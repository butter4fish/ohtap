Speaker 1: My name is Harriette Cole and I'll be interviewing you today.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey and observing is Julieanna Richardson.  I'd like for you to please say and spell your name.  Start there.
Speaker 2: Sure, I'm Debbye, D-E-B-B-Y-E, Turner, T-U-R-N-E-R, Bell, B-E-L-L.  No hyphen, just a space between Turner and Bell.
Speaker 1: Excellent and can you tell me the date and where we are?
Speaker 2: This is August 12th [2014], Tuesday, we are at Arise News [New York, New York], a global cable network where I am an anchor for our evening news.
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Story_ID: 136357
Speaker 1: So I want to start with some People magazine-type questions.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have many favorite foods, which is part of my lifelong battle. (Laughter) probably the all-time favorite that I can eat anytime would be pepperoni pizza.  I love it cold; I love it breakfast, lunch and dinner.  But also, I love the traditional Thanksgiving meal, turkey and dressing, greens, macaroni and cheese, sweet potatoes all of that.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of year is fall.  I love as the season turns from summer because I'm not a particularly a fan of the heat of summer.  So when the heat breaks, but it's still beautiful outside.  I love sweater weather, I love to put on a nice sweater and drink apple cider and make pots of soup or chili.  And I'm a big football fan; probably has a lot to do with why I love the fall so much.  But for me, fall brings anticipation, which sounds unusual because many associate anticipation with spring.  But I loved school.  And so I looked forward to fall and a new school year.  Fall meant a new year, new experiences, new friends.  New accomplishments were coming. And to this day, even as a working woman working year round, I still love the anticipation of fall.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color is red.  Pretty traditional in that regard.  Red is bold.  It's sassy and unapologetic.  And I'm sure that represents me in some, in some significant ways.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: My favorite vacation destination happens to also be my birthplace, Hawaii.  I have traveled around the world, not to every country, not to every continent, but of the places that I've been, the beauty and splendor of the Hawaiian Islands have not been matched anywhere that I've been.  And I'll tell you a quick story about the reason.  We took a helicopter trip to the big island, the island of Hawaii.  And it was in the summer.  Vegetation was very lush, it had been a nice rainy season and so there were water falls spilling over the mountains and I had just never seen that kind of natural beauty, and it was so beautiful it made me cry.  And my mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] spontaneously began to sing, 'How Great Thou Art.'  And we stood on a cliff, looking at the waterfalls, at the beautiful vegetation, seeing all these exotic birds singing that old hymn, 'How Great Thou Art.'  It was one of the most, I don't know, surreal experiences that I've ever had with nature.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was, I was Miss America.  Although I was born in Hawaii, we left when I was an infant, very young.  And I returned as Miss America.  Didn't take long for the State of Hawaii to find out that I was born there so they invited me to do a homecoming there since I was Hawaiian born.  And so I was, you know, twenty-four, twenty-three years old at the time.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite phrase or saying if you have one?
Speaker 2: Very easy, it's Philippians 4:13.  And it says, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."  I am a woman of faith, I believe with every cell in my body that there is a God, that he is an awesome and good God, and that if I trust him, that he will make all things work together for me for the good.  And so for that reason I've used that my entire life.  Every time I've faced adversity, every time I've faced uncertainty, I've used that scripture that Paul said to the church at Philippi, the Philippians, I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me and it's not just about accomplishment, because if you go back a few verses and read what leads into that, he says I have been abound and I have been abase.  I have been full and I have been hungry.  I've had a lot and I've suffered need.  But, I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.  So in other words, no matter what season in life I am in, no matter what I'm facing, whether it's good or bad, I can do it through Christ.
Story_ID: 136358
Speaker 1: I'd like to talk about your family. Let's start with your mom.  Can you tell me her name and where she's from?  Tell me about your mom.
Speaker 2: My mother is Gussie Lee Jones Turner.  And I have been fortunate enough to travel the world and meet a lot of incredible people.  She's deceased now, but she remains the most phenomenal person I've ever met.  She was a woman of faith.  She was a steel magnolia in that she was gracious, kind, generous.  I grew up lower middle class.  We had what we needed but not one inch more.  But even out of our own limited resources, she gave generously to those in the community.  I remember every holiday, when she cooked a big meal for us as a family, we fixed plates and we took them to the elderly in the community, those that didn't have family visiting them.  As a child she made my sister [Suzette Caldwell] and I go to some of our neighbors' houses, particularly the elderly who didn't have family.  And we'd clean their bathrooms; wash their dishes; mow their lawn.  Remember there was a lady across the street and we called her Peaches, I don't know what her name was.  And we would have to go cut Peaches' toenails because she was limited mobility and couldn't get to her feet.  So what I know and live by as it relates to community service and compassion, I learned from my mom.  She was an incredibly intelligent woman.  She was raised by her mother [Gussie Jones] and father [Robert Jones].  By a loving couple that, neither had much education, but they had enough sense to get her a good education.  She ultimately got her master's degree, had a very successful career, was a leader in our community, was a woman of faith.  She was an evangelist and a preacher.  Everything I know about God and faith, I learned, not just because she drug me to church, but we lived it at home.  But she was a strict disciplinarian.  My mother suffered no foolishness from her two girls, my older sister and I.  So while I knew she loved me fiercely, her standards for me were incredibly high.  So much so, she didn't just expect us to do well, she expected us to be the best.  So, if I made an A, she wanted to know why I didn't make an A-plus.  If I came in the top ten, she wanted to know why I wasn't first.  Even growing up, I was rewarded for academic achievement.  I got four dollars for every A I made and she took away two of those dollars for every B I made.  That's the kind of standard that Gussie Turner held for her girls.  And that was tough as a young girl, but it has served me very well later in life.  She was the kind of woman who never met a stranger.  I have myriad memories of running into the grocery store just to get perhaps milk, and being in there two hours because she would engage somebody in the dairy section in conversation.  And they would end up telling her their life stories and what was wrong with them and what bothered them.  And she would stop, put down all her stuff, counsel them.  She was a counselor by trade, and pray for them.  So I spent much of my childhood waiting on my mother (laughter) as she encouraged, administered to, prayed for, the masses.  And she was never too busy for anyone.  I never heard her turn anyone away who reached out.  People would call in the middle of the night and distress about something and she would never pretend or act as if she was too tired.  She would wake up out of a dead sleep and listen to someone's problems.  She was just a phenomenal woman.  I aspire to be a measure of the woman that I saw that she was.
Story_ID: 136359
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] was born in Hayti, Missouri, small little country town in the boot hill of Missouri, to Gertrude Stanley, her biological mother.  My grandmother Gertrude went on to have eight other children.   My mom has nine siblings; however, for--some circumstances I know, and some that I don't--my mother's aunt, grandmother Gertrude's sister, ended up raising my mom as an only child.  And so the woman that I call grandmother is actually my great aunt, Gussie Jones.  She and her husband, Bob Jones, Robert Jones, raised my mom.  And she grew up in Kennett, Missouri, another small town in the boot hill of Missouri.
Speaker 1: You said she had eight siblings, did she know them even though she didn't live with them.?
Speaker 2: (Nodding) absolutely, knew them, growing up.  Excuse me one second, my nose is running.  Yes, she did know them, Kennett is thirty miles from Hayti.  So all her life, she saw them, not just on holidays, but on a regular basis.  What I understand is that my grandmother had my mother.  Gertrude had Gussie when she was very young.  And something happened between my grandmother, Gertrude and my mother's father who my mother never knew.  And Gertrude fell upon hard times and was not able to care sufficiently for my mom.  And her sister, Gussie, came to visit one day.  And my grandmother Gussie tells this story.  It was cold and I don't know if there was electricity in the house, but there was no heat.  And Gussie Jones said that my mom, her diaper, was frozen to the floor.  And so Gussie Jones said to her sister Gertrude, "Let me take this baby, Bob and I will take care of her until you get on her feet--on your feet."  And so Grandmother Gussie did that and never gave her back.  Eventually, she and Bob Jones adopted her and raised her as their own.
Speaker 1: Did she know that the other children were her siblings?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  The siblings knew about my mom, and my mom knew about the siblings.  They grew up as siblings but just not in the same--just not in the same household.  And the truth be told, and I'm still--of the nine children, six are living and I'm, you know, still in touch with--in relationship with my mom's living siblings, most of them.  But it did create an interesting family dynamic because my grandmother Gertrude remained poor in that small little town, raising eight children.  And so there was an interesting family dynamic even when I was growing up about how those eight siblings had to scrape by together in a three-room house related to my mother who was being raised in a slightly higher socio-economic status as an only child.  And that created some tension and some resentment that I think they mostly resolved in adulthood.  But, yeah you know, families can be messy sometimes and that was a bit of a messy situation.
Story_ID: 136360
Speaker 1: Did Gertrude [Stanley] ever marry?
Speaker 2: She did marry. She married another man.  It's so interesting.  I don't know why and my grandmother Gertrude went to her grave without telling my mom [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] who her father was.  And much of my childhood and when we would go back to Hayti, Missouri, my mother would search for clues.  She would question my grandmother Gertrude.  "Who was my dad?  Tell me his name."  And she wouldn't.  So there was some trauma there that she would not talk about.  And I remember my mother even asking other friends in the community.  "Can you tell me something about my father?"  She finally was able to obtain a name, but was never able actually to find him or any of his family.  So that was perplexing for me as a child.  And I know that had to be devastating for my mom.  She wanted to know who her father was, and she never did.
Story_ID: 136361
Speaker 1: What did Gertrude [Stanley] do?  What was her work?
Speaker 2: That's a great question, [HM] Harriette [Cole].  I can't say that I actually know.  I can tell you what my great-aunt that raised my mom [Gussie Lee Jones Turner], Gussie Jones.  She was a domestic.  Gertrude and Gussie and their three other siblings were children of sharecroppers who were children of slaves.  So slavery is just three generations preceding me.  And at that time my grandmother, Gussie that raised my mom, quit school after I believe the eighth grade.  She was the oldest child because she had to work and help provide finances and income for the family and help raise her four younger siblings.  And so all she really was qualified to do was be a domestic and she was that all her life.  She retired at sixty-five as a domestic.  I remember as a little girl when I would go visit my grandmother in the summer in Kennett, Missouri.  If she was not off she would take me with her to the house that she took care of.  The family of course a white family.  A Caucasian family.  Ms. Donaldson [ph.].  She'd take me to Ms. Donaldson's house and put me on the back porch.  And give me something to do while she went and cleaned this big house and prepared meals for this family.  And she did that until the day she retired.
Speaker 1: Did you learn how to clean as a result of her?  Did you gain any of those skills from your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Here--this is what I love to say.  Particular I believe this is true of so many African American families and poor families.  It was great pride in my family.  And cleanliness was indeed next to Godliness.  So I can remember from my mother, being tested to see whether or not I was strong enough to push the vacuum cleaner.  And she made it a game.  And I was I don't know, four or five.  And I thought it was big fun.  And I can remember practicing and working trying to push that vacuum cleaner.  Little did I know that I was just being auditioned to take that on as a chore.  You know and the minute that I could push the vacuum and control it, then that became my job, vacuuming the carpet.  But yes, keeping clean house was considered a virtue.  I marveled at my grandmother that she cleaned these big houses of the white folk in Kennett, Missouri, but her house was spotless too.  You know, she would come home after a twelve or thirteen, fourteen, fifteen hour day and cook in her own house, clean her own house.  And she converted her entire yard, which was a sizeable one.  There was not one blade of grass in that yard.  The whole yard was a garden and an orchard and flowers.  She loved--she was a horticulturalist really.  She loved to grow stuff.  Every vegetable she cooked in her kitchen, she grew in her yard.  She had a peach tree, an apple tree and grew figs and grapes, all kinds of things.  Her work ethic was phenomenal.  I never saw her sit down.  She laid down at night to sleep, and then she got up, did it all over again.
Story_ID: 136362
Speaker 1: You said that you can trace your family back to slavery.  Can you describe your family back--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --there?
Speaker 2: I--I'll start with the Turners, my father's side.  The generation that I know my--is my great-great-grandparents.  And they are--I have to stop and think about this now.  Can I cheat? (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Tell me your father's name?  Yes you can cheat but tell me your father's name?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Frederick C. Turner, Jr., son of Frederick C. Turner, Sr.  My father is one of two siblings.  Freddye Sue and Frederick.  And his father is one of seventeen siblings.  Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: From where?
Speaker 2: Texas.  Texas.  And let me take a quick peek.  Can I?
Speaker 1: Sure.  Sure.
Speaker 2: All right.  Yes, so my great--make sure I have it right here.  My great-great-grandparents were Frank and Caldonia Bell [ph.].  Both of them slaves in South Texas.  Brazos County I believe, Texas.  They gave birth to I believe thirteen children.  One of which was Lyla Bell [ph.] who married Kerry Turner [ph.].  And we called them Mama Lyla and Papa Kerry.  I don't remember Papa Kerry, but I do remember Mama Lyla.  And they gave birth to seventeen children, one of which is my grandfather, Fred Turner, Sr.  And of course he gave birth to two children, Fred Turner, Jr. my father, and my aunt Freddye Sue Turner Davey.
Story_ID: 136363
Speaker 1: I want to go back--would you like to hear about my great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Mama Lyla [Lyla Bell (ph.)] was a strong independent woman.  I believe when they married they lived in Brazos County [Texas].  They were sharecroppers on a rented farm.  A flood came through, I don't remember the year, but the story goes that as they fled the house trying to grab what they could to escape the water.   Papa Kerry [Kerry Turner ph.] ran ahead--got ahead of Mama Lyla and by this time they had three or four children and Mama Lyla called and said, "Kerry, come back and help me with some of these children."  And Papa Kerry yells over his shoulders, "Don't worry about the kids, you just come on.  We'll have more kids." (Laughter) so I choose to interpret this story in the great love that he had for his wife. (Laughter) they saved the children and then of course had nine more.  And after the flood they lost everything in Brazos County and then they moved to Caldwell, Texas--again a small town Southern Texas, south of Houston [Texas]--where they first rented a farm.  And eventually Papa Kerry was able to purchase land of his own.  And they lived off that land.  And some of his children even inherited that farm.  And again farmed--I went there as a child growing up.
Story_ID: 136364
Speaker 1: And I can remember one of his sons, Uncle Lawson [ph.], who ran the family farm.  And they grew amongst other things, I'm sure it was many other things, but I remember cantaloupe, because Uncle Lawson called those mushmelons and watermelon.  And when all the kids would come in the summer, he would pack us in the back of the truck, drive us out in the field to help harvest the melons.  I grew up in Arkansas, so I knew heat and humidity, but there is nothing like the heat of South Texas in the middle of the summer.  And then being out in the middle of a field, you know, harvesting melons.  So I didn't particularly enjoy that, but one of the things we did to have fun was we would break a watermelon.  And the sweetest part of the watermelon is the heart of it.  And so we would break a watermelon and eat the heart out, which would make Uncle Lawson so mad because that's taking money out of his pocket.  But I remember spending those dusty hot summers on the Turner Farm harvesting watermelons with my cousins.
Story_ID: 136365
Speaker 1: Do you know how your--is it great-great-grandparents became free?
Speaker 2: I do not know that story.  I do not know the story.  I can only surmise that they learned of their freedom because they lived around the time of the Emancipation Proclamation [1863].  So I can only surmise that they gained their freedom through the Emancipation Proclamation.  And perhaps heard about it with the historic story of Juneteenth [June 19th], you know, years after Abe [Abraham Lincoln] Lincoln signed it.
Speaker 1: Tell that story?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Can you tell the Juneteenth story?
Speaker 2: The Juneteenth story?  What I know of the Juneteenth story.  Of course Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation at the end of the Civil War, 1865 [sic, 1963] I believe was the year.  And of course this was very controversial, particularly below the Mason-Dixon Line in the South.  So interesting and the slaves, many of them at that time it was the only life they knew.  And were resistant to the idea of being set free.  And of course plantation owners were very resistant because they were losing free labor and in their minds, losing their own property.  And so there was not a great effort to disseminate the message that the slaves had been set free.  The story goes, there were a group of slaves, I believe around a tree.  I don't know where, but it was at least a year or more after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed that they heard about their freedom.  And it was in June, probably in the teen. June 15th, June 19th I believe.  And so that day now is called Juneteenth, the day that many slaves learned of their freedom.  And I would assume that that's how my great-great-grandparents became free.
Story_ID: 136366
Speaker 1: The land that your Uncle Lawson [ph.] had owned, is that still in the family?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do believe it is still in the family.  Nobody works it as a farm anymore but yes it is still in the family.  And it's only been in the last--the last of my grandfather's siblings [Frederick Turner, Sr.] passed away just within the last five years.  So someone, you know, lived there from their childhood until very recently.
Story_ID: 136367
Speaker 1: So your dad [Frederick C. Turner, Jr.], can you tell me more about him, where he grew up, his--what he did?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Frederick C. Turner, Junior Jr., my father is still to this day at the ripe old age of seventy-seven a very handsome, dashing man.  Especially so when he was young.  He was very charismatic, outgoing, very personable.  And he has a very interesting place in history along with my mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner], but my father [Frederick C. Turner, Jr.] was one of three African Americans who were the first to attend Arkansas State University [Jonesboro, Arkansas].  So my father helped integrate the student population at ASU back in the '50s [1950s]; however, he was raised by his mother Ercerene Lee Turner.  Very fair skinned, probably ethnically, racially mixed woman.  But just raised to be himself.  So he was aware of the struggles of black people, but never saddled by them.  And he was never taught that he was inferior to anyone so he never thought that he was.  He tells the story that he had an idealic childhood.  While segregation was all around him, it didn't seem to stop him.  And that served him well when he went into the [U.S.] Military.  Went to ASU, graduated.  He and one other of those three other African American men actually graduated.  Walter B. Strong.  Now there is a black alumni association named after the two of them.  The Strong-Turner Alumni Association at Arkansas State University.  But he finished there and went into the [U.S.] Army.  Traveled the world as an infantryman in the Army; served two tours in Vietnam; rose in the ranks to Lieutenant Colonel.  Ultimately became an instructor at The Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  It was a very prestigious career move, and then retired from there many years ago, probably twenty-five years ago or so.  He was young, because he went into the Army young so he started a second career in Texas.  He moved to Austin, Texas, worked for the Texas Employment Commission there for twenty years, retired from that.  And then moved to Newport News, Virginia, where he became the head of human resources at Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia].  And he worked at that for maybe five years perhaps, not quite, but decided it was too much work for retirement, (laughter) so he finally retired for good.  And now he still lives in the Hampton-Rhodes area and lives to golf (laughter).
Story_ID: 136368
Speaker 1: How did he [Turner's father, Frederick C. Turner, Jr.] and your mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] meet?
Speaker 2: My mom who grew up in Kennett, Missouri which is about an hour from Jonesboro [Arkansas] which is where my father grew up, was born and raised, would come to Jonesboro to visit her aunt.  On those trips, as young kids do, they would, you know, hang out on the street, or go to the park.  As I remember, there was a party, a house party.  And my mom attended that house party, and she saw this tall, handsome, you know, outgoing man.  And my mother was tall as well, and beautiful, and they noticed one another.  And they became friends.  And as I understand it, they would only see each other in the summer when she would come to Jonesboro to visit.  But as she got older, they began to date.  And then they married when she was twenty; he was twenty-two, in 1960.  So it was one of those, you know, both in the same place at the right time.
Story_ID: 136369
Speaker 1: So your parents [Frederick C. Turner and Gussie Lee Jones Turner] married in what year?
Speaker 2: 1960.
Speaker 1: 1960.  And he was obviously still in the [U.S.] Military so tell me about their journey.
Speaker 2: Yes, he definitely was in the military and of course military people, mostly men in those days, traveled every year or two.  So they soon after their marriage, moved to Fort Ord, California, which is where my sister [Suzette Caldwell] was born in 1961.  And it's difficult for me to track, but I was born in 1965 in Honolulu, Hawaii, at Tripler Hospital [Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, Hawaii] there.  And I lived six different places the first five years of my life because during that time, he served two tours of duty in Vietnam.  So in addition to his military assignments, each time he would go to Vietnam, my mom, my sister and I would move back to Kennett, Missouri, her home town where my grandmother [Gussie Jones] was.  And we would stay in Kennett until he came back from his tour; join him wherever he was assigned.  So the final place was Jonesboro, Arkansas where he was recruited to come back and be on staff at ASU [Arkansas State University, Jonesboro,, Arkansas].  So I mentioned earlier how he had an interesting role in history in terms of integration in our society.  Not only was he one of the first African American students to attend Arkansas State University, he came back several years later to be the first African American on staff at ASU.  And he taught--
Speaker 1: (Coughing) sorry.
Speaker 2: No problem.  He taught in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] department at ASU for a few years.  The [U.S.] Army allowed him to do that as an assignment.  And then eventually, he was assigned to go somewhere else.  By that time my mother and father were separated and when he had his next military assignment, he went and we remained in Jonesboro, which was where I grew up.
Story_ID: 136370
Speaker 1: Did you--when he [Bell's father Frederick C. Turner, Jr.] was in Vietnam, do you remember that time?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I do remember--I have one memory of when he was away, and that is at Christmastime.  My sister [Suzette Caldwell] and I went to Washington, D.C., which was where his sister lived, Freddye Sue Turner Davey.  And we stayed with my Aunt Sue as we called her, and her children, while my mom [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] flew to Hong Kong because daddy [Frederick C. Turner, Jr.] had some leave time.  And he met her in Hong Kong, and they spent some time together in Hong Kong over the Christmas holiday while we stayed behind in Washington, D.C. so I have that vague memory.  And what I remember about that visit with my Aunt Sue is, my Aunt Sue is very much like her mother, my dad and Aunt Sue's mother, in that she was loving and nurturing but very strict and stern.  So I worked very hard not to disobey her, not to defy her because I was afraid of her wrath.  My sister have such inhibitions, and she did something, she disobeyed something.  I don't remember what the infraction was but my aunt got very angry.  And so I then tried to intervene on behalf of my sister, and my aunt told me to stay out of it, you know.  And I was like, "Don't hurt my sister."  So, now then my aunt gets mad at me, and she's going to spank me.  Now my sister and I fought like cats and dogs growing up.  We tried to kill each other really.  But, we would kill you if you bothered the other.  She was fiercely protective of me.  And so when my aunt then threatened to spank me, my sister stood up to her.  "Don't you touch my sister."  I'll never forget this, this was, you know--I maybe was, I don't know four years old I was very young, which made my sister eight or nine.  And here's this little eight-year-old standing up to a grown woman to protect me.  And I somehow don't remember getting the spanking.  I think she actually--she actually talked my aunt in off the ledge.  But that's my one memory of--while my father was serving in Vietnam.
Story_ID: 136371
Speaker 1: Very interesting [HM] Harriette [Cole], you didn't ask me this but it's only been in the last twenty years that my father [Frederick C. Turner, Jr.] has began to talk to me about his experience in Vietnam.  But as a young child and teenager, he wouldn't talk about it at all of which I think was common for many Vietnam War vets.  But as he's gotten older, he's told me a few stories.
Speaker 2: Did your--did you share any of this?
Speaker 1: I remember he talked about being I don't know where he was in Vietnam, but he was assigned to a watch and he was given a break and he had gone to take a nap and had taken his shoes off.  And he told me, I believe the instruction was they were never supposed to take their shoes off, because if there was a surprise attack they, you know, needed--they didn't have the time to get dressed completely, so they needed to be able to hit the ground running.  And he decided he was so tired, and his feet hurt, and Turners have long, kind of crazy feet, you know.  And so he took his shoes off, and sure enough, the air raid siren went off and there was an incoming attack from the Viet Cong.  And he talked about how he had to jump out of bed and run to this high watchtower, which was a part of his assignment to look out for where the plane was coming, but he didn't have time to put his shoes on.  And there was broken glass somehow along the way and he was telling me about how he had to just ignore the pain and run through the grass and the glass to get up into this tower so that he could get on this post to protect--to protect the unit.  And, you know, he talked about after it was over, they were able to defend off the attack, spending hours pulling glass out of his feet.  So that's a story I remember.
Speaker 2: Did he share any other Vietnam stories with you?
Speaker 1: That's--that's the main, that's the main one that I remember with any detail.
Story_ID: 136372
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Frederick C. Turner, Jr. and Gussie Lee Jones Turner] break up soon after Vietnam [War] with do you know--do you know what--
Speaker 2: Yeah it wasn't long after.  I mean they--they separated when I was four going on five.  So that would have been '69 [1969], '70 [1970].  So, yeah, toward the--toward the end of the war although he was back in the U.S. by then, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense that it could--like I don't even think they called it PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] back then but.  Do you have any sense of what precipitated the break-up?
Speaker 2: It was not the war I don't think.  You know, interestingly, and again, I credit my mom and my dad, we were never placed in the middle of the dissolution of their relationship.  You know, my mother always was an advocate for my dad.  "His birthday is coming up, have you gotten him a card?  You haven't called your dad, you need to call your dad."  He came when he was on leave from the [U.S.] Military; he came to visit us.  He made it to the big events that he could at that time.  So I always had a healthy relationship with my dad.  And my mother ever withheld that from us, nor begrudged that of us.  And I really appreciate that now seeing how awful it can be for the children of divorced parents.  And they somehow remained friends and co-parents.  I can remember my dad would come to visit us and he would sit for hours laughing and talking with my mom in the living room.  And I'd be back in the den pouting because this was supposed to be my time (laughter). You know, and they were out there talking.  And I didn't realize then how extraordinary that was but I have an appreciation for it now.  In fact, just came back from family vacation with my sister [Suzette Caldwell], her family, and my father.  And just talking about old times my dad just said to me less than a week ago in passing.  He goes, "You have no idea how many phone calls that I got from your mom for us to talk about some issue that she was having, you know, with raising you girls.  Some problem, something that she needed to talk about."  I never knew my mom called my dad, but good for them.   Very, very mature for them.
Speaker 1: Did either of them remarry?
Speaker 2: My father remarried.  He married Irene; he was married to her for twenty years.  They eventually divorced some, at least ten years ago.  So he married a second time.  My mother never remarried.

Speaker 1: So I want to go back to your early years.  What is your earliest memory from growing up?
Speaker 2: One of the earliest is the story that I told you about my parents [Frederick C. Turner and Gussie Lee Jones Turner] meeting in Hong Kong.  And my sister [Suzette Caldwell] and I going to [Washington] D.C., that's probably one of my earlier memories.  Beyond that in terms of the continuum of my life, my memories start when I was four.  The reason I remember, we lived on college campus housing in Jonesboro Arkansas, just on the periphery of Arkansas State University.  And this housing was provided by ASU as my father taught there in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] department.  And we lived right next to this creek.  And I had begged my mom for a piece of jewelry for my birthday.  I begged her for two things.  I wanted a piece of jewelry.  I think it was a necklace.  And back in those days these big pinwheel suckers, lollipops were all the rage.  And I wanted one of those, you know, that had the pinwheel of colors.  And I begged her for that.  I got both for my fourth birthday.  And the reason I remember it is when my mother gave me this necklace, she said, don't play in it, because you'll lose it.  And I said, "Yes, Mommy, I won't."  And we loved to play in this little creek next to our house.  Well you know, I put that necklace on and I went right outside and played in the creek.  Stayed out all day, we were all over the place cause those were back in the days where you could literally run the town and be safe.  And I came home that night, and it wasn't until I was getting undressed to get in the tub that I realized the necklace was gone.  And I was crestfallen and also terrified because now my mother was going to find out that I had disobeyed her and I wore the necklace out to play.  She was merciful because she said, "Well, it's gone.  You're not going to get another one.  And that will be your punishment."  So I was grateful for that.  I remember about the sucker, remember that my sister four years older than me, we were quite the competitors.  She didn't like me at all.  And she asked for a lick of my sucker and I didn't want to let her have it.  I didn't want to give it to her.  And so she finally told on me.  "Debbye won't share her sucker."  And my mom, "Debbye, just let her have a little bit."  You know, "It's going to be okay, just give it to her."  And I gave the sucker reluctantly to my sister.  And do you know, that little heifer dropped my sucker and broke it in a thousand pieces?  I was mad for years (laughter) about my broken pinwheel sucker.  That's my earliest memory.
Story_ID: 136374
Speaker 1: What was family life like in your home?
Speaker 2: Family life was vibrant, and busy.  My mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] was by this time, by the time my memories kick in she's a single mom now.  And she was a working mother.  So she had to do it all.  She--first--first she went back to school because she quit the teachers college that she was in to marry my dad [Frederick C. Turner, Jr.] because that's what women did.  When she got divorced, now she became the head of the household.  She wanted more for us than her level of education could provide, so she went back, finished her degree at Arkansas State University [Jonesboro, Arkansas], got her master's started her career.  So she was a busy, working mother.  We were latchkey kids, and so a lot of responsibility was given to us.  I remember being expected to help my mom run the household in that we had chores to do.  We couldn't play until the chores were done.  When we came home from school, we were expected to do our chores, to start dinner, to get our homework done.  There was just always work to be done.  But it was a happy home, a lot of laughter.  And because of my mother's generosity and open spirit, there was always a lot of people in our house.  She'd tend to take in strays of all kinds, human and otherwise.  So there were always people, you know, over because they didn't have anywhere else to go, or because they wanted encouragement, or because they needed prayer. My mother was a psychologist and rehabilitation counselor.  And in her early career she worked at a mental health hospital.  And she would bring home, (indicating) the strays, the holidays, the patients that didn't have family, and didn't have anywhere to go.  And I remember in the days leading up to the holiday, when she was bringing some of these crazy folk into our house, her lecturing us about what to say, and what not to say to these people because of course she was counseling them.  She knew their issues.  So I can remember her--I don't--I didn't know them to be trigger words at the time, but I remember her saying, you know, "Don't say this word, don't ask this question," because she knew what these people's issues--I can remember her packing up the knives.  But yet she would bring these folk into our home so that they would have a place to be and a sense of family on the holidays.  So that was just a normal part of my childhood.  My mother was a woman of faith.  She started a Bible study in our home that became a ministry that still exists to this day, twenty years after her passing.  But it started off being called The Thursday Night Share Group.  And high school and college students would come over every Thursday night and she would teach a Bible study.  And my mother was a powerful and engaging teacher and speaker.  And people's lives would change.  They would come hear the word of God, believe it, and apply in their lives.  And she believed the Bible for what it said.  And so when the Bible says that you can ask God for anything, then he would do it.  She would do that.  So she would put a chair in the middle of the floor, and it was called the prayer chair.  So at the end of Bible study, if anybody had a prayer request, they could sit in the prayer chair.  Everybody around would gather around, they would usually touch, you know, reach out and touch them, and would pray for whatever that need was.  And I saw miracles happen in our living room during those Thursday night share groups.  So seeing the demonstration of the power of God was just very politically incorrect to say in this twenty-first century but I saw with my own eyes.  I saw people change, I saw people who couldn't hear, and we prayed and they could hear when the prayer was over.  And that was just a normal--I thought that was normal.  I was quite old before I realized that that didn't happen in every house.  Another enduring memory of my childhood was--my love of animals comes from my mom.  Again, she took in strays of all sorts.  So any abandoned, stray, half road kill, anything, we would take into the Turner family.  And so we had lots of cats, dogs, turtles, frogs, parakeets--which didn't go so well with the cats, so I quickly got over my parakeet phase--fish. We had it all, but it was just a lot of life in our household.
Story_ID: 136375
Speaker 1: Did you ever feel like you were competing for her [mother, Gussie Lee Jones Turner] attention because she was always bringing others into your home?
Speaker 2: Very perceptive question, absolutely. Especially when I was younger, you know, of course most girls---young girls want nothing more than the attention of their parent, and in my case, it was my mom.  And because she gave herself so freely to her career, to the community, to the ministry and the church, I often felt like there was not enough left for me.  And I was resentful of that at times, you know.  And I can remember faking illnesses just so she'd have to cancel something and with me.  But here's the thing, because my mother was a woman of faith and believed in the power of God, faking an illness didn't work because what she would do was she would slather some what was called anointing oil on me and pray for me and say, "You're healed.  Go out and play." (Laughter) so I, you know, faking illnesses didn't work that well and I, you know, set about to--so interesting you ask this question because now having looked back at my life with a bit of analysis, I realize that my own standard of excellence and achievement was born out of wanting my mom's attention, wanting her affirmation.  So I lived to get that A, to get that affirmation.  I lived to win that contest to please her, you know, I lived to be a leader or a pioneer in something, all in an effort to please my mom and to get her attention.  And that really remained until she died.  It was after her death as I dealt--processed the grief that I made the connection, and had to learn how to live for me and not for the affirmation of my mom.
Story_ID: 136376
Speaker 1: I want to go back to the neighborhood where you grew up and can you show it to me?  What sights, sounds and smells remind you of your neighborhood growing up?
Speaker 2: You know even in my old age, I remember our home address.  311 East Oak.  The corner--the one house from the corner of Oak Street and Cobb in Jonesboro, Arkansas.  Jonesboro when I was growing up was a town of about 20,000, maybe a few more.  So it was a small town, a segregated town, although we lived on the white (indicating) side of town.  So I lived in a predominantly white neighborhood; however, our neighbors on either side were also African American.  So the smell that takes me back to Oak Street every time is cut grass.  Every summer if I drive through--living in New York [City] you've got to go out in the suburbs, drive through a suburban community, and I smell cut grass it takes me right back to my childhood.  I just remember the sounds of Saturday mornings when everybody was out in their yard you know, cutting the grass; edging the yards; hedging the bushes.  So that takes me right back to childhood.  It very much was a village in terms of caring for the children.  My neighbor to the right Mrs. White, was the quintessential nosy neighbor, and she was my mother's [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] spy because my mother was a working mother.  So we couldn't really get away with anything even in my mom's absence because Mrs. White was always looking out one of her windows seeing what we were doing.  I'll tell you a quick story about that.  Again my sister [Suzette Caldwell] and I were, you know, foes growing up, archenemies and one summer we're home together and we're both older and I've gotten a little sassy and decided I wasn't as afraid of her as I had been when I was younger so I would stand up to her a little bit.  So we got in some argument about something, and somehow she tricked me into going outside and then she locked all the doors.  So in the middle of the heat in Jonesboro, Arkansas in the summer I am locked outside.  So I go from window to window, door-to-door, banging, you know, "Let me in Suzette, let me in."  And of course our neighbor, Mrs. White can hear this and at some point I just finally sit down on the front porch, on the steps, and just cry.  And then I run out of tears and I just sit there.  And sure enough, my mother drives up and I was just amazed.  And she unlocks the door, goes inside and spanks my sister, and tells us that if she ever has to come home to discipline us from her job, that it would be a whipping we would never forget.  And I was amazed that she even knew that we were having this problem.  So I found out years later, Mrs. White called my mother at work and said, "Mrs. Turner you'd better come home, Suzette's trying to kill Debbye." (Laughter) so my mom had to drive home and let me in the house.  But thank God for Mrs. White, I might still be out there if she hadn't called to rescue me.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: I probably was ten, something like that.  Yeah, ten years old.
Story_ID: 136377
Speaker 1: Did you ever get to be friends with your sister [Suzette Caldwell]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We became friends in adulthood.  And honestly, she is four years older than me and but far more mature than her age growing up.  And I was very happy go lucky.  The way I like to describe it is my sister was Angela Davis.  Carried the weight of the world around.  She was very much an activist, you know, wanted to change the world against racism and inequality, and I was Rodney King, "Can't we just all get along?"  You know I just was unencumbered by things.  And so, our personalities didn't mix.  And she was very smart, skipped a couple of grades and then graduated from high school a year early.  So we were never in school together, she was always too far ahead of me.  So the first time we were going through a season of life at the same time, was college.  For all of her exuberance in primary and secondary school, she became a little lost in college.  She was an engineering major but could never decide which discipline in engineering she wanted to pick.  So it took her seven years to finish college.  So I caught up to her in college.  And so it was in college that we finally had something in common and that was the beginning of our friendship.  I mean we still argued like sisters do, but we became friendly.  And then when my mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] died, that's really when we became friends.
Speaker 1: When was that?
Speaker 2: My mother died August of 1994.  It's twenty years this month.
Speaker 1: What caused her death?
Speaker 2: Cancer.  She died of cancer, but unexpectedly so.  It had been treated; we thought they had gotten it all.  She was having complications from the treatment; she had radiation.  What I learned later was very often where the cancer was in her body, the amount of radiation they had to give her that the radiation does as much damage to the healthy tissue as the cancerous tissue and it was the complications of the radiation that killed her.  But what I want to say about my sister and my relationship is all growing up we would--I mean we would argue fiercely and my mother would always say, "Stop fighting one another because one day you'll be all you have."  And I never believed it and I never understood that and then sure enough when my mother passed away I was twenty-nine.  All of a sudden, my sister was all I had and we patched things up and became friends.
Story_ID: 136378
Speaker 1: As a child, what kind of child would you describe yourself as?  You talked a little bit about the difference between you and your sister [Suzette Caldwell], but who was little Debbye?
Speaker 2: I was precocious little child, talker, I never stopped talking.  I always had something to say.  Nothing thrilled me more than to find out information and disseminate it.  Little did I know that that set me up for the career I ended up in that I didn't even know that I would end up in.  I love to tell the story I was a good student, always excelled academically, loved school, and I worked fast.  And so I would finish my assignment before most of my classmates and because I didn't have anything else to do I'd start talking which of course kept them from finishing, you know.  So I was always getting in trouble for talking and one of my elementary school grade card--report cards said in the comment section, "Debbye is a good student, but she talks too much."   And I later used that as a life lesson when I began to do motivational speaking particularly talking to young people about potential and who you are.  And I jokingly said, "This teacher just didn't recognize my potential because I talk for a living now." (Laughter) and it's a quite nice living too.  But I talked a lot, very curious, very curious.  I was the kind of kid that took apart my mother's [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] appliances to see what was on the inside, what made them work.  I was my mother's co-conspirator in taking in all these stray animals, loved animals.  Back in these days people really didn't spay and neuter particularly in that part of the country, so our cats continually were giving birth to kittens.  And I loved nothing more than to assist my cat in giving birth to her kittens.  She didn't need my help, but I was down there like Johnny Bench, you know, ready to catch one if it got away from her.  But I loved that; I loved animals.  My best friends were my pets growing up.  Very active, I was a very active kid, I was not a mischievous kid, I was the do-gooder, I was the one, "Yes, Mommy whatever you say, Mommy."  I was the pleaser in contrast to my sister who was the rebel which probably also why she didn't like me so much (laughter).
Story_ID: 136379
Speaker 1: Debbye your name has a curious spelling; do you know where that came from?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  My mother--Debbye is my nickname, I was born Debra but my mother spelled Debbye, D-E-B-B-Y-E in honor of my aunt, my paternal aunt, Freddye Sue, my dad's [Frederick C. Turner, Jr.] sister because she spelled Freddye, F-R-E-D-D-Y-E.  Now where the Y-E came from in her name I'm not sure, but my mom used the Y-E--it wasn't me, it was my mom, used the Y-E to honor her sister-in-law, they were very close.
Story_ID: 136380
Speaker 1: As a child, what did you dream you wanted to do with your life?
Speaker 2: My dream of becoming a veterinarian solidified fairly early in life; however, before that I wanted to be a teacher and I come from a family of educators.  My grandmother Turner was a high school French and economics teacher, she taught for thirty years in the Jonesboro [Arkansas] public school system.  My grandfather, Fred Turner, Sr. was a high school principal.  Both my dad [Frederick C. Turner, Jr.] and my mom [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] taught the higher education level.  His sister [Freddye Sue Turner Davey] went on to become a professor; she was the head of the honors college, which is now named in her honor at Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia].  So education runs throughout my family.  So I thought I wanted to be a teacher. And it tracked with where I was in school.  When I was in first grade, I wanted to be a first grade teacher, and when I was in second grade, I wanted to be a second grade teacher.  By third grade back in those days that's when science was introduced.  And once I was introduced to science, that was it, loved science, loved biology and learning how the body works.  Mainly I was interested in animals, but the human body fascinated me.  Not long after that, I think by the fifth grade or so I remember saying to my mom, "You know, I think what Dr. Jack Jones does is so cool."  And he was our family veterinarian because we had all these cats and dogs and whatnot we were at the veterinarian office frequently.  And I thought it was so cool that this man who could take an animal who couldn't talk to him, couldn't speak, couldn't tell him what hurt or where it hurt, but he'd be able to look and poke and prod and figure out what was wrong with it and then he would almost always have a solution that would solve the problem.  The animal would get better.  And I thought that was cool.  And so to my mother's credit, when I expressed this in admiration, she said well, "Why don't you ask if you can hang out at his clinic and just help?  See what it's like."  And so I did and from that point on, on the summers--summer breaks and holiday breaks I would go and volunteer at Dr. Jones' clinic, and it was there that I knew I wanted to be a veterinarian.  I love to tell the story, I didn't do anything significantly, all I did was, you know, clean out kennels and scoop up poop.  But I figured that that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  Not scoop up poop, but take care of animals.  And so that set me on my educational track of getting my Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine degree.
Story_ID: 136381
Speaker 1: So you said you had a lot of animals, cats and dogs in your house, so how many were there at any given time?
Speaker 2: Okay so I'm--I hesitate to say this out loud although I have admitted it publically before.  We had a lot of cats.   The highest number that I can remember was twenty-six cats at one time.  It's a lot and it defined my social circle because--well I'll just say it.  I don't like generalities but generally, there's a lot of black folk that don't like cats.  So I lost friends over our cats, there were some of my little friends would not come to our house because they were scared of cats, didn't like cats, didn't want cat hair on them, whatever the case might be. (Laughter)  so my friends were defined by who could tolerate all the cats (laughter).
Speaker 1: And now at the same time you said that you practiced tremendous cleanliness.  So how did you balance having all these animals and keeping your house clean?
Speaker 2: Well first of all not all of them were indoors.  Some of them probably, I'm gonna guess.  Uh oh.
Speaker 1: It's okay, keep going.
Speaker 2: I'm gonna to guess probably eight to ten of the cats actually lived in the house.  The others were what were called indoor, outdoor cats so you know, they liked to go out and roam the neighborhood and back in those days we thought that was okay.  But yes it was a lot of vacuuming, a lot of--this was before the take lint rollers which were a miracle-- but back--a lot of lint, you know, lint cleaning.  We had orange crushed velvet sofa; which was like Velcro for all that cat hair.  Yes so a lot of cleaning and my mom [Gussie Lee Turner Bell] was a clean woman.  She didn't like a dirty house; she didn't like a smelly house.  So a lot of, you know, scooping out that litter box, changing the litter box which seemed to always seem to fall on me, which is why I probably will never have that many cats ever again (laughter).
Story_ID: 136382
Speaker 1: Where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: Went to elementary and secondary school in Jonesboro [Arkansas].  I went to East School [Jonesboro, Arkansas] for elementary school, to [Douglas] Macarthur Middle School [Jonesboro, Arkansas], and then Jonesboro High School [Jonesboro, Arkansas]. Graduated from Jonesboro High in 1983.  And then I went to my mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] and father's [Frederick C. Turner, Jr.] alma mater for undergrad, Arkansas State University [Jonesboro, Arkansas] as a pre-vet student.  I finished my--I was a bit of an overachiever, I would take twenty, twenty-three hours a semester.  I would take classes on the breaks.  And I finished all my pre-vet requirements in three years and was accepted to veterinary school and then I went to veterinary school at the University of Missouri, Columbia [Missouri].
Speaker 1: In your elementary and secondary school and high school [in Jonesboro, Arkansas], were you in public school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Public school my entire education.
Speaker 1: So public school in Arkansas during that time, what was the racial makeup of your school?
Speaker 2: The racial makeup of the school that I went to was largely Caucasian because we lived on the (indicating) white side of town.  We lived in a in a white neighborhood and so the vast majority of their students were white.  I was always the minority in the class, one or one of a very few.  And that remained true really until high school [at Jonesboro High School, Jonesboro, Arkansas], but in the region and just in our country nationally, you know, African Americans now make up 10, 11 percent of the population.  It was, you know, 9 or 10 percent of the population back then, so we were always the minority.  But because of the classes that I took, I took advance classes and what were called honors classes.  In most cases I was almost always the only black kid in the class.  So it was interesting because it set up this interesting tension.  The little white kids who, you know, who knows what they were being taught, or told, or heard in their homes, regarded me sometimes hesitantly and sometimes with novelty, I was like a zoo exhibit.  And then the black kids didn't always accept me because I was always in class with the white kids.  And I was raised by two educated parents [Gussie Lee Jones Turner and Frederick C. Turner, Jr.] who required that we enunciate and speak in full sentences where the nouns and verbs match.  And back in those days that was called talking white.  And so I was often teased and maligned by a lot of the black kids because I talked proper and because I was in the white classes, and because I made good grades.  So that was a--that was tough for me growing up, you know, I probably didn't reconcile that and didn't figure out where that came from until I was well into college [at Arkansas State University, Jonesboro, Arkansas].  I spent a lot my childhood trying to gain the acceptance of my people, so I can remember if I was in class I spoke one way, and then on the playground where I wanted to play with the black kids, I would speak a different way in order to be accepted by them.
Story_ID: 136383
Speaker 1: Arkansas, and this would be '60s [1960s] early '70s [1970s], right?
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: It was quite racially divided?
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: Do you know how it ended up that you were living in a white neighborhood?
Speaker 2: It was--I know exactly how I ended up living in this neighborhood, but what you're getting to I don't know that I can answer.  I grew up in the same house that my father [Frederick C. Turner, Jr.] grew up in, so I ended up in this neighborhood, because the house stayed in our family, and when he was recruited by ASU [Arkansas State University, Jonesboro, Arkansas] to come back to Jonesboro [Arkansas], by this time, my grandmother [Ercerene Turner]--his mom--was deceased.  And he remodeled the house and moved us into it.  So that's how I grew up there.  Now how my grandparents ended up in this neighborhood, I don't know.  That I don't know.
Speaker 1: Do you remember experiencing racism?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I remember being called the N-word, and I like to always say when I--cause I don't believe--I don't believe in the use of the word.  I think it serves no purpose, but I think grown folk can be grown folks, you know, I was called nigger.  I remember hearing my father being called boy.  I've seen a cross burning in someone's front yard.  So absolutely, it was the segregated South even in the late '60s [1960s] early '70s [1970s].  My mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] was a civil rights activist.  In her teenage and young adult years, she protested to integrate the library and the lunch counters.  So she was arrested a few times during sit-ins.  And my father was an activist, but in a sort of a much more passive way; he didn't protest and he didn't rail, but you know, he just went to ASU as a little black kid and then came back as a black instructor, you know, so he blazed the trails in a different way.  And so, I was very aware of the segregation, very aware of the social tensions between black folk and white folk; however I was never constrained by them, you know, I was never taught that I was inferior to anybody.  I was never taught that my future was limited to anything because of the way I looked.  In fact, I was expected to excel and to do great things in spite of in that case.
Story_ID: 136384
Speaker 1: You were three when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated so that's very, very young.  Do you have any recollection of that moment?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Was it something that your parents talked about?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother [Gussie Lee Jones Tuner Turner]--you know, and most of my childhood memories are around my mom raising us since my dad [Frederick C. Tuner, Jr.] moved out when I was quite young at four.  But we had family dinnertime on a daily basis and we discussed life around us.  I can remember particularly as I got older, discussing politics, having just watched the evening news and then we'd have dinner and then we'd have to talk about what we saw on the news.  And if you remember in the '70s [1970s], there was a lot of protesting particularly going on--on college campuses.  It was a lot of protesting to apartheid; of course the segregation that remained in the community in which I lived and we talked about those things at the family dinner table.  I don't remember my mother--I don't remember my mother teaching me a lot of lessons about Dr. King as a human being.  What I do remember is her teaching me the lessons that he was teaching, of equality and being of high moral character and equal access and justice.  I remember the themes more than her talking about the individual.

Speaker 1: Thinking of just Arkansas a little bit more just--at that time shortly after-King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] been killed, there's a lot of movement happening in the country but slow to happen in the South.  You were going to a predominantly white school; who were your friends?  Did you have white and black friends?  What was your social life like?
Speaker 2: No I had white and black friends.  And I was encouraged by my mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] to talk to everybody, to play with everybody.  I could remember if my mother found out there was a disabled kid in the class, she would ask me about that.  "Do you ever sit by that child at lunch?  Do you ever talk to that child?"  I mean she was very intentional about teaching us to be open to everybody.  I can remember her in some ways making me have lunch with the outcast kids.  You know, she goes, "Find a kid that nobody sits with and you sit with them."  So I had a rainbow coalition of friends and I had to because of the neighborhood you know, my best little friends growing up were little white girls because they--that's who was living in the neighborhood.  My social interaction with the black kids in Jonesboro [Arkansas] came from church because of course and even to this day, you know, the most segregated day of the week is Sunday.  And the church that I grew up in, St. Paul A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal], of course, was an all-black church.  We were very involved in church and my mother grew up Pentecostal.   So we would go to St. Paul A.M.E. in the morning for 11 a.m. service and then in the evening, we would go to the "sanctified" church 'cross town in the evening.  So I love to say that I grew up spiritually bilingual. (Laughter) I can sing all the old hymns but I can also cut a shout (laughter).
Story_ID: 136386
Speaker 1: Growing up in between those two churches, what do you remember about being involved in church?
Speaker 2: The experiences in both of those environments were very different, and St. Paul A.M.E [African Methodist Episcopal]--and for those who know the history of the A.M.E. church, you know, founded by Richard Allen very strong emphasis by the original founders called the five horseman of the church on education.  So, you know, A.M.E. members are--were usually the members of the community that had some level of higher education that pursued education and careers.  So I remember the older people in the congregation being people that carried themselves with pride and dignity and I remember people like Ms. Watson [ph.] who was one of the ushers of the church--excuse me, Ms. Pitman [ph.] and requiring the kids to sit up straight.  And she would always come through with her fan and hold it under our mouth so we had to spit out our gum.  You know, so there was this--there was in addition to teaching us the things of God in the Bible, there was a strong effort to teach us to be good citizens, human beings, I can remember in church being taught how to behave in public, how to look someone in the eye when you speak to them, how to shake someone's hand firmly and those kinds of things.  So there was as much a socialization and etiquette lesson going on in church as there was Bible study at St. Paul A.M.E.  Now at Carter Temple the sanctified church, you know, it was all fire and brimstone, you know, the pastor, the preacher, whoever it was would get up and preach some fiery, very animated sermon on, usually it was some scripture about why we were going to hell if we didn't do something. (Laughter) and then somebody would catch the spirit and there would go the old organ and there would go the drums and then, you know, all the little old ladies would begin to dance and shout and there was no greater entertainment to me than to sit on the back row and to watch these people shout and jump and roll up and down the aisles of the church.  We just thought that was the funniest thing in the world, until I got caught by my mom [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] and then had to go sit next to her. (laughter)
Speaker 1: Did you ever get the spirit like that?
Speaker 2: No, not growing up.  Not growing up.  I didn't understand it, didn't seem necessary to me, you know, as a little kid it just seemed weird, you know.  I'm not sure about a God that will make you, you know, flop around like a fish.  With great--with more understanding, I had greater acceptance but as a child, no, never.
Story_ID: 136387
Speaker 1: I read that you were quite young when you consciously chose to be Christian as opposed to just going to church as your mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] went to church.  What happened?
Speaker 2: Yes I was raised, again, by a Bible teacher and an evangelist and so I was raised in a staunch Christian home.  And the way I like to say it, it wasn't just a Christian home, because that can be a cliche.  It was a Bible-believing, God-fearing, Holy Ghost-filled home.  And there was a requirement of not just going to church, but getting to know the God that is the reason to go to church.  And so at seven years old, maybe slightly younger, I would just remember, when I started first grade, every day, my mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] would stand at our side door, which looked up Cobb Street toward East School [East Elementary school, Jonesboro, Arkansas] which was just two blocks up the street, and she would watch me walk home.  And every day when I got home, she would ask, "Can you read yet?"  And I, you know, at the beginning, "No, Mommy but I know my A, B, Cs," you know, "No, Mommy but I know my pronunciations."  And then over a period of time after I read my first sentence and it was probably, "See Spot run.  Run spot run." I came home. I ran all the way down the hill knowing that she'd be at the side door. "Mommy I can read.  Mommy I can read."  And I got to the door and I told her, "I can read, Mommy.  I can read."  And I remember she gave me a big hug, she said, "I'm so happy, congratulations."  She said, "Now come sit down with me."  And she had laid out on the kitchen table a Bible.  And she pointed at it and she said, "This is the recipe for life."  And she says, "Read it every day of your life for the rest of your life.  All your answers will be found there."  And then she went on to tell me what I now know is the story of salvation; the story of Jesus coming to cleanse me of my sin and save me.  And she asked me if I was ready to accept Jesus as my Lord and Savior and I told her, "Yes," you know.  So she prayed a prayer of salvation with me and so I got what is known as "got saved" sitting at the kitchen table with my mother when I was seven years old.  And I did exactly what she told me to do, the Bible was open to the twenty-third Psalm and my dumb little seven-year-old self, when she said read this every day, I thought she meant specifically the twenty-third Psalms.  So for like five years, I read the twenty-third Psalms very day before I figured out she meant the whole book.  But yeah, happened at seven.
Story_ID: 136388
Speaker 1: How did pageants come into the life of this young girl in Arkansas, great student involved in the church?  How do pageants fit in?
Speaker 2: Pageants was antithetical to the life I was living, you know, the sanctified church [Carter Temple Church, Jonesboro, Arkansas] certainly wasn't happy about pageants because you had to wear a swimsuit.  You know, the intellectual, academic part of me, you know, went counter to what pageants would seem to represent, so here's the story.  I was in a high school pageant called The Jonesboro High School Sweetheart Pageant [Jonesboro, Arkansas] and it wasn't so much a pageant as a fundraiser for the service organizations in the school.  So each service organization was supposed to enter a representative to compete.  I was in the Future Business Leaders of America, F.B.L.A.  And I became the F.B.L.A. representative in the sweetheart pageant and it wasn't because I wanted to be in the pageant, but no other girl in the organization would do it.  And I wasn't shy and I was like, "I'll do it," you know, because back in those days, the whole country stopped and watched the Miss America Pageant, you know, so I had seen it, you know, we watched as a family every year.  And I was like, you know, I'll mimic what I've seen on T.V I'll do it, don't worry.  And I did just exactly that, I did what I had seen the girls on T.V. do and I was like, "My name is Debbye Turner, when I grow up I want to be a veterinarian." (waving) You know, the whole thing and doggone it I won the thing.  One of the judges was a director in the Miss America system.  She directed the local pageant, Miss Jonesboro.  And she came up to me and told me who she was, said that she was in the Miss America system and she says, "I think you would do very well, why don't you be in my pageant?"  I was not interested, by this time I knew for sure I wanted to be a veterinarian, very involved in the band, I was a percussionist and, you know, doing all the band stuff, music stuff, so it just wasn't an interest.  So I said, "Thank you so much, I'm really honored, I don't think so."  And so then she said, "Well, in the pageant, you can develop positive self-esteem and goal setting, great self-image."  And in my mind, I had those things and I was like, "Well that sounds wonderful, I don't think it's for me."  And finally in her full court press she said, "Miss America program is the largest source of scholarships for women in the world, if you make it to the Miss America Pageant, you can win tens of thousands of dollars in scholarship money."  Well bells went off in my head, I used to like to say my ponytail stood up, because, growing up in a lower middle class home, I knew my family could not afford the education I wanted.  I knew I was gonna have to get scholarships, I knew I was gonna have to work.  And all of a sudden, I was just presented with a means to an end, and I said, "I'll do it; where do I sign up?"  Because it was solely for the scholarship money, I had no aspiration to be Miss America at that time, no Miss Americas looked like me so I didn't necessarily think it was something for me anyway but I just thought well you know if I win a talent award here, a Miss Congeniality there, I'll you know, amass some money to help pay for my education.  And I entered the Miss Jonesboro pageant and I won.  And I no I take that back, the entering of the first time I did not win.  But I placed and that gave me a little bit of the taste of winning and remember I was growing up in a household that if I came in second place which could be considered admirable, my mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] would want to know why I didn't come in first.  So by that time I had the standard for myself.  And so not winning was enough of a challenge to do it again because I wanted to win.  And to make the long story short, it took seven years, eleven tries, in two different states for me to win a state pageant.  I finally won Miss Missouri after three failed attempts at the Miss Arkansas title and it's the Miss Missouri pageant that took me to Miss America.
Story_ID: 136389
Speaker 1: So the journey of being in these pageants as a smart young women who didn't necessarily buy into the pageantry of it, what was your journey?  How did you experience going from contest to contest?
Speaker 2: What you first have to understand is not only was I in a pageant, The Miss America System, I was in the Miss America System in the South.  And pageants to this day are a big, you know, bouffant business.  And there were girls who were born, bred, and burped to be Miss Somebody, so I entered the system with, you know, no preconceived notions of a it would be like and no investment really in whether or not it affected my life.  It was just something fun to do, win some scholarship money.  And I entered with these girls who had been raised for this.  And so first it served as a challenge because now in some ways, I'm in a foreign land.  So now, I've got to learn a new language and a new way of being.  You know, I didn't wear makeup, I barely wore dresses and I wasn't really a tom girl, just wasn't bothered with those things.  So it was a challenge for me just to sort of figure out the game and to beat the others who had been playing it for a long time.  So at first that's sort of what it was, it was just a game to me.  And it took I believe three tries for me to win a local.  I went to the Miss Arkansas pageant for the first time, again, this is a big hairy deal.  And most girls on their first time don't do anything.  I made the top ten and that got people's attention.  And I remember one of the pageant people saying, "You really have potential.  If you would actually apply yourself, you could do very well."  So that was the first time it ever entered my mind that maybe I could excel at this, maybe I could be Miss America.  So I set about to win another local to take me back to Miss Arkansas.  It took a couple tries, went back to Miss Arkansas the second time and I got first runner-up, which again, big deal for a second try.  And then I was told, if you can just win a state pageant, you will be Miss America.  And that was when I set as my sight to be Miss America, it was no longer just about the scholarship.  I'd learned more about the system; who this organization is; who Miss America is, what she does.  I was like, oh that would be kind of cool.
Story_ID: 136390
Speaker 1: So I entered another local, won that.  Went back to the Miss Arkansas pageant a third time.  Now, this time I'm the returning first runner-up from the previous year.  There had been a long history at the Miss Arkansas pageant that if the first runner-up from the previous year returned, she won.  It had happened five out of the last seven years.  So when I went back this time, I wasn't the new girl, I wasn't the underdog, I was the odds-on favorite.  I got all the media attention that week, I won my swimsuit competition which was huge because I had the same hips back then that I have now.  And so that was great, I won the talent, that wasn't such a big deal because I usually won talent every time I was in a pageant; made the top ten.  Now I want to also pause in the story and tell you that my faith was an active partner in this pursuit so by this time, I had said God, I want to win, help me win.  My mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] would pray for me before the pageant and she'd pray this nice little prayer.  "Lord just touch Debbye to do her very best, let her just be a reflection of the love and light of Jesus, let her be an inspiration to these other girls and father your will be done."  Now she had raised me to believe that the Bible was true, and the Bible says you could ask God what you wanted so while she was praying this nice little prayer, in my mind I'm thinking, "Let me win God.  I want to win."  So by this time you know, I have you know, tasted a little bit of glory and I want more.  So I'll never forget that night, I was standing on the stage, made top ten and I had made top five.  So now it was time to call the places and they start with fourth runner-up and I had developed a system by then and so as the M.C. [master of ceremonies] was doing the preamble to the announcement, I would say a prayer.  And so he said, "And your fourth runner-up is" and I was, saying, "God, don't let it be me."  And they called another name; I was like "Phew, thank you Jesus."  And then he said, "And the third runner-up is" and again I prayed under my breath, "God don't let it be me."  And he called another name; "I was like phew, thank you Jesus."  Then it occurred to me, by this time I was in botany in college and botany you learned about probabilities and odds and I realized the more names they called that were not mine the fewer chances I had of being called at all.  So by the time they got to second runner-up, I changed my prayer and I said, "God your will be done," and they called a different name and I was like, "Oh thank you Jesus."  Now they're at the first runner-up.  I had been first runner-up the year before and I hadn't been first runner-up at a couple of local pageants so they got to it and I really didn't want to be first runner-up, I really wanted to win, but I also trusted God and so he went through that whole long, in the event that the winner cannot complete her duties, the first runner-up position is very important and during all of that, I said, "God, I just want your will; your will be done; your will be done."  And he said, "And the first runner-up is," and then there was that dramatic pause, "Miss Northeast Arkansas, Debbye Turner."  And you heard the audience gasp because everybody thought I was gonna win.  Probably except for the family of the girl who actually won.  And I maintained my composure, I put on that pageant smile, back in those days they'd give you a silver tray, I called it the silver chip tray and they handed me that tray and I thanked the judges and I waved at the audience.  And I--and of course they'd hustle you out of the way because the winner is about to be called.  And I stood over there on the side baffled.  I didn't understand what happened.  Well, after the pageant was over back in those days, they would allow the friends and family to come up on stage and my family came up and you would have thought they were coming to view the dead.  I mean long faces, tears in their eye, my sister [Suzette Caldwell] the activist mad.  "These racist people, they won't let your brown skin be Miss Arkansas.  You don't need this; you're better than this."  You know, my dad [Frederick C. Turner, Jr.] says to me, "You're our Miss America."  And I wanted to slap his little brown head; they didn't give me any scholarship.  And my mother came up, she was the last person, she smiled at me and she hugged me and she whispered in my ear, "I'm so happy for you.  You did a great job.  Remember there's always Missouri."  Because by this time, I'm a junior in veterinary school at the University of Missouri [College of Veterinary Medicine, Columbia, Missouri].  And being a student in that state made me eligible for that pageant system, but I always wanted to be Miss Arkansas, my home state.  And I, you know.  At that point, I just needed to process the loss; it was like a death.  But after a few weeks, more prayer counsel, I decided I'll try this one more time.  And so, in my senior year of veterinary school I competed in the Miss Missouri local system, won Miss Columbia, went on to Miss Missouri, won Miss Missouri, and went on to Miss America.
Story_ID: 136391
Speaker 1: What year was the--that second Miss Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Oh, okay I have to count backwards.  It would have been 1987, the second Miss Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay so you were in--I'm interested in you running for the pageant, your being involved in the pageant and at this point Vanessa Williams has won and been dethroned and replaced.  Did that affect you?  Did her reign and fall affect you at all in your journey?
Speaker 2: You know--so interesting, I remember watching Vanessa compete.  It was obvious to everyone that she was going to win and I, like the rest of the African American community was, you know, swelling with pride that she won.  I remember though when she gave up the title because of the nude photos that surfaced, thinking that's it, they gave a black girl a chance, you know, it got messed up.  I won't say she ruined it, but it got messed up.  They're never going to let another black girl be Miss America.  In fact, one of my friends who had all good intentions said to me, "You might as well try something else.  Vanessa messed it up for all you all."   And it seemed to make sense at the time; however, again I'm being raised by this hard-charging woman [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] who believed that I can do anything through Christ who strengthens me, you know, so I kept going in my journey.  Now she was Miss America.  She won in 1984, five years before I won and of course her first runner-up Suzette Charles was also African American.  And Suzette Charles had a nice soft landing with the title.  So that seemed to help a little bit.  But I was just sad.  I was sad because I felt like she was a victim in many ways.
Story_ID: 136392
Speaker 1: I will tell you though, my aspiration to be Miss America was not connected to Vanessa [Williams] in any way, I was already involved in pageants by the time she won and I already had my own reasons for wanting to be there and wanting to win.  So much so, that when I won, the first thing that Miss America does as Miss America, is goes into her first official press conference.  There were dozens if not more than a hundred members of the press from around the world in the pressroom.  And I remember after I walked the runway and waved and, you know, all the girls surround the winner and, you know, was congratulated and hugged by all my fellow contestants.  The head of the Miss America Pageant at that time, Leonard Horn said, "I'm gonna walk you to your press conference.  They're gonna ask you all kinds of things.  We don't limit what you can talk about.  You can say whatever you want to say; you can talk about whatever you want to talk about, but as an attorney"--because he was---"let me just caution you, what you say can and will be held against you."  And I was so high on just winning Miss America, "Okay."  And I, you know, I walk in, the flashbulbs go off.  And it's important to understand, a part of competing for Miss America is preparing for a private, job-style interview.  The most rigorous questioning I've ever endured.  And so I knew how to answer questions.  That's a part of what helped me win the pageant.  So I didn't feel any intimidation, I felt like I was fully prepared for this because that's part of the competition.  They want to know can you handle this.  I was not prepared for the very first question.  Second question, the first one was how did--what were you thinking when you walked down the runway?  Second question.  "How does it feel to be a representative for little black girls out there as the new Miss America?"  I'd never thought of myself in that way.  I was just this veterinary kid who wanted to pay for her education, from Arkansas.  And while I was very aware of my ethnicity growing up, it didn't define me and I was caught of guard and I gave a poor answer.  I said, "Being black is not everything that I am, it's just a part of who I am."  And I went down, "I'm a veterinarian--or I'm a veterinary student, I play the drums, I was raised by a single--"I mean I went down this list of the things that define me and again I said it, "It's just part of who I am."  And the next question came.  As you might imagine, that didn't go over well with many members of the African American community, because what I didn't get in my youth at that time, was the significance of the achievement coming after Vanessa.  We had a shot, didn't go so well, I was the next shot.  And I only saw it as it related to me, not as the significance in society.  And I spent a lot of my year explaining that statement.
Story_ID: 136393
Speaker 1: I'll never forget Essence magazine, and I'll call her name.  She's still around, [HM] Lynn Norment.
Speaker 2: Ebony.
Speaker 1: Ebony magazine. Lynn Norment wrote an article, she did a feature on me; I was on the cover.  And it was a lovely article, talked about my background and what I would do, la la la la.  And in the last paragraph, she editorialized because she had asked me again, a similar question.  "How does it feel to be a representative for the black community?"  And I said in all my naivete, "Well I don't really feel like I represent the black community.  I don't know all black people, you know, I just want to be me.  I want to be the best me and if that's an inspiration to anybody, then I'm happy about that."  And I remember she wrote, "She doesn't understand that when her black face walks into a mall, they see her skin color whether she does or not."  And then she went on to say a few other things about my naivete.  It just kind of chopped me up at the end of the article, hurt my feelings so much, I was mad at her for years.  But it was a good lesson, because I didn't understand the larger picture.  And what most people who live in a dominant culture that is not theirs has to come to recognize is whether you like it or not, you become a representative for your culture.  And so I had to learn that lesson and it was an important one to learn and it was a critical--I realized that there was power in that, there was influence that I could have that I had overlooked.  So it was an important lesson to learn.
Story_ID: 136394
Speaker 1: Well--and Vanessa Williams was a very light-skinned woman with green eyes; Suzette [Charles] was a very light-skinned woman, you're the first brown African American woman.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did that never--was that never a thought for you in the system?
Speaker 2: It was and it wasn't, I mean I was aware, usually when I competed in pageants I was the only black girl or one of two, you know, I was always in the minority, I was always aware of that and again, you know, depending on who you ask, you know, many would say the reason I never won Miss Arkansas was because of my skin.  I say in a more philosophical way, "It just wasn't the right time.  God had a different path."  But, people could make a very persuasive argument about the race politics there.  But, to your point, one of my early appearances as Miss America, she spent a lot of time--Miss America in those days, spent a lot of time doing autograph sessions.  And this was back in the day twenty-five years ago that being Miss America was a big deal.  Miss America was the second largest watched live programming in the--in television, behind the Super Bowl. So everybody knew who Miss America was.  So these crowds would be huge with long lines that, you know, snaked what seemed like forever.  And I was in Pennsylvania at a mall.  The name of the mall escapes me but a little old black lady had stood in the line, she had driven by herself.  She was in her eighties, kind of stooped over.  Driven from a few hours away to come and stand in line and get my autograph.  And when she finally made it to the front of the line, she says, "Honey, we're so proud of you."  I remember that she said we, and she was by herself.  "We're so proud of you."  And I said, "Thank you, Ma'am."  And she says, "And you know what I like about you?"  And I said, "No, ma'am, what is it?"  "You look black." (Laughter) And I was like, "Thank you very much."  That was a very high compliment to me.  So, yes you make a very interesting point.  I, you know, I am the quintessential black girl.
Speaker 1: Well I remember when you won and that was something that we noted that here is the woman who looks black who is black after Vanessa.
Story_ID: 136395
Speaker 1: And so how did you--you described how [HM] Lynn Norment wrote--and this is, Ebony Magazine so it's all of Black America.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Seeing this, were you ever able to right the course in terms of your public expression on representing black women, black girls?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think the first black magazine I appeared in was, Jet, and then, Ebony, on the cover and then, Essence.  So I was able to address it a bit in the Essence interview.  But it was still soon after and I was still getting my footing.  And for someone who has gained overnight fame, you'll appreciate--not saying that you've gained overnight fame--but someone who has; you'll appreciate how disconcerting that is.  How is this little country girl from Arkansas--I was not, you know, socialized or raised for this at all. I wasn't prepared for it, so those words that Leonard Horn said, you know, "What you say can and will be held against you," turned out to be prophetic and I had to learn what that really meant.  So by the time those articles came to be, I really hadn't gotten my arms around it.  Later in the year, I wrote an editorial about that article and by this time, it's six months into my year.  And when I say every interview I gave for local black newspapers; for local black television shows; other smaller black publications; it always came up.  It was the elephant in the room.  And then I did a lot of appearances as Miss America, and many of them were before, obviously, African American audiences and so if there ever was Q&A, it always came up.  "What did you really mean?  Did you mean to say that?"  And so I found myself trying to explain it and apologize for the effect.  And finally, after I realized sort of the form that I had, I asked to write an editorial for a magazine, I asked our publicist, "Can you get me an editorial column so I can address this?"  And she did.  Now, it was in Good Housekeeping. (Laughter)  it turned out.  So it probably wasn't the right form, but that was, you know, my one opportunity to address it.  And pretty much after that, it kind of calmed down.  I went to The [NAACP] Image Awards that year.  That helped.  And I met Oprah Winfrey at The Image Awards, and I said to her, "If you ever need a guest for your show, call on me."  Doggone if she didn't remember that, and about a month later invited me to be a guest on a show that she was doing on celebrities and their moms.  Doing makeovers on their mothers.  And so I and my mom [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] were on the Oprah Winfrey show.  And she helped me a lot.  I went to dinner with her the night before the show, the taping, and we talked about that.  And Oprah has been very forthcoming and even criticized particularly earlier in her career.  And so that was very helpful and I finally, as my grandma would say, got some sense about me, and understood the real significance of what was happening.
Story_ID: 136396
Speaker 1: I want to talk a little more about the inner workings of the pageant system.  You know, the--we see on TV now these pageants with the little children--
Speaker 2: Oh Lord, yes.
Speaker 1: And all the way up.  How much does it cost?  You know, there is--it seems as if there are a lot of expenses so there is the potential for a payoff but you have to invest a lot in it as well and how does it work and how do you work in it?
Speaker 2: Let me first of all say there is a big, difference between the Miss America system and the Miss USA system.  The Miss USA system is a traditional beauty pageant.  They judge proportions and, you know, what I call moles and bow legs.  Miss America truly is a scholarship organization, and while there is a swimsuit component to the competition, the women are rewarded on talent, communication skills and yes, there's poise and beauty, but in the weighting of the system, they're minor compared to the talent and the communication; intelligence.  So the kind of woman, particularly when I was in the Miss America Pageant, was completely different that entered the Miss America system than one that would enter the Miss USA system.   So these truly were especially back in those days, the girl next door.  So while there were Bob Mackie gowns walking the runway at Miss America, they were few and far between.  For me I was this little, you know, poor little black girl from Arkansas.  We didn't have money to send me to veterinary school, so we sure didn't have money to finance a lot of expensive costumes and lessons and tutoring for pageants, so I very much was a self-made girl.  One of my mother's [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] good friends taught ballet in Jonesboro [Arkansas], Dr. Sylvia Richards.  And I would go to Silvia Sylvia and she helped me learn poise and posture and how to walk and turn.  There was a designer in Jonesboro who, you know, designed gowns for the little society ladies in Jonesboro.  And I forget how I met Tim Cobb, but my mother befriended him, he took a liking to us, and he would make my costumes at cost.  So I just had to buy the supplies and then I would help him.  One of my ultimate goals when I was in the Miss America system, this was back now we're in the '80s [1980s], and that was the days of big shoulder pads and beaded gowns, truly the Bob Mackie era.  And I wanted one of those beaded gowns but couldn't afford it.  And so Tim said to me, "I will make you a beaded gown, but you have to bead the fabric."  And so after work between classes, you know, I was in college at that time, I would go to his shop and sit in the back and I would drag a friend with me and sit and hand bead the fabric that he used to make my first beaded gown that I competed in Miss Arkansas with.  So we just, you know, we found ways around it.  I rented things; I borrowed things.  I never went to charm school or took modeling, so I watched a lot of what the glamorous people on T.V. did.  Back in the days of 'Star Search,' and there was a model competition, I studied that like it was astronomy, watching how these ladies carried themselves and used their facial expressions and that's how I sort of trained myself to get ready for the Miss America Pageant.

Speaker 1: And in terms of size, now you said Miss USA was more rigid about how--what the proportions were, et cetera.  Would you be average height or are you less than average height?
Speaker 2: Again on the Miss America system because this attracted the girls who wanted an education, they weren't necessarily beauty bombshells.  So Miss Americas are a varying height.  I'm probably one of the taller Miss Americas.
Speaker 1: At what height?
Speaker 2: I'm 5'7".   The Miss America that crowned me, Gretchen Carlson who is now an anchor at Fox News, is 5'2".  I crowned another African American woman, Marjorie Vincent and she's probably 5'5", 5'6".  So there's a wide range of heights because it's not that kind of system.  And even today, yes, there is a very wide range and heights, coloring, not all Miss Americas are blond, not all of them are the Southern beauties.  That happened in the Miss USA system.  These are girls that either were incredibly intelligent or incredibly talented and reasonably nice to look at.
Story_ID: 136398
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the money a little bit more.  Obviously there's prize if you win, the top prize, but how does the prize system work?
Speaker 2: Well, many people don't realize in the Miss America system there is money to be won all along the way.  So you win a little bit of scholarship money if you win a local.  But there are preliminary awards.   So if a contestant wins the talent award, gets the highest score in talent, or the swimsuit award, there is scholarship money attached to that.  And, you know, so a local pageant winner might win a few hundred dollars.  Then a--then those local pageant winners go to the state pageant and again there is scholarship attached to talent, swimsuit preliminary and interview preliminary.  So the contestants that get the highest score in the private interview, get a scholarship.  And then of course the state winners win thousands of dollars and those state winners go on to the Miss America Pageant.  Again, preliminary awards, all with scholarship attached to them and then the big prize, Miss America.  All told, and this was twenty-five years ago, this was in 19--or excuse me, in 2014, the twenty-fifth anniversary of me winning the Miss America Pageant.  So twenty-five years ago, I won a total of $44,000 in scholarship money to go toward my education and back then that was quite a significant sum.  It covered all my educational cost including the student loan debt that I had racked up by then.  I had a little left over for a down payment on my first house.  So it was quite lucrative.
Story_ID: 136399
Speaker 1: Now twenty-five years ago, Miss America Pageant had a much bigger impact than it does today and I know you have participated in--as a judge in other ways within the pageant system.  Today, what is the money like?
Speaker 2: Today the money is bigger.  I don't know the exact number but the winner of the Miss America Pageant I believe wins a $50,000 scholarship.  And there's lots of other scholarships now.  Now contestants who are pursuing a career in medicine win preliminary awards.  There's preliminary awards for community service.  There's a lot of money to be won.  And what's important to note with the Miss America system, is that this money can only be used for education.  It's not that they hand the winner a check and say enjoy; it has to go toward some pursuit of higher education.  So for Miss Americas that have already finished their college degree when they win, the only way to get their money is to go to graduate school.
Speaker 1: Is there an age limit?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The age limit now, and it's changed a few times over the years, but it's seventeen to twenty-four.
Story_ID: 136400
Speaker 1: Now there was a recent controversy and I thought it was Miss America, but I think it's Miss USA with a contestant who won in our state and then it was rescinded because she was about to turn twenty-five?
Speaker 2: No, that was Miss America.
Speaker 1: It was Miss America, okay.  Talk about that a little bit.
Speaker 2: You know, I don't even know how that happened and I almost blame the organization for allowing that to happen.  I don't know the details but yes, each contestant going into the state pageant has to sign the contract of the state titleholder and stipulates that she fulfills all the criteria for being able to participate.  So how that got through I'm not exactly sure.  And then each state winner going into Miss America has to sign a Miss America contract that stipulates she's eligible according to the criteria and available to perform the duties of Miss America before she competes so that it's not an issue after a winner has been named.  So how that happened I'm not exactly sure.  Usually there is a birth date cutoff.  You have to be twenty-four or can't be older than twenty-four by a certain date and I would imagine that's where the discrepancy was.  She didn't make that date.
Speaker 1: Interesting that the controversies are still what--(unclear)
Speaker 2: Yes, and can I say something about that?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It is interesting, you don't hear about controversies amongst--usually when you hear about the Miss America Pageant it's about some woman who is nontraditional that's competed and what makes the news is a few years ago there was a state title holder who was an Afghanistan or Iraq vet, or a deaf contestant, or there was one Miss America who won who is a diabetic and wears an insulin pump.  So those are the things that usually make the news of Miss America.  In the Miss USA system, which is owned by Donald Trump, it's usually the controversy that bubbles up just before the pageant.  So, some contestant got arrested for shoplifting, or, you know, gone into rehab.  And it's always conveniently timed leading up to their broadcast so it kind of serves as a ratings booster for them.  For the Miss America Pageant, it's rare if it's a controversy, it's usually some novelty or oddity.
Story_ID: 136401
Speaker 1: So you won Miss America, can you show us that experience because you described leading up to it with the Miss Arkansas, but when you won, can you share that experience?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I want to start with the seconds before I won.  Now again, I went there to win.  By this time I had been in the system for seven years; I knew what I was doing.  I went to Miss America--I didn't go to have fun, I didn't go to make friends, I didn't go to braid somebody's hair--I went to win, and I was very methodical and very focused about that.  I don't think I was a mean competitor, but I was very focused; I had a goal.  But when I got there, there was buzz I learned about this other contestant, Virginia Cha, Miss Maryland.  And the buzz was about the two of us, and who would win.  And there was this speculation that this might be the first year a minority might win again after Vanessa because Virginia was Asian, and me being African American.  So all week long we tracked together.  The first night I won swimsuit, the next night she won swimsuit.  The second night I won talent--no I take that back, I didn't win talent, but the next night she did win talent.  I'm like aww so I was kind of setting, you know, my course against hers.  We both make top ten and we compete.  And it was my hope once they came out of the final competition--final commercial, to announce the winners, that she would be eliminated early because I thought I had a better chance of beating any of the other girls up there on stage other than Virginia.  So I wanted her out of the way.  So, come out of the commercial, Gary Collins and I think it was Mary Ann Mobley began to talk about the runners up.  They began to call the runners up.  They got to third runner up and there was another competitor, Miss Colorado, Debbie Riecks.  And so Gary Collins says, "And your third runner up is Debbie," and he paused just a moment and for that split second I thought I had gotten third runner up and I remember thinking oh crap.  And then he said, "Riecks, Miss Colorado."  I was like, "Oh, thank you Jesus!"  (Laughter) I was still in the running.  And this year, the way they decided to do it was the entire top ten, so they called fourth, third, second runner up.  So there are still seven girls still standing there, one of which is the first runner up, one of which is the winner.  So what they did was then to call the final two finalists out but you don't know which one--which is first runner up.  And dag gummit [ph.] they called, Debbye Turner and here I go (thumbs up sign) good.  And then they call Virginia Cha, and I'm like (grunts).  And I just couldn't be confident that I beat Virginia, because she was a very strong competitor.  For whatever reason--No, it was Phyllis George and Gary Collins chatted on forever before they announced the winner and the runner up, and I remember standing there thinking, will you just get to it?  Now Virginia Cha is hyperventilating.  I mean, she is about to, you know, she's (acting out hyperventilation).  And I remember turning to her, you can see it on the tape.  I began to talk to her, "It's okay, you did such a great job; I know you're gonna do well."  Because she was just, you know, she was about to lose it.  Finally they get down to the business.  And they say and the first runner up is Virginia Cha.  And instinctively the culture in pageants is the contestants turn and congratulate the one who's just won something.  So out of reflex, I turned to congratulate her for being first runner-up.  And it took a second before I realized, that meant you won dummy.  And you can see my hug change when I realize that, because I went from giving her a very polite oh look what you did hug to, "Oh my God I won." (acts out a scream)  You know, and then they called my name.
Story_ID: 136402
Speaker 1: First thing I did was I raised my hands and I thanked God because I knew I wouldn't be there by his grace.  The second thing I did, I knew where my parents [Frederick C. Turner and Gussie Lee Jones Turner] were sitting; because of all the lights I could not see them, but I knew generally where they were.  I looked in that direction and I gave my mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] thumbs up because in every pageant, I always wanted her to know I couldn't have done it without her.  And so that was my way of sharing that moment.  So that was the second thing I did was I gave her that thumbs up.   By that time, Gretchen [Carlson], poor little short Gretchen behind me is trying to put the crown on me and so I had to do this power squat and for her to get in you know they always fumble and its hard to get up there and I just remember my quads burning, thinking, can you please hurry up?  (Laughter) she finally gets to--gets the crown on my head, I stand up, and Gary Collins says, "Miss America, greet your audience."   And I didn't really know what he meant by that so I turn around to Gretchen and she goes, "You're Miss America, go."  And I turn around and I started taking that iconic walk down the runway.  And I'll tell you this, because I'm the kind of girl that prepares for everything, I had even practiced my winning smile in the mirror, because I knew that these photographs were going to last forever and I wanted them to be good.  I was so overwhelmed with emotion.  I thought about those days of beading my own material, I thought about all the people who poured into my life and gave me things for free.  And I thought about those people who said, "You're a black girl; you'll never be Miss America."  And just like I'm overcome now, I was so overcome with that, I couldn't smile the way I had practiced.  It's this dumb, ugly smile that I had all the way down the runway, relishing the village that it took to get me there.  And so now I'm stuck with those pictures (laughter).
Story_ID: 135273
Speaker 1: You described that first press conference, so what does Miss America do over the course of the year?
Speaker 2: I liken the year of being Miss America like a presidential to a presidential campaign.  I'll give you the statistics first.  Miss America back in my day I traveled 20,000 miles a month.  I was in and out of the city every eighteen to thirty-six hours. I worked seven days a week, forty-eight weeks out of that year.  Giving speeches, signing autographs, being in parades, conducting interviews, you know, newspaper, print, television.  It very much is like a campaign, you know, signing autographs and kissing babies.  And it's relentless.  It is the single most difficult, physically strenuous job I've ever had.  I was away from home for all but two of those weeks that entire year.  So it is quite a responsibility.
Story_ID: 135274
Speaker 1: I won the Miss America pageant three days shy of my twenty-fourth birthday.  So I turned twenty-four, three days later on September 19th and I was on the David Letterman Show ['Late Show with David Letterman'] that night.  I have a funny memory about that.  They knew that it was my birthday and so [David] Letterman made this big show of giving me a gift for my birthday.  And I forget his little sidekick that used to be his foil for his jokes, a little older guy.  And he was--well we have a gift for you befitting a new Miss America and his partner pushed out a lawn mower (laughter) as my birthday gift.  And everybody laughed.  Back home my mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] got so excited because she thought she had just gotten herself a new lawnmower.  Turned out it was just a prop; they never sent it to me. (Laughter) she was mad for a long time. "Call them and ask them about that lawnmower, they gave it to you on national TV."  I'm like, "Mommy, I'm not gonna bother them about the lawnmower.  I'll buy you a lawnmower."  But that was, yeah, on my twenty-fourth birthday.
Story_ID: 135275
Speaker 1: And did you--in your speech in Miss America, did you talk about wanting to be a veterinarian?
Speaker 2: Absolutely. Absolutely. I was the first--the year that I competed was the first year that the pageant instituted a platform.  So every contestant had to--we actually had to write an essay on three social issues upon which we felt strongly.  And one of them would then become our platform for the year.  There were many Miss Americas before me that advocated for a passion but they did it of their own volition.  This was the first time it became an official part of the program.  So I was the first Miss America to have an official platform and I chose youth motivation.  So, spoke at schools, churches, camps, youth rallies, youth conventions all over the country about excellence and goal setting and exceeding beyond others expectations.  All of which were things in my life and of course--by this time, I am within six months of my Doctor of Veterinary Medicine [D.V.M.] degree.  So, you know, I talked a lot about my love of animals and knew--I always knew I would go back and finish my degree; it was never a question.
Speaker 1: So did you have to negotiate with the school?  What happened?
Speaker 2: I did, and thankfully, the dean of the veterinary college [University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine, Columbia, Missouri], Dr. [Roberts] Kahrs was very enthusiastic.  He thought that this was a great opportunity for me and was very willing to give me a year leave of absence so I could fulfill my duties as Miss America.  And then as soon as I gave up the title, the next month I went right back and finished my last year of veterinary school and graduated with my D.V.M. in '91 [1991].
Story_ID: 135276
Speaker 1: Where then did you practice?
Speaker 2: It was in the course of my final year; we have to practice in order to obtain the degree.  So I had practiced throughout my training.  But in my last few months of veterinary school, I received a call from an executive at Ralston Purina.  They came and had lunch with me; they wanted to start this national pet education program; they were looking for a veterinarian to be the spokesperson and thought I would be the perfect fit.  I had the name recognition, communication skills and the degree.  And so my first official job out of veterinary school was being the spokesperson for the Caring for Pets Program.  And it was the perfect fit for me because I was able to use my education to talk about proper pet care, but use all those skills that I had just obtained as Miss America doing these media interviews around the country.
Story_ID: 135277
Speaker 1: It was during that year, I was giving an interview about pet care, the four Cs of responsible pet ownership.  And a Los Angeles [California] television agent saw me give that interview, was impressed by what she saw, and tracked me down.  Made a cold call, introduced herself and said, "I think I can build a career in television for you.  Are you interested?"  And by this time, I had been approached by a lot of people with a lot of motives and my, you know, my guard was pretty high.  And I was like, "Oh that sounds nice, no thank you."  And she kept calling.  Every few months she'd call again, "Are you sure?"  And so to get rid of her, I said, "Get me a gig."  And the first gig on television she got was hosting a special sponsored by Modern Bride on getting married, but it was a national show.  And I was impressed that she got that for me.  And then she got me a gig doing pet segments in the local news in St. Louis [Missouri] because that's where I'd settled after I finished veterinary school.  And that was the beginning of my career in broadcast journalism.  I did that.  That led to hosting a pet show for PBS which eventually led to anchoring an entertainment show in St. Louis called, 'Show Me St. Louis.'  That led to me becoming a correspondent for CBS, which then led to me being an anchor here at Arise News.  So I never in my wildest imaginations thought that I would end up with a career in television.
Speaker 2: How long did you also practice being a veterinarian?
Speaker 1: None after that.  None.  And I struggled with it at first, because at that time particularly right out of veterinary school I got a lot of invitations to speak and I had a very--I still do motivational speaking but then I was doing two hundred speaking engagements a year and so my mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] said, "Ride this wave as long as it's here.  It won't be here forever."  So I made the conscious decision to delay my veterinary career and I didn't want to go into practice, I wanted to specialize.  I wanted to do a residency in internal medicine, be board certified, teach and practice at a veterinary school.  I wanted to be a clinician.  And so that was the next step for me and I decided to delay that to take advantage of all these opportunities that becoming Miss America had afforded me and twenty-five years later, the opportunities are still here.
Story_ID: 135278
Speaker 1: In the midst of a very active career, when--I know that you're married.  How did you even have time?  Where did dating fit into your life?  You know, from the young age being a Christian and then--and you--and you married?
Speaker 2: Yes, well growing up, grew up as I've said before, growing up I was raised in a very strict household.  We were not allowed to go to parties, they were just places we were not allowed to go.  Even people we were not allowed to hang out with, so that severely limited my social life.  I was allowed to date.  I couldn't date until I was sixteen.  I had a crush on a young cute guy who had just moved to town the year [Jonesboro, Arkansas] before and we had to wait until my sixteenth birthday before we could go out on a date.  And I dated him for six years.  We eventually became engaged, so I had one real boyfriend through high school and college and then once I got to veterinary school, there was a time and it's not related to veterinary school and it's not related pageants, but I was raised to believe that if you allow God to put two people together, it will be the right match and it will last.  And so my mother [Gussie Lee jones Turner] had always said, "Wait on God's choice.  Nobody can choose better for you than the Lord."  And there was a point at which I came to realize he was a great choice, but he was not God's choice because as we talked about our future and the kind of life that we envisioned, his vision of life and lifestyle was very different than mine.  And it took me a long time to admit that and to break up, but eventually I did end the engagement because I said, "We won't be happy.  We want different things."  So then entered the winter of my discontent. Laughter) and I didn't date much through my twenties.  I had become Miss America, I was traveling the world, you know, doing those two hundred speaking engagements a year, and Ralston Purina and other shows and it was just a lot, you know, there was a lot going on.  And I was perfectly fulfilled and I probably was one of those, you know, "I don't need a man.  I'm a strong black woman.  I can take care of myself.  Bought my own house.  Bought my own car.  What do I need a man for?" And then around twenty-eight my ovaries began to talk.  You know what, okay, you don't need a man but if you want a baby. (laughter) So it wasn't really until I had begun to hear my biological clock that I started to try to slow down long enough for somebody to ask me out on a date.  And, you know, I dated here and there, I had a very good friend, we were really just friends for ten years.  That didn't work out and now I'm marching through my thirties and now it's not cute anymore.  I began to, you know, in my late twenties, early thirties I was like, "Okay God I'm ready, send him." And he didn't come and by thirty-five I'm like, "God you may not have heard me, I said I'm ready."  And he didn't come.  Then toward my late thirties, I'm headed to forty and I'm like now listen here God, you know, quit playing. (laughter)  I'm almost forty.  As it turns out, a young man that I met in 1992, we had become casual friends over the years.  He was an event planner, I was a motivational speaker, he had booked me to speak at a Christian youth rally and we met and that was it.  He booked me to speak a few other times.  Eventually, I hired him to manage my speaking engagements and we got to know each other, but he was like a brother.  He was, you know, one of my best friends but like a brother.  Make the long story short, fifteen years after we met, he confessed his love.  I'll never forget what he said.  He said, "I have loved you from the first day I met you."  And then he went on and said other wonderful things about how he compared me to all the other women he'd dated and they never measured up blah, blah, blah.  And I remember sitting there listening to that thinking, "How do I let him down easily," because in my mind, he was a brother.  And I said to him, "Thank you," which was the worst thing to say after someone says I love you.  And I said, "I love you, but I can't offer you the love that you're offering me and that's not fair."   As you can imagine, it ruined the friendship.  We didn't talk for a year and a half--
Story_ID: 135279
Speaker 1: But his mother got deathly ill.  I found out about it through a blast email. And I went to the funeral and I don't know what happened, but between that time that I turned him down and the time that I saw him at his mother's funeral, he didn't look like my brother anymore.  He looked fine, gorgeous.  So I sat through--by this time I'm a minister, so he had asked me to sit in the pulpit and I think I did the prayer and read a scripture so here I am, you know, "clergy."  But I sat through this poor man's funeral lusting after him.  I followed him everywhere he went.  He was the spokesperson for his siblings to give remarks and the whole time I was just thinking mm, mm, mm, mm.  How could I let that get past me?  Come to find out he was dating somebody else.  So I just thought, I missed it.  Send somebody else, God.  We were both marathon runners at the time.  Turns out we were both registered for the Chicago Marathon [Chicago, Illinois] and so we agreed to find each other and start the race together.  So he was dating somebody but I decided I was going to flirt my behind off.  And so I giggled every time he said something and twirled my hair and touched his arm and, you know, things we do.  And he's a very faithful, loyal guy, you know, he was very gentlemanly and circumspect.  And finally before we parted company to say goodbye, I just decided to say, "So if things don't work out with what's her name, we should talk again."  And in my mind I thought he was going to break up with what's her name, take a day or two to recover and call me the next week.  Months went by and I didn't hear from him, but I finally did.  He called and again I remember exactly what he says.  He says, "I can't get you out of my spirit.  I felt called to you.  I thought I would try this one last time."  And by this time I'm crying and he said, "I don't know if I'm out on this limb by myself, but I thought I would try one last time."  So I'm crying, I'm like; "You're not on that limb by yourself.  I love you too."  And we dated and the next year got married.  I was forty-two when I got married.  It was his first marriage too.  So we're a bit of late bloomers.  So here we are with our old selves with a four year old.  God help us.
Speaker 2: And is this your biological child?
Speaker 1: Yes, again, faith and an almighty God.  I was able to get pregnant naturally without any intervention of medical technology and gave birth to a beautiful, healthy, rambunctious child who is in control of everything.  I'm trying to wrestle back control, I'm planning a coup (laughter).
Story_ID: 135280
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about your--you were at CBS for a long time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And was this under [HM] Lyne Pitts?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did she bring you there?
Speaker 2: Yes, Lyne Pitts hired me.
Speaker 1: And so while you were there can you tell me what you were doing?
Speaker 2: Yes, I met Lyne Pitts at an NABJ, National Association of Black Journalists convention.  And I had gone there specifically to show my reel, clips of my work to executives, network executives.  Just to gauge their reaction, but at this point I'm hosting a show in St. Louis [Missouri] and I decide I want to take this to the next level.  I want to try to make it to the network.  I wasn't ready yet I didn't think, but I just wanted to see.  Again, a part of my personality, that preparation thing.  And so I met Lyne Pitts, she was at the CBS booth and I showed her my tape.  She was complementary about some things; she was not so complementary about other things.  Lyne Pitts is a straight shooter, but I appreciated it and I remember saying again to her, if there is ever an opening, think of me.  And it was just one of those things that was a throw away thing.  Well sure enough a couple weeks after that convention one of their contributors quit.  And she remembered me, contacted my agent, flew me up, interviewed me and I got a job as a contributor on 'The Early Show.'  It was the version of the morning show that CBS had at the time and I was a--essentially a feature reporter.  So I would do feature stories a couple times a month.  It was not that big of an assignment, but I loved it, got my feet wet at the network and I wanted to be on the air more because I quickly learned out of sight, out of mind.  The more you're on the air the more chances for advancement.  So I began to look for ways to get on the air and I said to our Executive Producer, a Senior Executive Producer, "You know, I don't know if you all know but I'm a veterinarian, people love their animals, I notice you all don't do pet stories, you know, how about I do some pet stories?"  And he was game, he goes, "We'll try you out on Saturday."  So I did a pet segment on Saturday; apparently it went well.  By the next week, the sales department had sold a year's worth of sponsoring advertisement for pet segments and I became the CBS Resident Veterinarian.  And for the next eight years--because I was a couple years into my tenure there--I did all the pet wildlife animal stories across all of the CBS shows.  I was there for eleven years and I'm convinced the reason I stayed for so long because broadcast news business is very fickle and transient, is because I had a niche that nobody else could fill.  It was doing those pet and animal stories as a veterinarian.
Story_ID: 135281
Speaker 1: Why did you leave?
Speaker 2: Two reasons, my contract ran out and they didn't renew because at CBS, they have this habit of retooling their morning show every three or four years.  No version seems to be able to get traction and so my contract ran out at about the same time they decided to retool the morning show.  And so they--I was told, "We love you.  We want to keep you.  Let's find another place for you but we're not gonna use contributors on the morning show anymore.  And this was when Gayle King, Charlie Rose, Norah O'Donnell came in.  And so it was a completely different format, so they weren't doing those lifestyle types of things, but for whatever reason, they never found another spot for me in the network.  And I kept suggesting, you know, I'd love to be on the evening news.  I'd love to do Sunday morning.  I'd love to do weekend, but it--it just didn't materialize and so I reasonably quickly realized, "I don't think they really want me to stay, I think they're just being nice.  So I took that as an opportunity.  What I did do at CBS was I got to fill in anchor a lot, so whenever the main anchors were gone, I got to fill in, but I was never afforded the opportunity to have a real shot at being the main anchor.  And by this time in my career I wanted to be an anchor.  And so I decided I'm gonna leave CBS and I'm going to look for an anchor position.  This, you know, another certain age in this business, and this was probably the end of the window to do it.  If I don't do it now, I don't know if I can do it later.  And within the same year, Arise News came along.
Story_ID: 135282
Speaker 1: I'm aware of Arise because first there was the magazine and then the fashion shows that the founder would bring to New York [City, New York].  And then suddenly there is this announcement that there was going to be an international television channel.
Speaker 2: Network (shakes head).
Speaker 1: How did you become aware of Arise?
Speaker 2: Again through [HM] Lyne Pitts.  I owe Lyne a lot of the success of my network career.  This was the late summer of 2012.  I was still looking for my next spot to land and my husband and I had gone on our first vacation without our daughter, to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  And I got a text message from Lyne while I was laying on the hammock out on the porch of the house and she said are you willing to take a call about an anchor job?  I almost fell out of that hammock trying to text her back saying, "Yes! Yes!"  And so I called her and she goes, "You're gonna hear from a woman by the name of Eugenia Harvey.  There's a new network, a global cable network.  They're looking for an anchor and I recommended you."  So make the long story short.  We were supposed to be there for another four or five days, turns out the owner of this brand new network was in New York that day and was leaving the next day.  I told my husband, "Baby, pack the bags."  Packed the bags, closed the house, drove back to New York that night.  Made the last ferry, drove back to New York and met with Nduka Obaigbena the owner of Arise News the next day.  In the interview, he offered me the job.  And here we are a year and half later.
Story_ID: 135283
Speaker 1: It's a neat mission, you know, the mission is to tell not just the mainstream stories of news and events, but the stories of what we call the underserved community which is very often the people of color, the communities that don't have the resources and the voice.  So in addition to telling the news that everybody else tells, we also want to tell the stories that don't get told for the people who don't have voices.  And it's a really neat vision.  All the challenges of a startup, but it's been a cool journey.
Speaker 2: And this is focusing on people of African descent.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It is an international network; your background is quite different in terms of the audiences that you serve.  Do you find that you have to put on a different--look through a different lens today?
Speaker 1: No, because in many ways, you know, I was born in America, I have been--I had been to Africa before I worked for this network and a few other countries, so I was aware of the world in which we lived.  I'm not one of those ugly Americans that have very myopic vision.  And because I worked in broadcast journalism at that point for almost twenty years, I often pitched stories that did not get interest at the mainstream network for which I worked.  And so it's been a wonderful relief and a great opportunity to tell those stories that I couldn't convince my old bosses were interesting and worthy of telling to be able to tell them here in this forum.  So it really just opened up a forum for me that just wasn't available before.
Speaker 2: As a startup, it's, I mean, obviously I watch--I know a lot about the network.  There's not a lot of advertising; how is it as a business as you look into the future?
Speaker 1: Yes, that's probably a better question for the owner, but the intention is to advertise.  We started off broadcasting in Europe, soon after Africa and in some parts of Asia.  So we broadcast internationally, it is the governmental news model in Great Britain to not allow advertising.  Their news broadcasts don't have commercials, it's illegal.  And so when we started and I started off anchoring our first international show in London [England].  I commuted to London for six weeks I worked here.  No commercials, so that is the model then that was brought to the U.S.  It is the goal to get wide distribution, we broadcast in the New York City tri-state area now.  We broadcast in [Washington] D.C. and a couple of other small little pockets, but he is working on the wide distribution and it's sort of the catch-22.  It's difficult to get distribution without advertisers.  And it's impossible to get advertisers without distribution, and that's what he's struggling with right now trying to get the chicken or the egg; but one of them to come first.

Speaker 1: When you think about your legacy, what comes to mind?
Speaker 2: I hope my legacy is a living, breathing example that the impossible is possible.  I am the most unlikely person to have lived the life that I've lived, to experience what I've experienced and to attain what I've achieved.  But by the grace of God, a lot of work and some tears, I've made it.  I want every little--and now I get it [HM] Lynn Norment--brown girl out there who doesn't see a world bigger than the disadvantages that she's in to know she can be anything, and she can do anything if she'll dedicate herself to it.  And I would recommend have faith in the God that created her to help her.  That's what I want my legacy to be.

Speaker 1: Your child is four years old, what are the lessons that you're teaching your child looking to the future?
Speaker 2: You know, I've turned into my mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] (laughter).  All the things I said I would never do and say with my children, I'm doing and saying them with passion and gusto because I get it now.  I'm teaching her even at four to be a strong independent thinker.  I'm teaching her to be kind even when others aren't kind to her.  I'm teaching her that she will always be able to do more than she thinks she can do if she just keeps trying.  And I'm teaching her to have faith in her creator, that there is someone bigger than her.  That if she depends on him, he will help her do all things.
Story_ID: 135286
Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: I do, you know what and it's so interesting because that question is asked a lot particularly of celebrities and I hear people say no I don't have any regrets because I wouldn't be where I am and I find that curious and God bless those who can live without regrets, but there are some things that I wish I had done differently.  Some things I wish I had handled differently.  For instance, once I got into television and realized that I wasn't going back to veterinary medicine anytime soon, I let my licensing lapse.  It was very easy to keep it up.  I had to do some continuing education, a few hours every year.  And I was like ah, I don't really have time for it, I'm not practicing, I'll let it go.  I wish I, you know, because now to become licensed now, I practically would have to repeat veterinary school.  You know, so it's things like that.  I met some amazing people as Miss America who opened themselves up to me.  Oprah [Winfrey] gave me her home phone number; Bill Cosby gave me his contact information.  A number of people, "If you need anything, let me know."  And I was too young and dumb to understand how significant that was, you know, so I let the year go by, I let the time go by without using access that was afforded me, yeah.  So things like that, missed opportunities.  But it does all work together for my good I believe.
Story_ID: 135287
Speaker 1: If you have one piece of parting advice to offer to young people who might want to do what you've done with your life, what would it be?
Speaker 2: I would say this, my message has changed to young people.  In my year as Miss America and the intervening years after that I would--I used to talk to almost millions of kids and I would say, "You can do anything you want to do with your life; you can be anything you want to be."  And my perspective has changed.  I think we can do anything, I think we were born to do a particular thing.  Purpose.  So my advice is spend the first half of your life figuring out your purpose while you're here and then spend the rest of your life living it out.
Story_ID: 135288
Speaker 1: You described that your inroad to television was through Ralston Purina, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And where did you go from there?
Speaker 2: After Ralston Purina I got this gig hosting this national special about getting married, which led to being a contributor on an animal show which made perfect sense being a veterinarian.  It was called 'The Gentle Doctor,' broadcast on PBS stations.  And eventually, I got the gig to host the show.  And at the time it was just sort of a little fun side thing.  And it's cool, I'm on T.V. and, you know, as I traveled to do motivational speaking which was my true passion at that time, I was just cool to go to a different part of the country and it's like, "Oh yeah saw you on that show," and it was just something, you know it was available to me and I took advantage of it. It was fun, I was, you know, reasonably proficient at it.  When I got the job as anchor of 'Show Me St. Louis,' [St. Louis, Missouri] which was this local entertainment show, similar to, 'Entertainment Tonight' on the local level.  I thought again, I'm just doing this fun little host, I'll go in there, I'll sit down, it was a thirty minute show, I'll go in an hour before to do my hair and makeup, do the thirty minute show, maybe stay there thirty minutes to slap five and, you know, pat butts, and then I'd be out of there.  What I didn't know was actually the title was anchor reporter, and that it was a real live broadcast journalism job.  And when I showed up, I found out I had to grout, find stories, research them, book them and shoot them.  And then come back and supervise the editing.  I had no skills for that, you know, I knew how to spay a dog, or, you know, sign an autograph.  So I learned trial by fire on the job, how to be a journalist, and I hope that those early stories have somehow been destroyed in a flood or a fire, because I was not good at it.  And it was one of the first things that did not actually come easily for me and that I was not naturally good at it.  I was used to excelling at whatever I tried.  So, I quickly learned to find mentors.  There were other--particularly African American females in the newsroom.  One was a producer, and the other two were anchors or reporters.  And I asked them for help, you know, "I don't know what I'm doing, can you show me what to do?"  And it was through their patient tutelage that I learned how to A, recognize a story and then B, properly construct the story and then C, tell it in an engaging way.  So that was all done in local television in St. Louis where I really learned to be a journalist and I was no longer a "novelty" former pageant girl that they put on TV. I began to learn my trade.
Story_ID: 135289
Speaker 1: After my first contract with 'Show Me St. Louis' [St. Louis, Missouri], which was three years, by this time I had been out of veterinary school about five years.  I had to make a decision and that is am I going to go back into veterinary medicine while I still remember the information, or am I gonna pursue this new career.  And I struggled with that because all I had ever wanted to be ever since I was a little girl was a veterinarian and I, you know, spent all this time and money getting this education that I wasn't using.  And I talked to one of my colleagues from Ralston Purina who is a veterinarian and had practiced and I sort of told him of my dilemma and he said, "Listen Debbye, you've been afforded incredible opportunity and he goes you can do more good for animals on television speaking to thousands or millions of people then you ever could treating them one at a time."  And that was the release that I needed.  And from that moment forward, I plunged headlong into broadcast journalism but I was more interested in news then entertainment and when I went to CBS then I began to look for those opportunities to tell real news stories.  And as it turned out, that little girl, that precocious little girl who loved to gather information and tell people, came out.  And now all of a sudden I'm doing exactly what I wanted to do when I was five years old and that is gather facts and give people good factual accurate information about stuff that matters in their life.  I'll add this, the best thing that ever happened to me in terms of becoming a journalist, was to be the subject of news before I became a reporter of news because I spent that year as Miss America being interviewed and I saw the damage that could be done when information is told incorrectly, told with a motivation or a slant, that has ulterior motives.  So how it affected my life, you know, I made it on the cover of The National Enquirer.  A whole article made up, none of it is true (laughter).  Yes, so when I finally ended up in journalism, I came in with a sensitivity to the importance of being first of all, accurate and second of all fair.  And I've tried to keep that throughout my career because I experienced it first before I became a journalist.
Story_ID: 135290
Speaker 1: Now 'The Early Show,' you weren't there when it first became 'The Early Show,' right?
Speaker 2: Shortly after I think it started the year before I, you know, before I came onto CBS.
Speaker 1: And CBS has long struggled with trying to not be number three in that time slot.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I don't know that it's ever-- has it ever?
Speaker 2: No, it's never been out of the third spot.
Speaker 1: So what was that environment like being in, being on a show that is new and struggling and not getting out of that spot?
Speaker 2: Because of my role when I first started, I didn't feel the pressure of it.  What's important to note is this was Bryant Gumbel, it was Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayson.  It was the new incarnation of 'The Morning Show,' called, 'The Early Show.'  And this is not long after Bryant had left 'The Today Show.'  And so the pressure was on him.  He was brought in to save the CBS morning time slot.  So I didn't really feel that pressure.  I was going on and, you know, doing how to keep your puppies from chewing through electrical wire segments, you know, so I got the fun stuff.  By the time I was doing those real stories and I grew at the network and I went from a contributor to an actual correspondent and they were monitoring the popularity of my stories and my segments.  It was frustrating to be on a show that was number three in that the big "Gets" that we called them in our business, always went to the number one show.  And then, you know, the B-plus Gets went to the number two show.  So we were always scrapping to try to get those big stories and those big interviews by celebrities or newsmakers or whoever it was, that would automatically go to the number one show so that was frustrating.  That was very frustrating, but it also was a freedom because in number three, I mean we weren't 'Today' ['The Today Show']' in 'Good Morning America' that were literally in mortal combat everyday.  We were the little engine that could Early Show. So, I had the freedom as a reporter and the show had the freedom to try things and do things and take risks because we didn't have that much to lose (laughter). Yes, so it was this interesting dichotomy of having limitations because we were number three, but also having freedoms because we were number three.
Story_ID: 135291
Speaker 1: And now being at this network [Arise News] that is a startup, but international--are you as an anchor traveling a lot?  I know you said in the beginning you were.  What does your role consist of?
Speaker 2: I travel for the big stories.  I went to South Africa to cover Nelson Mandela's funeral.  It was our hope last year to send the show down to Florida for the Trayvon Martin trial.  It's those big stories that I as an anchor travel for.  Ultimately we didn't, ultimately didn't, but when he hired me, that was, you know, the trial was coming up.  And, you know, we were looking for ways to make a name for ourselves, like we're going to own this story.  We ended up doing a myriad specials but we kept it based here, probably for financial reasons.  So, you know, I mainly stay here.  At 6 six o'clock in the evening Eastern Time daily, evening news show.  And then when those really big, historic iconic events happen, then they'll send me out.  But we have correspondents and contributors around the world now that often will cover those stories in those remote locations.
Story_ID: 135292
Speaker 1: As you look at your broadcast career, what would you say going from local into big national news and here, it's small but it's international; do you see through lines?  Are there very dramatic differences between them?  When you look at the big picture?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know what the through line that I see is I have been blessed throughout my journalism career to always do what I loved, you know, at CBS, at first I was telling people stories which I loved doing, ordinary people that did extraordinary things.  And then I parlayed that into this niche as The Resident Veterinarian.  Obviously, loved those and it wasn't just the, you know, the cute panda born at the Atlanta Zoo, you know, I covered the impact on the wildlife in the Gulf Horizon oil spill.  You know, things like that, so those big wildlife stories as well.  But that was what I had a passion for, so that was a blessing in that capacity.  I was responsible for finding my stories, so I found the ones that I liked to do.  And for someone who starts off as a general assignment reporter, they know that's not the case, you get the story you're assigned and you do it whether you like it or not.  And so I've always been blessed to have that opportunity to choose what I'm really interested in, what I'm really passionate about.  And now here at Arise because of the mission of this network, again I am telling stories.  Sometimes they're the regular old garden variety, tornado, fire, you know, political corruption stories, but we tell them in a way that interests me.  I love that on any given night, the guests look exactly like me and they are psychiatrists and engineers and heads of corporations.  I am amazed at the number of experts and champions in industry that are people of color and minorities that you never see in mainstream media and this is the outlet for them.  I love that.  We've done segments about black women and their hair.  We've done segments about how little black boys get socialized in America differently than little white boys because little white boys will probably never have the encounters with law enforcement that are commonplace for black boys.  That's not going to happen on those other networks.  And we do that here and we talk about Ghana and we talk about Liberia, we talk about Mali.  I didn't know where Mali was (laughter) until I got this job at Arise News and I'm richer for it.

Speaker 1: --So go ahead and tell us about this photograph.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is my mother [Gussie Lee Jones Turner] and my father [Frederick C. Turner] on their wedding day.  Gussie Jones, Fred Turner, Junior, in 1960.  And this is at St. Paul A.M.E. Church.  It's the church my father grew up in and the church I grew up in.
Speaker 1: Where?
Speaker 2: Jonesboro, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: (Off-CAMERA CONVERSATION)
Speaker 2: So I'm going to put several down and you can go left to right, okay? (photo falls)
Speaker 1: I was wondering if that was gonna happen.  We grew up with a lot of cats.  That was one of my earliest kitties.  I remember her name was Kitty.  Had a lot of kittens.  This is me at two years old.  My one and only topless photo of life.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was gonna say good thing that didn't come out at the pageant.
Speaker 1: And then the third is my mother, my sister [Suzette Caldwell] and I on I believe an Easter Sunday.  I believe it to be about a year, year and a half which would make my sister about five.  We're done, done with the on camera part.  I'm narrating photos.
Speaker 2: (Off-CAMERA CONVERSATION)
Speaker 1: That's my sister, my mother and myself.  The center photo is me playing a snare job at a school assembly as Miss America showing them that I too was a drummer.  And that's a family photo taken the night that I was crowned Miss America.  My sister, Suzette Turner Caldwell, Fred Turner, Gussie Turner and me.
Speaker 2: One more picture.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yes it's the next one coming up. (laughter)  Have you heard anything from downstairs?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA CONVERSATION)
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a Christmas photo, one of our Christmases we really decked out the tree and even though we weren't wealthy somehow my mother was able to pull off a bunch of Christmas gifts.  In the center in the striped top it's me in high school, I probably was about fifteen years.  That's post braces.  You'll soon see one with braces.  And then on the right is my sister Suzette and I.  I'm probably about eight years old.  Suzette is about twelve.  As you can see, I've always had that big forehead.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA CONVERSATION)
Speaker 1: (laughter)  The Commentary.  Absolutely, why not have the commentary? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA CONVERSATION)
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my mother and I on my homecoming back to Missouri after I won Miss America.  I just love this photo, as you can see we both are looking each other in the adoring way that we really, you know, cherished each other and I shared that accomplishment with her as far as I was concerned she was Miss America too.  The house is--that's the house that I grew up in on Oak Street in Jonesboro, Arkansas.  It is also the house that my father grew up in.  And I believe. Excuse me, can I take it?  Can I look at it?  That's, okay.  That is my grandmother [Ercerene Turner], my father's mother standing in the yard.  And then the photo on the right is me as a middle schooler practicing my snare drum.  I started playing percussion in middle school and turns out I loved playing the snare drum and my poor mother had to listen to me practice every day in our house.  This also was my homecoming to Mexico, Missouri, the town where the Miss Missouri Pageant was held.  I was giving a statement to those who had come out to greet me and members of the media.  And then the large black and white is my autograph photo from when I was Miss America.  Actually it was my official Miss Missouri Pageant photo, which I liked better than my official Miss America Pageant photo.  Alright on the left this black and white with me holding this monstrosity is my year as Miss America I endorsed I think it was Motorola, I don't know if you can see the wording on the side of the phones.
Speaker 2: US Cellular.
Speaker 1: Oh, US Cellular, right.  That was US Cellular.  I was a spokesperson for US Cellular and that was the first version of a cell phone if you can believe it.  My second favorite prize for winning Miss America besides the scholarship money was the convertible corvette I was given.  I loved, loved that car.  I even drove it for a while with the Miss America sign on the side until my father convinced me that was not safe and was setting me up to be assaulted in some way, exactly.  And then the photo on the right is the night I won, moments after I was crowned and I just like this photo because it's the behind the scenes shot.  Me looking out at the crowd, the steadycam operator following me down the runway as I go.  You can't see it well here but that's where I was doing that ugly smile that I could not control.  On the left is a snapshot of me on stage at the--excuse me.  A snapshot of me on stage at the Miss Arkansas Pageant as Miss America and I show you this photo because I competed unsuccessfully three times to become Miss Arkansas.  I could never win, I won the Miss Missouri Pageant and became Miss America and I was able to go back as Miss America to Miss Arkansas and that was quite a gratifying moment and kind of a, "Well how you like me now" kind of moment.  In the center is me, my retiring year as Miss America that was actually 1990 because I won in '89 although my title is 1990.  Gary Collins was the host so that was one of the official photos I think that went on the cover of T.V. guide.  And one of my duties as Miss America was to be an ambassador for the Children's Miracle Network, which provides funds for children's hospitals.  And so, I visited many hospitals that year and met a lot of sick kids that were fighting for their lives.  During Miss America, I met everybody who was anybody and these are just a few of the photos.  On the left, that's me and Clifton Davis.  I'm not sure who's on my left in that photo.  In the center photo, it's--I went to a taping of, 'The Cosby Show,' and this was in the Heyday of, 'The Cosby Show.'  So there's Phylicia Rashad, Bill Cosby and [HM] Jesse Jackson happened to be there that night as well.  And then this photo is of me and Oprah Winfrey.  I met her at [NAACP] The Image Awards, and as a result, she invited me to come be a guest on her show.  I have an interesting story about Jesse Jackson when I met him that night.  He said to me.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Do you want this on the record?
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it's fine, he said it and I've told it.  I've told it in public.  "Make sure there's some black people in your entourage.  Don't surround yourself with just white people." (laughter) Which I thought was that's interesting advice.  Okay on the left is a shot of me on the stage at the famed Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York.  I as Miss America got to go and I actually performed during amateur night and for anybody who's seen it, you know how raucous this crowd was and I literally begged them not to boo me and they didn't.  Not that I was that good, but they were merciful.  I went to a celebrity charity golf classic and there I am with Bryant Gumbel who I think was the host of this golf classic.  And then Vice President Ann Crowl.  And then on the right is [HM] Billy Davis [Jr.], the other half of [HM] Marilyn McCoo and myself.  On the left is my father, Fred Turner, Junior.  He was an infantryman in the Army and I believe this photo was taken in Vietnam.  One of his two tours of Vietnam.  This was a family photo mostly Turners, not all.  Starting on the top at the left is my mother, Gussie Turner, my dad's father, Fred Turner, Senior, then my father, then my first cousin, Earl Davey, My Dads sister, Freddye Sue Davey.  My dad's brother in law, Earl Davey.  On the bottom left is my cousin, we call her Sissy but her name is Sue.  And then my sister in the red and white stripes.  My mother's great aunt who raised her, Gussie Jones.  Me on her lap, then my father's mother, Ercerene Turner.  And I don't know who that one in the back over there is.  And then in the right photo seated on the left is again Gussie Jones my great aunt who raised my mother as her own.  One of my mother's cousins, Lucy Hall and then my mother's baby sister, Hattie.  Excuse me, my grandmother's baby sister, Hattie.  On the left is my mother's high school graduation photo.  She graduated from Kennett High School in Kennett, Missouri.  The middle is a photo of my mother, my sister and I.  I'm the younger one there.  And then on the right is, I don't know what the circa is on this but my mother, Gussie, she was Jones at the time.  On the left is me with President [George] H.W. Bush who was in office when I became Miss America and this is a meeting with him in the oval office.  And then this is an advertisement for a Lustra silk product.  The year after my year as Miss America.  I crowned an African American, one of her runners-up was African American and so they asked us all to be in this ad together.  That's Marjorie Vincent, myself and Marisol Montalvo.
Speaker 2: I'm just gonna pick a couple of these.
Speaker 1: Okay, if you need to take those out you can.  Is it easier?
Speaker 2: We'll try and hold them where you can see.
Speaker 1: All right on the left is a boyhood photo of my father, Fred Turner, Junior.  And on the right a folder when he--excuse me a photo when he was a young man.
Speaker 2: You know what's in here.  What would be represented?
Speaker 1: I think I printed out this photo.  Did you see this one?  Oh here it is.
Speaker 2: Okay. Right. Oh, you told me.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Again this is the Turner family.  I can't name everyone in the photo, but I spoke of Papa Kerry and Mama Lyla.  Papa Kerry is the gentleman in the center in the back with the hat, standing next to him is Mama Lyla.  Those are my great grandparents.  Over to the far right, the light-skinned woman holding a baby, that's my grandmother, Ercerene Turner my dad's mother.  And I believe she's holding my father.  And to her left, the tall dark gentleman is my grandfather, Fred Turner, Senior.  And then a myriad of my grandfather's siblings and their children.  And this was in 1934.  And I'm wrong, it's my Aunt Sue, my dad's sister that's in my grandmother's arms.
