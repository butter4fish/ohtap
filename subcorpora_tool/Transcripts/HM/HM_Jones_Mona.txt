Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) We're in Seattle, Washington, in my home.
Story_ID: 629060
Speaker 1: Before we go, go into depth, there are five, lightweight, People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone, and they only require a short answer.  The first question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think my favorite food might be chicken and dumplings.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Purple.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have lots, warm countries, water, probably in the Caribbean.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, one of mine: kindness is magnetic.  It draws out the best in others.
Story_ID: 629061
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Sylvester Lake] side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Pauline Evylyn Sims [Pauline Sims Lake].  Pauline, P-A-U-L-I-N-E, Evylyn, E-V-Y-L-Y-N, and then Sims, S-I-M-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Tennessee, in Jackson, Tennessee, and her birthdate--she was born in 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How, how far back can you trace her ancestors?
Speaker 2: Not very far.  Probably her grandpa.  And I only met my grandmother [Mary Bell], never was able to meet my grandfather [Eddie Sims], but I heard stories about them, but never having met them.
Speaker 1: Okay, but her great--her, her great-grandfather or your great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: My great-grandfather (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, is the one--is far back as you can go.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, what was his situation?  Was he--
Speaker 2: He was, had--owned a little piece of farm, owned a little piece of land he was given.  And so on his farm, he raised chickens and hogs and crops, and so he did pretty well in terms of being able to provide for the family.  Everybody would go to grandpa's because they knew that was a place they could be taken care of.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, he was your mother's grandfather on her father's side or mother's side?
Speaker 2: On her mother's side.
Speaker 1: On her mother's side, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  You know anything about any other ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: Her father was a Jones [ph.], and he was in Holly Springs, Mississippi.  And they were a large family, and still reside there in that Holly Springs area today.  We do have a family tree history that goes back to my grandfather, and it kind of doesn't do a very good job of telling what happened before him, just a little bit.  But we do have a semblance of a family tree.
Speaker 1: Okay, and it goes back to--
Speaker 2: To my great-great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: So that would put him in the 19th century sometime in the--after the Civil War or before?
Speaker 2: After the Civil War.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So there's no family stories about slavery or of the Civil War itself or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just, just kind of passed on stories that I'm not sure if they're even real because--
Speaker 1: Well, are there any?  I mean if there's one, tell it.  If it--
Speaker 2: They're, they're--
Speaker 1: --it doesn't make any difference if it--because we can't verify it now anyway.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But it's a story, you know, it was passed down through the family.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.  I, I actually can't even remember them except that mother would say to me the kinds of little rhymes that her great-grandfather would pass down.  I remember one.  It says, "I went to the river, couldn't get across, paid five dollars for the ol' gray horse."  And that came from her grandfather.  And I don't know where he got it, but I'm not sure, the stories that my mother remembers as a child were fantasy or whether they were real 'cause they were never told to me except through mom who wasn't real sure if everything that she was getting was accurate in terms of history.
Speaker 1: Well, it's not--as I said, it's a story.  You know, if it's a story, it's a story.  It doesn't make any difference if it's real or not.  If it's passed down in the family (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What I do hear from--what I did hear from my mother was that it was kind of a joyful time when they went to grandpa's and that there was a sense of comfort in being at grandpa's farm.  And she liked going there, and would get to go, spend every summer there with grandpa.  And so they would sit and tell various kinds of stories, and, and rhymes and, and I, I'm not certain that all of those stories were fantasy or real.  But mother enjoyed being there and liked listening to grandpa do those rhymes and sing those songs.
Story_ID: 629062
Speaker 1: What I mean by it not mattering is that, that if somebody wants to check the veracity of something in a historical document, you know, then they're free to try to verify it or falsify it.  You know what I mean, but--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --but in terms of us, when we tell the stories of our families, we should try to pass along the things that we think were passed along to us.  And if they, you know, they may not all be true.
Speaker 2: I really wish I had more stories to share.  There's a poem that I wrote, and it's called 'Vanished' [Mona Lake Jones] and it says, "An old man asked, 'Before you go, / Can I tell you some history I think you should know?' / The boy said, 'I'm in a hurry, on my way out to play. / Maybe tomorrow I'll hear what you say.' / A grandmother said, 'Come sit, my dear. / I have something I think you should hear.' / The girl over her shoulder stopped to chime, / 'Maybe tomorrow, I'll have the time.'" / And so it went and the years passed on. / And before they knew it, the old man was gone. / And the grandmother soon went away too / and took with her all the wisdom that she knew. / And when the boy and girl were older and grown / they wished for those stories, the old folks had known."  I kind of wrote that from my own sense of experience, wishing that I had more information, accurate or otherwise, to share about my history.
Speaker 1: Because if it, you know, one thing we do know is that if they shared it with us, it's something that came from them, you know, and that precedes us, whether they knew what they were talking about or not (laughter).  You know what I mean?  It's something that they've shared--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that's part of their belief or, you know, experience.  So, okay, so, now, your mother--oh, there's something you said here--now, this is very interesting here because we were talking to the Gaytons, well, [HistoryMaker] Carver Gayton the other day.  And we talked to Susan Woodson [HistoryMaker Susan Cayton Woodson] in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --who's related to--her grandfather [sic. great-grandfather] was Hiram Revels [Hiram Rhodes Revels] who was the president of Rust College [sic. Alcorn University; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, that's where--
Speaker 1: --the first black senator of Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And their family moved out here, and Horace Cayton, Sr. [Horace R. Cayton, Sr.] founded the Republican [Seattle Republican] newspaper out in Seattle [Washington].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And so Susan Woodson grew up out here.  She's in her eighties now in Chicago.  But she grew up out here.
Speaker 2: Well, that, that's where my family--that's where we have the family reunions is at Rust College, 'cause it's in Holly Springs [Mississippi] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was wondering if there was a Rust College connection or a Holly Springs connection in Seattle 'cause, you know, they did, those descendants of the Revels and the Caytons came out here--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --and were out here for many years and I just wonder if there's any connection to--
Speaker 2: No, not that I am aware of--
Speaker 1: --Holly Springs.
Speaker 2: --that there are any, there's a Holly Springs connection.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, these are two families with Holly Springs connections that actually lived in Seattle, so I just-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.  One came out before the other.  So--
Speaker 2: In fact, you're making me aware of that as we're speaking.  So that's something that I'd like to examine, see if there is a connection.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might be--
Speaker 2: Could be.
Speaker 1: --might actually be one.  So, thought I'd put that out there for the sake of whoever is watching this tape in the future.  They might be able to link the knots that we're not able to get.
Speaker 2: The Holly Springs connection is mostly on my, my mother's side.  And that is a place where my mother's father [Eddie Sims] grew up and so we have our family reunions there at Rust College.  And the situation with my grandfather and my grandmother [Mary Bell] is that they, they were never married, and so mother was in Jackson, Tennessee growing up there and grandfather was in Holly Springs growing up there with his other family.  And so there wasn't a connect until many years later, until the kids of my grandfather and my grandmother, who is the mother of Pauline Evylyn Sims [Pauline Sims Lake], got together.  And so they kind of found each other and we didn't do family reunions in that side of the family until probably about twenty years ago, after they connected and found each other.  And by that time, grandpa had deceased, and so that's the reason I think I never got to, got to meet him.  But it was a wonderful coming together and they are truly family and much appreciated.  But I didn't know them as a child, only as an adult.
Story_ID: 629063
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Pauline Sims Lake] have a chance to go to school in, in--
Speaker 2: Went to high school, graduated from Merry High School in Jackson, Tennessee, as did my father [Sylvester Lake].  In fact, they were childhood sweethearts and went to Merry High School in Jackson and then dad went on to Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a, that's a C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal] college, isn't it, I think.  Isn't it?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think Lane College, right.  I think the C.M.E. church runs that.
Speaker 2: Is it?
Speaker 1: I believe.
Speaker 2: And that would stand to reason 'cause dad was a Methodist as he was growing up.  But I think that was the college to go to if you lived in Jackson, and, and that might have prompted that more than anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your mother have any other stories of growing up that she shared with you that you think are important?
Speaker 2: She had stories to tell about being the daughter of the, of the town seamstress.  Her mother [Mary Bell] was a seamstress, and she sewed for lots of the people in Jackson.  And so they would come in and out of her home with their clothes to be made and fittings to be fitted, and so she got to meet a lot of different people as a young girl growing up in Jackson because of her mother's occupation.  And then she'd always talked about how much she loved going to the farm of her grandfather, because that's when she really felt a sense of belonging and comfort because she was at grandpa's farm, and there were so many wonderful things to do.
Story_ID: 629064
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sylvester James Lake [Sylvester Lake].  And it's S-Y-L-V-E-S-T-E-R, James, J-A-M-E-S, and Lake, L-A-K-E.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in 1914 in Bolivar, and he--
Speaker 1: That's Bolivar, Tennessee, yeah (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he went to school in Jackson [Tennessee] and met my mother [Pauline Sims Lake] when they were in grade school, both deceased in this past two years, mother just six months ago, and dad the year before.  And they were together for a very long time, since they were childhood sweethearts and then were married for sixty-eight years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you know anything about the ancestors on your father's side?  How far back you can trace those, that group (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can't go back as far with--well, actually, I can.  My father's side on the Lake side, they know that their slave masters were in Louisiana, some place in the Louisiana territory area.  And they were from--they had migrated from France.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting 'cause, you know, the C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal] church started in Louisiana, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And Lane, you know, a C.M.E. school.
Speaker 2: Oh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Kind of, might be a connection there.
Speaker 2: And my dad played football for Lane College [Jackson, Tennessee], and he was studying to be a pharmacist.  That's what his hope was, and then one summer, he read the newspaper and it said, people were needed to work to help build the Grand Coulee Dam in the State of Washington.  And so he hopped on a boxcar and came way west to the State of Washington to help build the great Grand Coulee Dam and never returned.
Speaker 1: So he hoboed basically, got on a boxcar--
Speaker 2: He did.  He hoboed on a boxcar to go west.
Speaker 1: That was common in those days.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: My dad talks about hoboing.
Speaker 2: Is that right?  (Laughter) Yeah, that was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Nobody had money to buy a ticket to come this far, so the next best thing was to do the hobo thing.  And he did it from Jackson, Tennessee to the State of Washington.
Speaker 1: That's a long trip.
Speaker 2: It was a very long trip.  And, but he doesn't talk about it in terms of anything other than it being an adventure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He doesn't talk about the weariness of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Does he talk about what happened--
Speaker 2: --or the hardness of it.
Speaker 1: --on the trip?  Are there any stories about what happened on the trip?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't even talk much about the trip itself, just about the wonder of the State of Washington when he got here, and the building of the dam and the differentness as compared to Jackson, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Now, did he finish Lane or did he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he never went back to finish.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Once he left that summer to, to work on the dam and began to make money, and sent for mother, and they got married, he never then went back to college, always thinking that he'd be doing that at some point in time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So for t- he did two years at Lane before he had that summer to go work in Washington.
Story_ID: 629065
Speaker 1: Now, he [Jones' father, Sylvester Lake] was married to your mother [Pauline Sims Lake] already by that time, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, is there any story about how they fell in love and, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a, he was a soda jerk in high school [Merry High School, Jackson, Tennessee] at the local fountain.  And she'd come in and he'd make her special concoctions (laughter) of various sorts.  And they fell in love, and were lovers for many, many years.  And they had such a wonderful love story because I tell you, they were the kind of models I'd guess that everybody would hope for in terms of parents.  It--there weren't many things that they didn't do without each other, and they had fun together.  They really loved each other, and you always knew that.  And so I was fortunate enough to have some really good models in terms of what a relationship could be like and how it could work and how you support each other and how you have bad times and good times and still hang together.  And maybe that's why my husband [Joe Jones] and I have been together for forty-five years, because I was kind of modeling what my parents showed me, fortunately.
Speaker 1: That makes sense.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That makes sense.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 629066
Speaker 1: So your father [Sylvester Lake] worked on the Grand Coulee Dam--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and now, what did he--what would he do after it was built?
Speaker 2: He--so once he helped build the dam, then they moved on up the road to Spokane, Washington, and he worked for Kaiser Aluminum [Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation], and he was one of the first African Americans to be superintendent, head of the construction, foreman for the work at Kaiser Aluminum.  And he drove those big cranes; he was a crane operator, and did that until his retirement.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we were never poor.  We didn't have a lot of money, but we were never poor, because dad always had a job that paid.  And, of course, he was in the union and all of those things that go along with being that kind of construction worker, and so we found ourselves very fortunate in that we didn't ever have to want for a whole lot.  Mom [Pauline Sims Lake] and dad had enough money to get what we needed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: While we had other friends, you know, who were on welfare and were struggling and all that, we never had to do that.  We felt very fortunate.
Story_ID: 629067
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' [Pauline Sims Lake and Sylvester Lake] personalities, their talents and their dispositions, and--who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Absolutely my father.  He was a poet.  He was the one who got me to start writing.  He would buy me poetry books for my birthday, and he would read to me, and dad was a, a speaker himself.  He was the grandmaster for the State of Washington and its jurisdiction as far as the Masons are concerned, and he would give great speeches and would memorize long passages of poetry and content in books and share those with me and practice them with me.  So I was mimicking my father, and he was really the one who taught me the appreciation for literature and the spoken word and the written word.  That all came from my father.  And his mother was quite a writer.  The mother--his mother, we called Grand Honey, and Grand Honey died when she was ninety-seven.  And up until her death, she would write these beautiful letters to me that were extraordinarily well written and thoughtful and poetic in their content, giving me advice on life and living up until her death.  So I think he probably got his talent from Grand Honey, and then his talent for writing and using words was passed on to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I thank him for that in each of the books that I've written.  I always say something in honor of my father as it relates to my talent for writing and using words.
Speaker 1: Now, did he have a favorite poet that he would read from or favorite group of poems that--
Speaker 2: He, he loved--I just think he liked everybody.  He did a lot of Langston Hughes.  He, he'd read a lot of Langston Hughes, and, and, but it wasn't just Langston.  It was just poetry in general, and I have books still that are anthologies that he gave me as a child.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was your Grand Honey's name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Mamie McKinney [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and I wrote a piece about her.  At first we tried, grandmother.  And then we called her Grandma, and then Nana, and then Grand Honey, and it just was so right.  You didn't even have to say how sweet she was, you knew it when you called her name.  And she was.  And what's fun now is that I'm Grand Honey now.  That's what my grandchildren call me, is Grand Honey.  I kind of took that from her.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's a tradition to pass on, I would guess (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, I think so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think so.
Story_ID: 629068
Speaker 1: Now, do y- did you live in the same neighborhood the whole--in Spokane [Washington] when you finally moved to Spokane?
Speaker 2: My neighborhood only changed as an adult.  We lived pretty much in the same house, in the same area as I grew up in Spokane, and mother [Pauline Sims Lake] and dad [Sylvester Lake] didn't move until after I had left on my way to college [State College of Washington; Washington State University, Pullman, Washington].  It was that they got a home in a different part of the city, but for the most part, I grew up in the same house and the same neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you kind of describe the neighborhood for us?  Was it all-black neighborhood or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, there was no such thing--
Speaker 1: --a mixed neighborhood?
Speaker 2: --in Spokane, Washington as an all-black neighborhood.  There weren't enough of us to make such.  But there was a section of town that most blacks were--I wouldn't say relegated to, but on the other hand, we kind of were because it was like any other city in that time.  You couldn't buy a house in particular neighborhoods.  It wasn't said, it wasn't spoken.  The realtor just wouldn't sell them to you or wouldn't show them to you.  So pretty much, most of us lived on the same end of town, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What end was that?
Speaker 2: It was on the south side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the, the neighborhood was mostly white, and it was a working-class neighborhood.
Story_ID: 629069
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I think the most vivid, vivid memory I have as a child is when I discovered I was black, and that people may look at me differently because of my blackness.  When I was in, probably about the first grade [at McKinley Elementary School, Spokane, Washington], kindergarten, first grade, I grew up in a neighborhood where nobody locked their doors and people could go in and out, and it--safety was not at that time thought to be an issue.  We played outside until it was dark, and you could play outside all day long and not worry about anything.  So we would go to each other's homes, and one little girl who was white came to my home every day and played, and she would ask me to go home with her, and my mother [Pauline Sims Lake] would always say, "No, I haven't met her parents."  And I thought that was always strange, but one day mother relented and said, "Okay," thinking that it was probably all right 'cause the little girl, Karen [ph.], had come to our home every day for a week or so.  So I went down the alley and went to Karen's house, and when we got there, her mother was at the screen door, and Karen yelled, "Mom, I brought Mona [HistoryMaker Mona Lake Jones] home to play."  And her mother looked and said, "Is this Mona? Is this whose house you've been playing at every day?"  And she pulled Karen through the screen and slammed the door.  And I remember going down the alley and coming in our backyard, and my mother was standing in the kitchen window.  And I saw tears start to come down her face.  And she had to sit me down and tell me that there were people who were not going to like me just because of the color of my skin, and she felt that she had failed me because she let me walk into that situation thinking that it was going to be all right.  And it was at that time that I realized that, kind of smacked with the reality that there were gonna be some people who would respond to me differently because of my color.  I can remember that.  I can actually remember the sense of hurt, mostly because my mother was so hurt and the look on her face.  That is vivid to me.
Story_ID: 629070
Speaker 1: There's another time that I--it's vivid in my mind as a child, and it again has to do with the reality of me understanding my blackness.  And that was when I was again, either kindergarten, first grade, they had us do self-portraits for our mothers for Mother's Day.  And we had flesh-colored paint to use.  And I clearly knew that that didn't reflect me, so I mixed up my own paint.  And I made it kind of toasty brown, and I was very proud of kind of how I'd been creative enough to do that.  And the teacher came around and she said, "What is this?  This is not flesh colored."  And she tore up my picture.  And so I, I went home and told my mom [Pauline Sims Lake] and my father [Sylvester Lake] what happened, and thankfully, they were the kind of parents who would go on my behalf.  And they went to the school and had a talk with the teacher, and they weren't boisterous or loud or anything.  They were always in a kind of education mode.  They would always try to help people understand.  Dad wasn't an angry person.  He was a thoughtful, articulate person who could go and have a conversation with you, and probably you'd feel badly after having spoken to him about whatever the subject might be (laughter) as it related to race.  And I got to do my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So he--
Speaker 1: --mine over again and make it look like me.  But I remembered that.
Speaker 2: What could the teacher's rationale be for you trying to make it look like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It wasn't the flesh color that she had put out there for everybody to use.
Speaker 2: So you should have tried to draw a picture of yourself looking like somebody else, but, without--
Speaker 1: I, but I, you see I'm talking about it, so I still remember it and, and what an impact it had on me because I was so proud of how I had reflected myself and how creative I'd been to have had it torn up, and she wanted me to start over.  And I was teary, and I remember I couldn't do it and went home to talk about it to my parents.  And I did get to make--and I still have that today, that.  When mother passed she had it in her dresser drawer, and I, and I brought it home with me.  I still have it.
Speaker 2: That is, that's, you know, I don't know.  It'd take a psychologist to really unravel what that teacher was thinking about.  I mean I don't--that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't know if it was not having followed directions or used what she had prepared or if she really didn't like the fact that I was painting myself other than the pink, flesh color.
Speaker 2: And we don't know now, I guess, but it's very strange, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't think I'll ever know.  But, yeah, that was, that was a significant childhood event.  Many of my childhood events really are around me discovering who I was and how people, other people, were viewing me.  I just had a difficult time trying to think that me being a nice person and being a person who was kind to other people wasn't enough and that it didn't matter how nice I was or how kind I was or how bright I was, how creative I was, some people didn't like me.  So that was a lesson I continued to learn.
Story_ID: 629071
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  What--can you kind of describe the neighborhood [in Spokane, Washington] you grew up in, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The neighborhood was working-class, mostly white, but there were black people who lived on the south end of town too.  So we knew how to get together.  I had a special friend named Freda [ph.], and Freda was my absolute best friend growing up, and she was very dark skinned.  And so kids would always, the white kids would always make fun and call her names, and I had many fights 'cause I'd have to throw down my bike and help Freda fight the battle.  So I got to be pretty adept at fighting battles on behalf of my friend, Freda.  It wasn't so much me, but because she was so different in color from the other kids in the neighborhood, she'd usually get some kind of comment made, and then we'd have to have a fight about it.  My sister, Sylvia [Sylvia Lake Finley], wouldn't be physical.  She'd always just get on her bike and keep rolling, but I'd always have to help out, help the situation physically so I got pretty good in the neighborhood.  And they got so they kind of didn't mess with us.  The positive stuff in that neighborhood though was that one of the smells I remember is that there was donut shop that wasn't far from our house.  And they would make the donuts every evening and my father [Sylvester Lake] would go down and get 'em hot, hot off the assembly line, and we'd have warm, glazed donuts and milk at night, and that was something that we always looked forward to.  It's a wonder I didn't turn out to be a big, fat person (laughter) because I ate so many glazed donuts (laughter) when I was little.  And neither of my parents were either.  I don't know how we managed to stay thin, you know, fairly thin with all the donuts that we ate.  Mother [Pauline Sims Lake] was a good cook, so in our kitchen there was always something--I wrote about, "Something was cooking in the big iron pot.  And I slipped in the kitchen and said, 'Mama, what you got?'  She said, 'Oh, it's special for you, baby, it's just what you need.'  I opened the pot and said, 'Ooh-wee, yes, indeed.'  It was my favorite chicken and dumplings, the kind you barely have to chew.  I was so tickled I hardly knew what to do," and it goes on.  But I wrote that poem because I remember the pot on the stove of the chicken and dumplings.  And actually, it could have been a lot of other things in that pot too that I could've written about because we always had a pot of something cooking on the stove.  And mother was a, a good cook, and so--and we didn't have any issues of not having enough money to buy the kinds of things that we needed to cook.  So we always had plenty to eat and the kitchen was this wonderful place to be.  I wrote about the kitchen.  I mean every, everything in, in my writings you'll see reflects the kinds of things that happened to me.  "It wasn't the greens simmering on the stove or the smell of canned strawberry jam or the pies cooling on the countertop.  It wasn't even the gravy being stirred to pour over the mashed potatoes.  It was love that filled our kitchen.  The kitchen was so full of love you could taste it when you licked the mixing spoon.  You could feel it through the hot pads when you took the cornbread from the oven" ['Love in the Kitchen,' Mona Lake Jones], and the piece goes on.  But that's about the kitchen that we had and the kinds of things that went on in the kitchen 'cause that was the central place in, in our home.  Folks didn't just cook in the kitchen.  They hugged and cried there, broken hearts and cut fingers were mended right in the kitchen.  It was a place to show off over the kitchen sink while you were washing dishes if you thought you could sing.  You know, lots of stuff went on in the kitchen.
Speaker 1: That's, you know, that's--well, it is poetry (laughter), so it's good.  It's (unclear) say, vivid description.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 629072
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little kid?  Were you outgoing or were you--?
Speaker 2: I was always outgoing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was smart in school, and took pride in being a really good student.  My parents [Pauline Sims Lake and Sylvester Lake] encouraged academics and we'd always have to get our schoolwork done and that kind of thing before we could play.  So I was rewarded for being a good student.  And I was always dramatic; I even took drama lessons.  I had a little dramatic scholarship that allowed me to go on Saturday mornings and learn how to recite and to perform.  So drama has kind of always been a part of me since I was, oh, grade school, junior high school because someone heard me speak one time at a Mother's Day tea, and then the person said, "If you'll come and study with me on Saturdays, I'll give you a scholarship."  And it was Miss Stevens' [ph.] drama school.  And so I went and learned how to, how to speak and how to recite poetry.  And I think that was very helpful to me to this day 'cause it kind of gave me a sense of, I can do that, which, you know, if you have the self-confidence, then it allows you to do a lot of things that you might otherwise try.  But she helped me with that.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your school, your first school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dorth- my grade school or the drama school?
Speaker 1: Grade school.
Speaker 2: McKinley [McKinley Elementary School, Spokane, Washington], I went to McKinley grade school and Libby Junior High School [Libby Center, Spokane Washington] and then on to Lewis and Clark High School [Spokane, Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was the name of your drama school?
Speaker 2: Dorothy Stevens School of Drama [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Dorothy Stevens--I assume she's white. But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I--she saw something in me and wanted to nurture it.  And if she were alive, I would be thanking her today.
Story_ID: 629073
Speaker 1: Were you excited about mo- movies or television when you were coming up?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) did you watch the performances in those?
Speaker 2: We, we got one of the first televisions in our neighborhood, a little round screen TV and fuzzy.  Folks would come to our house to look at it.  I can remember that.  Movies on Sunday afternoon, we'd all go after church on Sunday, in between church service and BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union of America].  And we would get a bag of Tastee [Tastee-Freez] hamburgers.  You got four for a dollar, and we'd get our little greasy bags and take 'em up to the Fox movie theater [Fox Theater, Spokane, Washington] and watch whatever movie it was on Sunday afternoon.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was kind of a tradition.
Speaker 1: Now, did they bother to segregate the movies here in Spokane [Washington]?
Speaker 2: No, not in Spokane.  You could sit wherever you wanted.  Very often we chose to sat in--sit in the balcony because we could eat our hamburgers and make noise, but it wasn't because we were relegated there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And we liked all kinds of movies, and, you know, there weren't movies with blacks as predominant characters so we watched Westerns and all such movies that were prominent at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and did you have a favorite actor or actress or--
Speaker 2: I don't even remember having a favorite.  I watched some of everything, I think, always wishing that I'd see somebody black in a movie and got so excited when they began to show themselves on television.  We'd get on the phone and call each other and say, "Turn on your TV.  There's a black person on," so and such.  I mean, it was a big deal.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know they said--my grandmother used to call us in and say, "Coloreds on."
Speaker 2: Yeah, coloreds on (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  We'd come in to see who it was, if it was Nat King Cole, Peg Leg Bates or whoever (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, exactly.  Oh, and when Nat King Cole got his weekly show?  That was something.  We watched that religiously, and anybody else who came on, black, we looked even if we didn't always like what we were seeing.  They were black so we'd watch.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they mean by--even if they were doing some stereotypical--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, right--
Speaker 1: --role or Stepin Fetchit or Willie Best or whatever, you know.
Speaker 2: --yeah, we'd watch just because--
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's better to see somebody than--
Speaker 2: Yeah, than not to see us at all.  So we, we knew when somebody black was on TV 'cause we would make sure that message was sent.  And folks would either come to our house--and then, pretty soon, everybody had their own TV.  But we were actually, were one of the first in our neighborhood to have a TV and were really proud that we had the TV (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, you grew up, I guess, during part of the Joe Louis era--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --fight era.  Do you remember the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absol- oh and my father used to be a boxer.  He was called Papa Lake [Sylvester Lake], and when he was down at Grand Coulee Dam, he'd do a little boxing.  And I, I remember that we had a little benefit for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] that just got started in Spokane, and dad and another man staged a boxing match to raise some money.  And he was called at that time when he boxed, The Lemon Drop Kid (laughter), and he gave, my father gave lemon drops to everybody.  He always had a pocket filled with candy to the time that he--of his death, he would--in fact, when we gave him his ninetieth birthday, there was a big sign that said, "The Candy Man."  He gave candy to everybody.  His candy of choice was lemon drops, and then, I don't know whether they stopped making lemon drops or he just decided to change.  He got some other wrapped candy later on that he would give away.  But dad was a boxer.  So we were interested particularly in Joe Louis and any other fight that was going on.  But we'd sit around the radio and, oh, have big time fight time and know who was fighting and who was going down and all such things as that.
Story_ID: 629074
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite teacher at McKinley [McKinley Elementary School, Spokane, Washington]?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I had some I liked a little more than others.  I had one that I didn't like at all, my fifth grade teacher.  She didn't like me.  She made it very difficult.  She was, she was prejudiced.  That's kind of what it amounted to, and I knew it, and she did all kinds of things to show me that.  I did have some teachers that--most teachers I liked.  I, I liked all of them with the exception of that one.  And they treated me fine.  The kindergarten teacher who made me tear up the picture and so forth, I don't even remember what her name.  But I remember having teachers who seemed to care about me.
Speaker 1: Okay, were there very many--well, I know there weren't many blacks, other black students in the class, but were there any at all when you were there?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You were the only one?
Speaker 2: I usually--in fact, I was always the only one in my class.  It seemed that there were other blacks in the school, but we were all in different classes.  My sister [Sylvia Lake Finley] was a year ahead of me.  So we didn't have classes together.  Freda [ph.] was a year behind me so we didn't have classes together, not until I got to junior high school [Libby Junior High School; Libby Center, Spokane, Washington] did I have another black in my class, and all the way through high school [Lewis and Clark High School, Spokane, Washington], I was generally the only one in my class.  And even as I went on to Washington State University [State College of Washington; Washington State University, Pullman, Washington], I was the only one in the class and never, ever in my life have I had a black teacher, not in junior high, not in grade school, not in high school, not in college, ever.
Speaker 1: Now, that's quite an--that's pretty isolating.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I feel very unfortunate not to ever have had a black instructor, ever, graduate school, never.  So I was always isolated in my education in terms of having others in the environment who looked like me or reflected me.
Speaker 1: Now, others have stated that, in terms of your peers, it didn't make that much difference until you get to be around eleven or twelve.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then there seems to be some sort of a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a cutting off of ties.
Speaker 2: That's about right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's about right.  Junior high school, where you start noticing that people are having parties and you weren't there, and we had parties and didn't invite them either.  It was kind of a separate, separate but equal in Spokane [Washington] because we all went to the same school.  But we'd often separate out when it came to social.  That's when you would notice it.
Story_ID: 629075
Speaker 1: And our church [Calvary Baptist Church] in Spokane [Washington] was the congregating place and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a social center for the--
Speaker 1: --it was the, it was a social center for all of my friends.  We either went to the Methodist church or the Baptist church, and some went to the Sanctified church, but church was the source of, of our social gathering as kids.  And then my father [Sylvester Lake] started an Orbit Club [ph.]; they called it the Orbit, he and two other men.  And they started this club so the kids could have some place to go on Friday and Saturday night, and they'd have a deejay and music and, oh, that was the place to be.  And I was so happy because my father was the one who had put that together.  So I think you had to pay twenty-five cents to come in.  And it wasn't a money maker.  He and his two friends didn't do it for the money at all.  Never was it intended to make money, just a source of a social outlet for the black kids in Spokane.  So we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sounds like such a nice gesture, I mean, just--
Speaker 1: Oh, it was wonderful.  I--and today, you can talk to kids who grew up in Spokane, and they will tell you that the Orbit was their source of salvation in terms of having an outlet that was healthy.  And you couldn't drink liquor in there, and, you know, there were things that you couldn't do, but I know that kids were going to the car and getting whatever kinds of stuff they felt they needed.  But we had the best time at the Orbit, and you could dance and karaoke wasn't in then, but whoever thought they could sing could get up and, to the microphone, and we had little quartets that would perform.  And it was a wonderful--I mean I have such, such fond memories.
Speaker 2: Now, you were coming along at the onset of rock and roll, right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Rock and roll was starting to hit and Chuck Berry and--
Speaker 1: Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley and (singing) "I found my thrill" ['Blueberry Hill'], Fats Domino, all those folks were, yeah.  And we sang, danced, had the best time.  I mean it was really quite wonderful, and I can smile every time I think about how much fun we had at the Orbit.  And then we were in Spokane and there was an airbase, Fairchild Air Force Base [Washington], and so lots of the young guys who would, who were stationed there, they'd come into town and dance, too on Saturday night at the Orbit.  So we had big fun.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We didn't miss not being included in some of the social activities at school that they were doing 'cause we had so much fun that it didn't matter that we weren't invited to particular fraternity and sorority stuff that was going on at our high school [Lewis and Clark High School, Spokane, Washington].
Story_ID: 629076
Speaker 1: Now, did you run for student office or anything like that in high school [Lewis and Clark High School, Spokane, Washington] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  I was always popular.  I had a sister preceding me, and so between the two of us, you know, student body president or--let's see.  I was student body secretary.  "Don't make a mistake.  Vote for Lake."  That was the slogan that we used in all the campaign literature, recycled from my sister who preceded me and was an officer of this, that and the other, uh-huh.  We were popular because we were, I think we were nice people.  We were well liked.  We were smart in school, and since we were one of, you know, a handful, many kids knew us, and so it wasn't too hard to get elected to whatever office you chose to--I don't think I was voted the friendliest girl in school, but I believe my sister was.  I can't remember, but if she didn't get it, I got it.  And it was kind of fun to be able to be a leader in school.  So both of us, my sister, Sylvia [Sylvia Lake Finley], and I were both school leaders.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were there any high school teachers that really were instrumental in your development or took a keen interest in you?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I can say that I had teachers who were, who were nice to me and encouraging, but I also had teachers who were just the opposite, who were not, not nice, not supportive, would make it very difficult for, for me as a student.  And I, I knew I had to work around them, work in spite of them, succeed, because I knew I needed to even though they didn't care that I did.  I, I have--I always think that we, as blacks, have antennae, and they get more refined as we get older, and we can kind of read situations and read the verbal and nonverbal messages that people are sending to us.  I got pretty good at it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I guess when you were on the verge of graduation--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --now, did you work for the school paper and did you write for the school paper or anything when you were there?
Speaker 2: No, I never did write for the school paper?
Speaker 1: Did you enter any poetry contests or writing contests in high school?
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: Never?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I was never validated as a writer in high school.  In fact, when I would write, very often, I would try to be writing from an African American perspective or at that time, colored perspective, and teachers often read it as if it didn't have value or they didn't understand or weren't sure why I would even wanna write about it.  So I got my validation from my family and church [Calvary Baptist church, Spokane, Washington] and little black community Spokane [Washington], but not from school.  I was never thought to be a, a particularly good writer, because teachers often didn't understand why I chose the subjects that I did or had the viewpoint that I had.  So I didn't get that kind of validation, not from school.  But I did get it from church and my mother's Wednesday art club and my parents [Pauline Sims Lake and Sylvester Lake].
Speaker 1: So she had a Wednesday art club, did she (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they had a Wednesday art club, and they had wonderful teas and they would do everything to bring art to the community that was, hopefully, by African American artists and writers and anything that they could find that they could value as art that was done by African Americans, they celebrated it.  And then they would just do art things themselves.  They would do flower arranging; they would do quilting; they would do things that they felt artistic, so they had a little black women's Wednesday art club, and they'd have a tea, and I would always speak at the Wednesday art club functions.  I would recite poetry and get validated.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, the community gave you the, you know, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --the sense that you could write and create and--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and put together something.  Okay.
Speaker 2: That's where it came from.
Speaker 1: Okay. So when you were senior then, did you know what college you were going to, since you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I thought I was going to go to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] because my parents were from Tennessee.  But at the last minute, I got a little frightened to go that far away from home so I went on down the road to Washington State University [State College of Washington; Washington State University, Pullman, Washington], which was about an hour away.  I always wondered if I made the right decision, because I got down there, and for one entire semester, I was the only black woman on the campus.
Speaker 1: Now, this is 1957.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1957 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, we'll--
Story_ID: 629077
Speaker 1: We're talking about Washington State University Cougars [State College of Washington; Washington State University, Pullman, Washington]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you're, you're the only black Cougar (laughter).
Speaker 2: I know.  I'm probably the oldest living black Cougar (laughter).  There weren't many of us in--when I was there.  One semester, I was the only black woman on the entire campus, and there were always some black men on the campus because they played sports.  So they came in to play basketball and football and so forth.  So there were men and no women, and I was always very popular because I was the only one.  And at that particular time, they weren't dating white girls, so I had to be everybody's date for the prom, for the dormitory dance, for the whatever.  I was it.  And the girls in the--my dormitory always thought I was so popular.  It wasn't really that.  It was that I was the only choice (laughter) that they had.  And it sounds like it would be really fun, but it wasn't always because I could never be serious about anybody because I had to be everybody's date.
Speaker 1: Now, that's an interesting burden to have, you know, to have to be everybody's date--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and never, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I never could have a serious relationship.  Not that I needed one, but if I had wanted one, I couldn't have done so and still been able to be everybody's date for their various parties and dances and so forth.
Speaker 1: Kind of duty dating in some way.
Speaker 2: Duty dating (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I never thought of it like that, but that's kind of what it was.  And I, I was glad to see a couple more come onto campus so it could spread around a little bit.  And, and fortunately, or unfortunately, the University of Idaho [Moscow, Idaho] was only ten miles away.  And they had black men going to school down there for the same reason.  They had come in to do sports and there were no black women on that campus.  So I had to go to Idaho and be the date for some of them as well.  So I, I had fun.  It was a, it was a fun time.  I never was without anything to do, and they were ha- thankfully, nice guys.  So it wasn't all bad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was okay.
Story_ID: 629078
Speaker 1: Now, you were a cheerleader in high school, right?
Speaker 2: No, I was a drum majorette.
Speaker 1: Drum majorette in high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was the head drum majorette.
Speaker 1: All right, the head drum majorette.
Speaker 2: Head drum majorette.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So I twirled the baton and marched out in front of the band, and it was a fun, fun thing to do.  I played the clarinet in the band as well, but I never was very good at it and didn't take it to be a serious instrument for me.  But I did twirl the baton.  So we had tryouts and I tried out and I was the best one.  So I got to be the head majorette for the marching band.  And so I'd go on the festivals and the parades and I'd be the leader of the Lewis and Clark marching band [Lewis and Clark High School, Spokane, Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you continue at Washington State [State College of Washington; Washington State University, Pullman, Washington] with that?
Speaker 2: No, and when I got to Washington State, then I was on the, the Cougarettes, the dance team.  There were twenty of us, and we performed for the basketball games and for the football games, and it was kind of a dance, I guess they called it a dance marching group.  There were twenty girls that tried, you tried out and you were selected, and you got to be--it was kind of a honor to be a Cougarette and wore little short skirts, and we danced and so forth.  So that's what I was when I got to Washington State University.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was your major?
Speaker 2: I started off--and I was gonna be a dietician.  I'm not really sure why.  But for some reason I, I thought everybody's gonna be a teacher.  I wanna be something different from being a teacher.  And I had had success in home economics classes in high school and that, and there was a home economics teacher who really took me kind of under her wing in high school.  And I think that may be how it led me to think I could be a dietician.  But I took chemistry and, and I think I, I did okay.  And then I had to take Chemistry 102.  Then I had to take organic, and then I had to take inorganic, and as the chemistry classes proceeded, I got worse and worse instead of better and better.  And there were more classes yet to come, and I thought uh-oh, maybe this is not gonna be (laughter) the best avenue for me.  And I thought, I'll be a teacher.  So then I went into education courses, and, and that was, it was fine and really quite frankly, it was a much better fit.  I don't think I would like having been a dietician.  I spent a summer in Spokane [Washington] under the wing of a dietician, working at a hospital.  And it wasn't that good of a summer.  I didn't particularly like what I was doing, and, nor did I think that that hospital environment as a dietician was gonna be what I--was a good fit.  I was much better with kids and teaching people and sharing that talent that I had for writing.  So it turned out to be a better choice, but the choice was, because I was not doing so well in all of those science classes.  And I think it was because my heart wasn't there.  I mean I just didn't care that much about it.  So I started on the education path, and I graduated with a bachelor's in education.
Story_ID: 629079
Speaker 1: Now, were there any teachers there that were particularly helpful and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a teacher who was the--I had a little music scholarship, and the music teacher was--he was very helpful to me.  But I had dreadful, a couple of teachers that impacted me, I think more than did he.  One teacher in one of the classes that I took was clearly not in my corner, and he was kind of curious of how I got there, and why I was there.  And when we took our final exams, I had done really well, but we took our exams, and he was a--it was a exam, and I noticed when I finished, I was kind of finished before everybody else.  But I, I was--I had studied hard so I thought, well, I guess I'm just wise.  And I looked around and I walked up and gave the professor my paper.  And he kind of had this smirk on his face when I handed it to him.  But I wasn't really sure of what that was about.  And when we got our tests back it was a big red, F for failure on my paper.  And I was just, I was mortified, and I looked at the paper.  I didn't see anything that was wrong, and it got to the last page, and there was a whole page, about thirty questions, true and false, that was--there was nothing filled in.  And then I looked at the exam, and you could see where the staples had been pulled out, and put back in it.  And so he had stapled the, the last page of questions on after I had turned my test.  And so I failed.  I was totally mortified.  And then another teacher at Washington State [State College of Washington; Washington State University, Pullman, Washington] gave me my exam back, again, nothing was wrong on it.  But there was a fail.  And he said, "You cheated."  And I said, "How, how did, how did I cheat?"  And he says, "I saw you when you cheated, and if you wanna talk about it, you can go to the head of the department."  And that I did, and the head of the department had already been prompted by my teacher and said, "Yes, I understand you cheated."  And I said, "No, I, I--," it was a music class, and I was on a music scholarship.  And it was Music 101.  It wasn't even a difficult--I mean, there was no reason for me to even think about cheating had I needed to.  But I had no help from chair of the department, and I got a D in that course, in Music 101.  I'll never forget because the instructor said that I cheated.  And, you know, those are really heartfelt kinds of things.  I mean they just impacted me and--'cause there was nothing I could do about it.  I mean I, I was, I was on my own.  And there was not an ear to listen, and there was not a black student union.  There was not a black support group.  There were not people I could go to.  The very people that I was to go to were already convinced that I had done something wrong by the professor. And so I had a kind of difficult few times, but I survived.  And I probably am a stronger person because of it.  It, it gave me an understanding, again, the same kind of lesson that I learned as a kindergartener, as a first grader.  There are some people who are going to treat you differently because of your color.  And sometimes I forgot that, and I thought everything was okay.  And then I'd get smacked by that reality, and I did again at Washington State.  But I made it, and, in spite of.  And I think I am a stronger and more realistic person.  I never let it, I never let it get me so that, such that I was dysfunctional or depressed, but only for a moment.  I always seemed to bounce back, and I attribute that resiliency to my family and my community, people who would continue to tell me, "Mona [HistoryMaker Mona Lake Jones], you're okay," and "Mona, girl, you got it going on."  I'd get enough of that, that it would undo some of those messages that I would get from those people who didn't want me to succeed.
Story_ID: 629080
Speaker 1: How did you do in the education department [at the State College of Washington; Washington State University, Pullman, Washington]?  I guess you did fairly (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did okay, yeah.  And, and I, I had to balance out, you know, those grades that I would get because of those circumstances that I just shared with you.  I'd have to work very hard, harder than I probably needed to, to prove that I was deserving of being there and that I was bright, and that I could make it and all those other things.  But really, again, I had a wonderful, wonderful family that said, "Girl, go head," you know, "No, don't pay that any mind.  There're gonna be some other people out there who are gonna think you're grand."  And there were, and there were enough of 'em to know that those were peculiar kinds of people.  And I ended up, as I reflect on it, feeling kind of sorry for them because they had to spend a lot of time to be as manipulative and wrongdoing as they were.  That took some effort and some planning, and, and who would want to spend their efforts doing something like that, trying to put somebody down and make sure that they weren't successful?  I can't even imagine using my energy like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a sad world sometimes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: People--but nobody ever tried to--there was never a teacher that tried to do that in grade school or high school [Lewis and Clark High School, Spokane, Washington]?
Speaker 2: No, I had, I had to say--I, I don't wanna be negative, but, you know, being the only black person in an environment, yeah, I, I came up against high school teachers who did things and grade school teachers.  I--and I never had a black teacher.  So I, I, I'm just, you know, kind of envious of those kids who went to all-black schools, maybe where teachers wanted you to succeed and made you succeed and hoped that you succeeded and expected you to succeed.  I had more, I had many who didn't expect me to and maybe not so much didn't want me to, but maybe didn't expect to me to.  It was--I always found myself in situations where people would say (gasps), "You are really, you really," like they were surprised that I could talk and walk and (laughter) and be normal like every other person.  In fact, I had a young woman in my dormitory come up to me one day and say, "Mona [HistoryMaker Mona Lake Jones], you are really nice.  I know you really are," she said.  (Laughter) And I was like, I don't know what she thought a black woman was supposed to be like or what her stereotypical understanding of how blacks were, but she was just genuinely, genuinely impressed that I was a nice person.  And I couldn't get angry at her for it because she was just expressing what she was feeling (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She was sincere (laughter).
Speaker 2: She was very sincere.
Story_ID: 629081
Speaker 1: It was like my massage therapist one day said to me, "Mona [HistoryMaker Mona Lake Jones], I am so happy that there aren't, you know, that they don't have prejudice in Seattle [Washington]."  And I was just--I think my body must have gone stiff because I was like, "What?"  And I thought, no, I've spent my money here to get this massage.  I'm not gonna spend it trying to educate you to the reality that, yes, it exists in the City of Seattle as well.  But she was really sincere.  I mean she just couldn't imagine that there were people who were, you know, who were prejudiced or racist in the City of Seattle.  And so she was saying that in great confidence, "I'm so happy, Mona, that it's not here that you--," you know, with, but, okay, (laughter) all right.  There's a line in one of my books, and it talks about what you do when racism and sexism and all those other -isms raise their ugly heads.  And it says, "M-mm-mmm, should I demonstrate, tolerate, educate, negotiate or just kick ass" ['The Color of Culture,' Mona Lake Jones]. I mean, and that's the reality of what we do, is, you know, what do we do when it happens?  Do we take the time if we see a glimmer of hope to educate that person or do we just tolerate it or do we negotiate so that we can work together or be together and get this job done even though you're not respecting me or liking me.  And when I say kick ass, I don't really mean physically.  I mean sometimes that is what happens, but I mean, do I get you back for what you just did?  And there are all kinds of ways to do that.  I went into one of the university classrooms, and they had that on the board.  And they spent the entire hour examining that, that little saying and discussing what it meant and how were, how were people responding to the notion of assimilating and negotiating and all of that and what kinds of ways can you kick ass.  And it was fun to see how they were interpreting what I had written.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's all true.  Those are the options.
Speaker 1: And my contention is that you have 'em all in your pocket, and you learn how to pull the right one out to fit the right occasion.
Speaker 2: So have there been occasions where you had to use each one of those?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, absolutely, not physical for many, many years or since my friend, Freda [ph.], way back when we were seven and eight years old.  I'm not a physical fighter person, but I have done it in another way or two, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I think it's a skill that, that we need to teach our kids to--how to, how to use all of those because you're gonna have to at some point pull it out and, and use it.  Hopefully, you choose the right one.
Speaker 2: Okay, so there's all situational, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 629082
Speaker 1: Any highlights of your four years at Washington State [State College of Washington; Washington State University, Pullman, Washington] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Washington State?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was a really good education.  It was one where I, I always wished there were more of us.  When I say more of us, more African Americans.  I would have to come back to Spokane [Washington] to get hair done and have to get reinforcement from home because I didn't have a support group down there.  So I always longed for a few more of us.  I think that was my greatest wish while I was there.  But I knew I was getting a good education, and I was in all of those activities and doing all those normal kinds of things.  But I was really glad to have graduated and had an opportunity to move on to something else.  I was really ready to leave Pullman, Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you graduated in, let's see, that'd be '64 [1964]--
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 1: Sixty-one [1961]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and where did you go?  Did you enter (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then I, then I--
Speaker 1: --the workforce or did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I came over to Seattle [Washington].  I literally went from Pullman to Seattle and have been here ever since, since 1961.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I meant--now, you graduated from high school [Lewis and Clark High School, Spokane, Washington] in '57 [1957], is that it?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, then from Washington State University in--
Speaker 2: In '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: --nineteen sixty-one [1961], and then you came right here, back to Seattle.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And started teaching in the public schools here?
Speaker 2: I started teaching in Bellevue, Washington which is a suburb of Seattle.  And, honestly, I found myself being a really good teacher.  I think I was a really good teacher, and, and they were all-white students.  And I thought well, now, wait a minute.  I, I'm a talented teacher.  I need to share this talent with some African American kids, so I left Bellevue, which at that time was the highest paying school district in the State of Washington and was, it was kind of a caveat if you got hired in the Bellevue School District.  I left Bellevue and came into Seattle, and started teaching in the inner city.  And that's where I stayed as a, as an elementary teacher and loved being a model and an advocate and a teacher of African American kids.  They weren't all, but there was a predominance of them.  And I liked it very much.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what's the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Martin Luther King Elementary [Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School, Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was it--what was it--it was named something else, I guess, when you started (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was named Harrison [Harrison School, Seattle, Washington]--
Speaker 1: Harrison.
Speaker 2: --after Harrison [President Benjamin Harrison], and, and the kids changed the name shortly after I left.  And, and it was interesting that my son [Brent Jones] went to school there, and he was the, in the first grade class that went down to testify before the city--school council, the school board, to get the name of Harrison changed to Martin Luther King.  And I thought, isn't that a small world, how it came around that I was there, and then he was there as a student and was part of that movement.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is King--is this elementary school or--
Speaker 2: Elementary school, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 629083
Speaker 1: So, now, this is the first time you've lived in a predominantly black environment, I guess, or, or, or, or worked in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I never have lived in a predominantly black environment (laughter).  I mean Seattle [Washington] is not the metropolis of blackness either, but it is blacker than any environment I've been in.  And, and it's, and it's, it's really--I know people have, have had conversations with me because I write about, you know, appreciating and celebrating being an African American.  And they often ask me questions about, "How did you get to have the mindset that you do having been raised in an environment that was mostly not you and not reflecting you?"  And I'm not--I always have difficulty answering that question, and, again, I go back to my family.  They made me like who I was and appreciate my color and my heritage and my history.  They did all of that for me, and I, and I really thank them.  They taught me that to be black and to be a woman was the best possible combination you could ask for.  I mean, and I really believed that.  And they taught me that I was beautiful and I believed that.  I mean way before, black is beautiful, they were, you know, instilling that in me.  And I--and it caught with me, and I believed it and so I was able to shrug off and let go and find still value in my being, even though I was sometimes not being validated by others in that environment I found myself.  So I always knew I had to do better.  I had to do more.  There's a poem that says, "Being the mother of a black child, it ain't no easy thing. / You gotta call on Jesus and listen to the angels sing." And I--the poem goes on to say, I have to help folks understand when I go to school, "how smart black / children are, and expect them not to fail, but help them reach up for a star" ['Being the Mother of a Black Child,' Mona Lake Jones].  And that's what kind of my parents did.  And then I found myself doing that for my children.  I'd go to school and when I'd have a sense that they weren't expecting them to be successful, weren't expecting them to achieve, weren't expecting them to be stars, I'd go to the school and have a nice conversation just like my mother [Pauline Sims Lake] and father [Sylvester Lake] did and help them with that.  My son [Brent Jones] got a, a C on a physics test one time.  And he was so disappointed.  And he was so upset that he had not done as well as he had thought.  And the teacher was surprised that he would be, you know, upset that he had not gotten anything better than a C.
Speaker 1: What, she thought his expectation was lower, was lower (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she thought--
Speaker 1: --for himself?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.  She thought, well, that was good.  Why would you be upset about that?  And I went to school and helped her with it, you know.  I found myself, I think I have a little education gene in me 'cause I, all my life I've been trying to help educate people to many realities about African Americans.  I get a little tired of it sometimes, but most of the time, I'll take that position and go ahead and try to help you if I think that there's a possibility that I can dissuade your stereotypical understanding of who we are--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I'll try.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your parents introduce you to black history and that sort of thing--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --when you were coming along?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: They had books and--
Speaker 2: They had books.  They--whatever books they could find, and there weren't a whole lot.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know there were some available, yeah, Woodson [Carter G. Woodson], and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they had J.A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers] and others, other people were writing.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  We--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --my dad had all of those.  And he would read them--he was a reader.  Oh, my dad was a reader.  And he would share all of that information with us.  So we knew, we had a sense of history.  And we certainly didn't get it in school.  The on- only thing I ever got in school was George Washington Carver and the peanut and, you know, a few little, but nothing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That seems to be like the only one that everybody got.
Speaker 2: Latched on to, yeah.
Speaker 1: Everybody was taught about George Washington Carver--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --it seems.  But that's about it.
Speaker 2: And, and that was, that was about it.  That was the predominant figure that I got as a student was--I think that he was the only one that they ever really included.  And, of course, we know there's so much more.  So what I got was from home and from, from church [Calvary Baptist Church, Spokane, Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was it.
Story_ID: 629084
Speaker 1: So you taught at Harrison [Harrison School; Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School, Seattle, Washington] or through the time that--were you there through the time that it changed to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --Dr. King?  Okay.
Speaker 2: No, then I had moved on, and I was teaching by then in the, I think I was in graduate school and then went on to teach in the college and university and never went back to teaching elementary school.
Speaker 1: Now, you moved through graduate school, but it was like--it wasn't direct.  It was like--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --at first you went and got a master's [degree]--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --I mean you went for your master's.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And where did you go for your master's?
Speaker 2: To the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I came here, and then I got, I got married [to Joe Jones], and started having kids.  And once they kind of got into school, I said, "Oh, oh, I think I'll go to get my master's degree."  And then once they got into kind of high school, I said, "Oh, oh, I think I'll go get my doctorate."  So I spaced, I didn't go from, you know, from undergraduate [State College of Washington; Washington State University, Pullman, Washington] to graduate.  My, I--there were spaces in between.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and I think I was a good model for my kids [Brent Jones and Dana Jones Walker] in terms of getting an education and understanding that education is continuous, and you're never too old to, to learn, and there, there's a piece in one of my books.  It says, "Stand back and watch me / I'm just getting ready to unfold! / I decided to let my spirit go free / I'm ready to become the woman I was meant to be. / You see I've either been somebody's daughter, mother, wife / Now, it's time for me to take charge of my life" ['Getting Ready to Unfold,' Mona Lake Jones].
Story_ID: 629085
Speaker 1: We had you finishing your master's degree.  And you finished at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --right?  Now, we're not missing any story, are we?  We're not speeding past a good part of the story?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: And you talked about your volunteer activities with the church, the Black Child Development Institute [Black Child Development Institute - Seattle, Seattle, Washington].  Are they before you got the Ph.D. and master's?
Speaker 2: Before and during.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: All happ- kind of happened in there, smoodged in there together.
Speaker 1: What's it called, the Ethnic School [Mt. Zion Ethnic School, Seattle, Washington] or something at your church (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there, there was a time where I spent every Saturday for five years as a matter of fact.  There were a number of kids in the city who I felt really needed to have an opportunity to be immersed in their culture and, and understand who they were and like who they were, appreciate who they were, and that the public schools or the private schools, for that matter, weren't necessarily doing a responsible job of that.  Or maybe it wasn't even their place to have to do that, but nonetheless.  So I helped start the Saturday Ethnic School, and what we did every Saturday was we would study black history.  We would read literature by black authors.  We had courses that I thought important for our children in, in grammar and assertiveness, learning how to look people in the eye and to ask questions and, and to kind of assert themselves in a way, not aggressive, but to stand up and, and be able to be counted.  So that I was able to get a group of professionals together and we would work with the kids every Saturday.  We wrote a grant and got money for computers, and so we had computers that the kids could check out and take home with them over the week so mom and dad and everybody could kind of get a sense of what this computer thing was about.  And we had a computer lab and we had a math lab, so that they could get tutoring.  They could bring in their work and get tutored.  But everybody in the Ethnic School was black; the cook was black, the teachers were black, the environment was black, and it was the first time that many of these kids had been in environments where they could see all these models that were successful and were liking them and nurturing them.  And it was a wonderful school, and we'd have about a hundred and some kids every Saturday.  And I did that for about five years.
Speaker 1: Now that--now, how did it come about?  You were one of the founders, but there were other, other parents that felt the same way?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know that other parents felt the same way.  It wasn't as a--much as a parent as it was an educator.  There were two of us who were educators who kind of started it, and the convincing of parents that their children needed it wasn't, wasn't very hard.  I mean we told 'em what we had and they came.  And a lot of biracial kids who are in Seattle [Washington] needed to have that side of them examined and celebrated.  And so we found we had a lot of kids from, from those kinds of backgrounds.  But it was a loving environment.  We would even, we'd eat family style so that the cook would cook the meal so that we would have--ate at a table and we'd have to pass the food and learn the forks and the knives and the, and all of that kind of stuff.  We tried very hard to do everything we thought that the kids needed to have a sense of family, a sense of caring and to leave there with some new information in their heads that would be helpful to them.
Story_ID: 629086
Speaker 1: Now, what year was this that you started?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was in the '70s [1970s], '80 [1980]--let's see, '80s [1980s], in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: So it started up in the '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So '80 [1980] to, '80 [1980]--
Speaker 2: About ten, about '81 [1981] to, somewhere in there.  You know, the years start smoodging in there together.
Speaker 1: But for five years you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, for five years, I did that.  And I--
Speaker 1: Now, this is similar to, similar to what goes on in Jewish temple.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Jewish kids go to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --Friday nights, they go to--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And I went to school with Jewish kids, and they would tell me about what they did.  They learned language, history, culture and mythology--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --of the Jews.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's, that's kind of the model that we, that we used.  I, I really wasn't, at the time, aware that that's how they were doing it, but since then, I've learned that they were kind of doing the same thing we were.  And it, it didn't devalue anything else they were doing.  It just gave 'em another layer of: "I like myself, I'm proud of myself, I have a history," and "I'm valuable."  That's, those were the messages that we were trying to get.  And we really wanted them to see others who were like themselves, and who were like them, being successful.
Speaker 1: I think people probably--and I've heard people say, you know, "Why should I study about being black?  I'm black already," like, as if to say if I was a tree, I would know about a tree 'cause I'm a tree already or something.  But it's--but people say that kind of thing, but it's not necessarily true in every black family.  I mean every black family that you knew wasn't doing what your parents were doing, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely not.  And, and you know, I, I looked at the fact that my children [Brent Jones and Dana Jones Walker] were so successful in what they, their life paths, their choices, ad so many of their friends were not.  And I tried to think, why were they successful and their friends not?  And it really came down to the family, whether the family was there to answer the questions, to be there when things went wrong, and then I think about how many kids we raised besides our own.  We were always--my husband was always at somebody else's basketball game and cheering for being there because their dad wasn't or they didn't have a dad in the house.  And so Joe [Joe Jones] would do it.  And we always had other kids living at our house, besides our own for whatever circumstances they found themselves in.  So I know that the parenting that kids get is so incredibly important as to whether or not they're gonna be successful.  Now, some kids make it in spite of, but it's so much easier for them when they have parents who are able to be there and support them and nurture them.  So I recognized that, and I knew that was missing in a lot of kids.  So how could I help them find value in themselves?  And one of the ways was the, you know, was the Saturday Ethnic School [Mt. Zion Ethnic School, Seattle, Washington].
Story_ID: 629087
Speaker 1: But then I was president of the Black Child Development Institute [Black Child Development Institute - Seattle, Seattle, Washington] and that was a whole 'nother layer of my recognizing that our kids needed special attention.
Speaker 2: Now, tell us about the Black Child Development Institute?  Is that a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, it's a national group--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and it just happens to have an affiliate here in Seattle [Washington].  And so we advocate for black children as, in the school system.  We're there with parenting.  We're there with foster care.  We're there in the social welfare system.  We're advocates for black children.  And so it's a busy organization, still working very hard today in Seattle to address the needs of African American children.
Speaker 2: Now, is that the group that was founded or, or helped--it was established, I guess, in part, by [HistoryMaker] Useni Eugene Perkins?  Is that the same group?
Speaker 1: No, Evelyn K. Moore--
Speaker 2: Evelyn? Okay.
Speaker 1: --in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] founded this group.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then most of the major cities have a, a group, a Black Child Development Institute in existence now.
Speaker 2: Now, when did you get involved with Black Child Development Institute?
Speaker 1: Right after the Ethnic School [Mt. Zion Ethnic School, Seattle, Washington] as I kind of gave reins to that to someone else, I, I moved to the Black Child Development Institute.
Speaker 2: So this is the early '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And did that for a few years as well.  I've always been an advocate, particularly to, for African American children and youth.  I think my whole kind of emphasis has been on caring about and caring for black children.  I mean that's been the thrust of my volunteerism.
Story_ID: 629088
Speaker 1: Even as I am moved into the Seattle Links chapter [The Links, Incorporated], I chaired the services to youth portion, and I recognized that our kids weren't passing the SATs, and I thought, why aren't they passing the SATs?  They're bright.  Why, why are they finding that so difficult?  So I got some black men and they were the black engineers in Seattle [Washington], and set up a Saturday series.  Come in and learn how to take the SAT exam.  So I did that for, I don't know, five, six, seven, eight years, helped kids pass that SAT.  And I went out and found volunteers who would come in and do that, particularly, with the math I wanted to have some black males there.  So I went to the black engineers' organization and they would come in and teach the math portion.  And then I just had some teacher friend women who taught English and so forth, and they'd come in and do the language part.  And we did that on Saturdays to help kids pass that exam.  Some of my kids, my, my children, my very own children, their friends couldn't get their scholarships to college, to play ball or whatever it was they were about because they couldn't pass that SAT exam.  And I thought, now, that is really a tragedy that an exam like this is keeping them from being a recipient of a scholarship.  So every time I found a kind of an area of need, I've kind of wedged myself in there in some sort of way and tried to give back by using my either influence or my skill or my talent.  And it's mostly been directed at, at black youth.  My husband is the same way.  He has always helped me or started his own endeavor to kind of--so, so that's been our focus.  I, I think we realized we've been fortunate, and we wanna share that and one of the ways we know we can do it is with young people.  So we found ways to--I know my kids were, my very own children [Brent Jones and Dana Jones Walker], again, were--we were trying to find something to do one Saturday and looked in the newspaper, and there was a track meet going on, all-city track meet.  So I said, "Oh, let's go look."  So we got in the car and we went to the track meet, and it just so happened, it was an open meet that day, and kids could run.  You didn't have to be in a club.  So mine got out there and ran and they dusted everybody.  And it was like, they didn't even have the right stuff on or anything, and they came over and said, "Who, who's their coach?  Who, who did they run for?"  Well, we weren't running for anybody.  And so, so my husband said--there were some kids who wanted to run, and he bought 'em track outfits and, you know, and organized them, the South Central Athletic Association.  And my kids ran their way right on through the university.  I mean they got scholarships on track and, and my daughter set a, a national record in the 4 x 100, you know, relay, and I--you know, and that just, was happenstance.  So, so when, when Joe [Joe Jones] started the South Central Athletic Association, me, as an educator, thought, okay, this is an opportunity for kids to learn too.  So you had to come into the portable and read for an hour before you could go out and run on the track.  So I got a couple of other friends, and we brought library books and we'd read--I said, let's make this a, you know, read and run kind of deal.  And so it just, you know, it's just finding ways to, to nurture our kids, and that's kind of what I've been about, really been my thrust in life.
Speaker 2: Now, what year is the South Central Athletic Association in?
Speaker 1: It's still in existence, and it must have started in--let's see.  My kids graduated, in the '90s [1990s], in the early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it's still in existence today.
Speaker 2: Okay, and just for the record here, your husband was a, he was a fair athlete at--
Speaker 1: Right, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 1: Right, he's always been an athlete.
Speaker 2: Played in the Rose Bowl [Rose Bowl Game] and was (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, so--
Speaker 2: So, I mean they'd had a decent coach.  He actually knew--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --what he was doing.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  And then, and then we found out that kids--he went up to ski one day, and there were no blacks up there skiing.  And he said, oh, we gotta get our kids to skiing up here on this mountain.  This is too much fun.  And he started the Four Seasons Northwest ski club, and you can talk to most any of the kids in the city who know how to ski, they learned through Joe's ski school.  So it, it's just been one, you know, athletics, education, wherever we can see that we might have an impact.  And I am so proud.  I think I am proudest about my ability to have touched the lives of so many children than I am about anything, and, and being a parent.  I, I love what I did as a parent with my own children.

Speaker 1: Ph.D.  We didn't, we didn't cover that and what--
Speaker 2: I then, after I finished my master's [degree], I did all sorts of things and was being a parent and all that.  And I wanted to get a doctorate, but it just kind of didn't have the energy nor time to combine parenthood and the social activities that I was doing and so forth.  So I waited for ten years and the kids [Brent Jones and Dana Jones Walker] got into high school, and I thought, ah, I can do this now.  So I, I went back to, to school, and got my doctorate.
Speaker 1: And this is a Ed.D. actually (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, a doctorate, education.
Speaker 1: All right, and that's what year?
Speaker 2: And that was, let's see '61 [1961] was B.A. Eighty-one [1981], '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: Okay, so and you got it from the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington]?
Speaker 2: Seattle University [Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 1: Oh, Seattle University, okay.
Speaker 2: So all my education has been in Washington State schools, Washington State University [Pullman, Washington], University of Washington and then Seattle University.
Speaker 1: And the master's degree was in what year?
Speaker 2: It was in '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's University of Washington.  Okay, now what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: It was understanding parenting black children, what causes them to engage or disengage in the educational systems?  And that was an interesting study.  I interviewed tons of parents to find out why they're not going to school, to see about their kids or what would prompt them to go to school to help, you know, their kids be--one of the things I, reality I knew was that parents who were involved, their kids did better, just in general.  There're always an exception.  There's always one who for whatever reason was able to make it on his, pretty much on his own.  But research still contends that there was a person, a body that they can point to who helped them be who they are, or convinced them to do well in some way.  So--what was the question?
Speaker 1: What was your dissertation about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I was, I was understanding parents, black parents' involvement in education, in the educational process.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I found out interesting things.  I found out things like the school secretary can be a stopper as to why.  If the parent goes to school and the secretary stops 'em at the desk and asks them why they are here, and who--do you have an appointment and they might not ever come back.  I mean just simple--little, simple things because very often the African American parent has not had a successful experience in the educational system themselves, so they are real tenuous about whether they're going to go challenge it or be a part of it.  And, you know, there're a lot of other things, but that, that happens to be one of 'em.
Story_ID: 629090
Speaker 1: Now, this is important stuff here.  I think--now, now you know the work of John Comer [sic. HistoryMaker Dr. James Comer], right?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  His--he has a program actually to get more parental, parental involvement in the public schools, and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I've, I've done parenting, parenting things too.  It's--that's a challenge.  It's really a challenge.  I've, I'm--I think I've been more challenged by that than certainly working with the kids.  I, I did courses in parenting with parents who were either said by the state that they needed to take some parenting classes or in some cases, they just came 'cause they wanted to--it was called Effective Black Parenting and worked with parents on just some ways to parent that they weren't aware of.  I mean some of 'em didn't know that there were options available to them and how to discipline their children who either hit 'em, spanked 'em, beat 'em or that was it and didn't know that there was a long spectrum of possibilities to discipline children.  And I would say things to them like, you know, "Say something kind to your children every day before they leave because--and when they return to you, 'cause they're bombarded very often with negative stuff," and they would say, "Like what?"  And my assumption was that they would know kind things to say, and I learned that they didn't necessarily.  So we'd role play saying kind things.
Speaker 1: Do you often reflect, I mean you reflect that you were lucky to have the kind of family that you had?
Speaker 2: Oh, I am, I absolutely know that that is a part of or the reason I am, as I say, who I am, is because of my parents [Pauline Sims Lake and Sylvester Lake] and feel very fortunate that I had the parents that I did.  Your mic fell off.  I don't know if that makes any--
Speaker 1: It does make some difference (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's, you know, I think someone said once that the key crisis in black life is a cultural crisis actually.  And--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and it makes everything else either work or fail.
Speaker 2: It really, really does.  And, and like I said, I looked at the success of my children [Brent Jones and Dana Jones Walker] versus their friends who were not, and it, it appeared to me that most often it was the lack of good parenting or the lack of parents who tried, but not necessarily did they--they weren't intentionally bad parents.  It was just like when I would teach those parenting classes.  They simply didn't know.  They didn't realize that there were so many options and ways to parent.  They were either parenting like they had been parented or how they thought children ought to be parented.  The one young woman said to me, I, I just--I said, "What do you, what do you want in this class?  What would you like?"  She said, "Well, I just don't want my kids to be in a gang.  I just don't want 'em to be in a gang."  And when she got up at break time, she left, and she had a jacket on that had all this insignia stuff on the back.  And I thought, there--she doesn't get it.  She thinks that just to say don't do this is enough but didn't realize that kids are watching us all the time as parents and learning from us.  And, you know, being a parent's difficult anyway, and if you're not having the right answer nor had models for you to parent your style after, then it's really often very tragic results.  So I, I just value the fact that I had the kinds of parents who were able to give me the kinds of things that I needed to make good choices.
Story_ID: 629091
Speaker 1: Now during all this period of time when you're, when you were earning the higher degrees and working on these programs to, you know, these supplemental programs for black youth--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, and developmental programs for black youth, from track to skiing to, you know, the Ethnic School [Mt. Zion Ethnic School, Seattle, Washington]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --were you writing too?
Speaker 2: Just minimally.  I was writing dissertations, and, you know, and papers for school, not the creative stuff that I really enjoyed writing.  So once I finished my doctorate [at Seattle University, Seattle, Washington] and my kids [Brent Jones and Dana Jones Walker] were then up and leaving for college and stuff, that's when I started writing.  It was like, oh, it is my time.  I finally can really let my creativity flow and write about what I'd like to write about, and it made me very happy to be able to begin to writing.
Speaker 1: So what did you--were you involved in a writer's workshop or inspired by--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --individual poets as you read or what happened?
Speaker 2: I, I even, don't even have a absolute favorite poet.  I just like literature.  And I like writing and I like to see how people use words.  So I started just writing down some little thoughts as I would do speeches for either, when I was teaching at the colleges or when I'd be at a social event, and they'd ask me to say a few words, and I'd share a poem that I'd written, and people would clap and smile, and I'd think, whoo, and then I wrote a couple pieces and sent 'em to Essence magazine, and they published them, and people would write or ask Essence (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, this is a big deal now.  Your first--well, tell us about the first poem that Essence published of yours?
Speaker 2: The first poem that they--
Speaker 1: And how did you get the temerity to send that poem to Essence magazine (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I know.  It was, that one of their editors, Stephanie Stokes Oliver, was in the audience when I spoke, and she came up to me and said, "You need to send some of your work to Essence," and I did.  And it was, you know, after that I was talking to [HistoryMaker] Susan Taylor the other day.  I was the emcee for a program that Susan was on, and I, and I reminded Susan that it was Susan, herself, and Essence magazine that gave me the first kind of push.  I wrote this poem, and it's still the most popular poem that I've written today.  And it's, "A room full of sisters like jewels in a crown /  They were Vanilla, Cinnamon and Dark Chocolate brown / Now just picture yourself in the midst of this glory / As I describe the sisters who are part of this story.  They were wearing purples, royal blues, all shades of red / Some had elegant hats on their heads / They had sparkling eyes and shiny lips / And as they moved through the room swaying their hips," ["A Room Full of Sisters," Mona Lake Jones] and it goes on, just talking about us as black women.  Well, that was the first piece that was published in Essence, and they got a, you know, a really good response, and the editor called and said, "Where's the book?"  And I thought, well, I could do a book.  I have lots of pieces of paper and lots of little poems and things that I've written.  And that's what prompted me to put together that first 'Color of Culture' book ['The Color of Culture,' Mona Lake Jones].
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was back in--what was that?  In the '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was in the '90s [1990s], uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I've been writing ever since.  And, and now, I'm on color culture. I just finished 'Color Culture III' ['The Color of Culture III,' Mona Lake Jones], and a new book called 'Unleashing the Power of a Sister' [Mona Lake Jones].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So now, I'm just having fun writing.  And I've (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So these are all--these are all collections of poetry.
Speaker 2: They're all collections of poetry, short story, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and so I, I'm fortunate enough to be out on the speaking circuit so I speak at all kinds of things, and I use my poetry and I'm just feeling so blessed to have people listen to me and read me.  I mean it's just, it's exciting.  It really is.
Story_ID: 629092
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a thematic source for most of your poems?  I mean what are your, what's your--is your theme mostly family or what?
Speaker 2: I don't know that it's mostly family.  It's just appreciating life, just as positive as I can get about life in general.  That one poem I have 'Life is Sweet' [Mona Lake Jones], "It's like a dish of warm, berry pie with fresh cream melting on the top, tasting so good you have to tell yourself to stop.  Woo, life is so sweet."  And it goes on about the sweetness of life.  That, that's kind of what I, I write about.  So much of what I write about is positive, but it tells the story of being colored black in America, you know, all kinds of situations and so there are some trials and tribulations, of course, 'cause that's a part of who we are.  But I really try to look at the positive side of our culture and just really appreciate who we are.  I always say, "When you're feeling a little uncomfortable, when you're feeling down, and when you're feeling alone, reach back and get you some culture."  And I tell people, you know, just wallow in your culture.  It makes you feel good.  And don't ever let anybody tell you, you're culturally deprived.  One day somebody said that, and I was surprised at them.
Speaker 1: Well, so many people don't know about it or don't use it, you know, or like we said before, assume they know all it is to know about it because they are black.  It's nothing they have to read or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, but I--
Speaker 1: --no new people they have to associate it with, but--
Speaker 2: Right, but when I celebrate that, oh, it makes people happy.  I mean when I talk about our blackness and how wonderful it is and all the, the kinds of things that, that tell who we are, people get excited about it.  They clap, they laugh, they find value in it, they find association with it.  So that when I talk to groups and I'm celebrating African American culture, they really find joy in that.  There's this one piece that I wrote about brothers.  And it talks about how wonderful black men are 'cause, you know, very often, the only time they're celebrated is if, they're athletes and, you know, superstars, and very often that which is in the newspapers is negative and positi- you know, about what they're, they've done that's not good.  And so I wrote a piece just to celebrate them.  And I'm telling you, every time I do that in an audience, men come up and they hug me and they thank me, and, you know, it's this, like--and I went to the barbershop 'cause it was round about, "One morning I went to the barbershop, and it was round about ten o'clock.  And I just happened to walk by, and I looked in, and there were brothers of all ages sitting, waiting in line, each one of them I would describe as fine.  I don't mean fine 'cause they were short, tall or thin.  I mean these were just genuinely handsome, black men, that love and strength that showed in their eyes, and you knew for some years of living had made them wise," ['Brothers,' Mona Lake Jones].  And it goes on about, you know, the brothers in the barbershop, just positive things.  And the same way with that 'Sisters' piece ['A Room Full of Sisters,' Mona Lake Jones].  And then I acknowledge the fact that we have had, you know, many issues in our lives as, as blacks, as African Americans.  And we've overcome them, and we continually do so.  And there's always hope, and there's always the positive.  And if we keep those positive things about who we are in our heads and have pictures of them, then it helps us be kind of better human beings.
Story_ID: 629093
Speaker 1: Now, when you--and you've answered this on, in some ways already, but what are some of your hope and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I, I, I worry most about our children, and that they are not always making the best choice for their lives, and that they're not learning all that they can, understanding that their futures without education are gonna be pretty bleak.  And if their values are on only the materialistic things that they're trying to acquire, that they probably are not gonna be happy and satisfied, that their moral kind of choices are not always the best for their futures.  So I, I worry most about our children and what kind of futures are ahead for them and hope that they can kind of have some better and more realistic goals of what success ought to be.
Story_ID: 629094
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now if you could?
Speaker 2: I probably--I'm feeling pretty content, pretty good about what I've done.  I could've done more.  I'm sure of that, but my time and my energy level and my just abilities have not always allowed me to do as much as I could.  I, I think I would have chosen to go to an environment for my education that maybe looked a little more like me, that celebrated me a little more 'cause I missed that, not ever having had an education in an environment that was reflective of me, nor had the teachers that were reflective of me.  I wonder would I be a different person, would I be a better person?
Speaker 1: You do--do you regret not having gone to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], you know, back in--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I've, I've thought about that often, what would my life had been like had I done that, versus having chosen to go to another predominantly, major white institution.  I don't know what it's like to live in an environment where we are the dominant.  And I--and every time I'm in one it's just, to me, just really joyful.  It's like, oh, look at us.  Oh, look at (laughter)--I mean clerks are black and the people in the store are black, and the dah, you know, it's like, oh, this is something.  I'm, I'm like, you know, that kid in a candy store type thing.  I was like, oh, this is special.
Speaker 1: Yeah, sort of in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I'm in Washington (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Or Atlanta, and you go to the mall, and the whole mall is black.  It's, oh, this is not real.  But, yeah, it is, and it makes me smile when I'm there.  So I, that, that's the, that's the, probably area, where I've not had the kind of experiences I would like to have had and often wonder how would I be different had I had them.
Story_ID: 629095
Speaker 1: Now, tell us a little bit about your family.  I didn't ask you about how you met your husband [Joe Jones] and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But we'll talk about that now and your children and then--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I've got a couple more question after that, though.
Speaker 2: My husband and I met--he was working at the World's Fair for IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] in an exhibit.  And he was the exhibitor and programmed this machine to talk, and it said, "Who is the lovely lady in the green dress?"  That was me, had on a green dress.  And I was like, oh, that didn't just happen.  And (laughter) it was high tech, you know, back in 19--what, 1960, '61 [1961], 1961, '62 [1962].  That's when we met.
Speaker 1: Was it Seattle World's Fair [Century 21 Exposition, Seattle, Washington]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and we, so I moseyed over there, of course, and had a little conversation.  And, and that was, that was how we met.  So--
Speaker 1: But he actually used an animatronic robot to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh (laughter).
Speaker 1: --flirt.
Speaker 2: Way back then.  Yeah, and, and he had gone to the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] and was a football player, et cetera, and I was at Washington State [Washington State University, Pullman, Washington] as a Cougar, and we were great rivals.  So I had heard about him, but we'd not met.  And so, this was--we were both already through, so I was here for my first teaching job.  And that's how we met.  And the rest is history, and that was forty-five--we've been married for forty-five years this summer.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how many children do you have?
Speaker 2: We have two children, and our, our son [Brent Jones] is the oldest, and he is the vice chancellor for the Seattle community college system [Seattle Colleges, Seattle, Washington], and he's married and he's a doctor.  His wife's [Janine Jones] a doctor, and they have a little girl, our granddaughter, Nia [Nia Jones].  And then my daughter [Dana Jones Walker] is married with two children and she is in Maryland, in D--in the D.C. area [Washington, D.C.] and has a master's in public health and her husband's [Bill Walker] an attorney.  And they are married six, seven, seven years, about seven years, something like that.  Nice people, my daughter and my son are such nice people.  You would like them.  I mean they're, they're well educated, they're well liked, they're--they know how to get along with everybody because the neighborhood we grew up--had them grow up in in Seattle [Washington] was very integrated.  And so they came home from college one summer, and they had a party in the backyard.  And out in the backyard were Asians, Hispanics, Native Americans, white and black kids.  I looked out the window, and I thought, oh, if the world could see this.  I mean here were all these kinds having the best time and just enjoying each other 'cause they'd gone to school with just, you know, every ethnic group.  And so they know how to get along with people and like people just in general.  And they really like who they are.  That was, that was my, that was my thing, to raise two kids who, who liked themselves.  And I'm very proud of that.  So I have two and three grandchildren.  And I'm Grand Honey now.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  A historic--the family name was passed on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, uh-huh, right.
Speaker 1: --passed down.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 629096
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point today, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think the, the writing that I've done.  The, the books that I've written, the stories that I've told, the poems I've created.  Everybody doesn't get to do that, to touch so many people with their thoughts and their words.  And I'm just feeling really, really truly blessed that I have the talent and then the opportunity to share my thoughts with other people.  I, I just--every day kind of give thanks for having that talent and being able to share it with other people, the, the--hopefully, the things that I say touch some folks in ways that are positive, that give them hope, that cause them to think, that cause them to reflect or that cause them to plan a little differently, that validate them, that give them reason to celebrate, 'cause that's what I try to do with my writing.
Speaker 1: Now, you're really sought after as a keynote speaker and a motivational speak, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --all over the country now, right?  So.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I, I again, you know, talking to audiences all the time, and they're listening to what I'm saying.  And then they're standing up and clapping when I get through, and then they're shaking my hand, and they're telling me thank you for sharing what I did and saying what I said.  I know I was talking to an audience of mostly white people the other, few months ago, and the woman came up to me, and she said, "You are the sweetest radical I have ever met."  And I thought, isn't that nice.  She was listening to what I was saying, and could come away with the fact that I had said some very pointed things about our society.  And it was okay 'cause I must have said it in such a way that either she could relate to it or understand it, was not offended or took it in at least.  So, and large audiences.  I'm speaking to an audience of twenty thousand people in, in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] next month and, and little audiences, just having an opportunity to talk to people and to tell them what's on my mind and then for them to appreciate what I've just said to them.  That is so powerful, and I know everybody doesn't get that opportunity.  And I am so grateful to have that, and I hope that I will be able to continue to say the right things and impact people in such a way that it is thoughtful and positive and respectful.
Story_ID: 629097
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I--I'm, I've pretty much talked out (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I pretty--I've pretty much said what my life has been about (laughter), and, and I appreciate the opportunity to have, to do so.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you for taking the time for this, twice now (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: But the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a person who tried very hard to impact the community, the world, the people with whom I've come in contact, in a positive way, and that I've given folks some information or some tools or some reason to celebrate life.
Story_ID: 629098
Speaker 1: Okay, this is me in junior high school [Libby Junior High School; Libby School, Spokane, Washington], and I graduated from high school [Lewis and Clark High School, Spokane, Washington] in 1957.  So that must be in about 1954.  And I'm in the band playing the flute or the clarinet in that case.
Speaker 2: Okay, it looks like one of those metal clarinets.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: It doesn't make any difference, but if you can just tell us.
Speaker 2: This is photo--you've got rotate on it--148.  And this is a picture of my father, Sylvester Lake, and my sister, Sylvia [Sylvia Lake Finley], and myself.  I'm on the right hand side, and the photo must have been when I was about five years old, and so that would have been in, about 1945.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's see, and this one.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother, Pauline Eyelyn Lake [Pauline Sims Lake], and my grandmother, Mary Bell, her mother.  And that picture was probably taken in the '40s [1940s], and it's in front of our church, Calvary Baptist [Calvary Baptist Church] in Spokane [Washington], and it's picture number 149.
Speaker 1: And there's a caption that says, "Yes, it is."  Is that--
Speaker 2: That's--my father wrote that in.  And I'm not sure what he meant when he said that, "Yes, it is."
Speaker 1: And he put it in quotes (laughter).
Speaker 2: That must be something--oh, my grandmother used to say that time--all the time.  "Yes, it is."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And this is a birthday party, my birthday party, and--
Speaker 1: Oh, it's picture 150, 150.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I can't even tell you who all those kids are at this point because it was too long ago.  But it looks like it was about my fourth birthday, maybe, or about four years old.  So that would have been about 1944.
Speaker 1: Okay, which one is you.
Speaker 2: In the center.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, you're the little one in the center.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, with the braid hanging down on the right side of her face.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a picture, number--
Speaker 1: One fifty-one.
Speaker 2: One fifty-one.  Those are both my grandmothers.  There's Grand Honey on the right, my mother in the middle, and grandma, Grandma Bell on the right.  So--
Speaker 1: Oh, wait a minute, you gave us two rights.  So refer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, left, left.
Speaker 1: From left to--the reader is left to right, it's--
Speaker 2: Grandma Bell--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my mother, Pauline Evylyn Lake, and my grandmother, Mamie McKinney [ph.] who we called Grand Honey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they were all dressed up at church on Sunday.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's my high school picture, and it's picture number 152.  And that must have been in about 1956, '55 [1955], '56 [1956].
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's not your senior picture?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh, there're my grandmothers again.  Grandma Bell on the left, Grand Honey on the right.
Speaker 2: Standing in front of a Chevy [Chevrolet], it looks like.
Speaker 1: Is that right?
Speaker 2: It looks like a '53 [1953] Chevy.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and that's picture number 153.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me performing with my friend, Willie Jones, at a high school assembly, and we used to sing for talent shows and concerts and, I went on to be singer with the little dance band when I was in college [State College of Washington; Washington State University, Pullman, Washington].
Speaker 2: What was the name of the band?
Speaker 1: The Armon-Boltman Trio [ph.].
Speaker 2: I think we got that in the last interview, but we didn't discuss it this time.
Speaker 1: We didn't--I don't think so, no.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, well, it's a good thing we got it during the photos.
Speaker 1: And so that was in about 1956.
Speaker 2: What kind of songs you--
Speaker 1: We were singing, (singing) "Why do fools fall in love?"
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: (Singing) "Why do fools fall in love?  Why do fools fall in love?
Speaker 2: There's my, my--those are my grandchildren.
Speaker 1: This is picture 155.
Speaker 2: And that's Nia [Nia Jones] on the left and that's Bryce [Bryce Walker] on the right.  And it says right there it's in 2004.  And that's--I'm their Grand Honey now, and we have one more who's not in this picture, born since that time.  And her name is Nia, so that's Kyndal [Kyndal Walker], Bryce and Nia are the grandchildren.
Speaker 1: This is picture 156.
Speaker 2: This was at a, a conference and this group was in Rochester, New York, and that's a group of women.  And they had me there as a speaker, and that was their group and their choir, I believe.  I'm not sure, but it must have been in about 19--in about two thousand--about 2004.  And that's picture number 2007 [sic. 157].
Speaker 1: This is my father.
Speaker 2: Picture 158, okay.
Speaker 1: This is my father, and he's the one who gave me my skill in writing, Sylvester Lake, that actually is a picture at my daughter's wedding, Sylvester Lake, and that's me on the left.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I believe that's that same group in Rochester, and I was performing at the time.
Speaker 2: I think I--that's picture number--
Speaker 1: That's picture number 160.
Speaker 2: I think I skipped one.  Let me go back.  No, let's see.  Here we go, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is me in New York at the Harriet Tubman House [Harriet Tubman National Historical Park, Auburn, New York]--
Speaker 2: It's 159.  This is the one we skipped, picture 159.
Speaker 1: --at the Harriet Tubman House, and that was in about 2005.  And I've since written a piece about Harriet Tubman called 'Aunt Harriet' [ph.] [Mona Lake Jones].  I was so impressed with what I'd seen at the Tubman House and learned about her.
Speaker 2: Now, this is in --
Speaker 1: In Auburn, New York.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  And we did that one.  Here we go.
Speaker 1: That's at the Harriet Tubman home again.
Speaker 2: This is picture 161.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's me about to go into the house, and I was fortunate enough to go to another place in Auburn where she had, was part of the underground [Underground Railroad], and where the slaves stayed before they were transported to Canada.
Story_ID: 629099
Speaker 1: This is me in Boston [Massachusetts], and that's standing before a painting by [HistoryMaker] Paul Goodnight, and it's called 'A Room Full of Sisters,' and it's at the Boston fine arts museum [Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Boston, Massachusetts].  And that was probably in about 2005, '4 [2004].
Speaker 2: And this is picture 162.
Speaker 1: This is me speaking before the state legislature in the State of Washington and that was probably about five years ago, so maybe in 2002, 2003.  And this was me giving a speech at the state legislature.  I think it was to celebrate Black History Month or Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] celebration.
Speaker 2: This is picture number 164.  And I think naturals were in style--
Speaker 1: (Laughter)--
Speaker 2: --in this picture (laughter).  And those are my two birth children, Brent on the left and Dana [Dana Jones Walker] on the right.  And it must have been 1974.
Speaker 1: And this is picture number 164, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The children.  And this one is picture 165, and--
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my wedding day, with my husband, now of forty-five years, still in love, Joe Jones, and that was in 1965, and we were in Spokane [Washington] at Calvary Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a family picture, as they've gotten older, daughter, Dana, now Dana Walker, my husband, Joe, Joe Jones, and myself, and my son, Brent Jones, and that picture was in The Seattle Times, and we were the family of the year for Seattle [Washington].  They selected us and featured a story about us, so we had to take the picture.
Speaker 2: And that's picture number 166, yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Picture number 167.  My father, Sylvester Lake, and my mother Pauline Lake [Pauline Sims Lake].  And that picture was about in 19--no in about two thousand--maybe in 2002.  And they are, have both deceased in the last year.  And they are the loves of my life.
Speaker 2: That's me--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's me--that's picture number 168, and that is me in the second row on the right hand side, and there, again, I am the only one.  So it's not--I'm not hard to find.  And that's at Spokane, at McKinley Elementary School [Spokane, Washington].  And that looks like about third grade.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it says third grade (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Does it say third grade?  Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: May, 1948.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and that's my, my Miss McDonald [ph.].
Speaker 1: That's me at the National Urban League convention in Florida--Miami in about 2000, maybe.
Speaker 2: And that's picture number 159.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, and I'm performing.
Speaker 2: This is 170.
Speaker 1: And this is my father, and this had to be in 1957, right out of high school [Lewis and Clark High School, Spokane, Washington] and being introduced as a debutante.  I was a freshman at Washington State University [State College of Washington; Washington State University, Pullman, Washington], but the debutante ball was held in Seattle.  There were only a dozen or so of us black women in the State of Washington who were in college then.  And we were all introduced as debutantes.  They had to come clear to Spokane and get me and bring me over here.
Speaker 2: This is 171.
Speaker 1: That's me as a baby.  I had to be about a year old or maybe a year old.  And so that was in about 1939, 1940.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, this is picture 172.
Speaker 2: That is me performing but it was on the cover of the Seattle University magazine, and that was about four years ago.
Speaker 1: That's me--
Speaker 2: This is picture 174.
Speaker 1: And I'm the smallest one on the right hand side down at the bottom, and that's on the steps in front of the church in, probably in about 1941, '42 [1942].
Story_ID: 629100
Speaker 1: [NO AUDIO: VIDEO AND TRANSCRIPT ONLY]
Speaker 2: Okay, this is me in junior high school [Libby Junior High School; Libby School, Spokane, Washington], and I graduated from high school [Lewis and Clark High School, Spokane, Washington] in 1957.  So that must be in about 1954.  And I'm in the band playing the flute or the clarinet in that case.
Speaker 1: Okay, it looks like one of those metal clarinets.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: It doesn't make any difference, but if you can just tell us.
Speaker 1: This is photo--you've got rotate on it--148.  And this is a picture of my father, Sylvester Lake, and my sister, Sylvia [Sylvia Lake Finley], and myself.  I'm on the right hand side, and the photo must have been when I was about five years old, and so that would have been in, about 1945.
Speaker 2: Okay, let's see, and this one.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my mother, Pauline Eyelyn Lake [Pauline Sims Lake], and my grandmother, Mary Bell, her mother.  And that picture was probably taken in the '40s [1940s], and it's in front of our church, Calvary Baptist [Calvary Baptist Church] in Spokane [Washington], and it's picture number 149.
Speaker 2: And there's a caption that says, "Yes, it is."  Is that--
Speaker 1: That's--my father wrote that in.  And I'm not sure what he meant when he said that, "Yes, it is."
Speaker 2: And he put it in quotes (laughter).
Speaker 1: That must be something--oh, my grandmother used to say that time--all the time.  "Yes, it is."
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And this is a birthday party, my birthday party, and--
Speaker 2: Oh, it's picture 150, 150.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And I, I can't even tell you who all those kids are at this point because it was too long ago.  But it looks like it was about my fourth birthday, maybe, or about four years old.  So that would have been about 1944.
Speaker 2: Okay, which one is you.
Speaker 1: In the center.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, you're the little one in the center.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay, with the braid hanging down on the right side of her face.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's a picture, number--
Speaker 2: One fifty-one.
Speaker 1: One fifty-one.  Those are both my grandmothers.  There's Grand Honey on the right, my mother in the middle, and grandma, Grandma Bell on the right.  So--
Speaker 2: Oh, wait a minute, you gave us two rights.  So refer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, left, left.
Speaker 2: From left to--the reader is left to right, it's--
Speaker 1: Grandma Bell--
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So they were all dressed up at church on Sunday.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's my high school picture, and it's picture number 152.  And that must have been in about 1956, '55 [1955], '56 [1956].
Speaker 2: Okay, so that's not your senior picture?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Oh, there're my grandmothers again.  Grandma Bell on the left, Grand Honey on the right.
Speaker 1: Standing in front of a Chevy [Chevrolet], it looks like.
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: It looks like a '53 [1953] Chevy.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and that's picture number 153.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me performing with my friend, Willie Jones, at a high school assembly, and we used to sing for talent shows and concerts and, I went on to be singer with the little dance band when I was in college [State College of Washington; Washington State University, Pullman, Washington].
Speaker 1: What was the name of the band?
Speaker 2: The Armon-Boltman Trio [ph.].
Speaker 1: I think we got that in the last interview, but we didn't discuss it this time.
Speaker 2: We didn't--I don't think so, no.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, well, it's a good thing we got it during the photos.
Speaker 2: And so that was in about 1956.
Speaker 1: What kind of songs you--
Speaker 2: We were singing, (singing) "Why do fools fall in love?"
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: (Singing) "Why do fools fall in love?  Why do fools fall in love?
Speaker 1: There's my, my--those are my grandchildren.
Speaker 2: This is picture 155.
Speaker 1: And that's Nia [Nia Jones] on the left and that's Bryce [Bryce Walker] on the right.  And it says right there it's in 2004.  And that's--I'm their Grand Honey now, and we have one more who's not in this picture, born since that time.  And her name is Nia, so that's Kyndal [Kyndal Walker], Bryce and Nia are the grandchildren.
Speaker 2: This is picture 156.
Speaker 1: This was at a, a conference and this group was in Rochester, New York, and that's a group of women.  And they had me there as a speaker, and that was their group and their choir, I believe.  I'm not sure, but it must have been in about 19--in about two thousand--about 2004.  And that's picture number 2007 [sic. 157].
Speaker 2: This is my father.
Speaker 1: Picture 158, okay.
Speaker 2: This is my father, and he's the one who gave me my skill in writing, Sylvester Lake, that actually is a picture at my daughter's wedding, Sylvester Lake, and that's me on the left.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I believe that's that same group in Rochester, and I was performing at the time.
Speaker 1: I think I--that's picture number--
Speaker 2: That's picture number 160.
Speaker 1: I think I skipped one.  Let me go back.  No, let's see.  Here we go, yeah.
Speaker 2: This is me in New York at the Harriet Tubman House [Harriet Tubman National Historical Park, Auburn, New York]--
Speaker 1: It's 159.  This is the one we skipped, picture 159.
Speaker 2: --at the Harriet Tubman House, and that was in about 2005.  And I've since written a piece about Harriet Tubman called 'Aunt Harriet' [ph.] [Mona Lake Jones].  I was so impressed with what I'd seen at the Tubman House and learned about her.
Speaker 1: Now, this is in --
Speaker 2: In Auburn, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And we did that one.  Here we go.
Speaker 2: That's at the Harriet Tubman home again.

Speaker 2: This is picture number 164.  And I think naturals were in style--
Speaker 1: (Laughter)--
Speaker 2: --in this picture (laughter).  And those are my two birth children, Brent on the left and Dana [Dana Jones Walker] on the right.  And it must have been 1974.
Speaker 1: And this is picture number 164, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The children.  And this one is picture 165, and--
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my wedding day, with my husband, now of forty-five years, still in love, Joe Jones, and that was in 1965, and we were in Spokane [Washington] at Calvary Baptist Church.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Does it say third grade?  Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: May, 1948.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and that's my, my Miss McDonald [ph.].

Speaker 2: And that's picture number 159.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, and I'm performing.
Speaker 2: This is 170.
Speaker 1: And this is my father, and this had to be in 1957, right out of high school [Lewis and Clark High School, Spokane, Washington] and being introduced as a debutante.

Story_ID: 671714
Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Ma'am, can you state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Mona Lake Jones, M-O-N-A, L-A-K-E, J-O-N-E-S.
Speaker 1: And, ma'am, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: August 30th, 1939 in Mason City, Washington, which is no more, by the way.  It's now Grand Coulee [Washington].
Speaker 1: Really?  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It's near the Grand Coulee Dam?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Retiree.  I am out on the speaking circuit and writing, but for the most part, right now, I'm kind of grandmothering and wifeing and enjoying life.
Speaker 1: Okay, and would it be fair to say that you, to characterize you as a motivational speaker and a poet?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: What is today's date?  October 7th, 2017.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: In--you're at my home in Seattle, Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's good.  And we're finishing an interview we started in 2007.  That's ten years ago.
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Hello (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 671715
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna start, I'm gonna start with you as director of public relations for Seattle Community Colleges [Seattle Colleges].
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, this is in the early 2000s, right?
Speaker 2: Right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And tell us what this job was like and what you were doing?
Speaker 2: That was a job that covered the four campuses.  Seattle Community Colleges had three main campuses and then another vocational, technical campus.  And so my job was to do all of the public relations and the communications work for those four campuses--to do the development of catalogs and public information brochures, to write anything that needed to represent the colleges and to also manage the fund development arena for those four campuses.  So it consisted of not just public relations, which was special events, planning, communications and fund development, but also supporting the chancellor and the board of trustees.
Speaker 1: Who was the chancellor at that point?
Speaker 2: I worked for three different chancellors.  So at one point, it was--the first chancellor that I worked for was Don Phelps [Donald G. Phelps], and Don Phelps left to be the chancellor of the Los Angeles Community College system [Los Angeles Community College District].  And so when he left, there were a couple of kind of interim chancellors until we hired another one.  And then that was Chuck Kane [Charles "Chuck" Kane].  And Chuck Kane came to us from California, and so that was the last chancellor for whom I worked.  When I retired, he was the chancellor.
Story_ID: 671716
Speaker 1: Now, you were there [Seattle Community Colleges; Seattle Colleges] until, I guess the, what about twenty--I don't know, mid-2000s?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I left there in the early 2000s to teach again.  And so I became a faculty member at one of the local colleges called Pacific Oaks [Pacific Oaks College - Northwest, Seattle, Washington].  Actually, Pacific Oaks was out of California, but they had a branch here in Seattle [Washington].  And so I would teach in California in the summer, a summer course or two.  But for the most part, I was here in Seattle.  And what we did, students who had graduated with a degree in any number of fields decided that they wanted to become teachers.  And so they would come in for a year, and at Pacific Oaks, we would mold them within that year into teachers.  And they would leave with a master's degree in education.  So my sole purpose was to develop really fine teachers.  And that was kind of a love of mine anyway because I started off as an educator way back when, and as a teacher, and found it to be a profession that I was good at and found value in it.  And I knew that good teachers made good people, especially for our young, African American kids.  So I, for a long time, as you probably know, led the early childhood education department in the community college system and taught at the university and other places, to help in that whole arena of teacher education.  So when I had the chance after retiring, I thought, wouldn't it be fun again to return to that passion of mine, which is helping people become teachers.  And so these students who were very wise as they came to us at Pacific Oaks, brought any number of expertise that I was always enlightened about 'cause I really didn't know much about technology or biology or those--.  And when they would do their special projects and, and interface with other students, I'd always learn, probably as much as they were learning.  But I did know how to help them become teachers.  And so we worked with the Seattle public school system [Seattle Public Schools], and they came in.  And we taught weekends, evenings--because most of them still had jobs of various sorts.  And they would leave after a year with a master's degree and teaching certificate.
Speaker 1: Now, one of the challenges, I think, with people in technological fields is that they don't relate well to people, if they do--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --a lot of research.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was that part of the challenge?
Speaker 2: Yes, very much so.  And, and just understanding that, that the information that they had was, it was something that needed to be imparted to children.  And there were ways to do that.  And if they could understand where the child--what we used to always say that we'll start where the child is and then move from that point.  And to be compassionate about just enjoying youth and children and the, the satisfaction that one gets from imparting knowledge to young people.  So we found all sorts of ways to make that happen, and we plunked them in and out of classrooms and the teachers that had them, who mentored them in the school system were patient with them and found joy in bringing them along as well.  So that was a very satisfying job for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and you did that until about 2010.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 671717
Speaker 1: And, now, backtrack a little bit here, when was [HistoryMaker] Norman Rice the mayor of Seattle [Washington]?  Was that--?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-five [1995], somewhere in there 'til 2000 [sic. 1990 to 1998], 1996 to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) To 2000?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in that range.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was a poet laureate while he was the mayor of Seattle.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were Seattle's poet laureate (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then for about a year after that, because the next mayor [Paul Schell] asked if I would stay on for a year.  And so I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then you, you were named poet laureate of King County [Washington]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --from 2000 to 2003, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that's Martin Luther King County.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now tell us about that transition.  Now, we interviewed [HistoryMaker] Larry Gossett (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--right.
Speaker 1: --who was telling us some stories.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Larry Gossett.
Speaker 1: But you could tell us--
Speaker 2: It, it's really, it's a really interesting story and one that you would not think in the City of Seattle where the African American population is, is really, as you compare us to other large cities and metropolitan areas, not that big.  And so for us to pull that off, for Larry Gossett and Ron Sims and others to have made that happen and to convince the King County that they needed to be named Martin Luther King County was really quite wonderful.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, do you remember who King County was named for originally?
Speaker 2: I don't even know.
Speaker 1: I do.  I can say it.  Now, this is something I--Larry Gossett sent me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't even know.  Who, who was it?
Speaker 1: It was Rufus King [William R. King].
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Rufus--his middle initial--there are white Rufus Kings.
Speaker 2: Really, Rufus.
Speaker 1: One--yes.  The first one [Rufus King], it was a paragon and a admirable man, at least to most people that would be against slavery and for human rights and that sort of thing.  He would be your hero.  That Rufus King, there's a high school named for him in Milwaukee [Rufus King International High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, Rufus King.
Speaker 1: There's another--yeah, that's a Ru- that's one Rufus King.  The second Rufus King is a slave owner and a land speculator.
Speaker 2: Is that the one we were named after?
Speaker 1: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh.  So we went from Rufus King, the slave owner to Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Yes, that's the King.  And so that made it particularly painful for Larry Gossett to, you know, work for King County--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --that's named for the slave owning, slave driving, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --Rufus King from--
Speaker 2: Is that--
Speaker 1: --Georgia [sic. Alabama].  I think he's from Georgia.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  See I--
Speaker 1: And he was a 19th century figure.
Speaker 2: --I didn't, I didn't even know the story.  But the person [Tony Gable] who illustrated my books, 'The Color of Culture' series [Mona Lake Jones], is the same graphics designer who did the logo for Martin Luther King County.  So now, you see all of the King County cars driving around with Martin Luther King's head, figure (laughter), profile on the car, and all the letterhead and everything has Martin Luther King.
Speaker 1: Yes, it's remarkable.  It really is, I mean I, I was really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It, it is.
Speaker 1: --dumbfounded when I heard that story--
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: --that they were able to do that here.  And it wouldn't happen, as you said--you were giving us an example off camera of the way the State of Washington is stratified.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You have those east of the mountains--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who are--it's a red state east of the mountains.
Speaker 2: And, and I know that side very well 'cause that's the side I was born on.  And so the, the difference as the Cascade Mountain ranges kind of divide the state, is night and day because it's very conservative.  Even the, even though weather and the terrain are totally different.  It's dry, flat on the other side; and on this side, it's lush and green and mountainous and water.  So the difference is pretty stark in politics, in just the, the way people look. It's very, very white on the other side; very few of us.  Now, my parents [Pauline Sims Lake and Sylvester Lake] were pioneers.  They came to the other side of the State of Washington to help build the Great, Grand Coulee Dam, and that's how we migrated here.  And so once dad finished in the building of the dam, which was a hundred miles or so from Spokane [Washington], we went on up to Spokane, moved there.  And that's how--that's where I grew up on that side of the mountains; and went to school over there too in the Palouse [Washington] country 'cause I went to Washington State University [Pullman, Washington] as a undergraduate.  And that, too--for one, the entire semester, I was the only black female on campus.  And that was a, an interesting part of my life and a challenging part of my life as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, yeah, the Rufus King, I mean the King County story, I know we--when we were growing up, we used to hear about the Kingdome [King County Multipurpose Domed Stadium, Seattle, Washington], I had no idea who that King was.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm, I'm interested to (laughter) hear the story because I hadn't known who he was.  I just knew we were all elated, happy and overjoyed that we were now Martin Luther King County, thanks to Larry Gossett and Ron Sims and others.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and that happened around 2003 [sic. 2005] is that (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah (unclear).
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes.
Story_ID: 671718
Speaker 1: Now, we were talking about you at Pacific Oaks College [Pacific Oaks College - Northwest, Seattle, Washington] and you were there to 2010.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You were training teachers, right?
Speaker 2: Right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Technical people how to--
Speaker 2: How to become teachers.
Speaker 1: Do you have an educational philosophy?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I, I really--there's a poem that, that I wrote about just kinda believing in our children, and it says, "She is our future, sweet thing with eyes that twinkle when she looks and she's our future.  And he's a beautiful child with lips that glisten as he babbles and coos and he's our future.  And we ask the question, how will they grow and who will teach them to look with their eyes, to find the right direction, and how will they know which to say.  Their ways may be childlike now, but soon he will enter manhood.  She will become a woman, and then they will be expected to speak about the injustices they see, praise the goodness they find and turn to act kindly towards another."  That's kind of my philosophy in knowing that the youth, they really are our future.
Story_ID: 671719
Speaker 1: Now, in 2010, you, you basically retired from education as a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From real, from real work.  Then it just was a time for me to do things that I was just passionate about without having to be there at eight and leave at five or tell anybody where I was going and when I was coming or why I wouldn't be there or feel guilty because I wasn't there.  I thought it was time in my life to do what I guess people call retire, but I really didn't retire because I busied myself and have done so since then--writing and speaking, having this wonderful opportunity to still have audiences that want to hear what I say.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you do a lot of civic work.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: People here--everybody knows you.  Everybody we mention your name to, they all know you (unclear).  They get excited when they hear, they hear we--that we're interviewing you.  Now, one thing that you mentioned that you do is you work with the women of color for the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association].
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.  So there is what we call kind of, I guess, we're an executive council of the YWCA that focuses on making certain that the YWCA, which has an umbrella goal of eliminating racism, that we really adhere to that, and that while we are servicing the communities, we are making certain that we are servicing communities of color and servicing the, those who are not often represented well on, on councils and have smaller voices.  And so a part of that responsibility then is to be out there championing the causes and often at council meetings and wherever we can see the YWCA being an integral part of making something positive happen, then our job is to help make that happen.  And in helping to make that happen, being certain that people of color are being served.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you give us an example of something?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, there is a--one of the goals of YWCA is housing, and housing particularly women who have found themselves in straits that don't allow them to access very good housing or any housing at all.  And so we have locations now where we have gotten enough funding to build our own housing or villages, as a matter of fact.  There is housing in Seattle [Washington] and there's a vill- there's housing east of the, of the channel here on the other side of the water.  There's housing north.  And we wanted to make certain that women of all ages and all colors and from all stratas of life were accessing that housing.  So we did all sorts of things to make certain that that happened.  There is one housing complex on the other side of the mount- on the other side of the water here, past Bellevue [Washington] and on out; and on the very front of it, it says--one of my, one of my poems with the very first line, it says, "Stand back and watch me, I'm getting ready to unfold."  So a--supposing that every woman still has some unfolding to do, we wanted to make certain that they had all the support services to make that happen for themselves and their children and so forth.  That's just, you know, like one example.  But each year now, we have a conference on eliminating racism.  And so we bring in speakers and we have wonderful discussions and all that.  But we found what we needed to do was have a step past that 'cause we were coming in and feeling very good about talking about these issues and recognizing that there were issues to be addressed, but then like, what next?  So our council then said, what is next?  So how do we bring these ideas to fruition and how do we make all of these things happen?  And so we found all kinds of ways to address that.  Just, sometimes our presence at meetings of discussion and meetings of decision, I think, have made differences.  You see a bunch of women of color sitting up in the room, and you kinda wonder why, what, and maybe we need to address this a little differently, and maybe we need to take a moment and hear what their thinking is.
Story_ID: 671720
Speaker 1: How large is your group, and what's the composition of the group?
Speaker 2: We are probably about, I would say fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen--something like that.  And we have Native American, Asian.  We have a few white women as well, but for the most part, they're African American.  The two people who run the council are both African American; and then we educate the, the, the big board for the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], which is made up of those, you know, kind of high rollers, the people who give money, who have--can access money to make some of this stuff happen.  So we go in with different kinds of workshops, just to educate the, the broader board on what is racism and does it exist?  I mean some of them have been enlightened by our workshops that we provided just for them, didn't really know how bad it was, didn't really think that racism existed in Seattle [Washington].  What?  You know, that's hard to imagine, but some of them really felt that this was a wonderful place that very few incidents of prejudice were.  And so we talked about it.
Speaker 1: Now, now, one of the--now, this is a part of the, I guess it's part--is it part of the constitution of the YWCA, is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that they are the--
Speaker 2: It's part of the man- it's really a mandate now for the national YWCA--
Speaker 1: Yeah, now this is--
Speaker 2: --under its, under the national YWCA, it says, "We are the YWCA and our goal is to eliminate racism."
Speaker 1: Right, now, this is something that was, from what I understand, was created a long time ago, maybe the '30s [1930s] or '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The national YWCAs that are governed by mostly white women--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --came up with that as their goal and it's written in their (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It is--yeah.
Speaker 1: --their legal--this is what they're really supposed to be about.
Speaker 2: That, that is it.
Speaker 1: And do you think that they're--
Speaker 2: I doubt if there're any other or very few national organizations that really, truly have that as their mandate and then try to deal with it and literally try to do what they say.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would imagine, because of the way things are today, that very few of the YWCAs are really cognizant of that, the fact that that's one of the mandates of their organization.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thi- I think that they are becoming more and more aware of it, and one of the reasons is because they've had two women of color, black women, who have been, you know, the presidents of--the CEO, so to speak, of the national YWCA.  So that helps because they were coming in, bringing that perspective and making it more visible and, and so I'm, I'm--I'd be surprised if they weren't aware of it.  They may not address it the same way with such vigor as others do, but I don't know how they could not be aware of it at this point.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, there's a nation- is there a national group of women of color for the YMCAs?
Speaker 2: No, not that I know of.
Speaker 1: Or YWCAs, rather?  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, uh-huh.  I think there may be councils in each cities that--in, in various cities that have kind of organizations like we do.
Speaker 1: Okay, but there's not a national--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --place, where--a place on the national, where the different councils convene and--
Speaker 2: Not that I'm aware of, no, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --talk about policies and--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 671721
Speaker 1: And then another thing that I do in my retirement is to--I've recognized the fact that I'm a senior, and, and so I have embraced that seniorness; (laughter) and each Wednesday during the year with a three month kind of break in the summer, I meet with a group of senior citizens for discussions of--on topics of relevance to us as African American seniors.  And we kind of layer our discussions with the religious teachings from the church to which I belong.  So just broad things, like how do I remain kind, how do I remain Christian in my ethics in the midst of all of this turmoil that we seem to be experiencing now?  I know I said to you off camera that I don't think it's been, ever this much turmoil and this much stress, and then I backed off that when I thought, oh, this, this is not as bad, any close way near to, as when they were--when there was slavery and they were lynching and, you know.  So I had to kinda take that back.  But sometimes, you know, you feel overwhelmed with what the issues are right now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who--you know, what you could, what we could say, I know, is that there's probably no other time when people knew as much about what was going on as they do today.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's all over the world, but especially with the handheld devices, people have the phones and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: --we can, you can access the news wherever you are--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --almost, and be hit with all the bad things that are going on all over the world.
Speaker 1: And it used to be kind of covert and now it's blatant very often, right in your face.  And it's difficult to learn how to respond to some of the things that are happening now, which you kind of knew they were happening, but you didn't see them, and people certainly didn't articulate them and show them to you.  And now they do.  And so what is my response?  They--there's, there--I know there's that line in one--in my book ['The Color of Culture,' Mona Lake Jones] that says, "Hm, should I demonstrate, tolerate, educate, negotiate or just kick ass?"  And that, now you really do have to make those choices because it's right in front of you.  What am I gonna do with this?  And so in this Wednesday conversation with my seniors, we talk about what to do with all those things that are happening to us; and how do we still have faith, hope?  How do we still pray for those who are obviously not in our corner?  Should we pray for those who are--I mean there're just, you know, simple questions that, that come to mind that we have to grapple with.  So we, Wednesdays we do the senior thing, and it's a fun group of forty or so people, and we do a lot of eating (laughter).  We do a lot of talking (laughter), a lot of problem solving.  Sometimes we cry and sometimes we laugh.  It's helpful (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now how--how many are involved?
Speaker 1: How many are what?
Speaker 2: Are involved in the group?
Speaker 1: About, we have about forty every, every session, and we break up into small groups so that everybody gets a voice.  So we'll throw a question out there and then--or two, and then we, we break into small groups so that everybody gets an opportunity to talk, talk, talk if they need to.  And for many of the seniors, this is their best talking time of the week because they are somewhat isolated, and maybe don't get to do a whole lotta talking.  And so we have rules about talking too long (laughter), and shutting other people down.  So you can't tell anybody that they're wrong in this group.  You can, not agree with them, and dislike what they say, but you can't say, "That is wrong."  We don't do that.  So it's an interesting dynamic that happens with these seniors who very often assume they're absolutely right 'cause they've lived it, and they know it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, is there any particular topic that agitates them the most?
Speaker 1: Well, right now, it's the whole pol- political thing.  So politics is--nobody can understand what's happening right now.
Speaker 2: On the national level--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --with the president.
Speaker 1: Yeah, with the president.
Speaker 2: Number 45 [President Donald John Trump].
Speaker 1: Number 45, and most people don't speak the name, they just say 45, and keep on talking.  That seems to, it keeps seeping back into whatever we're talking about because every week or every day there's a new--I couldn't have believed that this would have been done or said.  So, yeah, that kind of keeps coming back in the framework.
Story_ID: 671722
Speaker 1: Now since we last talked, talked in twenty- 2007, I know you had at least three books out, I think, at that point.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Four books.
Speaker 1: Four books, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, three books then, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And how many books have you written since then?
Speaker 2: So, so since then two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I have one that just was published this past year, and it's called 'Nectar from Grandhoney' [Mona Lake Jones], and I don't know if you will remember, but a lot of people call me Grandhoney, and my grandchildren do that.  But I wasn't the first to have that name.  My grandmother was Grandhoney, and that's how Grandhoney came into our, into our family, into our being.  So the thinking on that book was to put down some thoughts for folks just to ponder and to--there, there's this, there's this thing that says, "We have the need to ponder and to let our minds roam and wander, looking for concrete words to say why things are this way.  And sometimes we may find it difficult to draw conclusions because reality mixes with our illusions and it may seem that when our thinking becomes blurred, that's when our greatest solutions have occurred, for that, that moment when we have examined all that is at stake, that we figure out which path to take.  And we're glad when our prediction has come true, and it turns out that we knew, but if life decides to take a different turn, then we simply view it as a lesson learned.  And once again, sometimes it's good to be perplexed and to wonder what may be coming next."  And so just kind of based on that poem that I had written, I put together what I call Ponders, just things to, to think about, to let your mind sit on for a minute and contemplate (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So each--yeah, each page is sort of a broad side of a statement or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --question--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what are some of the statements in question?
Speaker 2: Well, one of my favorite ones is: "Kindness is magnetic.  It draws out the best in others," and the, the whole notion that if, you know, kinda of what goes around comes around, there are probably two hundred sayings in the book that hopefully, will give you just a little bit of something that you can relate to, something that you can agree with, disagree with, ponder on for a minute and say, "Hm, hm."  So, so that each one, I'm hopeful, will give you a chance to even write a Ponder yourself because I think that everybody has a, just a little thought that they've kind of come up with.  So at the end of the book, I leave space for you to write down your Ponder.  Do you have something that you can think about?
Story_ID: 671723
Speaker 1: So, now you, you played a role in the campaign of Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] around here [Seattle, Washington], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I did, like everybody else.  I went down and sat in the telephone banks, dropped the flyers, did the, the doorbelling and the calling, gave money, went to Obama parties and we had a big party here at our home when it was election time.  And I tell you, it was a celebration that you would not believe (laughter).  We, we had folks up in here, grown men crying and (laughter), of course, women were crying.  Every- everybody was in tears and celebrating, and I--the only thing that, that saddened me was that my mom [Pauline Sims Lake] and dad [Sylvester Lake] weren't here to see it happen.  It was--they just missed it.  Dad was ninety-two and mother was ninety-one, and they had been gone for about a year 'cause they were about six months apart, and it was like, oh, I just--they would have been so thrilled to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They just missed it, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so they would have been thrilled to have seen all of that come to being.  So, yes, I was one of many who did the, the kinds of things that we hope contributed to his being the president--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --both time- both times.
Speaker 1: --were you optimistic all along?
Speaker 2: Optimistic--
Speaker 1: Especially the first time.  Did you really think he, it was gonna happen?
Speaker 2: But, but not really sure that this thing could happen.  Optimistic, but, really?  And so I think the, the actuality of it was, was just such an overcoming, joyful experience.  The second time was grand too, but the first time was, just--I'm like everybody else.  You know, you were kinda walking around speechless that this really, really, truly did happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I, I had this, this really false sense, and to--proven to be such, that things were gonna be wonderful, that people were gonna, "Oh, isn't this wonderful, finally, this race thing is going to be dissipated and we're gonna love each other," and I, I don't know why I was so full of that, but I was.  And it didn't take too long to find out that that was not the reality.  So, yeah, by the second time, it was, "Whew, we did it again."  But it wasn't the same sort of, this is gonna make everybody love each other.  We had already learned that that wasn't necessarily gonna be the case.
Speaker 1: Yeah since, since his second term ended, the country has kind of made a flip, even though President Trump [President Donald John Trump] didn't win the popular vote, he's still the president, right, so.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, and, you know, we, we, we often, and we're at a party or a dinner party or something with friends, I, I, I used to say to our friends--or I say it now, as they come over, I said, "Okay, everybody has two minutes, three minutes to talk about what's ailing you, where you're hurt--why you're hurting and what's the best way to approach it.  And that's it," (laughter) we, 'cause we find we'd be spending time on, "Oh, and this is--have you tried, you know, aspirin and orange juice or have you," (laughter) you know, whatever.  We'd be remedying each other, and that kind of stuff.  So, so now, I say, okay, Trump for, you know, and that's it because he can ruin a party (laughter).  He can ruin a whole gathering just that, you know, the mention of, of his name among us is enough to trigger off a tsunami as they say (laughter).  So rather than mess up the whole vibe of joy, it's best not to talk politics for a little bit.
Story_ID: 671724
Speaker 1: One of your passions is youth and you were talking about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --some of your youth activities has been siphoned off into working with seniors, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) I know it's, it's re- that transition just kind of slowly happened because my focus has always been youth and doing whatever I can do to help youth be successful.  And I still do some work in terms of scholarships for youth and, and my, my Links chapter [The Links, Incorporated], I was the chair of the Services to Youth.  And so we focused everything on youth.  I'm the one who, who started the SAT classes for our kids and, and I, I, I'm the one who went out and, and generated money from the tech companies so that they could have computers and blah, blah, blah.  But now, in this kind of seniorness that I find myself, I see a need on the other end of the spectrum.  And so, like I'm doing, working on a conference now on ageism in Seattle [Washington].  And, and so what services are available, what ways are there that seniors can still be active participants in life.  If you're thinking of growing old--if you're--how does that go?  If thinking of growing old bothers your soul, just leave that behind and remember the rainbows that are yet to come and so forth.  I try to do things that help seniors still feel a sense of inclusiveness and usefulness, and, again, that goes back to my Wednesday group.  But there are so many now avenues to work with senior services, and, and I do a senior fitness class twice a week, and we do exercises that are to tell our bodies that they still can be active and live more comfortably if you move and if you exercise.  And, and so I take part in the senior--and I've been taking Tai Chi with the seniors.  So I'm seniorizing now, and I'm enjoying those activities with my husband.  Joe [Joe Jones] and I have been married now for fifty-three years, and so we've kinda grown old together and literally growing old together.  And so we realize that there are things that we aren't as vigorous in our attempt to do now (laughter), and so we know we have to stay active.  So a part of that is doing things with him.
Story_ID: 671725
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at your career--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, before I even ask you that, let me--I didn't ask you about the reception of your book, your latest book.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'Nectar from Grandhoney' [Mona Lake Jones].  How was it received and, and how--is there a distribution plan for it, and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the 'Nectar from Grandhoney' really is just kind of getting out there.  We, we did it at the end of last year, and it is just getting into bookstores now, and on to Amazon [Amazon.com, Inc.], and I've taken it out as I've done public speaking.  So when I go out to do a speech, I take my little 'Nectar from Grandhoney' with me and sign a contract that says I'll do a book signing afterwards, and so it's that--that's kind of big in the first movement of it, getting out there.  And people like it.  I'm very proud of it.  It's an easy read so that you can--a friend just told me the other day that she had to sit at the hospital with her father who was ill, and they each read one of the Ponders and talked about it.  And they were able to go through almost half the book in that sit- one sitting, as they discussed the, the little thoughtfuls as I like to think of them.  And so it is a book that's an easy read.  And it's provocative in some of the things that I say.  So, you can like some of them or dislike some of them, embrace some of them, smile about some.  There's one in there, I was thinking about as it was raining this morning, as raindrops were coming down in Seattle [Washington].  And it says that in Seattle, folks, instead of carrying umbrellas, they simply learn how to do the quick step.  And we just--real Seattleites, hardly any of us get--we just, you move.  When the rain comes, we (laughter), we know it's time to move a little more quickly.  Little, little thoughtful things about Seattle and about being black are interspersed in the, in the book so that you, you're reading along.  And then something kinda pops up to you and it's a little controversial 'cause I can't write a book without celebrating being black.  I mean it's just hard for me to do because I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's what I was gonna ask you if there was a--
Speaker 2: --I like who I am so much.
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it had a cultural--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --like an African American cultural, or black cultural flare to it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it--
Speaker 1: And--'cause if you look at the cover, you don't necessarily get that impression.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I try to (background noise) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) but the name sort of indicates--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Pause.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: All right, so, now, I was just thinking, I was thinking that it has a--the title has an African American flavor to it--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and that the cover doesn't necessarily suggest as such, but it seems to be a book though, that a lot of people could get, you know, some wisdom from.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I hope so, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did it take you a long time to write it?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm the kind of person who gets these thoughts, and I put 'em on a piece of paper, stuck 'em in the notebook.  I get an idea and I put it on my computer.  So it was really a matter of, of, you know, making a compilation of all the, the ideas.  I, I always knew I was gonna do something like this.  So I've been keeping track of my Ponders, my thoughts, and it was a matter of putting them all together in one place is what it was.  So, and some of the one liners were--you will find in the context of a couple of my books 'cause I stuck some of those in 'The Color of Culture' [Mona Lake Jones] book so you'll say, "Oh, yeah, I remember having read that in, in one of her books."  It was a fun book to put together, and when I've gone out to do the book talks, it's hard for me to get through much of it because people wanna talk about the (laughter), you know, I'll throw a Ponder out there, and they wanna talk about it.  And everybody has a different twist, a different take, and it's interesting to see, too, how they have interpreted what I've said.  And that's not really what I meant at all.  So that's fun to get feedback from folks to see what their thinking is on it.  And so the name, 'Nectar from Grandhoney' implies the kind of sweet thoughts that I wanted to put out there from me.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and that, that's interesting like, that a work of art, like has a life of its own when it's released.
Story_ID: 671726
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a plan for another book?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have two children's books that are almost done.  And I've taken 'em out to the schools and tried 'em out on the kids.  And I, I think they're--I think--of course, I'm the author, but the kids liked them.  The teachers li- have liked them.  So those are my next two projects.  They're actually done now, and, and I'm looking for publishers for the--and that's a whole 'nother genre, you know, to do the children's books, and so it's a different avenue to take, and, and I've not been in that arena of publication before with children's books.  But they're really good.  I have two done and another one almost done.  So I'll, I'll be able to go to the publisher with two completed ones and the other one in the making, which is almost done.  So we'll see what happens with those, but that--those are my next two--those are my next project, are the children's books.

Speaker 1: Okay, now when you look back at everything you've done to this point--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --is there anything major that you would do differently if you could go back and change the trajectory of your life in some way?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  I, I kind of like the path that I've taken.  I know there could be improvements on it.  I could do a better job on just about everything that I've done.  I really know that.  But I feel very proud and very accomplished and very good about most of the choices that I've made.  At, at my age to--I think, to be able to look back and, and kind of find some joy in what you've done is an accomplishment in itself.  And so the changes that I would make would be the kind of changes that might, might have had me spend a little more time on my investigation and my education in my, in my marketing, my parenting, my--just little, but not--I'm very proud of my children.  I think, you know, if you ask me my greatest accomplishment, I would say my children.  They are the, just the kind of people that I would hope the world embrace.  They are giving, kind, smart, likeable folks, who are contributing to the world in all kinds of ways themselves.
Speaker 1: How many do you have?
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A boy [Brent Jones] and a girl [Dana Jones Walker], and then two others that were not officially ours that kind of lived with us off and on.  We always seemed to have other kids living in our house.  But two biological, and they are grown now, with their children.  And they're parenting.  I can see myself in the kind of parenting things that they're doing, and their grandchildren look like they're gonna be okay too.  So if you said, "Mona [HistoryMaker Mona Lake Jones], what's your greatest accomplishment?" I would say, my children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then having had this long, loving relationship with my husband [Joe Jones] for fifty-three years, and, you know, relationships take a lot of work because there's bumps and lumps and the road smooths out, and then one grows and one's not quite there yet.  And then the other one has a growth spurt, and, and so I've been able to weather all that and still come out on the end of it, enjoying still the relationship and feeling a sense of love and accomplishment in having been able to, to do that.  So my personal choices in relationships, children and, and husband and my mother and father were just these wonderful people who I think I made proud, and I wasn't able to love them until the end.  Those have been secondary to the kinds of outward appearance things like my contributions to education and, and writing and authoring books, and being active in the community.  Those are secondary to my relational kinds of accomplishments, I think.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm, I'm hopeful that we can, not just survive but to thrive, to--that our youth, that our young people can find a place in the future that will allow them to be all that they possibly can be, contribute all they possibly can contribute and that people will embrace that and allow that to happen; that we can--you know that old corny saying that Rodney King, "Can't we just all get along?"--I mean that people can get along and respect one another, that African American community can thrive.  I just keep coming back to that word, that people won't squash us and stomp on us and kill us and stop us and do all those--place all those impediments in our, in our pathways that don't allow us to, to be the best folks we can be.  So the African American community is, I think, sometimes very fragile, sometimes at our own doings, but a lot of the times it's because the broader society--we live in a racist society, and I don't know if it will always be there.  I know it will be in my lifetime.  But we can overcome that, and we can, you know, I'll say, corny too, you know, how we sing that song, "We shall overcome some day" ['We Shall Overcome].  Well, I don't know when that day is going to be, but I have faith that it can happen.  And I'm counting on our, I'm counting on our youth to be strong enough and wise enough and patient enough and hardworking enough to make that happen.

Speaker 1: Now, is there anything we haven't talked about that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I like, I like talking about being black.  I like celebrating blackness; and, you know, I grew up in a predominantly white environment over east of the mountains [in Washington], and I know people have asked me, "How did you get so black and how did you--how, how do you celebrate, how do you like being black so much when you were around so many--?"  Well, I just respect my community and my parents and all of those folks who helped me be Mona [HistoryMaker Mona Lake Jones], and I like the, the cultural things about our blackness.  There's that one poem ['Love in the Kitchen,' Mona Lake Jones] that talks about, "It wasn't the greens simmering on the stove or the smell of canned strawberry jam or the pies cooling on the countertop.  It wasn't even the gravy being stirred to pour over the mashed potatoes.  It was love that filled our kitchen."  I think about our kitchen, and I think about all the stories that were told and the songs that were sung.  I think about sitting on the church--and my, my mother [Pauline Sims Lake] giving me the eye when I was about to do something that shouldn't be done.  I think about my Grandhoney who sang songs to me and, and loved me no matter what I did.  I think about my father [Sylvester Lake] who didn't really have to say anything.  He'd just look, and who would give me books of poetry to read, and make me think I was okay.  I think about how my parents had to undo so many messages that were sent to me about the negativeness of being black that were bestowed upon me by educational institutions that I went through and--but how those folks in my community would pat me and hug me and tell me that black was beautiful and being a girl and a woman was sweet; and so I just love being a black person and being a member of the black community and being in this world and in these, you know, in this United States, no matter what they sometimes heap on us.  I like being black.  So I celebrate it all the time.  So when I can represent, I, I, I do.  When I can see someone's attitude maybe change just a little bit about blackness because of something I said or I did or I wrote or a conversation or a look that I gave or a kindness that I rendered, that makes me happy.  And it reinforces how being black is a wonderful thing.  And, you know, others--a line in one of my books--I think it's in the 'Grandhoney' ['Nectar from Grandhoney,' Mona Lake Jones] that says I wouldn't change my color.  I would only like to change the response to my color that some folks have.  And so whenever I can--and I'm grateful to have a voice to be able to still talk to folks and make an impact on what their thinking might be.  I love and appreciate that skill that I have, and the voice that I've been given to, to represent.

Speaker 1: The last question is--yeah, and thank you for giving me an answer to that middle, that before the last question 'cause nobody hardly--hardly anybody has anything to say when we get to that point.
Speaker 2: About what?
Speaker 1: About, when I ask them if there's anything else you wanna--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --add.
Speaker 2: Oh, is that right?  Oh (laughter)--
Speaker 1: You had something significant to add (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter).
Speaker 1: You, Asa Hilliard [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III], and there's about two or three others.
Speaker 2: Oh, Asa was my friend.
Speaker 1: Really, did--yeah.  So the last question is this.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Hm.  I think that I would like folks to say, she was a good, a good person, but for the following reasons: she was a good person because she was able to convey a sense of kindness and a sense of responsibility.  I'd like them to say that she was a good person because she was an author and a speaker who wrote and talked about things that were worthy of being talked about and spoken of and imparted some sense of wisdom, a little bit of wisdom.  I'd like them to think that she was a good person because she worked very hard in her community to uplift.  I'd like them to say she was a good person because she was a good mother and a good kind of citizen, and maybe that she was able to make a small difference while she was here.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Oh, you're very welcome (laughter).
