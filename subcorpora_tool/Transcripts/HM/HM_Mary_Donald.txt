Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, can you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Donald Frank St. Mary.  And Donald, of course, is D-O-N-A-L-D, Frank is the standard F-R-A-N-K.  St. Mary is, needs a little spelling.  It is, capital S-T-period, a space, capital M-A-R-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there a story behind the last name St. Mary?  It's--
Speaker 2: It is not really clear to me.  That begins (laughter) to ask a question about my ancestry, which certainly is not something that I have delved into extensively.  But I can only say a tiny little bit, and it just confuses the issue in my mind (laughter), namely, that my father's sister said that her grandfather, my great grandfather, came from Spain.  And he had the name St. Mary.  That doesn't really make sense to me (laughter), from Spain.  His name probably should have been Santa Maria or something.  And so, I leave it there with respect to how the name exists, I don't know.  But she claims that my great grandfather had the name St. Mary.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, perhaps they Anglicized it once they, you know, at a certain point or something, you know.
Speaker 2: Could well have.
Speaker 1: Okay, I thought I'd ask that one.  And, sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is July 22nd, 1940, and I was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Let me mention that I am currently retired.  I was a professor of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.  I am a mathematician and I think of my profession as being mathematician, professor and academic administrator.  But currently, I am called Professor Emeritus.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I think I've heard you say at one point you were Chairman of the Department for eight years, right?
Speaker 2: That is correct.  I chaired the Department of Mathematics and Statistics for eight years, in fact, until I retired.  We can certainly talk extensively about that if you'd like or we can come back to it at a future point.
Speaker 1: We'll come back to it down the line.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is the 8th of October, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in, we're on the University of Massachusetts, Amherst campus.  We're in the building that houses the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.  And currently, we are actually in the colloquium room, and meeting rooms of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we always ask as sort of a warm up, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Do I have a favorite food?  Maybe my wife would do a better job of answering that (laughter), I'm not sure.  I, I can't name anything immediately.  I like food (laughter), okay, all kinds of food (laughter).  So favorite, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, it is red.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Okay, historically, I have always loved Spring.  Spring in New England is gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, flowers everywhere, bursting for just many, many, many weeks.  There's another period in New England, outer part of New England, where the leaves turn golden and red and rust and all these beautiful colors.  Many, many people like that, that season.  But I prefer Spring.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).  I like cities, so I would never choose to go to the mountains to camp (laughter).  I much prefer to go to New York City or San Francisco or Washington, D.C. and just mill around, watch the people.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  Certainly, I have lived my life along the lines of, or tried to live it, along the lines of the Golden Rule.  But otherwise, it's not something I say (laughter).
Story_ID: 24190
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother has a most unusual first name.  I don't think I've ever met anybody or heard of anybody that has that name.  It's Daietta, D-A-I-E-T-T-A, Daietta.  Her middle name is Elizabeth, the standard spelling of Elizabeth.  Now, her maiden name was Perez, P-E-R-E-Z.  And, of course, she became Daietta Elizabeth St. Mary.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay, I know I made a note of that for you (laughter), and, but I don't remember her date of birth.  We can check it and make a note of it later.
Speaker 1: About what year would you think?
Speaker 2: Nineteen O eight [1908].
Speaker 1: 1908, okay.  All right, was she born in Lake Charles [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: No, she was born in St. Martinville, Louisiana.  St. Martinville.
Speaker 1: Is that near Lake Charles?
Speaker 2: It's not very far.  It's more in the South, towards the Southeastern part of Louisiana whereas Lake Charles is in the Southwestern part.  But it's not just a suburb of Lake Charles.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing in history?
Speaker 2: I can't tell you much at all about that side of the family, or the other, as far as that's concerned.  But I didn't know my grandfather on my mother's side, didn't know grandfather at all.  I knew a step grandfather from some later period.  But I didn't know my real grandfather, and that, I didn't know my real grandfather on the other side either.  But I knew my grandmother, my mother's mother (laughter).  I knew her very well.  She was the patriarch of the family and ruled the family.  And the family in the neighborhood in which I lived was extensive (laughter).  But she was (laughter) the person to whom everybody responded and listened to, and she always put in what she thought needed to happen.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: The name Big Mother (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --it was always Big Mother, but we can come back to that.  I made a note of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But it wasn't, her real name was not familiar to me so much as, it was Big Mother (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so everybody called her Big Mother?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, that's how she was--
Speaker 1: And did she live in Lake Charles when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I can tell you about it, if you'd like, the neighborhood or we can go on to my father's side, whichever you like.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us a little bit about your mother growing and did she grow up in Lake Charles or in St. Martinsville?
Speaker 2: It seems she came to Lake Charles at an early point in her life.  All right, my mother, she became eventually, an elementary school teacher.  And, but--let's try to start at a different place.  Much, much earlier on she, at some, a fairly early point in her life went to Xavier University, studying elementary education.  I'm not sure how long she was there.  But she got a certificate to be able to teach elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is Xavier [University] in New Orleans, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, I was a tiny boy, not going to school yet.  My mother got a job in Lake Charles, right, well, rural, rural part of Lake Charles, teaching for the parish, the parish is like the county, it's the political designation of things like county is, it's called parishes in Louisiana.  She taught in a one-room school, grades one through eight.  Now, I was a little boy, not yet in school, as I mentioned.  She took me to the school with her because I guess there wasn't anything else to do with me most of the time or maybe I didn't go every day.  But I remember going.  That school had a wood-burning stove.  So the first thing she had to do was to start that wood-burning stove, even though she had an assistant who sometimes started it because the assistant prepared the lunch meals for, for the kids.  But she taught all the grades, one through eight.  That went on for a number of years.  The school was actually called St. John Elementary School.  Of course, this was an all-black school.  And she taught kids in all the grades.  Now, I'm not exactly sure how long she taught in that school, and, of course, eventually, I went off to school myself.  But then she got a job, well, in the, in the mid-1950s, the local college in our town, McNeese State College was forced, of course, kicking and screaming, it was forced to integrate.  And my mother went and finished a degree in elementary education, at which point she was able to get a job in, in the Lake Charles City school systems which was a more urban and more normal school.  Let me mention an aside here to, to help set the stage for the environment in which we lived.  I have seen my mother's two certificates.  In fact, I brought them along.  We can find them if you'd like to take a look at them.  The first one, remember from Xavier University says that she was qualified to teach in Negro elementary schools, lower elementary schools.  Now, the second one, remember came from, through McNeese State College, which was, until the mid-'50's [1950s], an all white institution.  So she got her degree from this institution that presumably educated everybody the same way.  But her certificate from (laughter), given by the state, as a result of her degree from McNeese State College, said, she was qualified to teach in Negro (laughter) upper elementary grade.
Speaker 1: So even then in the '50's [1950s], they still had the qualification that, I mean, yeah--
Speaker 2: That's right (laughter).
Speaker 1: Even with a BS in education?
Speaker 2: Yep.  So she taught in the Lake Charles elementary school system for years and years and years until she retired.  I could tell you a little bit more about her.  She, she certainly was the matriarch of our family.  She was a high-strung person (laughter), a worrier, always worried about something is gonna happen or such a thing as opposed to my father, who was very, very calm, extremely, extremely slow to anger (laughter).  So I will, I will stop there until you have some questions about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, is there any, you said you never heard the Daietta before, is there any explanation about where it came from at all?
Speaker 2: I, I do not know.  Daietta, yes.
Speaker 1: Daietta, okay.
Speaker 2: A most unusual name.  I have never heard it as a, before or since.  But she was called by her friends, Dah, and that was Dah (laughter).
Story_ID: 24191
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: And spell it for us.
Speaker 2: He is Frank, F-R-A-N-K, and that's my middle name, of course, Joseph, J-O-S-E-P-H, St. Mary, exactly the same spelling as I use.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: It was in '08' [1908] as well (laughter).  I will have to check on what those dates really were for you at some point if we have a break.
Speaker 1: And was he born in Lake Charles or--
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.  He was born in Lake Charles.  His, his baptismal certificate which I have seen says that he was born in Lake Charles.  My inclination is to believe there is a, a little town that is about, oh, ten miles outside of Lake Charles, called Chloe, C-H-L-O-E, Chloe, Louisiana.  I don't know if it's incorporated or not or anything like that.  And it is very, very like--he grew up there.  And the whole family lived there.  And so it's very likely he was born in a home there in that town.  That's my speculation.  My father went to school only during the early part of his life.  I don't think he recalled how many grades he actually went to, maybe six or seven.  And then went to work.  He started to work.  I don't know, maybe it was part time, and this was a farming community, that part of Lake Charles.  But he started to work for this company.  This company was called Farmer's Land and Canal Company.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what's that again?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the name of the company Farmer's Land and Canal Company.
Speaker 1: How do you spell--
Speaker 2: Now, let me tell you--
Speaker 1: --I'm sorry.  How do you spell Farma?
Speaker 2: It's regular, just like the person who goes out and digs in the earth.
Speaker 1: Oh, Farmer's, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Farmers Land--
Speaker 2: F-A-R-M-E-R, apostrophe-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, Farmer's Land and--
Speaker 2: --and Canal Company.
Speaker 1: And Canal Company, okay.
Speaker 2: And it turns out amazingly enough, my father worked for that company all his life.  He never worked for a different company, but (laughter) let me clarify that I assure you, it was not a joy ride.  Let me tell you just one little point as to why I say that.  My father never made over $100 a week as best I can tell from looking at old records.  I saw a, a W-2 type form that he received in 1972, which indicated that his salary was right at $100 a month--I'm sorry, a week.  And that was essentially at the end of his work life, all right.  He retired at about sixty five.  So, I extrapolate that he essentially made over $100 a week.  And so much of his life, he clearly made a lot, lot less than that.  He, when I knew him, he got up at some ungodly hour every morning like 5:30.  He had the wisdom to eat oatmeal every morning, all his life (laughter), which some people think is good.  I don't know.  He left before I got up in the mornings, okay, went to work.  He usually got home 5:30 or 6:00.  There were no holidays.  Here we are on Columbus Day which is a holiday here at the university, and across much of the nation where people, many of them don't have to go to work.  No, my father went to work.  New Year's Day was never a holiday.  It was a work day.  Thanksgiving was never a holiday.  It was just a normal work day.  I presume the only holiday was Christmas Day.  So, he was the steady (laughter), the steadying hand in our household, when, when my mother was the, the high-strung one, and he would say, ah, it's all right.  It's going to be all right (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, that's, so did he have any retirement benefits when he--
Speaker 2: No, nothing, nothing, but--
Speaker 1: It's just the end of work.
Speaker 2: That's it, nothing but social security when he--
Speaker 1: Social security, okay.
Speaker 2: --when he retired.
Speaker 1: Wow, that's something.  Now, was his situation, would you say was unusual in those days or the regular, pretty typical of what happened?
Speaker 2: My inclination is to believe that it was probably pretty typical for a common--well, he was a laborer, all right.  And let me elaborate a little bit about, for example, the name, Farmer's, Farmer, Land and Canal Company.  This was a rice farming company.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: It grew commercial rice.  Now, rice needs water, all right.  It is flooded for a certain period during its growing time.  And so that's why it was called "canal".  They had a system of canals and pumps, huge pumps that could move water, all right, from a canal into a field and flood it.  And they had what's called locks, of course, so they could lock the water in there and they could release these locks and let the water out.  And so the name, Farmer's Land, huge, huge land, canals.  That's where it all came from.  And he worked as a laborer on that, for that big corporation.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lake Charles is historically like rice-growing country, you know.
Speaker 2: It is, indeed.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: As I, when I was a little boy, the rice, I don't know what you call it, mill, maybe or the rice storage place was called, was considered the largest one in the country.  So you're right on target that, it was the rice growing belt of the country.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you know anything at all about your father's ancestry?
Speaker 2: Except what I've told you to this point, namely, that my great grandfather's name, my father's sister says was Dick.  That's what she said, his name was Dick, I guess from Richard.  His wife's name as Dahlia.  And they had a large number of kids like, I have all of the names of their kids, but I, I couldn't say many of them.  But my, my grandfather apparently was the oldest, my father's father was the oldest of these, say eight kids.
Speaker 1: And what was his name?
Speaker 2: France--
Speaker 1: F-R-
Speaker 2: F-R-A-N-C-E, that's what my aunt would tell me.  His name was France, and he was France Joseph.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: St. Mary.
Story_ID: 24192
Speaker 1: Okay, now, would your family be considered Creoles in that part of the country?
Speaker 2: Yeah, very likely.  They were thought of Creoles.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was that the identity that the, I mean 'cause there are some people we've interviewed that, you know, are in a Creole family and everybody speaks some French or they have some other, you know--they have a certain amount, certain recipes and cultures that they practice that identifies them as Creole.  Is that true in your family?
Speaker 2: To some extent.  My matriarchal grandmother, okay, she spoke, and my mother spoke French to one another, frequently.  My father on the other side understood essentially, no, no French.  But, so there was French spoken, but it was on my mother's side of the family.  But none of the kids, I'm calling myself a kid and my, all of my first cousins, none of us spoke French.  We didn't speak French to one another.  And some of them learned it more because their parents spoke more of it.  But in our household itself, except when my grandmother was there, there was no French spoken.  As far as foods are concerned, I think there were dishes, but they're just indigenous to that, that area and not so much Creole, like, you know, you had gumbo and you had fish etouffee and fish gouvion and shrimp Creole and shrimp etouffee. But I think everybody made those dishes (laughter).  I don't think it was, it was just, those were indigenous to that area of Louisiana.  And, you know, all across Southern Louisiana into New Orleans, you get those same dishes.  So they may have been called Creole way back there, I don't know.  But they were just normal.
Speaker 1: So you're saying that the designation of being a Creole was kind of losing its special quality or something when you were growing up in a sense, do you think?
Speaker 2: It could well have been.  It certainly was there, but it did not, it didn't have any significant connotations.  I can tell you a story about that too.  I'll tell you this since you've talked, you got onto this subject.  Of course, I look like what people think of as a Creole, okay.  Well, I spent quite a number of summer at Southern University.  Southern University is a predominantly black institution and way back then (laughter), it was all black.  And there is a town in Central Northern Louisiana called Cane River.  There are books about Cane River, and it has, it apparently thinks of itself or it was the center of the Creole culture, all right.  And so at Southern University, everybody is there, everybody is, and so I had spent any number of summers there.  And so one summer a woman, back then, we'd say a girl (laughter), talking to me who knew me, she says, and I'll brag about this.  She says, you look like the people from Cane River, but you don't act like 'em (laughter).  So, I was delighted (laughter).  I wasn't associated in any negative way with the people from Cane River.
Speaker 1: Okay, and she was referring to negative behaviors rather than positive behaviors.
Speaker 2: I fear as much (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, Cane River, that's the area that Gene Tumor writes about in Cane the novel.
Speaker 2: That could be.  I have read one novel about it, but I don't remember who the author was.  It's not my kind of reading, really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24193
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were telling us about your grandfather before we took a little break.  Can you, you gave us his name.  His name was France Joseph, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  Now, I never knew him.  But I knew my grandmother, my maternal grandmother.  I knew her well.  She lived in, next door to me with my father's [Frank Joseph St. Mary] sister, the same one I've been alluding to.  She was delightful.  Oh, just the nicest person, easy going, just very pleasant to be with.  And she was my father's mother, and my father clearly had some of his traits from her (laughter).  And, of course, I never knew my father's father, so don't know what kind of person he was.  But Mama Teen, that's how--her name was Celestine.  And so we called her Mama Teen, as opposed to the other grandmother, Big Mama (laughter), or Big Mother.  So, I can't say anything about that grandfather except he was a rice farmer, all right.  And as best I can tell, a sharecropper.  So this, this begins to explain how my father ended up working on a rice farming, for a rice farming company all his life, that his father did some similar type thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, it's obvious that you have probably quite a bit of European ancestry, but is there, are there any stories about that in the family passed down as to who or what or what happened?
Speaker 2: There may be stories, all right.  But unfortunately, as I look back on it, I'm not one who paid much attention to those stories or, or captured them in any way.  Maybe I have an excuse (laughter).  Mathematics is a very, very demanding mistress.  And I started studying mathematics very, very early on, and it took, it took my focus and my concentration and such things.  So I didn't pay attention to whatever other stories.  I'm sure there are stories.  I just don't know them (laughter).
Story_ID: 24194
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Oh, hello, you raise, you raise questions here.  Okay, our house was in the city, all right.  We didn't live in the country.  We lived in the city.  Let's call it the city.  Now, what I mean is, I lived in a neighborhood where there were single-family houses, all right, on small lots.  Like our lot was fifty feet wide in the front, and I think it was seventy five feet deep or eighty feet, something like that, okay.  My father [Frank Joseph St. Mary] and probably friends had actually built the house.  We had an outhouse, all right, earliest childhood memories, outhouse, all right.  We did not have plumbing.  I don't know if I should go farther in telling you about that or not, but you couldn't, you couldn't because this is the city, and you have, lived on a small lot, you couldn't be digging holes in your backyard (unclear).  That would never work, okay, because your whole yard would be filled up very quickly.  So, there was a toilet man, pulled by a horse-drawn, it's a horse-drawn tank.  And so, your, your outhouse or can was emptied by the toilet man.  So you talk about--and you knew when the toilet man was in the neighborhood.  There's no question (laughter), enough said.  I remember when plumbing came into our street, okay.  When they put the central plumbing line down in the middle of the street, I remember that, and shortly thereafter, my father and, and the neighbors put in our plumbing line into the house, so we had in-the-house sewage disposal.  So, all right, we seemed always to have electricity in, in my recollection.  But my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, I remember didn't.  She used what was called then coal oil.  Coal oil, I'm sure it's just kerosene, but it was called coal oil, coal oil lamps in her house.  I remember when our house got its telephone, first telephone.  So, early childhood memories--
Speaker 1: How old were you when the first telephone came?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I can't say.
Speaker 1: Were you a little kid?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so.  But that was long after the public sewer system came in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't know how old I was.  I just remember it being--
Speaker 1: Now, this is all in the '40's [1940s] then, all this takes place in the '40's [1940s], I guess, right?  You were born in 1940 so--
Speaker 2: I was born in 1940.  Certainly, the sewer system and such things came in, in the '40's [1940s].  So it must have been in the late '40's [1940s] that we first got a telephone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, oh, somewhere in the '50's [1950s], I would guess '52' [1952] or '53' [1953] that we got a television set.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So there are some childhood memories.
Story_ID: 24195
Speaker 1: So was your neighborhood all black, I mean all African American?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  We lived in an all-black neighborhood.  Everything was rigidly segregated.  I went to all-black elementary and high school, with all the, all the students were black.  I went to a Catholic school, and some of the teachers were, were nuns who were white.  But all the lay teachers were black.  So, I grew up in the black community, wholly and totally.  I never ate at a lunch counter in my hometown, all right.  That, that never happened.  I had left before it became possible for, for us to do those kind of things.
Speaker 1: Now, you've described, I wanna get back to this in a minute, but I forgot to ask you about your brothers and sisters.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, tell us about your--can you name 'em and tell us where you fit into the--
Speaker 2: Yes, of course.  I, I have two sisters.  The oldest sister is Winifred, W-I-N-I-F-R-E-D, Agnes and her married name is Noel, N-O-E-L.  She's four years older than I am, has lived in California for many, many years.  She actually got a doctorate degree from, from here, from University of Massachusetts.  And she was a psychological counselor.  She worked at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville for a while and spent the latter part and the bulk of her career at the University of California, Davis doing psychological counseling.  My, my other sister, she, Winifred was the oldest, and then the next sister was the middle child, and I am the third and youngest child of three.  So the second sister, her name is Patricia.  And her maiden name is Abatte, A-B-A-T-T-E.  She is two years older than I am.  She went to McNeese State College.  In fact, we overlapped for two years, and we can talk some more about that too.  And she got a degree in elementary education, and got married shortly thereafter and moved to Los Angeles and has lived in Los Angeles ever since.  She was a teacher in the L.A. public school system for her whole career.  She's retired--both my sisters are retired now.  So, in some sense, all three of us followed our mother's [Daietta Elizabeth Perez] line in this, ending up in an environment, an academic environment of some kind or another, teaching.  So, I don't know if it was direct.  We can talk a little more about that at some, some other point, but--
Story_ID: 24196
Speaker 1: When you consider your parents personalities and their talents, their dispositions, their looks even, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: In looks (laughter), I take after my mother [Daietta Elizabeth Perez].  There's just no question about that.  I look like my mother.  My personality, I think, even though there might be some debate about this, my mother was well (laughter) known in the family.  I think I take after my father [Frank Joseph St. Mary].  I have many of his mannerisms that I recognize.  I have sayings that I remember him using.  So I definitely have a lot from, from his way of thinking, and at least I think my temperament is much, much, much more like his temperament than like my mother's temperament (laughter), which I've already told you was high strung (laughter).
Story_ID: 24197
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Okay, we lived a block and a half from, from a railroad track, nothing unusual about that.  The railroad track always goes (laughter) through the black section of town (laughter).  So you always heard the trains, all right.  I already told you about a very distinct aroma that existed (laughter), that was only when I was a little kid, very little kid.  I don't recall any significant aromas later, after, in the later part of life.  No, there were no odors predominant in the--ah, it turns out, Lake Charles is an oil centered industrial refinement area, all right.  So, there were the plants, quote, unquote "the plants", all right.  They were not close to where we lived, all right.  But you could, you could frequently smell the plants, all right.  You got a sulfur type odor every now and then.  And so, even thought that came from far away, but it's just an indication of how much pollution they were probably expelling into the air.  So you did, did get that smell.  What did you say?  Sights?
Speaker 1: Sounds, yeah, and smells.
Speaker 2: Sounds, smells.  The sights, nothing that I can think of in particular.
Speaker 1: Okay, were the houses frame houses for the most part?
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.  They were wood, frame houses, up on short blocks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, no houses were on the ground back then.  Putting on a so-called slab was, none of the houses in my neighborhood had that.  That's maybe even a later phenomenon.  After all, these houses were built.
Speaker 1: Now, was, did Lake Charles have a black business district or strip, you know, or street, a main street?
Speaker 2: Yes, it did.  It was called, Boulevard, just Boulevard.  The official name of the street was Enterprise Boulevard, but it was just, in the community it was just called Boulevard.  And, okay, Boulevard had, of course, several bars, night clubs.  It also had cafes, okay.  I ate in the cafes, any number of them, and I liked them.  There was a shoe shop, all right.  That's very standard, when everybody had their shoes repaired, all right.  And it was an excellent shoe shop.  You'd bring your shoes there to be re-soled or re-heeled.  It was just standard, and it was a thriving business.  There was a grocery store on, on that, on Boulevard, Ontario's Grocery Store.  And there was a movie theater, Palace Theater.  I think that when I was a little kid, you could go to the movie for like twelve cents or something like that.  And was it thriving in any sense--oh, there was Price's Pharmacy too on that street.  So, in no sense could it have been have been called thriving in the sense of something now.  But back then, I think you might as well say that this was, was a vibrant neighborhood.  It didn't have the best reputation in the world, of course (laughter) because of the night clubs.  That's just how things go (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did some of the top black acts perform there?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I saw, later on in life, you know, top Jazz musicians, saw Sam Cooke, just, yes, they came, all right.  And you would see their buses.  They came in buses.  You got a different world, very different.  You'd see the bus with the sign on it, so you knew who was in town.

Speaker 1: Did you attend school early on with your mother [Daietta Elizabeth Perez]?  You said you used to go with her to school to set up?  Was that your first exposure to school, the one-room school?
Speaker 2: Yes, but I was just a tiny little boy.  So I was a hanger-on.  I don't recall that I was doing any lessons with the other students.  I just sat in a corner probably and played with something or wrote on a tablet or something because my mother had to take care of each of these groups, all right, because there's all these different groups.  She had to keep one busy while she was working with another because they were in different grades.  So eventually, I started to go to school.  And we walked to school.  So, I walked to school with my sisters, my older sisters.
Speaker 1: Now, is this a Catholic school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to a Catholic school.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Sacred Heart High School and Sacred Heart School, that was the elementary school.  And back then there was, there was not junior high.  There was only elementary school and high school.  And it was called Sacred Heart School and Sacred Heart High School.  And so I would just walk to school, school was eight blocks.  You know, I walked there for twelve years and so we knew exactly how many, how many blocks away it was (laughter).  It was eight blocks.  And so my, my father, of course, as I indicated, always was gone 'cause he left very early in the morning.  And my mother was gone too when we took off to, to walk to school.  And I remember (laughter) something about that.  It seemed to me every morning for breakfast, we had two slices of toast bread, toast.  It was always white bread then (laughter), just pure white, soft bread, two slices of toast with butter and probably sometimes cinnamon and sugar and all kind of stuff on it and coco.  My sisters loved coco.  So I had cocoa every morning.  I assure you, to this day, I hate cocoa (laughter).  I don't like coco, don't even drink any (laughter) cocoa, even though it's now better, you know.  They call it hot chocolate, and they put things in it, and it's much better, but, so, it was milk and two slices of toast.  And then we walked to school.  And early on, I'm sure they picked me up and walked me back home with them.  But that was that early experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you, what was your favorite part of school?
Speaker 2: Okay, if we're talking about that early, early period, it's, it's hard for me to say.  My recollection is not very good of the early grades.  There's a picture of me and my first-grade class all sitting in a large room.  And it looks like there could have been a hundred students in there.  It's astounding.  All of us were in, sitting in a desk, and just a huge number of students.  And later I, I remember by second or third grade, it seems that it wasn't that many students.  And there might have been more than one second grade because I start to remember a little bit about those grades a little later.  But the only recollection I have of that first grade is that picture.  So, in the early years, I certainly remember by fifth grade and sixth grade, I had become, let's call it, somewhat a diligent student, all right.  And I can, and I can cite examples that I remember, but, and I use the word "somewhat" because from my current perspective as to what a diligent student (laughter) is, I'm not sure I was one (laughter), okay.
Story_ID: 24199
Speaker 1: What was the first indication you had that you were talented as a mathematician or that you liked math?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, as I was mentioning, I was somewhat in this context that I mentioned earlier, a diligent student.  By that, I mean I did my homework.  I, you know, I was going to a Catholic school, and you had to memorize part of the catechism (laughter).  So I would memorize my, my lessons and practice them and memorize them.  And coming through the grades, I don't have any particular recollection of seventh grade math or eighth grade math.  I must have just done all right, maybe better than the other students.  I do not know.  Okay, but when I got to high school, which was ninth grade, there were some things that piqued my interests.  There's no question.  And the, there are two ways to kind of describe them.  Let me preface that by saying that mathematicians love puzzles and mathematicians like to work on problems, all right.  They like to solve things.  And the puzzles can be verbal puzzles or any kind of puzzle.  A mathematician is going to work on it (laughter).  So, I probably took Algebra in ninth grade and found that to be, to work very, very well.  But there was a shop teacher, and I had shop, all right, probably in ninth grade.  This guy was clearly very, very bright, all right.  And he used to like to give the class, his shop class, little puzzles, usually word puzzles, some kind of word puzzles.  And he'd give you these word puzzles, Mr. Rochon, Mr. Rochon.  I remember him, and, of course, that's why I never was very good at shop, all right (laughter).  But I couldn't make anything.  But he liked to give these problems, and I love them, I loved to work on 'em.  And so that's an indication, but my sophomore year in high school, I took Geometry.  Ah, that's when I saw a completely different side of, of reasoning, how you reason, how you think.  And it was the first real indication of what mathematics grows up to be, okay.  It's a thinking science, and it's a very, very careful and precise reasoning science.  And that's what Geometry is, even in, in tenth grade.  And so I loved it, all right.  So, thereafter I took all of the math courses that my school had, which were few (laughter).
Speaker 1: How far did they go?  Did they, did you take calculus in high school?
Speaker 2: No, this, it was, I don't think it existed way back then in high school, except--
Speaker 1: Did they go as far as trigonometry?
Speaker 2: Nope, there was no trigonometry in, in my high school.  I had Algebra II.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Certainly, Algebra II, but don't remember any other formal course in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your mother know any higher math at all, I mean at home?  Did she know Algebra and--
Speaker 2: I, this is interesting.  You see that raises the question, did my mother try to help me with my homework, say in mathematics or something?  I don't have any recollection of that ever happening.  I would have to ask my older sisters were either of them ever called upon to try to help me.  That may be an indication that I didn't need any help at that point.  I'm not sure about that though.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I forgot about your older sisters.  They certainly could have--
Speaker 2: Yeah, theoretically, they, they could have provided support in mathematics for me.  But I just have no recollection of it.
Story_ID: 24200
Speaker 1: Did you have any idea that such a thing as a mathematician existed as a career, I mean--
Speaker 2: Absolutely not, absolutely not.  Let me tell you another aside here.  I delivered newspapers.  I had two jobs starting very early, like ninth grade.  I don't know if you wanna talk about it or we can come back to it later.
Speaker 1: Sure, well, we can talk about it, yeah.
Speaker 2: The first job I had probably starting in ninth grade, around there, after-school job, was in a newsstand.  I worked at a newsstand.  I worked from 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon till 7:00 at night.  This was a newsstand, grocery store, fruit stand.  So, and I was the only employee, so I did everything.  I swept.  I had to see that the news magazines were taken down and so-called clipped, and if they didn't sell, you had to clip out the date and the name 'cause that went back to the publisher for credit.  I stocked all the shelves, did everything, worked every Saturday all day.  And every other Sunday, I worked from, on Sunday, it was from 6:00 to 12:00.  This was a job I did not like.  I really did not like it.  I guess in my whole life, this may be the only job I didn't like (laughter).  And I worked there for at least two years, I think.  It was a woman who was a widower who ran the, owned this newsstand.  She was racist from the perspective, from my current perspective.  She called every black person, every black male who came in the, into the newsstand, "fella".  Fella, okay, fella, this, fella, can I help you.  And if it was a young black person, they were always, boy, of course.  She didn't, of course, think of herself as racist, all right.  In any case, I didn't like the work, I didn't like it.  But as a kid, I needed to work.  So I had that job.  Well, I left that job because some of my friends had paper, delivering newspaper, and a route came up.  Now, what do I mean by that?  Well, black kids could only deliver on black routes (laughter), okay.  Things were segregated, couldn't deliver on a white route.  So I had to, a black route had to become available for me to get a job.  And I, I started delivering newspapers.  So I liked this job.  Every afternoon, you delivered your newspapers.  After you had finished, you were through delivering your newspapers.  And so I met a lot of people, lot of people.  I delivered about 135 newspapers on a bicycle.  And I met a lot of--oh, I had to collect.  So it wasn't like you just threw your newspapers (laughter).  The tough part was collecting.  You collected weekly on Saturdays.  So, the positive side of that was, I met a lot of, lot of people, okay, black people who were just ordinary black people in the neighborhood, all right.  I wasn't delivering precisely in my own neighborhood but not terribly far away, okay.  And now, to get to the point of this story, I told you about the plants that existed right outside of Lake Charles.  So a lotta, lot of blacks worked in the plants, usually as some kind of a laborer.  And so these people knew me, and they knew I was in high school and that, and one guy who would always tell me, well, let's back up for just a moment.  The mantra in the black community when I was growing up was very simple.  Everybody had the same mantra.  It was stay in school, okay.  To any young kid, it was always, that's what they told you, stay in school, stay in school.  It was the mantra across the whole community black, black adults toward kids.  So, one man who worked, obviously worked at the plants, he told me, Donald, you should be an engineer.  He used to always tell me this.  Remember, you should be an engineer.  Now, he worked at those plants, oil-based industrial plants.  Well, (laughter) I had no idea, well, I had one idea about what an engineer was (laughter).  It was the guy in that train who wore that striped hat (laughter).  So I never, I couldn't understand (laughter) why would he want me to be that?  (laughter)  He, of course, interacted with real engineers, chemical engineers and all kinds of engineers (laughter) who had degrees in engineering.  But that's the most he could tell me about it is (laughter), was be an engineer.  Well, so I don't know how we got off on this at the moment, but in school, I delivered newspapers--I'll wrap this little segment up and we can get back on focus.  I delivered newspapers throughout high school, and I remember or maybe I haven't really mentioned this, but McNeese State College where I went to college was in my hometown.  That was very fortuitous because I don't know how I would have gone to college if it wouldn't have been there.  So I just went right there.  I delivered newspapers, I continued to deliver newspapers for my first years in college, in fact, all right.  So, it's been, had a lot of experience doing that.  Okay, I'm gonna stop and try to get, you can try to get me back on track.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were on track 'cause I was asking you what was your first inclination that you could, that mathematics could be a career.  And here you, this gentleman tells you about being an engineer.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's right.
Speaker 1: You still didn't know, but, but it was like, did it kind of make you wonder what he was talking about?
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, definitely had no idea about that, there was such a person as a mathematician, all right.  So we can stay on this for a little while if you'd like.  Well, we've already gotten the sense that I liked mathematics.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: All right, and I was successful at it.
Story_ID: 24201
Speaker 1: But what were some of your activities in high school?  Now, I assume you were a good student.  Were you an honor student in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't have, in my high school, anything called honor students.  You just were a student.  And you got your report card, okay, with your grades on it, in the various subjects you were taking.  I actually finished high school third in my class.  Some people are surprised about that (laughter), that you only finished third (laughter), and here you are.  There were two girls, just superb, just the best of my friends, in fact, Caroline Ross and Wanda Chandler, who were superb students, and, and probably much, much more focused on their studies than I was.  And they finished ahead of me, in however the school decided who had finished highest in the class.  And I played basketball in, in high school.
Speaker 1: Now, what position did you play?
Speaker 2: I was a forward.  Back then, playing in high school--maybe it's still the case, I don't know, you didn't have to be (laughter) six feet six [6'6'] to play forward or guard (laughter).  And I played on the varsity team for three years, my sophomore and junior years and senior years.  But, of course, the first two years, I rode the bench the whole two years (laughter).  And I was a starter my senior year.  That, it turns out, I played basketball essentially all my life.  I played with old guys every Tuesday evening and Saturday morning throughout my career.  We played basketball.  So that was, that was a very good experience in many, many ways, of course.  I believe firmly in sports.  Sports teach you so many things that you do not learn easily any other way, team sports.  I can tell you something else about sports, but I'm gonna not, not go on (laughter) at this moment.  But that, that was a central thing.  And--
Speaker 1: Well, was your, did your coach have a big impact on you as a--
Speaker 2: Oh, the coaches changed almost every year.  This is a Catholic school, okay.  Resources were never, never generous, so they would hire a coach for a (laughter) year, who was some college student graduating from college.  He'd stay for a year or maybe two years.  On occasion a priest decided to coach the team.  So the coach was not a stable influence in the sense from year-to-year.  So I'm sure they had an impact because they were the ones teaching us how to play.  And I remember that, but I think I learned more about sports through the activity and interacting with the guys than through any coach.
Speaker 1: Did your team play the other black schools in the surrounding area?  Is that the way it went?
Speaker 2: Ah, yes, indeed, and that, ah, yes, right.  We played the other black schools, only the black schools, of course.  So we, we were in a conference.  And toward the end of the season, we went to the tournament, you understand? We went to the conference tournament.  And if you won the conference tournament, then you went to the state tournament.  This is all black.  Now, all right, so you have that picture.  That picture is very familiar.  Let me tell you about something else.  In our school, in all the schools, public schools and Catholic school, we had the same conference in academics.  So, you had Algebra I, Algebra II, Geometry, you had World History, you had American History, you had all these topics, these subjects, okay.  And you went to the conference district exams.  You got it?  So, each school could, could send, say one or two people to the conference.  And now you would compete against the other schools, like I competed in Geometry.  I competed in Algebra, and, and this went on for, for all the years, you understand?  So, one of my goals and all the kids' goals was to, to get the conference, to get to the district conference and to win there and go to state (laughter).  So you studied, you know.  I competed in the mathematics courses.  I competed in, in other courses over the years. And we had, our teams that would go play the academic conference, all right.  And then we'd go to State.  State was held at Southern University.  That was my beginning experiences in early high school, all right, with Southern University.  I used to go the, I would really work hard to win the district because I wanted to go to State (laughter) all right.  And so then you competed with everybody all over the state in the academics.  And it was just a glorious thing.  And then they had an awards ceremony at State, who had won and they'd announce the winners.  So this was an excellent academic incentive.  And I'm sure, it's probably long lost.  I can't, but I suspect it's long lost, but it was a great thing, all right, certainly great.  I don't know how I got off on that.
Speaker 1: So did you win?  I mean did--
Speaker 2: I definitely won (laughter).  It turns out, I competed in mathematics and other things too.  I essentially always got to State, all right.  I never did win the top prize in, at the state level.  I once came out second and maybe third, but I never won the top prize in mathematics at the state level.  So, but I was extremely pleased with the whole experience.  And we got onto that because of the basketball thing.  But this was a, a very, very good thing to have happen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were representing the school in sports and in the academics.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Now, was, I guess one of the young ladies in school was probably the other representative, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: One of the two, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, Carol and Wanda always in the competition.  We may not have competed in the same areas, all right, like they didn't necessarily compete in mathematics.  I always competed in mathematics, but they didn't necessarily do that.  They could compete in American History or World History or some other, other subjects that they felt more competent in.
Story_ID: 24202
Speaker 1: Who were your best friends in high school?
Speaker 2: They were very, very largely my classmates.  Okay, this was a very small high school.  There were 28 students who graduated with me at, at my high school graduation, okay.  Now, of course, any number of students had left during those four years, but there were only 28.  We knew each other exceedingly well, all right.  We had probably spent 12 years with each other, and they were closest friends.  And many of them still are, are close friends.  And even if you haven't seen them in years, we know each other immediately (laughter).  So they were certainly that, and I had some neighborhood friends that--I haven't told you this yet.  There was a public elementary school three houses away from my house, same side of the street.  So, okay, you left my house, you walked past one house, you walked past another house, you walked past a third house, and then you were at the school.  Ah, I have to tell you the name of this school.  To give you a bit of the flavor of the environment in which I grew up in.  It was called Second Ward Colored Elementary School (laughter), okay.  It turns out, so I knew kids because, and the kids from the neighborhood who didn't go to the Catholic school went, went to Second Ward, okay.  It was--in, in the neighborhood, it was just called Second Ward.  And so I knew kids who went to that school.  We played together after school, and mentioning playing, let me tell you, there was no playground anywhere, right, anywhere near where I lived.  There are no playgrounds or anything like that.  It turns out the schoolyard had a huge fenced, hurricane fenced area, grassed, and it was mowed.  It had basketball hoops.  It's outside dirt, the basketball hoops.  They didn't allow any playing on the, on the school grounds after school.  We could not play on those school grounds, not allowed.  My whole, you know, I lived right there all those years.  We could never go play there, didn't allow it.
Speaker 1: That's really, it sounds crazy, but--
Speaker 2: It's madness.
Speaker 1: So, now, you said you, before we started the interview, I asked you about the Epps.  We had interviewed Archie Epps seven years ago, and you said you knew he and his brother, his twin brother, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.  I knew Archie and Martin Epps.  And they had a younger brother, but he was much younger than me, so I didn't really know him.
Speaker 1: What was the age range, I mean the difference between you and the Epps brothers?
Speaker 2: Okay, I was just trying to think of that.  They were older than me, either by two years or four years.  I, I'm not sure which.  They, they lived, they went to Sacred Heart almost their whole career.  They, they left Sacred Heart I think in their senior year and went to one of the public schools.  The scuttlebutt was, well, let me just mention a little bit more about them.  The Epps owned a dry cleaning business in Lake Charles, okay, in the black community.  So anytime a person is independently employed, they usually can have a prominent role in the community.  And so they, Mrs. Epps, in particular was prominent in the community.  She was prominent in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and we should talk a little bit about that.  I have much experience on that side of things (laughter).  And so she was well known.  And they lived a half block from Sacred Heart School.  And the cleaners was right there next to the school.  So, of course, Archie's career eventually, his whole career was spent at Harvard as dean of students and maybe it might have been that, that might not have been the technical term for his deanship.  And Martin spent a lot of time at Southern University.  And I spent any number of periods, short periods, during my life at Southern University.  So I got to know Martin over those years after leaving high school even.  So, but the Epps were prominent in Lake Charles, a well known family.  And these two sons clearly, Mrs. Epps had high expectations which were well founded, in fact.
Story_ID: 24203
Speaker 1: All right, yeah, you were talking about, we were talking about the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and some of the activism because you were involved in the NAACP in high school.
Speaker 2: Indeed, yes.  I was a member of the NAACP Youth Group in my home town.  And you see, mentioning Mrs. Epps, she was involved.  And Mrs. Combre, Mrs. Combre ran a funeral home.  And so there, you see, independent business person.  They, they could have a leadership role in the black community.  And so Mrs. Combre worked extensively in the development of the NAACP.
Speaker 1: How do you spell her name? I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: C-O-M-B-R-E. And, so the, the NAACP Youth was established by these people as well.  And so I was a, a participant from early on, and not to belabor these points, but I went to the National NAACP Convention in New York City in 1959 as a youth member.  I'll tell you just a little more about that.  I participated in a March on Washington, oh, the, the great March on Washington, the Martin Luther King, "I Have a Dream" March on Washington was '63' [1963].  The one I attended was before that, maybe late '50's [1950s].  Let me tell you just two quick stories (laughter).  I went to the March on Washington.  Supposedly, there were 50,000 people there, supposedly.  I was most impressed, okay.  I got home, and I asked my parents, I said, did you see anything about the March?  I said, it was huge, it was just phenomenal.  I said, you just can't believe how enthusiastic it was and how well things went.  They said, not a word.  There wasn't a word about that here, nothing on, and the newspaper never carried a single thing.  Okay, let me just stay on this general topic.  Now, I was, as I mentioned in the NCAA [sic, NAACP] Youth Movement for years.  Also, I was in SNCC, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
Speaker 1: That's later on in college or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: That was in high school.
Speaker 1: High school?
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure, yeah.  There were recruiters around, and this wasn't very active, but I joined and was a member.  Now, but in 1959, now, all right, I'd been in the youth NAACP, going to NAACP meetings, etc.  I went to this meeting in New York City.  I got the shock of my life.  Let me tell you why.  I didn't know, it had never occurred to me that there were white in (laughter), in the NAACP.  That had never happened in my environment.  And so I assumed (laughter) that the NAACP was all black (laughter).  But, so--
Speaker 1: So people like Jack Greenberg, I guess people like that were involved in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, many, many, you know, huge, huge numbers.  It wasn't just a few.  It wasn't, no way.  It was just huge numbers.  So this was a big shock.  It opened the world to me, all right.  Okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna let you do whatever (laughter) you wish to do at this point.
Speaker 1: Now, you graduated from high school in 19--
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-eight [1958], yes.
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958].  Okay, so you were at McNeese State [College] when you went to the convention, I guess?
Speaker 2: That's right.  But it was a function of my being in the local, being associated with these people.
Speaker 1: So you were already in it before you--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah--
Speaker 1: --had been in it a while.
Speaker 2: And this was, as a result of my having been well known to Mrs. Combre, it turns out Mrs. Combre is the one who took me to, to that convention.
Speaker 1: Did your parents have any convictions about Civil Rights in those days?  Did they, did they have, were they involved in any kind of way?
Speaker 2: My mother [Daietta Elizabeth Perez] certainly was involved, all right, going to some meetings, but she wasn't an activist like, like these other people, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your dad [Frank Joseph St. Mary] was busy or working?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he, you know, he spent all his time working.  He worked six days a week (laughter).
Story_ID: 24204
Speaker 1: So, before we get out of high school, now, you were in a Glee Club I saw on the--
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: --when I went through the book, and what other clubs were you involved in?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow, I was in the band.  I was in the Glee Club.  We didn't have many clubs, so I can't think of any others right now that--there was no Chess Club or anything like that.  So--
Speaker 1: Now, were you a class officer or anything?
Speaker 2: I may have been class officer in some of the earlier years, but my senior year, I was not.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when you look back on high school, who, are there any teachers or administrators or any adults you would consider like mentors, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if mentor is the right word, but in a broad sense probably so.  I credit the nuns with creating in me a certain amount of self-discipline, something they stressed, all right, self-discipline, which was exceedingly important in the future in my disciplinary studies.  Patience, perseverance, which, which yielded in me the capacity to focus intensely.  So there is no question.  I benefitted tremendously from having gone to that school and being taught by those nuns and those lay women who taught me in elementary and high school.  No question.  The benefit was enormous, and I see it from going way, way forward in my career.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it had to do with those character traits and, but, of course, my Geometry teacher who was a nun instilled great love of mathematics in me.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Sister Bernadette.  She was a little, bitty nun, Sister Bernadette.  So she clearly did a good job of that.  And Mr. Rochon, the shop teacher, remember (laughter).  He instilled in me that love of solving puzzles and working on problems.
Speaker 1: Now, is it Rochon, that's spelled R-O-C-H-O-N?
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: Okay, is he related to the, do you know if he's related to the Rochon's in Chicago, Chicago Rochon's?
Speaker 2: It could well be, it could very well be, but I can't say for sure.
Speaker 1: Robert Rochon Taylor built, you know, was a housing director in Chicago [Illinois], public housing director.
Speaker 2: Okay, yes, that's possible.
Story_ID: 24205
Speaker 1: At any rate, well, okay, McNeese State.  Now, how did you--I know it was right there in town, but it had previously been segregated.  So had it just integrated when you started or how long had it been integrated?
Speaker 2: I think it had been integrated two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure it was two years, at most three, okay, when I went.  But I think it was two.
Speaker 1: Now, did you consider going to Southern [University] or some other school?
Speaker 2: Okay, that was never considered because that would have cost money.  And there was not much money in my household.  There is no question about that, not to send me off.  I don't think so.  And so it would have been unthinkable for me, it would have been unthinkable for me to, to not go to McNeese because it had just opened up.  It was just an opportunity now that existed right here at home, that was not gonna stress my parents in the finances.  And I never, in my paper route, you know, I never made but spending money.  So I, it was never enough money to use for other kinds of activities.  But, but I, I will mention something just so we don't skip it.  We've already talked about I was involved with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  It turns out, well, I wasn't the only black kid going to McNeese.  The NAACP had a meeting before we, we went, all right (laughter).  All of us who were gonna be freshmen, not only from my school, but from other schools as well in Lake Charles, all the black kids.  And they just talked to us about this experience and what it was gonna be like and how to act, so interesting phenomenon, right, to (laughter), to tell you how to react in a racial context when you go off to college.
Story_ID: 24206
Speaker 1: Were there, I mean what was your reception at McNeese State [College], I mean how did the students receive the new black students?
Speaker 2: The white students?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: We were not received well, generally, not received well at all.  I can tell you stories (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, can you tell us a story about it, yeah, at least one story, yeah, at least?
Speaker 2: Well, I always was an aggressive student, all right.  And so I would ask questions.  I would put in my two cents.  Well, now, early on in those freshman years, it wasn't unusual at all for somebody, if I said something, for somebody to make a snide remark.  It wasn't unusual to get a spit ball thrown at me, okay.
Speaker 1: This was at McNeese State--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --at a college?
Speaker 2: That's right.  I can tell you another quickie, okay.  I was in the ROTC.  It was mandatory.  You had two years of ROTC, all right.  Well, this was dress, military dress uniform on Tuesdays, all right, and you marched on the parade ground.  And you were under, you were in a company, and you were under a company commander, and you had a captain over the company.  I was in a platoon and, so toward the end of the year, they, they started with their formal dance.  They're gonna have a formal, all right, the military formal.  And now, they're putting pressure in, during, during your parade ground when you're all spit and polished and standing at attention, they're telling the whole group, you must go buy a ticket, pay for the formal, whether you go [to] it or not, you must go pay for a formal and go get a ticket.  Well, I ignored this for several weeks.  And being scared and, and saying well, they said you must buy a ticket--and you know, this was students talking to you.  They're student officers.  So I went and bought a ticket.  I don't remember how much it was.  The next Tuesday, my company commander came up to me, gave me my money back and he said, you weren't planning to go, were you?  You got it (laughter).
Story_ID: 24207
Speaker 1: Now, oh, one thing I neglected, now you met your wife in high school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Or did, you may have met her before since you were--
Speaker 2: No, it was in high school.  I was a senior in high school.  And we actually got married when I was, '58' [1958], in '63' [1963].  So that was five years later, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she was, had she just started going to, what's the high school?
Speaker 2: Sacred Heart [High School].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sacred Heart?
Speaker 2: Yes, it turns out she did.  My senior year, she came to live in Lake Charles [Louisiana] from a different city in Louisiana.  And so that's when I first met her.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a story about how you met?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  She probably would remember, and it's not good for me not to remember (laughter).  But, I don't remember our first meeting, but I saw her at school, and I probably let her know that I was attracted to her (laughter).  And things developed from there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and what's your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Laverne, L-A-V-E-R-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And her maiden name was Frilot, F-R-I-L-O-T.
Speaker 1: Okay, and was she, now, did she go on to school at McNeese too or did she--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, she didn't.  She left school, became a, when she left, she was later in the years after me.  She became a medical technician, was trained as a medical technician on the job, spent, I don't know, maybe a couple of years doing that.  And then she moved to Berkley [California], and worked in Kaiser Permanente Hospital there as a medical technician.  And later in life decided to go to college and got a degree in early childhood education and was the director of a childcare center for, Hampshire College Childcare Center for a number of years, worked in the high school here.
Story_ID: 24208
Speaker 1: Now, all right, at McNeese State [College], so this, you know, so you're being harassed on some level by some of the students.  This is a, how many black students were there out of how many?  What do you think?
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughter).  Let's see, I wonder how many students were at McNeese?  Let me just take a, kind of a guess of the top of my head that there were 2,500 students at the school, maybe there were 5,000, okay.  Let's get in that, that's the range in which I'm pretty sure I'm okay, somewhere between 2,500 and 5,000 students.  How many black students (laughter)?  Man, the number of black students could very, very comfortably fill this room (laughter).  No, there weren't very many.
Speaker 1: Were there more than a hundred, you think?
Speaker 2: Maybe there were a hundred.
Speaker 1: Maybe a hundred, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's gives us some idea.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, did the black students form an organization on campus?
Speaker 2: Not initially.  It turns out there was a building that the school, when I got there, I got there, you know, a couple years after it had been integrated.  But it was called the "lounge", okay.  It was a wood, frame building, had some sofas in it and all that, and that's where the black students hung out.  And so you heard about the lounge immediately when you (laughter), when you got there.  But there was this fancy, fancy student center right, you know, a hundred steps away from the lounge, which, it was a little bit tougher environment there for black students.
Speaker 1: So socially, it was segregated like that, the blacks were in the lounge and the white students were in the new center?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Story_ID: 24209
Speaker 1: Okay, now, who--did you have good mathematics instruction there at McNeese [State College]?
Speaker 2: Okay, indeed, and let me return to something you asked me earlier, basically, or at least implicitly, you did.  You see, I was studying mathematics in high school, and, you know, I liked mathematics.  I was studying all my subjects, but I liked mathematics.  Now, the only, there were no role models.  I told you about the guy who told me to be an engineer.  There were no role models in my environment, none whatsoever.  The only role models were elementary and high school teachers.  And my mother was an elementary school teacher.  So I knew that, and I knew I didn't wanna be an elementary or a high school teacher.  I, that's all I knew.  I went to McNeese, I didn't know what I wanted to be, no idea, knew nothing about a mathematician or anything.  But, so it was natural for me to take mathematics courses, and that's what I started doing.  I just started, I had to take other courses.  I took English and History and foreign languages and, etc., and physics.  But always mathematics courses, right, mathematics courses, always, took the chemistry, I mean the calculus as soon as I could, then just kept going.  So, it turns out after a couple of years, you see, the mathematics courses become rather specialized.  And it's mostly mathematics major students who were taking them.  So I was just gravitating in that direction.  And so I had no other interests in any other area.
Speaker 1: Now, had you declared a major in some other--
Speaker 2: At that point, I declared a major because it became necessary at some point between those, in those, say second year.  And so I declared mathematics because (laughter), I didn't have anything else to declare.  I might have looked into an engineering degree, but there was no engineering in my, in my undergraduate school.  And so I declared myself a mathematics major.  I had no idea at that point (laughter) what that was gonna lead to, but it was just natural because that was my focus.  And, and what I was about to say, in those later years, you see, you started to take courses with the same students, all right, because they were all math, math and physics majors.  And so the relationships got better.  Most students started to know me, and I to know them.  And they treated me then as an equal, and there was even some studying together, amongst us.  So, the environment didn't stay terrible, even though in my later years, if I learned that some faculty member at the college was known as a racist, I would take his course (laughter) to not, not in the sciences, in the social sciences.  You always have to fill up some social sciences type stuff--
Speaker 1: So you would take their, if he was a racist, you would try to get in his course?
Speaker 2: I would take his course, and, and try to get an "A", okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you have a favorite course of study outside math, I mean, that you liked?  I mean what outside of math did you like the most, I guess, history or political science?
Speaker 2: It turns out, it was philosophy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I essentially took enough philosophy courses to have a minor in philosophy even though I really minored in physics.  There was a philosophy professor there that I liked very much, and he certainly, you know, he paid a lot of attention to his students, and he, he encouraged me to join the Philosophy Club, and he couldn't understand why I wasn't joining the Philosophy Club.  And, of course, as a black student, I never went into any residence halls.  You just, I guess it would have been possible (laughter), but just didn't do it.  That's all it was to it.  And so the Philosophy Club met in a lounge in one of the dormitory, the residence halls.  And one time, this philosophy professor prevailed upon me and says, you come to the meeting tonight.  We're gonna talk about this or that.  And so I went once, but I was reluctant to be in that environment.  So, just one of those crazy things of my undergraduate career.  I never, and I never attended any social functions in my undergraduate career, okay, at, on that campus.
Speaker 1: So did the black students socialize, have their own social activities?
Speaker 2: No, no, because we were, I guess we were too spread out.  We were spread in different majors and all kind of things.  No, there was, not at that point.  I'm sure later, after the black students became more comfortable on the campus, they did those kind of things.  But not then.
Story_ID: 24210
Speaker 1: Now, was there any teacher at McNeese State [College] or any administrator that was like, was special in terms of your development, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in mathematics, there certainly were two teachers who, who inspired me in some way.  There was Patrick Ford who is now deceased.  He taught me calculus and taught me some other subjects.  He, he was inspiring.  He was challenging.  He treated me like any other student in that class, all right.  And so I remember him.  And another Roy Dobbins, taught me a course that was different from other mathematics courses.  It turns out, let me very, very, very briefly tell you about mathematics.  Early on, in mathematics, you take the calculus, which is substantial.  You learn about differential equations.  In these courses, you do what's called problem solving.  You solve problems.  Now, there's another dimension to mathematics.  It is the dimension that Geometry is in.  Geometry, in Geometry, you write proofs.  Everything is a thought process in which you do very, very careful reasoning to conclude, the conclusion that you wish to conclude, which is the proposition called the theorem in mathematics.  Roy Dobbins taught me the first course, all right, in college which used that method.  And so the early methods are problem courses where the answer is a number or it's a formula or something like that, all right.  The later courses in mathematics become more this thinking process, this precise, careful reasoning, careful definition of, of the terms.  And so this was the first course that I had experienced that.  I experienced some of it in Geometry, but here it was a much higher-level mathematics course of it.  So, that was a new experience and I liked it.  My major advisor was the guy who actually most influenced me, and I don't recall that he ever taught me a course.  He was my advisor throughout my undergraduate career there.  And I was getting ready to graduate.  He knew that, all right.  It was, oh, probably in the fall of 1961.  And I, I met him, and he, being a low, low key guy, probably said to me, okay, so what are we gonna do?  (Laughter) What are you gonna do after you graduate?  Well, I told him I didn't know.  Now, let me tell you, there were other undergraduate students with me, majoring in mathematics.  They knew what they were gonna do.  They were gonna go to the plants, all right, remember those plants in Lake Charles, scientific oil-based refinery plants and try to get a job as a scientist of some kind.  I knew I couldn't do that, all right.  They weren't gonna hire me, didn't matter, it didn't matter that I had the same degree as they did, all right.  I wasn't gonna get hired over there as a, as some kind of a person who was comparable to an engineer, all right.  So, and this, my advisor must have realized that.  And he just said to me, you know, you could go to graduate school.  Now, I had no idea what graduate was (laughter).  But I knew that I loved school, I loved being a student.  He said, you can go to graduate school and get a Masters degree.  And I don't know if he intentionally had on his desk this brochure or if it just had landed there that day in the mail (laughter).  But there's a brochure, and he hands it to me.  It's a brochure soliciting graduate students to the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas.  He said, why don't you take this and fill it out and let's see what happens?  I did that.  I was accepted, and I went off to graduate school that January in Kansas.  And it was the beginning of a completely different life.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-one [1961], right.
Speaker 2: It was in January of '62' [1962] at that point--
Speaker 1: Sixty-two [1962], okay--
Speaker 2: --that I went to graduate school.
Story_ID: 24211
Speaker 1: All right, so, University of Kansas, 1962, January, right, okay.  So was that, you know, in comparison to McNeese State [College]?  How did you--
Speaker 2: Okay, interesting that you should ask that question.  It turns out now, in my last two years, I took, you know, all the math courses at McNeese State, and, you know, just one after the other.  And I got all A's in them.  After the calculus, I got all A's in all the mathematics courses.  So I began to think of myself as a bright boy (laughter).  Well, I got to graduate school (laughter).  Going to graduate school from undergraduate school is like moving to a different planet, okay (laughter).  The level at which the courses, the pace, and the depth of the courses is so much greater than in undergraduate school until it was just a shock.  I was really shocked.  So that was the beginning of the end of ever having the bright boy syndrome (laughter) again.  It was a big, big surprise, and a shock.  And I began to work much, much longer hours.  I got in the habit at that point, beginning graduate school, that last essentially a lifetime.  All of my professional life, I went to bed at midnight, and I got up at 6:00 in the morning, standard routine, all right, standard routine.  I worked every single night, not Friday night.  Friday nights, usually went to a movie or something, and I would work all day Saturday and on Sunday.  I might go to a movie on Sunday night.  But work meant study, okay.  We, as a professional mathematician, you don't use the word study.  You use the word "work".  You're working on your mathematics, studying mathematics.  So, big, big shock.  Things started to ease up (laughter) the following year.
Speaker 1: So your second year, it got a little easier?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yes.  I was now familiar.  Fall of, the following semester, really, that fall, I was now familiar with the pace, knew about the depth they expected and if you didn't know something, they expected you go learn it.  I understood that at that point.  In undergraduate school, you go learn something on your own?  (Laughter) That wasn't--my undergraduate school wasn't that sophisticated.  They just taught what was, you learned what they taught and that was enough.  But not in graduate school.  If the material is touching on something that you do not know, well, the expectation is that you will go to the library.
Story_ID: 24212
Speaker 1: Now, what aspect of mathematics did you focus on?
Speaker 2: Okay, my whole career has been in analysis.  Analysis is a broad area of mathematics, all right.  It, it deals with certain, a certain way of thinking and the tools that you use in doing your mathematics come from the area of analysis, all right.  And analysis is related to the calculus, all right.  And the tools in the calculus are some of the primary tools in, in analysis.  Now, but I need to contrast analysis with another big area of mathematics.  It's called Algebra, all right.  So this seems like a simple word, right, Algebra.  Un-un, it's a huge area of study in mathematics and encompassing many, many, many sub areas.  But it uses generally a different set of tools.  It studies structures of certain, certain kinds of structures like symmetries, symmetries, and things of that, where it classifies symmetries in certain groups.  It turns out the word "group" is a technical term in mathematics because it represents entities that behave in a certain manner and have certain properties.  So it's an Algebraic entity.  In analysis, a third big branch of mathematics might be Geometry or maybe a more general way to say it, is Geometry and Topology.  So there are these three grand areas which have many, many, many sub areas of study inside of them.  But my area was analysis.  And in analysis, one of the central things that you study is differential equations.  Differential equations and my focus initially was not in differential equations but in analysis, and, for example, my Masters thesis was a problem in integration.  Now, in calculus there are two grand topics in calculus, okay, overarching topics.  And I'm talking about elementary calculus which expands very broadly in mathematics, but there're two grand areas in it.  And one is differentiation, and the other is integration, all right.  So they're both in, in this area called calculus.  The calculus is inside the area called analysis (laughter).  And so my, my Masters thesis had to do with integration, working on a certain special kind of integrals.  And that was the Masters thesis.
Story_ID: 24213
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers who stand out?
Speaker 2: Well, recall, when I got there, I had this great big shock.  One of, and my--one of the first courses I took was just called "Analysis".  It's a standard course.  It's here.  First year graduate students usually take a course called "Analysis", all right.  So I took Analysis from G. Bailey Price, a mathematician, well known in the mathematics community (laughter).  And there I got this shock, all right, that the expectation, the pace, the pace was just beyond what I'd ever expected.  And the depth at which it was studied.  And let me tell you a sad story on myself, very, very briefly.  The first day I went to class, I didn't bring paper and pencil (laughter).  I thought it would just be introductory day (laughter).  Oh, that's not the way graduate school works.  Day One.  So, you know, I became a teacher, a professor my whole career was that I assure you on Day One of every single class I ever taught in my life, we had a full day's (laughter) presentation, where you were given homework, and you knew where you were.  This was undergraduate or graduate.  Teachers, G. Bailey Price, you know, that's the impression he made upon me that, you know, he's just, wow.  And I learned how to be a "wow" professor later because that's the normal (laughter), that's the norm.  And S. M. Shaw taught me complex variables that year, another topic in analysis.  Man, he would fill the blackboard from one end to the other so rapidly (laughter).  So they were all business, all right.  Teaching mathematics and I, in particular, in my influence in this department, was to try to make it more human.  Back then, the idea was to present the material.  The students who got it would be successful.  Those who didn't would find another career.  That's not the way we teach anymore.  It's not the way I taught in my years.  I was concerned about the students and their, their being able to learn the material and try to help them learn it and to explain to them why it's happening, not just to present it.  And that was the influence on, on all of the professors in this department when I was their department head.  And they knew it.  Otherwise, that was always the atmosphere there.  The courses, serious.
Story_ID: 24214
Speaker 1: I can tell you a little more about that.  I was interested in computers.  Now, eventually, my career moved into computers, computer-based mathematics.  But way back then, computers were a new thing.  So I took the only two computer-based mathematics courses they had in the department.  This was so new.  I took them because I wanted to go into computer mathematics.  Well, I programmed at that point one of the earliest computers, an IBM 650.  You use punch cards on this computer.  You put your stack of cards on it.  I could sit at the console and see what command it was executing.  I could stop it.  Now, a modern computer executes millions of commands in a second, all right.  So (laughter), but I could stop the machine, and it would show me which command it was working on.  Okay, the faculty member, he was the only one who did computer mathematics, he ran the computer facility, the one I'm telling you about, the research computer stuff.  You put your machines on there, your cards on the card reader.  He taught me a whole year's course.  I wanted to be in this area.  It is the area I eventually came to many, many years later.  But I decided I could not work with him.  He was too busy.  After having him for a year, two whole semesters in a graduate-level course and seeing him, you know, three days a week, I knew that wasn't gonna work, even though he knew I was interested.  He told me he would like for me to stay at the University of Kansas.  He said he would support me.  I decided not to stay because I knew I was gonna have trouble.  He was extremely busy.  He, he didn't grade our homework papers himself.  He had a teaching assistant grading the papers.  That was fine, but I knew I could not complete a PhD which is a major, major undertaking under somebody who could barely give me the time of day (laughter).  That wasn't gonna work.  And so I started looking for other institutions.  First, institutions that had computer-based mathematics.  That was almost non-existent in '62' [1962] and '63' [1963].  But I ended up transferring to the University of Nebraska.
Speaker 2: Now, had you received your Masters already at--
Speaker 1: It turns out I hadn't, but I completed it that fall.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I hadn't, you had to finish your Masters thesis, and have an oral exam on your Masters thesis.  So those things weren't done.  They were done in the fall when I was officially then, a student at the University of Nebraska.  But my MA degree came from the University of Kansas.  And I completed my dissertation and had my oral exam.  And so now, I'm at the University of Nebraska, but my focus has been in analysis, all right, the, my dissertation is in one of the branches of analysis, Integration.  The computer mathematics that I was studying, it's in analysis.  And so it was natural, when I got to the University of Nebraska to focus on analysis.  Analysis there focused on differential equations.  So I started taking advanced differential equations courses, and any--several of them, several different kinds.  And so I was a teaching assistant there.  I taught freshmen, largely.
Story_ID: 24215
Speaker 1: Who is your advisor at University of Nebraska?
Speaker 2: Okay, when I first arrived, okay, I'm a third-year student because I've had two years at the University of Kansas.  I have a Masters degree.  You're expected to be in, in a PhD program from, oh, at this point--well, normally, you'll take five to six years.  That's from undergraduate career.  So I'm expected to spend either three years or four years getting my PhD, at that point, when I arrive.  And so I don't remember who my advisor was at that point.  It, I probably got a generic advisor in the department, don't know who it was.  Maybe I didn't even use an advisor, and in graduate school, you can do your own thing.  But I started in taking differential equations courses, advanced, ordinary differential equations courses.  And as I preceded though, I had to take comprehensive exams.  So at the end of my first year, maybe or the second year, I don't remember which now, to get a PhD in mathematics, you have to take a battery of comprehensive exams.  They usually occur in three areas, okay.  It's the three areas I told you about (laughter), Algebra, Analysis, and in my case, it was Topology, Geometry--I told you Geometry Topology, but they're the three huge areas of mathematics.  And you have to take--in mathematics, you have to be well rounded in mathematics.  You, you can't just study one tiny little area, not in this country.  In Europe, that is, you do that.  You study, you become a specialist in a very tiny area.  You don't have to know the other areas.  In this country, in this department right now, you need to know other areas besides the one you're an expert on.  So, you have a battery of comprehensive exams, and I took 'em in those three areas.  Now, I have mentored minority graduate students in this department for years and years and years.  And I tell them, I flunked my comprehensive exams the first time I took 'em (laughter).  And they say, oh, no, you couldn't have (laughter).  How could you have flunked, you?  Where you are?  But I do that on purpose.  I tell 'em.  I wasn't perfect.  I wasn't a genius who just strolled through.  No one does that or essentially, no one.  It's tough, and you stumble.  You can fall.  Just get up.  So I tell 'em, I flunked 'em at the end of that first year.  So I took 'em again the next year, and I passed 'em.  Now, I got a major professor, all right, who was gonna direct my PhD dissertation, not just somebody to talk to about (laughter) what courses I'm gonna take.  Un-un, he's gonna direct my PhD dissertation.  His name is A. M. Fink, A period, M period, Fink.  That's how, everybody called him A.M.  I called him A.M.  He (laughter), he was just great.  And he's been great throughout, but he was a tough guy, all right.  He, there were three of us working under him at that time.  I know, I met with him privately once a week, all right.  That was at his direction.  It wasn't me saying (laughter), I'd like to meet with you to (laughter) talk about what I'm doing.  That's, which is more typical for PhD students because their, their major professor is so busy.  No, no, he set up the time that I was to meet with him every week.  Not only that, but the three of us, his three PhD students met with him for coffee at the coffee shop every week as well, okay, and talk about mathematics, talk about what's going on, talk about what, what the colloquium lecture was about this week.  That was another thing.  I had to go, there's--a colloquium lecture is a big lecture in the department.  Usually, it's from an external speaker who comes in and gives the main talk of the week, all right.  It usually occurs at 4:00 o'clock.  In this building, the same things happens.  It occurs in that room, that great big room right next door to where we are.  And A.M. Fink students had to go to the colloquium lecture.  If you missed (laughter), the next day he'd come to your office (laughter), and say, you really missed a good talk yesterday (laughter).  They were always good when you missed them.  I assure you that they were not (laughter) always good when you saw them.  In any case, you met with, for coffee, and you talked about whatever, maybe the, the colloquium lecture or whatever kind of mathematics was going on or what kind of mathematics he said we--he said, somebody would say, I don't know that.  He would say, well, then go learn it (laughter).  Yes, he wouldn't hesitate to come down.  If he were out of town or something during our regular meeting time, when he got back into town, he'd come down to my office.  I was in the basement, and he was on the, oh, second or third floor of the building.  He'd come down to my office and sit in a chair (laughter), and say what have you been doing?  So, as far as I'm concerned, a great PhD dissertation advisor.  Okay, it turns out, it was clear at one of these points, okay, that I wasn't gonna get, I wasn't gonna finish in 1967.  I was gonna stay another year.  That was fine with me.  The other two students, and they may have finished.  They may have finished.  I think they did in '67' [1967].  They were a little ahead of me.  And it turns out, I got the shock of my life one of those times when he came down to my office, and he told me in the fall of, in the spring of 1967, he told me, I'm moving to Iowa State University next year, (laughter) because now we had this relationship, all right, this intense, intense relationship.  And he's gonna leave me.  That was a shock.  Now, he wasn't a man of a lot of words, all right, un-un.  So, he told me, call the department head at Iowa State.  I called the department head at Iowa State, and he tells me I have a position for you, an instructorship.  It's all ready.  A.M. saw to it that (laughter), that a position was available for you.  So you will come to Iowa State next year and you will be an instructor.  And you can spend your last year here and, supported.  So he hadn't forgotten me, okay.  He had taken excellent, utter good care of me.  But the whole time I was studying differential equations.  He was a specialist in differential equations.
Story_ID: 24216
Speaker 1: So I go to Iowa State in 1967, in the fall of '67' [1967] in Ames, Iowa.  You may have a question, but let me just mention, since I mentioned I went to Iowa State in the fall of '67' [1967], it turns out, it's my wife and I, and a two-year old daughter.  We get to Ames, Iowa, and there's not an apartment, a house, a rental of any kind to find, can't find anything.  I meet the newspaper when it comes out every afternoon.  It came out at the newspaper press every afternoon.  I met it every afternoon.  Other people were there to meet it as well, to see if there's an ad for an apartment or something.  So we arrived, and that's the situation in the fall of '67' [1967].  A.M. and his wife, say okay.  You guys come live with us until you find a place to live, all right (laughter).  So, he took, he really took care of me.
Speaker 2: Okay, so how long did you live with A.M.?
Speaker 1: I don't know, weeks maybe.  And so in (unclear) of weeks, probably not a whole month, and then we found a house.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first rental that, that we found available, we took, of course.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: But that's, that's how they were.
Speaker 2: Now, tell us, I guess in ways that, as simple as possible, I guess, what your dissertation was about?
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, it deals with differential equations, all right.  Now, there is a huge theory around linear differential equations, much, much theoretical development, very solid, about linear, say in order.  They're not, this is, this could be tenth order or fifth order or second order, for example, differential equations.  And they relate to certain kinds of, of, from the perspective, current perspective, to simple applications like oscillating springs, oscillating string or a spring on a, one end tied or a pendulum swinging.  So you can describe a phenomena like that by differential equations.  So this is a, very simple examples, and fairly simple differential equations.  But they also have other applications in science.  They attempt to describe physical phenomena, all right.  Now, there are certain kinds of problems that are very valuable, and they're called boundary-value problems.  Now, and what that means is, for example, if it, if it is some kind of a beam, for example, like a beam may seem to be stiff, but it's not really.  It, it can be bent, all right, or a rod, say.  And now, this can be described by a differential equation, usually a forethought of differential equation.  But the question is, can you make the ends of this thing, can you clamp 'em somewhere, and that's a boundary-value problem.  See, the rod is between my two fingers.  Now, can I clamp this end here, wherever that is, and this end here and find a rod with the given physical specifications that will do that, from there to there, all right.  Now, it's a differential equation that describes this problem.  And it's called the boundary-value problem because, you see, I'm clamping these two sides in advance.  Now--at, at different places, basically, whereas I could clamp 'em horizontally, all right.  That's a different problem.  And so you can think of it as this one is at zero and this one is at zero, whereas, this other problem, this one is up here at one and this one is up at one half, all right, very different problems.  Okay, the theory, this is called disconjugacy theory or is, or some of the work that was in my PhD dissertation.  The idea is you can solve this kind of boundary-value problem, all right, only some of the times, can't solve it all the time, all right.  But there are some conditions on the differential equation which tell you when you can solve it.  And it has to do with the coefficient functions that are in the differential equation.  And it turns out that, if you solve the zero boundary-value problem, okay, and I've just tried to explain that where they're both at the same level all the time.  Think of that as a zero boundary-value problem, all right.  If you can solve that one, all right, then you may not be able to, in all cases, solve the other one, all right.  So, and it has to do with the solutions of the differential equation.  If there is a solution to the differential equation with, with the zeroes, all right, then it precludes solving certain other differential equations.  And so you're trying to characterize when it is by expressing conditions on the coefficients in the differential equation when you can solve these boundary-value problems and when you can't. And it turns out the theory expands into more general differential equations, very well-known differential equations to physicists and engineers, for example, called  Hamiltonian systems.  And so the dissertation, the PhD dissertation had to do with this set of problem, conjugacy, disconjugacy, oscillation, whether solutions can oscillate or not, that kind of thing.  So, that's kind of a (laughter), a very, very rough description, but a little bit of the terminology and, and what happens.
Story_ID: 24217
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you finished your PhD dissertation in 1968?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you were at the University of Iowa, right, I mean Iowa State University?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And you went, so you taught there for a while before you came over to U-Mass [University of Massachusetts], right?
Speaker 2: I was an instructor that one year.  I was also an instructor my last year at the University of Nebraska.  I was a teaching assistant before that.  So I taught college courses throughout all those years.  Well, I taught, in my last year at Iowa State, I taught an advanced undergraduate course in Fourier series which, it's an advance undergraduate course.  So I was teaching at all levels of the undergraduate curriculum throughout those years.  But at the end of that year, I, I accepted a position here at the University of Massachusetts.  I can tell you a short story about that if you want (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It's a short, it's another story about my major professor, A.M. Fink.  He, well, I told him--I told you he was a man of few words.  I told him that the New England schools were starting to just explode in their development.  That was right around the time they were all coming alive.  There was a story in "Time Magazine" about, right that year, about the New England schools and what was suddenly happening in them.  They were becoming full blown, moving institutions whereas before, they were sleepy, little state institutions.  Okay, so I told him I, you know, I might be interested in spending a few years in New England on the faculty at one of these institutions.  He doesn't say anything (laughter).  The national meetings of the American Mathematical Society is held in San Francisco [California] that January, January of '68' [1968].  He goes, and I go, all right.  We go to the meetings.  You know, and I probably was giving a talk.  I don't remember.  That's a normal thing.  You give a talk because, to get funded, to get support from you institution, you need to give a talk.  So I got, probably gave a talk because my institution paid my way.  And I probably talked about my dissertation.  Well, at the meeting he comes up to me at some point and says, I want you to meet someone.  I think that's what he said or he said, I spoke to someone about you.  Well, he clearly had spoken to this person, all right.  So I meet this person.  His name is Haskell Cohen.  He's a faculty member here.
Speaker 1: Haskell Cohen?
Speaker 2: Cohen, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: C-O-H-E-N.  He's a faculty member here, all right.  And I talked to him a little bit.  So, about a week later, I'm back at Iowa State, and the department head here gives me a call.  And he says, I'd like for you to come out for an interview.  I come out for a interview.  I'm made job offer.  I accept.  The rest is history.  I never wrote a single letter of application for a job.  So the old boys' network (laughter) landed me, okay (laughter), a prominent first-line position in the academic world, all right.  The old boy's network which is appropriately maligned most of the time, all right, no question.  But it did.  It turns out Haskell Cohen was here.  I was his department head for eight years.  He retired and recently deceased.
Story_ID: 24218
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  At the time, at that time, 1968, who or was there someone that mathematicians considered the, you know, the premier mathematician in the world or and where were they?
Speaker 2: Okay, the institutions that are so well known had surely "the" premier mathematicians in the world.  They were Harvard [University].  They were Princeton [University], the Institute for Advanced Studies is separate from Princeton, but it is a huge mathematics center.  [University of California] Berkley, those places certainly had the premier mathematicians, but that's not to say there were not great mathematicians at other institutions.  Two people that come to mind in my area, one was at Carnegie Mellon [University], and the other was at Johns-Hopkins [University].  So people I interacted with, worked on their research and, and they on mine, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Can you remember the names?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Zeev, Z-E-E-V, Nehari, N-E-H-A-R-I, at Carnegie Mellon. I'm pretty sure he was at Carnegie Mellon at that point, and the other was Phillip Hartman at Johns-Hopkins.
Speaker 1: Now, you wrote a paper concerning something that Nehari did, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed, indeed.  That was a very interesting thing.  Nehari, who--he had written many, many papers, of course, very well known in this general area of differential equations; had one paper that was quite famous, very well known.  And I was studying that paper, and this was, I don't think I've used this word, I was in pure mathematics at that point.  It, it's studied, pure mathematics studies mathematics for its own sake, primarily, to develop mathematics.  In later years, mathematics branched away from that, that inner focus and had an outer focus.  Okay, well, I was studying this paper.  The paper was well known.  Everybody, all the mathematicians in, in my sphere who did the same kind of work I did, they knew that paper.  I couldn't, I couldn't figure out the proof.  No matter how hard I worked, I couldn't make the proof work.  So, I was here at that time.  I wrote to A.M.  I said, A.M., you know this paper, right?  And he said, of course.  I cannot get through the proof.  I have looked at it, I've done this, and you get right down to here, and this doesn't seem to, to hold up.  A.M. looks at it.  He says, Hah, this is very, very strange.  He then elects to write to Zeev Nehari, a nice guy, just tell him that, we're having this trouble.  Zeev Nehari writes back and says, "These kind of things are not supposed to happen".  This is just not supposed to happen.  Of course, numerous, hundreds of people have read this paper.  It was read by editors, and referees before it was published.  But the proof is not, that proof is not valid.  So,--
Speaker 1: He's admitting he's made, he made a mistake.
Speaker 2: That's right (laughter)--
Speaker 1: A big mistake.
Speaker 2: A biggy (laughter).  Any time you get an article that's published in the Journal, and everybody knows the result.  Okay, it's a big mistake, but it turns out Phillip Hartman, the other name I was telling you about--now, A.M. and I wrote a paper.  And we point out in the paper that the proof of the Nehari paper is, is not complete, okay, is not substantial.  And so we're proving a special case.  We couldn't prove the whole theorem.  So there was a result in that theorem, well-known result.  And we couldn't prove the whole result, but we could prove a part of it.  So we wrote a paper showing what part of the theorem we could now prove.  This opens up the literature because everybody will now start trying to prove this thing because now everybody will know that the proof is not valid.  Well, guess who reviews our paper?  Remember that other name I told you who was so prominent in our area, Phillip Hartman reviews our paper.  He now knows that the Nehari result, which, of course, he knows the Nehari result, the proof is not valid.  He takes off.  Phillip Hartman was called the "Lion" in our, in our circle, okay (laughter), the Lion, himself takes off and he proves the theorem, okay.  So the result was correct.  The proof was wrong.  Nehari then provides, I mean Phillip Hartman then publishes a paper that gives a valid proof of Nehari's theorem.  In the meantime, our paper, giving a proof of a partial version of the Nehari's paper, of Nehari's result, appears as well.  So, see, interesting story.
Speaker 1: Okay, that is something.  I, now, well, it's the kind of thing, it would seem as though, in any field, to do such a thing would cause a little trepidation, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, it caused trepidation (laughter).  There is no question.  I gave a talk about it at, in Canada, at the University of Calgary, and one of the guys there, you know, who, if I'm gonna give a talk, that means there're many mathematicians there who know my area and know things.  He was not happy that I was talking about this, because he was a student of Nehari.  I told him, it's just part of history and Zeev Nehari is a great guy, and I liked him.  He's a very, very nice guy, and I said, I don't mean to cast any aspersions on him as a quality person.  He stated the theorem, okay.  Huh, (laughter), so it caused problems.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so this is 1969, I suppose that this is, that this--
Speaker 2: In that area, yeah, '69' [1969], '70' [1970].
Speaker 1: Yeah, here in my notes it indicates that you read the paper on the inequality of Nehari--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --in New Orleans at the AMS [American Mathematical Society].
Speaker 2: That's right, you're right.  You see, that was the paper, and I presented--was that in 1969?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it was definitely in '69' [1969] that all this was happening because that means I then presented a talk on the state of that paper and the proof at that New Orleans meeting.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, did that, did this, I guess discovery of yours, you know, kind of springboard you into the limelight in some way?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It's hard to say.  It's really hard to say.  I was in the community.  They knew me, okay.  The community of mathematicians working in this general area, they definitely knew me.  And, and cherished me, and I cherished them.  And for years and years, I worked in that area, and eventually, I changed areas.
Story_ID: 24219
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, here at U-Mass [University of Massachusetts] what was the, well, what was U-Mass like?  This is a completely different part of the country that you're, you know, that you're coming to.  And though your sister had been here, you said, before you, right, going to school?
Speaker 2: No, she came after me.
Speaker 1: Oh, she came after you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, it turns out the University of Massachusetts, at least back then and for many, many, many years, was a very activist campus, protests all over the place.  Shut the place down with protests.  We're in the war [Vietnam] okay.  We're in '69' [1969] and black students, the faculty, the black faculty who were very few, but we got together and interacted as a group with the administration.  And, and the administration reacted very positively to all our suggestions.  In those early periods, we had nothing bad to say about the senior administration.  They, they supported us as a group.  And we were quite cohesive.  And we founded this, this group called CCEEBS, Committee for the Collegial Education of Black and Other Minority Students, which became a stalwart institution on this campus for years and years and years in support, initially of black students, but the other minorities.  The "M" was added to that CCEEBS acronym.  But the administration supported our endeavors as, as black students, and I was at that point working as black faculty.  And I was working very, very diligently on my mathematics.  I said this before.  Mathematics is a very, very demanding mistress.  So my habits that I told you before, of going to bed at midnight, getting up at 6:00, those habits remained, never changed.  I, I worked on my mathematics when I was not in the classroom or otherwise occupied.  I worked every night after dinner, have dinner with the family, and then I would go down to my study at 8:00, 8:30 and work until 11:00 or 11:30 and then go to bed, and go up at 6:00 in the morning.  And frequently on days when I did not teach, I would work at home.  And by 8:00 o'clock I was at my desk, and I would work until, oh, I would run, I was a runner, a jogger for years and years and years and years.  We're talking, I was a jogger.  And so I would jog at noon.  When I was young, first here, I jogged in the morning.  I'd get up at 6:00 o'clock and go jogging.  But I couldn't that as I got older.  So I, I then would jog around noon.  And so I would jog, have a quick lunch and be back at my desk, all afternoon until dinner.  So, I was working on mathematics, so, working on research papers.
Story_ID: 24220
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you described your routine at U-Mass, and okay, what are some of the--oh, it says here in '72' [1972], you published a paper on "Oscillation of Complex Linear Differential Systems", right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is that, is that something that was influenced by the Zehari, I mean the Nehari--
Speaker 2: It turns out, not influenced by the Nehari thing.  You see, the oscillation and the name in my dissertation, the name oscillation comes up as opposed to using conjugacy or disconjugacy.  That's perfectly all right.  All those words kind of mesh amongst themselves.  Well, but it turns out it was a paper of Zeev Nehari's which I was writing on, of doing some elaboration on in that paper (laughter).  So the relationships, you know, they continued.  No question.  And it was very, very likely Zeev Nehari, who refereed, the referee of that paper there, that was published.  So he clearly had no hard feelings, you know.  So, but it was one, it wasn't on that inequality.  It was on a different, some different work of his, which I found very interesting and fascinating and so I, I joined it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you teach at the University of Oklahoma for a year?
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I spent a sabbatical there because of a faculty member who was there.  His name was Reed, W. T. Reed.  And I went there because he worked in this general area of differential equations that I was interested in.  And I wanted to work with him.  It turns out that he was impossible to work with.  You know, I had worked with my major professor, you know, very, very comfortably.  But this guy seemed to be very reserved and doesn't want to reveal any of his ideas that might lead to me (laughter), capitalizing on them.  He was a good mathematician.  There's no question about that.  But he very much kept to himself.  But it turns out, remember I told you A.M. had three students, and I was one of them.  One of them ended up being a faculty member at the University of Oklahoma.  So I had somebody I'd interacted with as a graduate student, under the same major professor as a faculty member there.  So he and I started working together on research.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so things worked out?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they worked out fine.  And we seminared every week with, with Reed, W. T. Reed was there.  We presented our work, and he made presentations, and we made presentations.  So there was a seminar.  It wasn't as though it was a dead all mathematical environment at all?  But just to, the interpersonal relationships were not very good with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You couldn't talk to him in his office, kind of just man-to-man or student-to-faculty member, no, didn't want (laughter).
Story_ID: 24221
Speaker 1: Do mathematicians tend to be less personable than other professors, do you think or is it just--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You seem very personable, but I, you know, I just wonder if you, if, thinking about the--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, but, you see the way I think of this, I have lived in this whole institution as being a department head for all those years.  I interacted with, with people in other disciplines, all kind of disciplines.  And there are some cranky academics (laughter).  It has nothing to do with (laughter) being a mathematician.  I, I definitely do not think that all mathematicians are in some sense--I'm not sure what word you used, but I'm using the word cranky.  No, definitely not; personable, I'm--they may be more reserved in their personalities.  That's because of the kind of work they do.  The way you, you focus for long, long periods of time, and you follow a very, very long, complicated arguments, all right.  The reason that, that [Zeev] Nehari paper, the proof had never been exposed is because nobody had combed through it like I did with a fine-tooth comb.  They had just said, Nehari did it, it's, of course, it's okay.  So, that may make them a little bit more reserved in their interpersonal relationships, but definitely, they love mathematics.  Oh, wow.  They, they love to talk about mathematics, their mathematics.
Story_ID: 24222
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, in '76' [1976], no, I'm sorry, from '75' [1975] to '76' [1976], it says that you taught a course you designed, a two-week course called "What is Calculus About?" to minority sophomore and junior-level high school students during the summer?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: Well, you begin to touch on another phase of a long, career-long effort to help minority students be successful in the sciences.  And this is one example of always looking for ways to support minority students in the sciences.  And I taught this course.  It was in the minority engineering program.  The minority engineering program, an established program at this institution, brought in these high school students.  They taught them hands-on engineering experiences.  And they wanted, wondered could somebody teach them something in mathematics?  Well, I'm not gonna go teach them an Algebra course, all right.  They're gonna have that in high school.  I'm not gonna teach them--I wanna teach them something exciting, something they do not think they can learn, Calculus.  So I designed and taught this course, met every, every day and taught them about Calculus.
Speaker 1: Now, how do you make Calculus accessible to high school students that have never been exposed to it?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, you have to bring it forward.  The Calculus describes physical phenomena, all right.  There's no question about that.  It defines, like I was telling you, it describes mechanical systems.  My research grows out of Calculus.  And so you start with velocity.  Velocity is, remember I told you in Calculus, there are two broad areas of study, differentiation and integration.  Velocity, that's the same stuff that you experience in your car, is the first example of a derivative, remember.  Differentiation, it's a derivative.  It's the first derivative.  Acceleration is the second derivative.  So you start demonstrating some velocity and acceleration, using various mechanisms.  And now, you say, ah, let's try to describer that behavior with an equation.  And now, let's do this to that equation, take its derivative.  And now, let's look at the numbers we get from the velocity and see if they're not the same numbers that are appearing in this equation.  So suddenly, they're associating a certain kind of velocity, which we have measured, with an equation which we got from differentiation (laughter).  And the way I taught this course was, I would lecture for the first part, and every day I had some questions, or hand-out.  Everyday they got a handout.  And the first part was lectures and the second part was to do something yourself on the hand-out.  And so I didn't wanna lecture for a whole hour, you got it, because I had high school students talking about something that was (laughter), clearly esoteric to them.  It turns out I learned something at that experience.  They loved it, okay.  But I noticed something.  Some of the students, they loved those hand-outs.  I worked to make sure they were nice and everything.  But some of the students didn't want to pay too much attention to what I was saying in the first part because they wanted to get to the hand-out.  And, of course, then, they get to the hand-out and they can't solve all the problems (laughter).  But it was a good experience, I think for the kids and the kids would ask, are we really learning Calculus?  I'd say, absolutely, you're learning Calculus.
Story_ID: 24223
Speaker 1: Now, you were a participant in 1980 in a conference at Dartmouth College called "The Special Conference on Women and Minorities in Science and Mathematics", right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was invited to go to Dartmouth and make a presentation.  This was a panel presentation.  I wasn't, I wasn't the primary presenter.  They had several panelists to talk about these issues.  And apparently, Dartmouth was beginning to face some of these (laughter), these kinds of things more directly.  And so they had this conference.  And they, generally, I perceived, wanted to know what was happening here because a lot was happening here, okay.  There were many, many activities designed for minority students.  The women's movement was moving well along, okay, and so I talked about that as best I could.  And I gave them the benefit of some of my general thinking, but that was just a one-day conference.  That's all I can tell you about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, it kind of sets the tone.  You've been doing, involved in this kind of thing all your life, right, from what I can tell?
Speaker 2: It is, indeed, the case that I have been involved in it.
Speaker 1: In '81' [1981], National Science Foundation awards you a $54,000 grant for the study oscillation of linear self adjoint differential systems, right?
Speaker 2: Okay. You're right, you're right in the heart of my research at that point on--that comes out of my dissertation.  That comes out of the whole, that school, A. M. Fink and Zeev Nehari and Phillip Hartman and those, that's the same research, okay.  I'm still on that research, and that was the first of many, many grants, but not in that, on that line of research, but, and very, very important morale building, boost, gave me new courage and new energy.
Story_ID: 24224
Speaker 1: Now, do professors at the University of Massachusetts, I mean what, was the math department like involved in a lot of research in those days in terms of getting research grants and that sort of thing or was it mostly teaching and--
Speaker 2: No, it was definitely focused on research and grants.  There's no question about the focus.  In fact, way back then teaching, teaching was clearly a back-seat second.  And it's no reflection on this institution.  It was true everywhere, all right.  That changed (laughter) as the future moved on.  I assure you, teaching was not a teaching--was no longer a back-seat second.  It became an integral part of a faculty member's activities.  And it had better be done well, yes-- (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, is this, are you speaking of when you were the chair?
Speaker 2: Oh, there's no question about when I was a chair.  But prior to that, it had already started--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --no question.  I didn't, the, all the faculty members knew my sentiments and I expressed them.  But still, the focus on research, to be successful here, you had to be doing research.  You couldn't be successful being just a good teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was during my tenure as well.  There's no question about that.
Speaker 1: Who set the tone for the kind of reemphasizing teaching or bringing teaching back up to prominence?
Speaker 2: I think it was a natural thing that, in the following sense.  It turns out that back there in the '70's [1970s], maybe in the '80's [1980s], there was a huge glut of mathematicians.  And back then mathematicians almost always went into the academic world.  So there weren't enough positions.  So it became very difficult to get a position.  So if it's difficult to get a position, people want, want to make themselves as good as they possibly can be to give themselves the best chance.  So they started to make, to being good teachers.  Now, you have to do research.  That's a given at an institution like this one or any in this class of institutions.  To stay, you must do research and get grants.  But then it became, since there were so many on the market until people started saying, well, I'd better become and expert teacher too.  And that's what happened.  And so I think it was somewhat natural as a result of the market.  And I assure you, it continued.  When I was department head, I became department head in '92' [1992].  We had huge numbers of applications of PhDs, young PhDs, looking for positions of--this is an aside.  You can go back, we'll go back to your question.  But every one of them would, in their, in their packet of materials, they submitted as a job application, they would talk about their teaching credentials, what their experiences were, what their portfolio might look like, how their teaching evaluations had turned out in their prior experiences.  They did not ignore it.  So, it was easy (laughter) to, to continue that, that focus.
Story_ID: 24225
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you became full professor in 1983 and so you're, your whole career basically, you know, is here.  You know, a lot, most of it here at University of Massachusetts, Amherst, right?
Speaker 2: It is, indeed.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, and you're really ensconced here.  Now, one thing that you started doing even as you were a full professor here, is that you were hired as a consultant for the Naval Underwater Systems Center in New London, Connecticut, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And what was your job there?
Speaker 2: It was a Naval research lab.  Okay, we haven't touched yet--even though there've been some hints.  I changed my area of research focus.  Remember, way, way, way back I wanted to be a computer mathematician.  Well, I started to become a computer mathematician here and thus slacked off on the other kind, the oscillation research and complex systems and all of that and started being a computer mathematician.  I started by teaching new courses in this department because there were no other people here doing that.  On the topic, the initial topic is numerical analysis.  It's teaching how to use mathematics, how to put mathematics on a computer to solve generally, physical problems, okay.  And so I was teaching mathematical methods that you could code into a computer.  And part of my courses was, certainly these methods the students had to code, put on a computer here and run it and show how the, what the results were like.  So they were experiencing two things.  They were learning mathematics, numerical analysis.  At the same time, they were learning how to put that material on a computer to actually solve a problem.  It wasn't just theoretical.  You had to solve something with it.  And so, I started doing that, initially at the undergraduate level, teaching undergraduates.  And then I started teaching graduate courses in it.  The department loved it because it then opened up opportunities for our graduate students.  You see our graduates students largely, prior to this point, were all, they would get Masters degrees and PhD degrees and go into the academic world.  Well, here in Massachusetts, there was a huge, huge high-tech industry that was burgeoning.  And so now, those students who were taking these kind of courses, could now take other courses and become much, much more suited to that high-tech industry.  And they just started flooding out, just going--we had PhD students who close to getting a PhD, who would leave.  We thought that was terrible (laughter).  But, you know, they would get a job and it was in two areas, in the high-tech industry and in the, the high-finance areas.  Our analysis students who had studied these kind of topics, all right, they could get, they could get jobs somewhere else now.  They were not academic bound.  So, we moved, I moved then into--I went to Yale [University] for a semester right around that period of time.
Speaker 1: This is right around 1983?
Speaker 2: Okay, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was in the computer science department because at Yale [University], this kind of mathematics was in the computer science department, all right.  It was still at Yale, more pure mathematics in the, in the mathematics department.  But in the computer science department, they had this kind of mathematics.  And so I got to know people at the Naval Underwater Systems Center.  It is or was, it's closed, it was a government laboratory, a government research laboratory, all right.  That's what it was, a research, that's all.  It had no production facilities or anything like that.  So it was engineers, mathematicians, chemists.  So they were part of, they were happy to interact with me, a mathematician who knows numerical methods 'cause see they were using, engineers use these methods.  But they don't really understand them (laughter) as well.  So they, they were happy.  They would come when I was there and make their presentations because they wanted me involved, and that just extended and, and grew.  And so I got to know this community.  And that community at that point was doing underwater acoustics.
Story_ID: 24226
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in '85' [1985] you and Ding Lee--now, this is a colleague at the Naval Research Lab?
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, publish your research, "Analysis of an Implicit Finite Difference Solution to an Underwater Wave Propagation Problem".  That's in the "Journal of Computational Physics".
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So, are--now, you're becoming, you're slowing getting involved in physics now.  You're, which is--math and physics are the same, just one's applied more than the other, right?  That's what--
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, there are many, many relationships between them, but, yes, the fact that that paper was published in the "Journal of Computational Physics" is an indication that the work was valued by a larger community, okay.  And, yes, it alludes to the same work that I'm talking about that's now extended to or actually applied to a problem that was of interest to the Navy.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was the wave propagation problem?
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: Can it be explained--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, let me tell you in the, if you will, crudest terms (laughter) of, of the group.  You know, I then became a member of a large group of scientists who worked in this general area.  Now, what kind of problems were they working on?  It turns out they were working on the following.  You have a submarine, okay, in the ocean.  And a submarine has a signature.  It's motor, everything, it has a signature, every--ours, the Russians, okay.  And the Navy over many, many years, they have captured its signature.  Now, what is its signature?  It is the sounds it makes, and what they sound like, oh, a thousand miles away, all right.  Sound underwater, certain frequencies, the low frequencies, travel just huge, huge great distances.  So, the question becomes, now, the Navy has these signatures.  So they know what sound that submarine is making, okay.  It's way over here making this noise.  Now, they are 500 miles away, all right, or so many miles away.  They're listening, they listening.  Can they recognize that sound, all right?  Can they recognize the sound over here that that submarine is making 500 miles away?  Okay, now, that's the problem.  So (laughter), that's a partial differential equation problem.  The problem itself is quite well understood theoretically, but it's very difficult to compute numerically.  So, we're listening at this sound, we're getting this sound.  And can we, can we identify it from this submarine, this particular submarine as a result of knowing its signature?  Okay, that's kind of confusing, but it's making a sound.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) yeah.
Speaker 2: So we're hearing something way over there.  Can we identify that it is definitely Russian Sub Number so and so.  That's the mathematics problem.
Speaker 1: So it's that specific?  You want to recognize a particular submarine?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Not just a Russian or an American submarine, but you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah--
Speaker 1: --or a model, but a specific submarine?
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.  You know, I went to many, many professional meetings where this kind of stuff was talked about.  Now, some of the guys who made their presentations had, had secret clearances.  And this is what I learned, as a result of just being in the, the groups.  They had secret clearances.  So they couldn't talk about secret stuff, all right, but they could talk about the general research that all the rest of us were, were talking about.  I could not do secret research.  That's not allowed at the University.  But the one thing you quickly discovered that the Navy had was that it had very, what we call "fine", meaning very, very good data on what each submarine sounded like (laughter).   The sound it made, they knew and now, the problem we're working on is, if you know what that sound is, can you recognize it way, way, way far away and identify it as that.  And there were any number of ways to work on this problem, but that was the general problem that we were working on.  And I was considered amongst that group of faculty-they're not faculty members.  Most of them were at government labs, okay, a few faculty members, but most were at government labs.  They called me a numerical modeler.  Now, many of them, they would go out on a ship for six weeks, you know, and test things.  You know, they would put some kind of a sound out somewhere, and then they would let the ship move way, way away from it, and then they would listen to it.  And so now, they have real data, all right. It was laboratory data, but it was real data.  And so I never did that.  I could have.  They invited me.  Why don't you come on the ship (laughter)?  I didn't have six weeks to spend on a ship (laughter).  And, but I was a numerical modeler, all right.  I could take their data and run it in my computer code and show them what answer I got.  That's, that's what they would like to see.  So they called me a numerical modeler as opposed to a real modeler (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, well, you know, from what I've heard in the course of doing these interviews, theoretical physicists do a lot, I mean they come up with a theory based on mathematical formulas to analysis real phenonom--you know, phenomenon of motion and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Indeed, theoretical physics is almost all mathematics.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, there's no question about it.  And some, some very important developments in theoretical physics have had a huge impact in mathematics itself, and it's still going on right now.  It's a big, big thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, okay, so you delivered a paper, I guess, based on this research at the first IMACS Symposium on Computational Acoustics at Yale University in New Haven in '86' [1986] called "Accurate Computation of the Wide Ankle Wave Equation", right.  Okay.  So you just discussed that, so you, yeah, you're, so most of what you do, I guess, in the next, you know, ten years or so are around acoustical wave computations?
Speaker 2: That is precisely the case.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I am in that community and working in it, and supported by the Office of Naval Research to do that kind of research.
Story_ID: 24227
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a highlight of that research that you wanna share with us?  I know you've been to, you were in Paris.  You delivered a paper there, and, I don't know, Chicago--
Speaker 2: The research was just ongoing.  I'm sure that in all of that research there was always a computer component, okay, where we actually ran data to show that our model, our mathematical model worked and how it worked, how good it worked, what it did that other models couldn't do.  So, when that computer data came off, and we looked at those graphs, those were high points, all right.  But writing up the papers and making the presentations, certainly in Paris [France] at the Sorbonne [University] or Scandinavia, in Ireland and England, it's kind of anticlimactic at that point.  You're just presenting the results.  The exciting stuff is when, when the research, you're doing it, and it comes out, and it's exactly what you had hoped, that's exciting.  Your heart starts beating (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that has always been the case with, with research and me.  You get so excited when you get something that you think is, is good, that, something you've been trying to do for ever so long, oh, wow.  It's exciting.
Story_ID: 24228
Speaker 1: I noticed, it just occurred to me that your change of direction kind of coincided with the change in direction of computer capacity, I guess, in some ways because I think, say '83' [1983] when they had the first personal computers, around '83' [1983]--
Speaker 2: You're absolutely right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I got my first personal computer about '83' [1983].  But you're right.  I could (unclear), a while, I was disappointed in myself.  There were super computers.  The first super computers, and gosh, I can't remember their name right now.  It was a person's name.  It turns out, I worked on those super computers.  In fact, the Navy had a bank of super computers somewhere.  It was the same one, this one name, all right.  And I worked on those for a while.  And then they opened a new camp, somewhere in Mississippi, Stennis, maybe, with a new set of those super computers.  And it turns out, the computer language, see, all the scientists who were on this, this other super computer were using this one language.  It's called VMS, I think it was.  The new language was Unix on the new super computer.  Well, all those scientists didn't know Unix.  Here in our department, we had been using Unix for years.  I could immediately jump on the new super computer that was there and use it, just, just use it (laughter).  I mean it was great.  I had it.  You know, you could look at the computer and see how many people were on it.  Well, there maybe would be six (laughter).  One time, one time the system administrator, all right, of that system, the super computer in Mississippi sent me an email message saying, Mr. St. Mary, we're gonna take the machine down now.  Would you please (laughter) log off, okay?  Super computer, the biggest computers in the world.  Okay, within six weeks to two months, there were a hundred people on it, okay, because everybody wanted to use it, but they just, they couldn't because they didn't know Unix operating system language.  But within six weeks, two months, certainly within six months, it was just really, you had to, it was, it was not so easy to use it then.
Speaker 1: So you had access during a crucial period almost by yourself (laughter)?
Speaker 2: That's right.  That was just phenomenal.
Story_ID: 24229
Speaker 1: I have always been concerned about community things.  Now, I came out of a rigidly segregated environment, okay.  I know what rigid segregation is like.  Well, I got here and there was some organizations who were fighting for poor people and black people.  And that organization in Springfield was doing what's called "fair housing".  Now, an old, old community organizer will know what fair housing.  It's when white people won't rent an apartment to black people.  All right, they'll tell 'em, it's occupied or something.  You got it.  And then white people go and, yeah, they show it to 'em and see if they want it.  Well, so that organization back then was doing fair housing testing.  And so they had white staff members and black staff members.  And so they would send black staff members or, or they would send real people who needed an apartment, to get an apartment, all right.  And they would be turned away, it's rented or something.  Well, the organization then would send a couple of its white staff there to, to look, and the apartment was, was (laughter) wholly available.  And so they would then charge 'em.  And I said, I'm prepared to get involved with an organization like that.  And so I got involved with them and I stayed involved with them for sixteen or seventeen years, on their board, the president of the board for a number of years because I supported institutions like that.  And so that was a community involvement.  And it wasn't the only one, several others I was involved in, but in support of minority persons, poor persons, I'm willing to, to extend some of my energy in that direction.
Story_ID: 24230
Speaker 1: Okay, now, it was in 1992, as you said, earlier, you became the department head here at University of Massachusetts, Amherst.  How did that take place and how did you feel about it at the time?
Speaker 2: It was '94' [1994], wasn't it?
Speaker 1: It says here ninety--oh, was it '94' [1994]?
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you said it was '92' [1992].  That's why I thought it was '92' [1992].
Speaker 2: Okay, it--
Speaker 1: No, no, that's right.  It is '94' [1994].  It's '94' [1994]--
Speaker 2: Okay, good (laughter).
Speaker 1: So all right.
Speaker 2: I thought for a moment I might have put '92' [1992].  Okay, it was '94' [1994].  You said, how did it come about?  Well, in the department of mathematics and statistics here, the dean appoints a committee, upon the recommendations of the senior faculty, to--of faculty members inside the department and one faculty member from outside, usually in physics or computer science, possibly chemistry, okay.  But those are close.  And it, and the dean asked that committee to canvas the department and discuss broadly whom it might recommend to be department head.  There's no, you don't step--nobody puts their name in the ring, okay, not in this department.  There's no such thing as, as me throwing my name in the ring saying, I want to be considered.  Not done.  No, anybody who did that (laughter) is sure to be blackballed completely.  No.  Committee goes to work, starts talking to people, all the faculty, talks, talks, interacts.  It eventually settles on some small number of faculty members, and it interviews them, the committee does, about becoming department head.  And what that person thinks, etc. about this.  So it interviews these people.  And it interviewed me.  I never knew, to tell you how closed mouth this thing is, I never knew whom else they interviewed, okay.  But they interviewed me.  They asked me would I allow myself to be interviewed for the department headship?  Didn't think much of it.  I never expected to be department head.  I was prepared to be if they, if they asked me, but I never expected to be.  I didn't think I would be selected.  They interviewed me.  Normally, a committee like this would recommend to the dean the names of two or three people.  They sent one name to the dean, one, mine.  That was it.  The dean appointed me (laughter).  She had, she was happy to appoint me.
Speaker 1: Good, this was 1994.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 24231
Speaker 1: Yes, now, we neglected to go over the, to talk about the SEP Program.  That started in '92' [1992], National Cancer Institute awards you a five-year, $3 million grant for a science enrichment program.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was a phenomenal thing.  SEP stands for Science Enrichment Program.  The goal is to try to move minority students and underserved students, so students who may not be a minority, but be in a community where their--communities where their development would not be very robust.  Enter the sciences.  Now, the National Cancer Institute, of course, would like for them to be biological scientists.  But I didn't care about that (laughter).  I wanted to move them into the sciences.  You have to be a scientist before you can be a biological scientist at some level in any case.  And so I designed this program.  It brings rising, ninth grade students from all over New England and Upstate New York, as far away as Buffalo and all of that, to this campus for a five-week residential program.  And there are six areas of study that are studied extensively.  Each area of study, the six areas are biology, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, physics and language arts, okay.  So you have five science areas and one non-science area, language arts.  These were structured courses.  Each course was taught by a professor and a high school teacher.  The professor may come from here or I may have gotten him from other institution, but they were professorial status, and I told these professors, to design courses that are not in the high school curriculum.  Don't want anything that's in high school that they're gonna learn next year.  Said, you design a course for, for students that they can understand and learn from, but I want it to be serious, and it needs to--if you can bring in research, bring it.  And they did miraculously.  I was, I was really impressed with the faculty and the high school teachers.  They worked hand-in-glove.  They designed the courses.  Usually, the professor designed the course before the high school teacher got here.  I found the best high school teachers I could find anywhere, from Chicago, from wherever.  I had a fantastic chemistry high school teacher from Chicago.  And, now, had a full residential staff, counselors that worked with the students directly.  I had senior staff, residents' hall staff and a full program, all activities, all day were planned.  And it was enormously successful.
Speaker 1: Were the students from the Boston area or from Springfield or, you know, cities in Massachusetts mainly or--
Speaker 2: No, we couldn't do that.  We certainly had some from those areas, those large geographical areas.  But because this, we were supposed to be covering a broad geographical area.  So we definitely had students from those (unclear), from Springfield, from Hartford, but we also had students from Maine, from Upstate New York, from Buffalo, as I mentioned.  And so it was largely populated by minority students, black students, Hispanic students and some American Indian students.  But I just considered it enormously successful.  Everybody who interacted with it just thought it was phenomenally good.
Speaker 1: How many years did you do this?
Speaker 2: We ran it five years or was it six years?  (Laughter) Am I having a senior moment?
Story_ID: 24232
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in 1995, you were honored as the National Association of Mathematics David Blackwell Lecturer.  And tell us who, what is the National Association of Mathematics, and who is David Blackwell?
Speaker 2: Okay, it turns out that the American Mathematical Society is the primary professional society of mathematicians in this country, American Mathematical Society.  It's a huge thing, okay.  The national meetings have three, to five to 6,000 mathematicians attending.  There's another college-level mathematical association called the Mathematical Association of America.  That's the teaching focus.  The American Mathematical Society is the research focus, all right.  But it's the professional organization.  Well, so, the National Mathematical, NAM, National Association of Mathematicians is the black national society, okay.  It came into existence many, many years ago.  And it holds its meetings, as do many, many other societies, at the same time as the national meetings are held.  You know, it's a sub meeting in the national.  And they also usually held a summer meeting of just NAM, National Association of Mathematicians.  Well, David Blackwell was a very, very famous black mathematician, really a statistician.  But certainly, very, very famous, developed some very famous and important statistics,  eventually, a professor, long-time professor at Berkley [University of California], okay.  Well, NAM wanted to celebrate him, okay.  So, they instituted a series, the David Blackwell Lecture Series.  David Blackwell, himself, gave the first lecture, the year before my lecture.  So I was considered the first in the series, all right, the first annual (laughter), after the man, himself, gave the one the previous year.  And so that was decidedly an honor, for them to have chosen me to make that presentation.
Speaker 1: That's right, it's quite an honor, yeah.  So does that, that means on some level that you were the, I guess, after David Blackwell, the highest regarded black mathematician in the country?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I had never thought about it like that.  I won't go that far, but it's an interesting analogy.
Speaker 1: It could mean that, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I hadn't thought about it, and I don't think, I don't think it was true, by the way.  So let's just leave it there (laughter).
Story_ID: 24233
Speaker 1: Who are some of the other top-flight, black mathematicians, that we may or may not have heard of?  You know, everybody's heard of the dream basketball team, and that sort of thing, but who were the mathematicians?
Speaker 2: Well, you have a very, very high-quality mathematician here at the University of Massachusetts who was here with me for many, many, many years, Floyd Williams, very distinguished mathematician.  He is now retired as well as am I.  You have, you know, I think of my, the people who were contemporary with me (laughter).  There's a mathematician called Jim Donaldson at, at Howard [University] faculty member there for years and years and years.  And he might still be.  I haven't, since I'm retired I don't interact that much, but he was a contemporary of mine, working in mathematics, not so different from my own.  There's another mathematician at, at Maryland who was another contemporary.  We were all contemporaries.  Oh, wow, I'm having that senior moment.  We've been talking too long.  He's quite a friend.  We've known each other for years and years and years.  And he was a department head at Maryland [State University] for a number of years.  So very clearly distinguished.  I'm sure I could come up with others, but that's a sampling.
Story_ID: 24234
Speaker 1: What was your philosophy of how math should be taught in, on a college campus?
Speaker 2: Indeed, I emphasized that the people who were here needed to be good teachers.  And my, my personal inclination about how you'd be a good teacher is to be to empathetic to, with the students, okay.  Now, remember I told you some time ago that when I was a graduate students, faculty members thought their responsibility is to put the material out there.  And you got it if you could (laughter).  They'd turn around and look at the faculty member, and they'd answer questions if somebody had some.  But they didn't care.  That was unacceptable, all right.  And I made it known that, however you did it, the students in the class needed to know that you were concerned about their learning of the material you were presenting, not just simply presenting it.  They needed to know it, okay, not only (laughter), you had to express it in some way by your actions, how you dealt with the class, learning all the students' names in your class, some kind of way, you had to express to them that you were concerned about them as individuals learning the material that you were teaching.  That could be grading their papers.  There're many, many ways to do it.  So that was, that's my philosophy, and it, it certainly, and different teach methods, can be utilized.  I don't wanna restrict anybody's initiative, but the students had to perceive that you were concerning about their learning the material and you were willing to help them to learn it.  Now, another way that came out loud and clear is because I wrote the advertisements for new faculty into this department.  And in every advertisement that ever went out for a faculty member or for the hiring of a new faculty member into this department, it said in it, amongst other things, research, no question, okay.  You, you have to have a research program and be functioning in that research program.  That's understood.  But it also said you have to be an excellent teacher at all levels of the curriculum.  Now, (laughter), let me tell you what that means at an institution like this.  You teach, there--we have students, we have to teach some remedial courses sometimes, all right.  Now, some faculty member could maybe be stuck, all right.  I'll use that word advisedly, stuck, teaching some, some large group of elementary students, some kind of an advanced Algebra course, college Algebra course.  They damn well better do it well, okay.  That's what it meant.  It's easy to teach graduate courses.  Oh, man, that's easy, the interaction.  It's vibrant.  Those students want to, want to learn the material.  Advanced undergraduates, it's almost the same.  But when you get down there, those students are disinterested, or if they're teaching first-semester calculus, you, you don't--don't treat that course cavalierly.  And that's what it meant, at all levels of the curriculum, you have to demonstrate excellence.  And let me tell you, phenomenal.  The people we hired (laughter), here we have teacher evaluations.  That's been going on long, long before I ever became department head.  It's been going on here, you know, in all of history that I know of.  And there're numbers associated with it.  The young people who were hired into this faculty, and there were a lot of them, they raised the standard (laughter) of the teaching numbers on the existing faculty.  They were good.  And I focused during my tenure as department head on the rejuvenation and regeneration of the faculty.  We had a huge number of elderly faculty.  And I wanted to replace those who I could clearly see were going to be retiring.  I think that might have been why the search committee selected me, because I may have been the only person who saw what the future, the next eight years, and that's how long I was department head, was gonna look like.  And that's what I told them.  You know, I was honest.  I didn't think I was gonna get the job, so I wasn't buttering any of 'em up.  I told 'em what the central issue was in going forward in this department, was that a large number of people were about to retire and the next department head had to focus on keeping those positions because the dean, the dean would like to (laughter) capture the positions, maybe put 'em somewhere else.  I said, that's, that's the focus of the next department head.  And I assure you, I kept that focus.

Speaker 1: In '99' [1999], the National Science Foundation awarded you a five-year, $2.5 million grant for Alliances for Graduate Education Professorial, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, another big effort that I worked on.  And largely I initially spearheaded the effort to write the grant.  But there were some other faculty members from various departments here who were enormously supportive and who eventually, you know, they took upon themselves, leadership roles in that thing.  And the goal of that program was to bring minority graduate students into this institution and to try to support them to get--and broadly support them through to PhD degrees.  That was the goal.  And it's not trivial to get a PhD in the sciences, I assure you.  And so they, and the minority students, in particular, don't have all these role models and all the support in their undergraduate careers.  It's a huge, largely, that's the case.  Sometimes they do, but, so they need more support after they get here and support to be brought here, support to be convinced that you can do it.  And so that's what that program did.  And that program, the P.I., the principal investigator, was designated to be the provost of the institution.  So I was not the P.I.  I was just one of the, the principal movers, the co-P.I.'s.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in 2000 the National Science Foundation awards you co-principal investigator, and--you and co-principal investigators, D. Barrington, S. Ergas, C. Poli, and K. Ruben, a four-year, $200,000 grant for computer science, engineering and mathematics scholarships?
Speaker 2: Yep, that's the first of three grants it turns out.  The final total was, oh, about 1.5 million, maybe it was 1.1 million.  The first of three grants.  Now, these grants were, again, to support minority students, minority students and women in the sciences.  And it was to support undergraduates students, ours was.  So, I wrote this grant, and this, we wrote it to, to target community college science students.  So a student who is getting an Associate degree from a community college, all right, who is in the sciences, we're gonna provide them scholarships to come to this institution to major in the sciences in hopes that they'll get a degree in, in that science area they were studying.  And the areas were engineering, mathematics, and computer science.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And we got three grants.  I was the P.I. on the first two, and on the third one, I was now retired, and I said, well, why don't we find somebody else to be the P.I., and I will be a supporter.  I should mention some names of people.  On the previous grant that you mentioned, ghee, they're, the people who worked on that, that was a big grant, 2.5 million grant earlier for, for graduate student support.  Charletta Seymour was the dean of the graduate school, and then she became provost.  And so she was a moving force in that, in that initiative.  There's no question, and very, very supportive.  And there were other people associated with that, and one of whom is Sandy Peterson.  She, a biology professor.  She was just tremendous in helping get that going.  It was a big operation, and another was Peter Hepler, Peter Hepler, a biology professor.  Don Fisher, a civil engineering professor.  These, these people, these faculty members supported me and I didn't feel the need to have to be the point person because they could be.  And then, and, and they just moved that along.  And in the CSEMS activity, that's the one where we supported community college students, all right, to come here to work on a Bachelors degree.  I had an assistant dean in the school of engineering who was just invariable, invaluable.  Her name is Kathy Reuben.  With her, I could never have been department head and run those kind of programs (laughter).  Now, that I'm mentioning people's names, whew, there are many, many names.  One of my supporters in the SEP program, Science Enrichment program, remember, that's a huge endeavor for high school students.  My assistant who, my right-hand assistant was Georgette Healy.  Without her support, I never, ever could have run that program.  So I just wanna mention some names of important people throughout, who, who were, gave just ultimate support to me in my endeavors.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, so the National Science Foundation grant that you were stating earlier, it started in 2000 and it went on, 2002 and 2003, I think, you know, and those are the other two parts--
Speaker 2: That's right, and three grants.
Story_ID: 24236
Speaker 1: In 2002, you were honored by, as a professor emeritus, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Two thousand two [2002].
Speaker 2: I retired, and the university bestowed the title, "Professor Emeritus" of Mathematics and Statistics.  But this is routine, and anybody who serves as a professor for all these years, they will be designated such.  So, I don't want to claim any (laughter) special honors there.
Speaker 1: All right, so did you, when you, now, you didn't, you didn't end your research with retirement, did you?
Speaker 2: I didn't think I was, okay.  I started working on things and still doing some things, and I had some unfinished papers.  But I had spent so much time as a academic, as an academic administrator, where I had not focused on, on research, all right.  There was, there was just not time to focus, the way research needs to focused on.  You have to bring everything to it.  And so I retired, but I didn't feel that I was gonna be successful because I didn't have the energy to bring to it that I had when I was much younger, and then to start again.  So I have not continued doing the research.  I, I'm very much interested in mathematics.  I come to talks here.  I was here last week for two talks, two colloquial lectures, okay, remember, I told you about colloquial lectures, and A. M. Fink saying you've gotta go (laughter) to the lectures, two of 'em.  I was here this week, and I have an office in the department, and I like to come in here and see what's going on and interact with the people.  But I'm not doing any research directly myself anymore.
Story_ID: 24237
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what are some of your other community activities?
Speaker 2: Those--
Speaker 1: We mentioned the housing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a program in Amherst called  the "ABC Program".  It's actually a part of the National ABC Program--it may have originated in Chicago [Illinois], I'm not sure, where minority students, black, Hispanic and American Indian students, are brought in to a community and put into the school systems and supported by the community, all right.  The community raises money through donations and the community owns a house that, and they have a staff person.  And those students live in that house and go to school here.  They usually come in ninth grade, about ninth grade, eighth grade sometimes.  And they graduate from here.  So, from the high school.  There's kind of an elaborate high school in Amherst [Massachusetts], (laughter) okay.  So that's the undercurrent.  And so they come here, and they're supported by the community in this way.  There's a board of directors that's a hands-on board, and I was a very, very early member of the board, maybe the second year the program came into existence, I was a member of the board for several years, treasurer of the board (laughter).  So, and that's a community support thing.  I was also on another board in North Hampton for a few years too that gave support primarily for poor people because that, this is the kind of thing I feel I escaped, okay.  I escaped.  I was a lucky one, you know.  My story is phenomenal, coming out of where I came from to have arrived at the kind of career I've had.  So anything I can do for people in the community to help move them forward and give them support, I have tried to do it.
Story_ID: 24238
Speaker 1: All right, sir, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, concerns.  Remember I told you that in my African American community, in my neighborhood, the people I interacted with all over the place, they told a kid like me the mantra, "Stay in school".  My inclination is to believe that mantra no longer is a mantra in the black community.  I wish it were.  I can't, I can't tell, but there is, there seems to be some other mantra, but I'm not sure there's a single one.  So, the, the black youth some kind of way need to learn delayed gratification.  Delayed gratification is so important to real gratification.  I don't have the slightest idea how you teach this.  It needs to learn, the black community, the black youth, needs some kind of way, the initiative to want to achieve, and, you know, we have the peer, the negative peer pressure just, this is terrible.  This is worst possible thing that could happen.  But I believe racism has not died, okay.  There's no question about that.  There's no question, but I believe there are opportunities for black people who are successful in their endeavors.  They will, if you go to school and you be successful in your, in your studies, there are companies out there who want to hire you.  They want to have a black person on their staff.  I believe that firmly.  But you have to show some success first, and that's a problem.  That's a problem.  You can't drift, just drift from one thing to the next and then expect to be in a position to be desired by a company or by somebody to hire you.  No.
Story_ID: 24239
Speaker 1: Okay, one thing I forgot to ask you about was your draft card, just to illustrate like how far we've come on some level at least, even though we haven't come far enough.  Tell us about your draft designation--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --at age eighteen, I believe it was.
Speaker 2: That's right, at age eighteen, you had to sign up for the draft because there was a draft.  It was a lottery when I was eighteen, but there was a draft.  So I went in to sign up, dutifully, 'cause you were--it was the law.  You had to sign up when you were eighteen.  And I, so I was given my card, and it has my, my name on it, full name and some address and such things, and then I turn it over, and in one place, it has the word "complexion".  And my complexion is listed as light-chocolate (laughter).  The racism and the designation of being black or "colored", all right, back then, they didn't want it to escape me in any way (laughter).  Of course, I didn't want it to escape me either, but (laughter) "light chocolate", using that euphemism when there was no space on the card for anything real.  That was, that was the environment I lived in.
Story_ID: 24240
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: Major is the key word.  I've enjoyed my career enormously, and it has been most rewarding to me.  There's no question.  I left the department headship on retirement.  The department was very disappointed that I had chose to leave at that point.  So the department valued me.  There is no question about it.  The ensuing department heads will contact me, the current department head, ten years later he'll come, he'll contact me and say, can I talk to you?  So he perceives, he never knew me as department head, okay.  He's new to the (laughter) faculty, since I left, but he has heard of my interaction with the faculty, and he wants to know about it and how he might be successful.  So I was, I was certainly valued there.  In the area of teaching, if, if I may use the vernacular, I was a hard ass (laughter).  I was a tough teacher.  There's no question about that.  I believe people--I worked hard myself.  I made the classes good, and I expected the students to produce as well.  I graded my own papers most of the time, certainly in any class that was reasonably small because I wanted the students to know, I knew what their individual work was like.  And so by way of regret (laughter) in this area of, of interacting with students, I would not say no so many times as I think I said it (laughter), in my professional teaching career because I was too much of a hard ass (laughter).  So, I would say, yes.  I'll find a way to do this for you or, yes, you can do that.  I'll let you do that, whereas, that wasn't my tendency.  Everybody had to tow the same (laughter) markers.
Story_ID: 24241
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, again, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow, legacy (laughter).  Well, I consider my professional career to have had these, these various focuses, okay, one of which was to try to support minority students, in particular, support them so they could be successful in the sciences.  Okay, to the extent that there are students out there who felt that support and as a result were, were successful, and I believe there are some, then they are my legacy.  There's no question about that.  Even some who just took courses from me and felt they experienced something that was special, they are my legacy.  The research in mathematics, okay, research is permanent.  You write a paper and it's supposed to be proved and everything is final.  It's just as valid today as it was 20 years ago when you wrote it, okay.  That's the mathematics, and if I use that word again, "Mantra".  In engineering, that's not the case.  Engineering is talking about some development right now.  And it's the latest development that I just discovered, but ten years later, there's a better development, okay.  And so it makes the previous one obsolete.  So, your mathematics stands by itself.  So in a sense, that is a legacy.  I don't think I ever developed any great, great thing that's gonna go down in mathematical history as being "the" development in this particular area.  I wish, I wish (laughter) I had, but it's extremely hard in mathematics to do that, and not many people do.  And the other area, of course, I ended up in academic administration, kind of inadvertently, right?  The department selected me to be its department head.  Well, I took it on vigorously.  And every, all faculty members here who were, who experienced it, they know it, they appreciate it, they wish that their ensuing department heads were as good, and so they, those faculty members are my legacy as well.  It's hard to talk about legacy (laughter).
Story_ID: 24242
Speaker 1: Well, we haven't asked you anything more about your family since I think you had a two-year old at one stage we talked about, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was in '67' [1967].
Speaker 1: Yeah, how many children do you have and what are they doing?
Speaker 2: We have three daughters.  The oldest is a professor at the University of Florida in the biology department.  She has a PhD from the University of California at Santa Barbara.  She's an environmental biologist.  And her specialty is, she studies fish, whole fish, okay, in various environments and how they thrive, how they reproduce, things of this nature in the laboratory as well as out in the, in the areas, in the waters.  And she's done a lot of scuba diving and wading through ponds and all this kind of stuff.  So she's now an associate professor there.  Our middle daughter has a job to die for (laughter) for many young people.  She is an interior design person for Ralph Lauren.  She is in charge of decorating Ralph Lauren stores, okay, so interior design.  She designs the interior of buildings, all right, no clothes or anything.  She designs, puts, places furniture and such stuff in the, in the store, okay, for clothes and stuff to be put on it.  And what's on the walls and what's there, everything, what's the furnishings like?  She is the director for international stores, for all of Ralph Lauren's international stores.  So she's always, she travels all over.  She's in France, okay, she's in--most recent trip, well, just a few weeks ago, she was in Tokyo.  From there she went to Hong Kong, okay, opening new stores.  So her office is in New York City.  And so they work in the lab.  They have a very elaborate system of design and so she has staff people, architects, all kind of people who design, they have precise measurements and what everything looks like of a building that they are gonna use as a store, the windows, absolutely, everything is in that design.  And now, in New York City, they design what the store is gonna look like, what furniture they're gonna use.  They order that furniture.  They have, they have warehouses all over the place.  And now, the final thing is to put it all together.  And so, in Tokyo, she was putting together a store.  In Hong Kong, she was putting together a store, and so it's her responsibility to see that the final product, project comes out as it was supposed to.  And so she travels all over the world, essentially (laughter).
Speaker 1: So that's daughter Number two.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Daughter Number three, is a lawyer.  Oh, I might as well mention this.  Our oldest daughter got her undergraduate degree at Harvard [University].  Our middle daughter got her undergraduate degree right here.  Our youngest daughter is a lawyer.  She was a Yale [University] graduate and a Yale law graduate.  She's a corporate lawyer, and she works as an in-house lawyer for Harris Corporation.  Harris Corporation is an international IT corporation.  She, she lives right outside of Washington, D.C. and so she works primarily in the government interactions division of Harris Corporation.  Harris Corporation has many, many, many contracts with the government, okay, as you would expect, an IT company.  They produce, they produce some things too.  And so she is the lawyer that keeps the company (laughter) straight in its dealings with the federal government over its contracts.  We have five grandchildren, four grandsons and one granddaughter.  And my only hope is that those grandchildren, talking about legacy, will learn this delayed gratification that I was talking about, will learn not to give up when a problem gets hard.  You don't do that.  You get tougher when the problems get, gets hard.  That makes you be able to solve harder problems, and so that's our family.
Story_ID: 24243
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, my gosh (laughter).  I don't know what that question means?  Does it mean, what would you like to have on your tombstone (laughter)?  No, I don't know what to say.  I think I've already alluded to the answer to that question.  In your legacy question, I really, really have answered that, that people remember me as someone who, who helped them, who was sincere about it and concerned about them and spent significant time and effort helping them, whether they were students coming up, whether they were students in my classes, whether there were times when I was a department head when very, very touchy subjects came up, and they come up.  This is a huge department, okay.  Many, many graduate students who were teaching.  So things come up, even with faculty members.  We had issues, and I never shied away from them.  I took 'em, and I, I worked to solve them, in the best interests of everybody.  So those, those individuals who maybe ran into some troubles felt, I hope a very measured, fair hand in helping them over these difficult times.  So the legacy is, though what those people think, and I hope they think positively.
Story_ID: 24244
Speaker 1: Well, this is the draft card that we alluded to earlier in the interview.  On the other side, it has just the vital statistics like my name and address and everything.  On this side, it has the color of my hair, the color of my eyes, and then it has a place for complexion.  And it put, on complexion it put, they put "light chocolate" (laughter).
Speaker 2: This is my mother, Daietta.
Speaker 1: Can you spell her name because it's kind of hard?
Speaker 2: D-A-I-E-T-T-A.
Speaker 1: This is my father, my mother and my mother's mother, my grandmother.  That's Big Mother.
Speaker 2: And what's your grandmother's name?
Speaker 1: I couldn't--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's right, we--
Speaker 1: --you at the moment (laughter).  I can tell you in a little while.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's another picture of my father.
Speaker 2: This is an early picture of my family.
Speaker 1: Can you do 'em like left to right?
Speaker 2: Yes, this is, our middle daughter is on--
Speaker 1: The left.
Speaker 2: --the left.  My wife is the next person there.
Speaker 1: Can you name them?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, Germaine is the one on the left, and my wife, Laverne, is next.  Our youngest daughter, Michelle is next.  I'm there, and then our oldest daughter, Colette, is the one on the far right.
Speaker 1: This is a later picture of my wife and I.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother and father.
Speaker 1: Can you name them, please?
Speaker 2: Daietta Perez St. Mary and Frank Joseph St. Mary.
Speaker 1: Somebody's doing a caption for these, you know, so that's--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Say the name for everybody, you know, even though you've already said it.
Speaker 2: This is an old, old, old picture of probably my senior high school prom where this is my future wife.  At that point, I had met her not so long before this picture was taken.  It's Laverne and Donald.
Speaker 1: That's just a picture of me at a much, much younger age.
Speaker 2: And another picture.  Certainly, I may have been in high school at that point.  Could have been in high school, maybe in college, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, this one tells you what it is, all right.  It's me in elementary school, '51' [1951] through '52' [1952], '51' [1951], '52' [1952].
Speaker 2: It's another picture of me in a suit, probably high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, another picture of me.  This one is '52' [1952], '53' [1953].
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959], it looks like--
Speaker 1: Ah, this is 1959.  I actually have my letter jacket on there which I still have, and it--I lettered, I don't know, junior year maybe, in basketball, and it has a basketball on it and a pin.
Speaker 2: That's me.  It must have been undergraduate graduation, maybe.
Speaker 1: Ah, that must have been high school graduation, I would expect.
Speaker 2: This is a senior party, all right.  This is a party where my friends and I are at the party, and I seem to be having a lot of fun there (laughter).  But that's a senior in high school.
Speaker 1: This is me in high school, maybe, around that period, yes.
Speaker 2: It's a cool picture.
Speaker 1: Yeah, with the black leather jacket, yep.
Speaker 2: Out fishing, probably the last time I ever went fishing, but that's high school.
Speaker 1: This is high school.  That's me on the far right.
Speaker 2: This is certainly young.  I must be in seventh or eighth grade there.
Speaker 1: Again, seventh or eighth grade.  I'm, I had responsibilities around the house so I'm doing something, digging.  I don't know what.  But that's my house and that's my neighborhood.  You see what the houses look like.
Speaker 2: I'm in this picture over about two thirds to the right.  This is my high school and many students, can't say exactly what the occasion is.
Speaker 1: And where are you?  You're--
Speaker 2: I'm right there.
Speaker 1: I think you're Number 12 here.
Speaker 2: That's right.  This is my sophomore year in high school.  I made the basketball team, and I'm Number 12, and, in fact, after that year, I was always Number 16.  And that was one of my classmates.  He made it too as a sophomore, next to me.  He had 16 on, but I wore 16 for the rest of the years.
Speaker 1: This is a senior class play, "Just Ducky".  That's me in the middle.  There're six people--there're five people in there, and that's me in the middle.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is the Science Enrichment Program students.  We are probably here listening to a professional presentation, a talk given by some scientist.  But this is during, and I'm up there.  You see me with the white shirt and the tie.
Speaker 2: This is, again, a function with the Science Enrichment Program.
Speaker 1: This is the first year of the Science Enrichment Program.  That person next to me was the professor who, who organized the language arts program during the first year.
Speaker 2: What about his name?
Speaker 1: I can't remember his name (laughter).
Speaker 2: That is the professor, the high school teacher I told you from Chicago who was phenomenal.  This is her on the right of these two.  This other person my director of the program, Rose, oh, gosh, I've been at this too long.  This is Rose.  She was the director of the program.  I was the principal investigator, and, who oversaw everything, but I hired her to direct things on a daily basis in the summer, Rose Myers.
Speaker 1: I don't know what that is.  Okay.  It's just a picture of me during that same period.  A Science Enrichment Program person took that picture.
Story_ID: 24245
Speaker 1: This picture is a picture of the students in the Science Enrichment program.  There may be some teachers in there as well, but that's what the group looked like all right.  And I don't think I'm in that picture.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is a more formal group picture.  I'm on the upper right corner of this, and you have faculty members in there, professors and teachers who, who were participants in the program, who taught in it, etc.  But that's the program.
Speaker 1: This is an article in "Massachusetts Magazine", the alumni magazine of the university that they highlighted the program, and it was--our program was the focus of the magazine that month.
Speaker 2: This is during my department headship.  I'm introducing various students and faculty to introduce themselves or I'm passing out certificates.  We gave certificates to students who were leaving, just certificates honoring them for being here.  And this is continuing, same kind of--this is the same meeting, same meeting.  See, that guy has a certificate in his hand.  He's probably just been given it.
Speaker 1: This is me in the lower picture.  This a picture taken while I'm lecturing in the classroom.
Speaker 2: There are a number of these.  It's another picture taken while I'm lecturing in the classroom, and that's my work on the blackboard.
Speaker 1: This is a good one here.  I like this one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, here's another broad picture.  Yeah, I'm trying to see what course it was, but I can't immediately.  But it's me lecturing in the classroom, upper right, same thing.  These pictures are me lecturing.  They were taken live while I'm lecturing a real class.  They were not staged in any way.
Speaker 1: Okay, the key thing here is that that phrase right there, "Most  Industrious".  This is high school graduation.  You get, they designated the two of us "Most Industrious".  Carolyn Ross is, was the Valedictorian of our class.  Remember I told you (laughter), that there were two women, Carolyn and Wanda, who were very, very excellent students, not necessarily in mathematics, but in other areas.
Speaker 2: Okay, I guess we got (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That was the only other "Stars" (unclear) one there.  You haven't gotten there.  I don't know what it is yet.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, here's you with the Glee Club.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, it's that one, Glee Club officers, oh, okay, fine.  If you wanna take it, that's fine, but and there's--look, I can tell you--
Speaker 2: No, this was the one with the stars.  Oh, this is a third one.  So we had three.  We didn't see that, but he took that picture off.  Now, this is Carolyn, Valedictorian, and that's Wanda, all right.  She was the Salutatorian.  So, and this is Glee Club officers and I'm one of them clearly.  Okay, now--
Speaker 1: Is this it?
Speaker 2: Now, this, this picture, do you recall that I talked about scholastic winners, you got it?  Look at that.  Scholastic winners.  Remember, you go to conference--
Speaker 1: Oh, right, right.
Speaker 2: --in scholastics.  So this is a--
Speaker 1: That's a state (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --picture of all of the people who won at one of the levels.  I can't say.  But this is, I'm up there towards the middle right.
