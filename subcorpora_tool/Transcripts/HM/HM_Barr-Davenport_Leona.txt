Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask you what I call People magazine-ish type questions.  What is your favorite food?  What do you like to eat?
Speaker 2: I like breakfast foods, and so I love omelets, bacon which I'm sure I shouldn't have, but those are like, I just love breakfast foods.

I love the islands, so I love cruises that just kind of take you around and you have a chance to sightsee.  So I'll say the islands.  I love the water, even though I can't swim.
Speaker 1: So the Caribbean island?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase?
Speaker 2: I, I do.  When I was, I was an intern at IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] while in college [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina] and there was a quote on the wall there, and it said, "To soar to the height of eagles is to find a place where few go, and only the very best can reach."  And I love that phrase, but I've added to it, "Therefore you should reach for the sky."
Story_ID: 638275
Speaker 1: Let's begin by talking about your family.  Tell me about your father.  Tell me his name and where and when he was born, if you know.
Speaker 2: My father's name is Luther Rufus Barr [Luther Barr].  He was born in Johnsonville, South Carolina, and he was born in 1919.  In fact, November 20th, 1919, and born to a family of sharecroppers, day laborers, and so that's pretty much how he was, the time that he was born.  He had a number of siblings, and right now I'm forgetting how many because there were so many.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he share any stories about his growing up?
Speaker 2: I believe growing up to some degree was, was quite painful.  We understand that in, in when growing up they were here, that his ancestors had come out of Georgia, slaves.  Or his, fore- grandfather had come out of Georgia as slaves.  But in growing up it was really, really tough.  My grandfather [Benjamin Barr, Sr.], his father, was a strict disciplinarian, very strict, but we believe most of the strictness came from lack of knowledge.  You know, not knowing how to love, not knowing how to be the man of the house, for lack of a better term, because they'd been so used to being told what to do, and how to do it.  All--they all worked for, for white people in farming and all of that, but he was raised in a very strict household.
Story_ID: 638276
Speaker 1: His mother [Mabel Barr] died while they were young and he [Barr-Davenport's father, Luther Barr] went off, he joined the Air Force [U.S. Army Air Forces; U.S. Air Force] and so he went into the Air Force and, and we often think that while in the Air Force, we have no proof, but we do believe he may have been used as one of the tests because he left in good shape and came back with a rash that he could never get rid of, never.  And so, you know, he dealt with a lot in his life.
Speaker 2: When you say tests, what tests are you thinking of?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, we think something similar to the Tuskegee test [Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male] that were not approved by the people, they were testing.  Who knows, they may have been using black men at that particular time in the service to test medications and medicine and things of that nature.  And we, we just truly, you know, we have no proof, we have no facts, but it is just interesting because this rash literally covered his entire body.  Everything except for his face, the upper part, but everything else.  He was just, his body just changed totally.  It was as if he had a permanent rash, dry skin.  It was interesting, and if you heard him scratching it would almost sound as if it was corn shucks, and for people who may not know what corn shucks are, that's, you know, the shucks that come off of the corn after they have been grown and they're harvested and as you pull them off, when they dried they have this sound as you're shucking corn.  It's a process but you have to hear it.
Speaker 2: Do you know what year or what time it was or what time period that he went into the service?
Speaker 1: Oh, wow, I believe it was around 1947 [sic.].  I vaguely remember seeing that, somewhere around 1947 that he was in the service.
Speaker 2: What about his education?  How much education did he have?
Speaker 1: He went to the sixth grade and that was as, as far, they could have gone further, you know, if, if he could have gone further in school if they had the money, or if they have had the transportation.  But sixth grade was as, as far as he went.
Story_ID: 638277
Speaker 1: Now talk to me about his parents.  Tell me their names.
Speaker 2: My father's parents were Ben Barr [Benjamin Barr, Sr.] and why am I drawing a blank on my grandmother.  She died, so, Mabel Barr, Ben Barr and Mabel Barr are my grandparents on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Did you know them?
Speaker 2: No, well I, let me back up.  My grandmother was already deceased when I was born, but I vaguely remember my grandfather because he died while I was a small child.
Speaker 1: And you said that your father [Luther Barr] had a number of siblings.  Would it be five or ten--?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was more like fifteen.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of their names?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Just tell me the ones that you remember.
Speaker 2: Right, I remember Ben Barr [Benjamin Barr, Jr.], Thomas Barr, Aunt--that's named Ruth Mae [Ruth Barr] and Daisy Bell (laughter), Daisy Bell Barr [Daisy Barr].  Oh wow, Frank Barr [ph.] and we had uncle that we called Uncle T [ph.], and I don't know why but right now, I'm losing track on his real name, but that was, there were two sets if you will.  He had his complete set of family that was about nine children, and then after his grandmother [sic.] died and his father remarried, then there's another set of about seven.
Speaker 1: Do you know that second wife?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Annie Bell Barr [Annie Barr].
Speaker 1: So, did you know her?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  We attended church.  She was very strict, very bossy and I didn't like her unfortunately.  I should say that because somebody might see this, but she was just very bossy.  Annie Bell Barr.  She believed in children, you know, being active in the church.  She believed in just kind of telling all children what to do and so as a result it was just something about that.  It was the manner of which it was done that just wasn't very comfortable for me.  But, she was a good woman.  She really was a good woman and she raised seven beautiful kids, and, most of whom I think there are three that are deceased, but they are still, you know, my--Doretha Barr is still alive, Helen Barr [ph.], Hazel Barr [ph.], they're still alive.  And Frances Barr.
Speaker 1: And what about her education, or how did she feel about education?
Speaker 2: Miss Annie is what we called her, Miss Annie.  I doubt that Miss Annie went any further than sixth grade also.  Her children, some of her children went on to go to college.  I know the youngest one did, but I don't know that any of the older ones actually went on to school, but you know, in our hometown of Johnsonville, South Carolina, parents encouraged education.  They encouraged education but in some instances there were some parents that actually kept their children out of school too much due to farming, sharecropping, and so as a result many of them may not have been able to graduate or they may not have had a chance to get the education that they truly needed.
Speaker 1: Cam you go any further back in your family tree, great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Do you know their names?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638278
Speaker 1: So let's talk about your mother now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell me her name, where she was born and when she was born.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Mary Leona Barr [Mary Brown Barr].  Well, her maiden name was Mary Leona Brown.  She was born in Johnsonville, South Carolina, February 13th, 1925.  She attended school in the Johnsonville area.  She went as high as eighth grade, and unfortunately, couldn't go any further due to finances and travel.  My mother was, and she actually worked at, at the school after she graduated as a cook.  My grandparents, her parents, Sam Joe Brown [Samuel Brown, Sr.], grandpapa is what we called him.  Grandpapa was born in 1906.  Make sure I don't reverse this.  He was born in 1903, August 12th, 1903.  My grandmother Luella Brown [Luella Rodgers Brown], was born 1903, and in the same area and they actually had eight children total.
Speaker 1: And Luella, do you know her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Rodgers, Luella Rodgers.
Speaker 1: Okay tell me more about your mother.  Did she share any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: She, she did, and they had some hardships of growing up, of course, just, you know, being the time that it was.  My grandmother, Luella Brown, died an early age.  She was only fifty-five.  She had a heart attack, right after coming back from visiting two of her children in Wilmington, Delaware, her son Samuel [Samuel Brown, Jr.] and daughter, Curlie Mae [Curlie Brown], both of them were married, and she came back and one day she just had a heart attack no longer after then.  And with medicine being the way that it is and was, of course, we never knew exactly what caused it, what may have brought about the, the heart attack, but she died at a young age and my mother, to some degree, became the mother of her siblings.  But growing up she was just, I think my mother has always been a strong person.  She said when she was a child that she used to cry about everything.  Everything, she just cried, cried, cried, and then she said she asked God if he would just remove that from her, just that sense of always wanting to cry about everything, and do you know for years, she couldn't cry after that.  For years.  And it became something that she felt I asked for the wrong thing, you know, wanting to cry, having the feeling of needing to cry, but she couldn't, and so that's, that's interesting but, but she said she asked for that and she feels like her prayer was answered and then it became an albatross to some degree.  But they were your normal kids, with nothing, but if you don't know you don't have anything, then it can be a good life, but normal kids, but they farmed for a living, my grandfather actually, he was cutting down a tree and I'm not sure if this was something that needed to be done or rather he was doing it for work.  Well the tree fell the wrong way and it fell on one of his legs and so he became an amputee early in life.  He had what we call a peg leg for years and then he, actually they created a, I guess you call it a prosthesis for him, so that kind of rendered him, he could work, but it wasn't the same kind of work that he would have been able to do but that was just something that he had to deal with as a young father, having to work with one leg, and, and during that period of time, having to do it with the peg leg, and then eventually as time changed, to get what he needed to function a little better.
Story_ID: 638279
Speaker 1: You said there were eight children and you told me two. Do you remember the other six (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneosu) Yes, yes.  I'll start with the boys, Samuel Brown [Samuel Brown, Jr.], he grew up and moved to Winston Salem, North Carolina and he worked there, worked two jobs for years.  He worked for Maurita Bakery [ph.] and for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.  He's deceased.  Raleigh Jefferson Brown [Raleigh Brown], he stayed in Johnsonville, South Carolina, married, had ten children.  He is now deceased.  Gary Brown.  Uncle Gary farmed in South Carolina for years and then made a decision to move to Wilmington, Delaware, and I, I don't remember what year, but I recall two of his children stayed with us in order to finish their graduation for that year, until Raleigh got settled in Delaware.  Uncle Gary is deceased, and Woodrow Brown.  Woodrow was the youngest son, very rambunctious.  He--trouble seem to find him no matter where he was.  If there was a stray knife or a bullet or a gun or a car waiting to be in an accident, somehow he just seemed to be the one, that's unfortunate but it is, and he died about four years ago.  He died about a year before my mother [Mary Brown Barr] did.  So those are the brothers.  Then my mother is the oldest girl.  She passed away on May 2nd, 2007, of congestive heart failure.  Idena McGill.  Idena Brown McGill [ph.].  She passed away probably about five to seven years ago and, of heart failure also.  Aunt Elnora Brown, and I'm trying to think of Aunt Elnora's last name, now it's Lomax, Elnora Brown Lomax.  She lives in Winston Salem, South Carolina--North Carolina; Winston Salem, North Carolina, with her, she has four children there and about three grandchildren.  And then the youngest girl, Sylvia, Sylvia Brown Singletary [ph.], and she lives in Kentucky with her daughter.
Speaker 1: Your [maternal] grandparents [Luella Rodgers Brown and Samuel Brown, Sr.] were also sharecroppers?
Speaker 2: They, they, they were more day laborers.  Then, because of my grandfather's accident, they never were full fledged farmers, so they did more day laboring.
Speaker 1: And where did they live?
Speaker 2: They lived in between Johnsonville, South Carolina and Hemingway, South Carolina.  They're really right, they're five miles apart, and so lived in that particular area for years, and--
Speaker 1: Well, I guess what I wanted to know was whether they owned their own land.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  My grandparents on my maternal nor paternal side [Mabel Barr and Benjamin Barr, Sr.], neither of them owned their own land.
Story_ID: 638280
Speaker 1: Now tell me more about your mother [Mary Brown Barr].  What type of person was she and what kind of relationship did you have personally with her.
Speaker 2: My mother was probably one of the strongest people I've ever met in my life.  Loving in her own way was an overt affection if you would.  Her, she showed her love with the things that she did, always cooking, always making that everybody was fed, even when what was there was little or nothing.  You always had something to eat.  She could take some beans and make you think that there was meat in it.  She was an avid gardener.  She planted a garden every year and just took care, the care that she took care, that she gave to the garden, it was, I mean it was exceptional.  I mean we're talking someone that goes out every day and waters whatever the food is she's growing. Excuse me. She make sure the weeds were gone and she'd make sure that everything was perfect, that it was whatever you needed to spray to keep the bugs away.  And so she just always had a beautiful garden and it wasn't about her just growing food in a patch.  There had to be order about everything.  There had to be straight rows and a certain distance between every plant.  I mean she just had it down to a science, to the extent that people would just marvel at just how perfect she was in, in her delivery, and she took pride in that.  And, and even when it was time for harvest, it wasn't just for us, she gave to everybody in the community and that was what people knew her for.  They knew that if you were hungry, if you stop by, if you said you were hungry, you were going to get something to eat.  She was one of the best biscuit makers in South Carolina, in Johnsonville, South Carolina.  In fact, that's where she, one of the things that was her claim to fame.  Everybody know that if you could get, and my mother's nickname was Titter, T-I-T-T-E-R, and people called her that because she was the oldest so her younger siblings, somebody didn't get sister and so as a result they were saying Titter, and so that's how everyone started calling her that name in life and that went with her to her grave.  In fact, it's on her obituary.  But she was just known for giving.  If you, if one of children or one of her sisters or someone brought someone to our home, if there was not enough food for everybody, then she didn't feed anybody.  But she would make it stretch and so she was known for cooking cakes, pound cakes and raisin cakes and pumpkin pies and she was just an avid cook and loved it.  She loved to see a clean sheets hanging out on the, on the line because we did not have washers and dryers but we had, at one point it was just by hand and when we got to a point where my father [Luther Barr] could purchase a washing machine then we used the washing machine but she loved just making things right and being able to look on a clothes line outside and seeing these perfect white sheets.  Nothing gave her more joy, and then to bring it in and fold it perfectly.  It was not about it just being put together, two people or either she could do it herself.  Two people had to get on either end, fold it perfectly, get it just right and that was the way she was and that was the way she tried to teach us to be decent and in order.  And even if something was about to fall apart, she would sew it together as many times as she possibly could, but she wanted it right, no matter what it was and, and that was just her nature, make it right, make it decent, and she had a saying, "You don't have to look like you don't have anything," and that was something that she just really just carried, you know, pushed to us, through us, and tried to show it in the way she took care of us.
Story_ID: 638281
Speaker 1: What characteristic did you receive from your mother [Mary Brown Barr]?
Speaker 2: Wow.  I hoard a lot because she saw value in everything.  She saw value in almost every and anything, and she could take whatever it was and make it into something.  I can remember as a little girl I had this little nightgown that I wore to bed and I don't know what, it was probably old, but I remember it tearing and it wasn't like a tear straight up and down or anything like that.  It tore at an angle and I just kept wearing that little torn up gown and so one day I went to put it on and my mother had sown it just perfectly together by hand, by hand and that was, that was the kind of person she was.  She didn't talk about anything that she was doing, she just did it because she wanted it to be right.  And she didn't throw it away because she obviously saw value in it.  She saw that I kept wearing it, and so she wanted to make it right.  So I, I think when it comes to seeing value in almost everything and thinking somebody can use this, you know, you don't have to throw it away, and, and then in plenty.  Once she got to a point that she could buy excess.  It was on sale, it was a good deal and if it was something that you're going to continue to buy more of, she'd take advantage of the sale, you know, and that was her thought.  She just loved to hear about discounts that, as adults, as I shopped and my younger sister [Wanda Barr Spencer (ph.)], I think my younger sister and I are the two that are most like her in this respect.  We love a good deal, we love to get bargains, we love to feel like we're taking advantage of, of the opportunities out there, and my mother loved to hear about that.
Story_ID: 638282
Speaker 1: And the same question for your, your dad [Luther Barr].
Speaker 2: For my father, I think what I achieved or gained more from him, I'm, I'm, I'm soft to some degree but I'm very, I'm tough.  I'm tough.  I don't understand the woe is me because I know what they went through and I know what others have gone through in life, and so I want people to toughen up, and, and get a grip and do what you need to do to make it from here to there.  It's not all going to be handed to you but you've got to find a way and make a way.  My father got up early every day.  I never heard him complain about what he had to do on the farm.  He did it and it was just, it was what he was supposed to do, and so that was the kind of person that he was.  He, he was strict.  He was extremely strict.  We didn't have a conversational relationship.  He was very much like, he took on some of the characteristics of his father [Benjamin Barr, Sr.], you know, not knowing how to love, not knowing how to communicate and, and kind of believing that children are children and it's not, at that particular time, and I hope people have changed a great deal, that it's not conversational.  If I tell you what to do, you respond to what I ask you to do and so he was just very strict in his thinking and how he did things.  But I think I developed from him just that toughness and, and it's not something that I'm completely proud of because I know there's sometimes I probably need to be softer, but I know that softness then, is allows other people to take advantage of you so I try not to put on or put out there that part of who I am.
Story_ID: 638283
Speaker 1: Before we move on, you did mention that your mother [Mary Brown Barr] went on to work at the school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Well, it, it would take one of her first cousins, one of my cou- cousins also, to tell you about that.  She was hired at the school to cook and this was one of those one room, one building schools, so it was not anything huge, but she was the cook for the school and so whatever they had as a menu, she cooked that, and, of course, those biscuits, the infamous biscuits were a part of that.  Well afterwards my cousin and some of his friends would go around to this window and they begged my mother for more biscuits after they had had their quota.  So she would hand, she would give them some of the biscuits out of the window, and he said that was just like heaven.  It was just like heaven, and I understand what he means because one of my mother's biscuits, I had some of my mother's biscuits after she passed away, in the freezer and you could heat them up.  It was just like cake, you know cakes you could put, freeze and I would call my siblings and say, I'm eating some of my mother's biscuits.  It was, really I was just bragging, but I held on to some of them for that period of time, but that's what she did.  And she enjoyed it, but unfortunately because my father [Luther Barr] wanted her to work on the farm [in Johnsonville, South Carolina], she had to give that up, so, you know, we regret that for her because she really enjoyed her work and her job.
Speaker 1: Did you ever learn to make the biscuits?
Speaker 2: I didn't.  So that's, there's so many things that you come to regret in life.  I didn't learn how to make the biscuits and I think only one of my sisters really, really tried, you know.  I think we kind of had it in our minds that our mother was going to be around forever.  And that she was always going to make these biscuits and we didn't need to try. And-the, the biscuits have really have traveled all around the country.
Story_ID: 638284
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your childhood.  What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Wow.  I think the thing that I remember most about my childhood was being, not being in school yet and being at home with my mother [Mary Brown Barr].  And she was a bit, she worked all day long.  I mean there was nothing that she needed to drive her.  The only thing that could ever cause my mother to sit down, she was asthmatic, she had asthma, and so when she did get asthma, it really took a toll on her.  I mean there were many times we just thought she wasn't going to make it.  And so I just remember those times because I was the only one there and I think that that's something that's very important to me, just the focus that I received as a child, even though there was really nothing to do and, and no place to go because she was there working all day long and in the wintertime it was really too cold to play outside, so you just waited, I waited until my other siblings came home from school.  And during the summertime, you just played if you were too young to work while everybody else worked in the fields, but my father [Luther Barr] was such a strict believer in responsibility.  As soon you came to a point where you could carry a glass of water, you had a responsibility and that could have been just giving water to the workers or giving water to my siblings when they were in the field, so.
Story_ID: 638285
Speaker 1: Now think about a sound, a sight or a smell that takes you back to that time.
Speaker 2: I, I think one of the things, we lived, we were in Johnsonville, South Carolina, and I don't know what it was about that area, but the sand, there were sand, there was sand in certain areas and it was pure white.  It was pure white, then in other areas there was clay, and then you had the farmland and at most of the farmland the dirt was black.  So it was this combination and I'm not sure how that could be, but it was just this combination and this, this feeling of, of openness and freedom to some degree.  We were in an area where you, the mailman did not come and I don't know if it was just for blacks or not, but the mailman didn't come to every house.  At one point, all of the mail for my parents and my uncle, my mother's brother, Raleigh Jefferson [Raleigh Brown], who lived behind us, all of the mail would be delivered at my father's brother's house.  Uncle Leroy [Leroy Barr], I didn't mention Uncle Leroy, that's another brother--but all the main was delivered to his house and we would have to walk every day to his house and I'm really bad on mileage but I would say it was at least a half a mile, maybe.  We'd have to walk to their house to get the mail.  And you'd walk through, there was a dirt, a sand road for the most part and then it would change different textures of dirt, and you'd walk and you had, in the summertime, you'd have trees on each side and farm, it might have been corn or tobacco, on one side, and it was the sense of openness, I use the word freedom only because it was back then at that particular time, the owners of our land really didn't bother us for a lack of a better term.  They only came around when it was time to harvest and to make the, to get the money.  They allowed my father [Luther Barr] and my uncle to farm the land in the way that they saw fit, so there were not daily in our lives, so it appeared, if you, it seemed like we were on our own land and in our own property.  But being a little scary at that time, you know there'd be something also when you're walking to get the mail and you think, I wonder if anybody is in that cornfield. Or, I wonder if anybody--even though nothing had ever happened, it was still that sense of freedom and love for what you had, but for me there was still that sense of fear, so it, it was interesting, and but nothing ever happened to any of my siblings or my cousins to my knowledge and so I don't even know where that came from, the fear part.
Story_ID: 638286
Speaker 1: So you didn't hear any stories about anything happening to anyone else?
Speaker 2: No, no, really didn't, really didn't and I remember that there was a conversation as I was growing up where other white landowners [in Johnsonville, South Carolina] felt that the owners of the land where we were had given my father [Luther Barr] and my uncle [Leroy Barr] too much freedom.  They felt that they were allowed to do what they wanted to do when they, you know, when they wanted to do it and make their own decisions, where in other instances where there was sharecropper, you know the land owning sharecroppers, the owner of the land was intricately involved in every aspect of what took place on a daily basis, but our landowners were only interested in the harvest.
Speaker 1: And do you think that your parents felt that the landowners were fair because there, there are some horror stories about how people work so hard and ended up with nothing.
Speaker 2: I think overall, the answer is yes.  If you think in terms of the fact that they did have the freedom to do what they wanted to do.  Say for instance with my mother's [Mary Brown Barr] garden, they could probably have come back there and said, you know, "We want half of what's in your garden, or you plant our garden," but they planted their own.  They planted their own and so overall I think it was fair in the sense of, of fairness if you will.  I guess the bad part that you would run into is that there were times when the crops didn't do well, and so when they didn't do well, and you're splitting almost nothing, you know, half and half, and I don't know, in some instances there may have been some farmers who weren't getting half of the, of the, the--
Speaker 1: The harvest.
Speaker 2: --the harvest of the crop.  But, for the most part, we probably had one of the better situations in the community.
Story_ID: 638287
Speaker 1: So you talked about the sight of the sand and the soil [in Johnsonville, South Carolina], what about a smell?  What smell takes you back to that time?
Speaker 2: It was clean, it was, it was clean, it was--the, the, during that time when you, when, if you woke up, I mean the air was fresh.  Everything was, was just good.  One of the things, one smell, my mother [Mary Brown Barr] cooking those biscuits.  You could tell that smell no matter where you were.  And she cooked every day.  I can only recall once or twice growing up in my life when I ever woke up and my mother was not at home, and if she was not at home, that meant she was somewhere taking care of somebody else.  You know one of her sisters might have had a baby or something of that nature, and she would go to help take care of them, but my mother was there all the time, and for the most part, my father [Luther Barr] was there all the time.
Speaker 1: What sounds do you remember?
Speaker 2: The rooster, in the mornings the rooster would crow, and that was indication that everybody that's living needed to get up, at least in my house, so, but that was the sound, that was the sound that you heard (background noise).
Story_ID: 638288
Speaker 1: So now before you go to school [at Stuckey School, Johnsonville, South Carolina], you, you, well you talked about before you went to school and you waited for your siblings to come home, what did, what crops did your, your family grow?
Speaker 2: My father [Luther Barr] grew, I say my father, we grew tobacco, cotton at one point.  We eventually stop growing cotton because cotton didn't do well.  You just, it was just one of those crops you could not control that well, and it was a lot of work for a little money, and so if you did not have a huge crop of cotton, you really were wasting, there was a lot of time for a little return.  Tobacco was the main crop that we made our money off of.  We had wheat and so those were the three areas.  At one point, cucumbers, and so you'd harvest the cucumbers, take them to the market and so those were the, the main, four main areas.
Story_ID: 638289
Speaker 1: You talked a little bit about the area in which you lived [Johnsonville, South Carolina], so it seems that each farm was a little ways away.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you have an opportunity to play with other children at that time?
Speaker 2: The children that I played with most often were my cousins, who lived behind us, and that was about a quarter, maybe a quarter of a mile walk.  And we farmed together, while we had separate crops, we helped each other on the farm, and but we played with them.  My uncle, my mother's brother, and his family lived behind us, and that was Raleigh Jefferson Brown [Raleigh Brown], and he had ten children and so we played with them more often, or most often than anyone else.  I had some cousins that lived a little further away and that was probably walk to go visit them and typically if any visiting was being done, it would be on Sunday afternoon.  And then my father's brother [Leroy Barr], the one we had to go and get the mail from, that was about an eighth of a mile, maybe, between an eighth and a fourth of a mile we'd walk there, and so he had, it was a granddaughter that we played with, but we didn't, we played with each other, you know.  We entertained ourselves and so it wasn't a daily (laughter) ha, ha, ha, because you had work to do, especially in the spring and in the summer, so, and in the summer, of course, you were around people all the time because the way we, we harvested the tobacco in particular, is that you would help each other.  At one point it was a sense of just helping each other to harvest the crops and you'd have a certain day.  Say on Monday, my cousin might be harvesting his crops so everybody went and helped him.  On Tuesday, same thing, and everybody had a day.  And then it got to a point, and, and we always thought this was unfair, this is my siblings and I.  We thought this was unfair because there were, I have, my mother [Mary Brown Barr] and father [Luther Barr] had ten children, two of them were twins and they were stillborn and they were, they were born in 1961.  And then I had a sister, a fifth, yeah, she was, she was third, let me think (unclear).  My older sisters are Ella [Ella Barr (ph.)], Rose [Rose Barr (ph.)], Delores [Delores Barr (ph.)] and then Elvora [Elvora Barr (ph.)].  Elvora was the fourth child.  She lived for five days.  She had a birth defect and, of course, during that time, a birth defect was sure death, and but I was raised with my other siblings.  And so we were older and so we would help everybody.  My father would take all of us and we would help harvest the crop, and at one point, my uncle who lived behind us, his children were smaller, and so all of them could not help, but it became interesting to us is that once we started to grow up and move away, then suddenly everybody says, well, we don't really wanna, you know, just help each other anymore.  We want, we should pay each other for the work.  And so then it became an hourly wage or a day wage for each person that each family brought, and it just suddenly seemed, oh, wow, you know, we were on the giving end and everybody loved it, and now that my father and my mother are down to your two children, then suddenly well, hm, I don't know, 'cause now we got eight people back here even though you had eight before, it's kind of different now.  But that was always something that we thought was interesting and unfair, but people were people and it's, it's enterprise is enterprise I guess, so.
Story_ID: 638290
Speaker 1: You talked about harvesting tobacco [in Johnsonville, South Carolina], I mean what was that like?  I mean tell me, describe to me about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It, it's, it's very interesting and I always tell people you had to be there, but the, the, the way it worked is that and I'll get you to, you planted the crop and then, of course, you had to keep the weeds out and all of that, but when it was time to harvest and typically it started around July, the men would go into, and the rows were perfect, they had to be perfect because the mule and the drag, and the drag is this rectangular kind of contraption that was built that sat about four feet off of the ground, and so as they cropped the leaves that were wiped, and you cropped from the bottom, you would, and the guys as they cropped, they would have to put them under their arm, the leaves under their arm and once they couldn't carry any more, then they would put them in the drag.  And so, and they laid them, you didn't dump it because it was a process, so that the driver of the drag would bring the tobacco to the barn.  At the barn there were these things that we called horses, but they really weren't horses.  It was a contraption that was built where the stick would sit on top and you would string the stick and so you start the stick, you tie the knot at the beginning and you would string, you'd have people that were called handers and they were really handlers I guess.  They would actually give you two to three leaves of tobacco.  You would string it to the right, string it to the left, so you might have one or two people on each side and this one person that was a stringer and you would string it, and then when you got to the end of the stick, you'd tie it, you would take it into the barn.  There were two people typically in the barn that would then take those sticks and hang them.  And the barn was about, I guess one or two stories if you will, because there were different levels in the barn where you hang the sticks.  Initially you would just hang them on the bottom and then the guys that were inside the barn would then climb up, straddle those, the length of the sticks and they would hang it all the way up to the top, and then once they hung all of the tobacco, the barn was full, then they would cure it and there was a process for curing it over a course of two to three days and so they would cure it until it was the dry tobacco that, that you, if you've ever seen that, you'd have to see it, but it was dry tobacco, and then you would unload the barn, you would take it to the pack house.  The pack house was where you sat and then you would separate the leaves based upon the quality.  There was a different quality that you put together and you would separate it, and so the better quality, that typically sold better because if it, if it was cured too much, you got very little money for it, but the tobacco company could use it in some form.  But it was different levels so once you get all of that ready and then you took it to, to sell it.  So it was a very intense process if you think all manual, with the horses, not horses, the mules.  Let me be very clear, the mules and the drag process and just everything that went into it.  Now one of the things about the tobacco that was really disgusting for, for me in particular, even though you would fertilize it and do what you needed to do to get rid of the insects, there were these big green worms that would grow on it, and it was just a disgusting, I cannot describe, but the thing that was funny about it, is that the boys knew how much the girls really didn't like it and they would try put, put a worm on you, or do, because they would grow larger than a thumb, and it was just, it was just, it's one of those things that you really can't describe, but that was one of the worst aspects of that entire process is the fact that no matter how much they did you could not control that.  You know you could control it to some degree because they could actually destroy the crop if you didn't continue, because there's a process also where you would go into the tobacco field while it's still green and remove those worms from the product so that, it was just an interesting, overall an interesting process and it was, you know, very pointed.  In fact one of the stories my sister just told me the other night, I think I'd heard but I'd forgotten.  My father's youngest brother on the second side of the family, one of his siblings, he was wild, his name was Albert May [Albert Barr (ph.)] and they said Albert, if his father [Benjamin Barr, Sr.] told him go left, Albert went right.  It just didn't matter.  And his father would tell him don't, "Don't wear those mules out," and Albert May would literally get upon these, this drag, I don't know if he was looking at television or what, but he would straddle the drag and just start driving the mules like a wild man, so here he is in the farm area driving these mules as if he was in some kind of race, and they said that was just, he was just, he was a death, what do you call 'em, you call 'em death defying person, and so he was interesting.  I never got to know him, never got to know him.  Once he left home he never came back.
Story_ID: 638291
Speaker 1: The house that you lived in [in Johnsonville, South Carolina], did it have running water?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no.  We, well we had running water to some degree.  I'll tell you how our running water was.  A pump had been installed on the porch, and it was, the pump was on the porch and they had built a shelf around the pump, and so you could put a basin there, pump water, go into the kitchen, where most people's water was out in the yard at a well or something of that nature.  And we had one out in the yard also, but we had moved up to the point that ours was on the porch, so, but no running water.  We did not have a bathroom growing up, we had a toilet, very well made toilet, outhouse if you will that was outside compared to some people.  But it was, yeah, it was, that's what we knew, you know.  We had buckets in the rooms for, you know, going to the bathroom at night, but during the day, spring, summer, winter, fall, you used the toilet.  And, so that's what we grew up with, and when I left to go to college [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina] in 1975, we still did not have a bathroom.  It wasn't until my sister and my brother, my oldest sister [Ella Barr (ph.)] is an educator.  She went to college and received her master's in special education at Winthrop College [Winthrop University, Rock Hill, South Carolina], and then my brother [Alfred Barr] went off to [U.S. military] service, that they decided to pool their money together to build a house for us, and so I remember coming home from college one of the weekends to help move, and so we moved into a house with running water in the mid-'70s [1970s].
Story_ID: 638292
Speaker 1: You were born in Hemingway [South Carolina].  You told me that Hemingway and Johnsonville [South Carolina] are very close together (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: You were born in Hemingway.  How old were you when you moved to this property in Johnsonville?
Speaker 2: I think, from what I can recall, I think I was two or three, because I was, and, and we must have been there just temporarily because I was the only one born in Hemingway, and I'm the seventh child born.  So I'm not sure, I'd have to find out now why we were even there temporarily, but I was the only one born there and I was the only one that was not birthed, or not delivered by my aunt.  My aunt, oh, what is her real name?  We used to call her, Aunt Mamma, Cousin Mamma, Cousin Mama, but she was a woman that was ahead of her time. Because she was the person in the community that helped people to get services and she was a midwife and she delivered all of my siblings except for me.  In fact her daughter is Sylvia Woods, and we're related.  Sylvia Woods that owns Sylvia's in New York [Sylvia's Restaurant, New York, New York], but she was not there for my birth because she had gone to New York.  Sylvia was having a baby and so she was not there for that but my aunt, my great aunt, my grandfather's sister, Aunt Les [ph.] delivered me, but I'm not sure of why I was the only one raised in Hemingway because everyone else was born in Johnsonville.
Story_ID: 638293
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about your oth-, your siblings.  You mentioned some of 'em, but give me their names again--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in order where you fit in--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and just a little spiel about, you know, what they do (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, sure. My oldest sister, Ella Mae Barr [Ella Barr (ph.)], she's sixty-two now and she lives in Johnsonville, South Carolina.  She's a retired educator, and she was the first on my grandfather's, of my grandfather's grandchildren, to go to college and there were forty-four of us.  She was the oldest and the first.  And she went to Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina.  My second sister, Rose Nell Barr [Rose Barr (ph.)].  Rose lives in Wilmington, Delaware.  She actually received her training from OIC, Opportunities Industrialization Center [Opportunities Industrialization Centers].  I think that was started in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and the, the gentlemen that founded it, I can see his face but I can't call his name right now, but she went to that school to get training in secretarial science.  My third oldest sister, Delores Barr [ph.].  Delores lives in Wilmington, Delaware right now and she went to the Job Corps in Iowa and she, at that time got a degree in, in computer science, you know, learning how to write programs in DOS [disk operating system] and she made that decision because they asked her what she wanted to study and she said, "Which of these pays the most money?" And they told her the computer science.  She said, "Well that's what I'm going to do".  Elvora [Elvora Barr (ph.)], I mentioned that she passed away after five days.  And then my next sister, Alean Barr [Alean Barr Scott].  Alean is married.  She lives in Columbia, South Carolina with her husband Van [Vanderbilt Scott].  They have two daughters, Vanice Scott [ph.] and Valicia Scott [ph.].  And both of those, they're adults now.  Valicia is working on her Ph.D. at Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  Vanice Scott is an education in Columbia, South Carolina, and Vanice has a son Javon [Javon Scott (ph.)].  And then going back to my siblings, my brother was next.  He is the only boy that lived, Alfred O'Farrell Lee Barr [Alfred Barr].  Alfred is a retired master sergeant from the [U.S.] Air Force and he lives in Johnsonville, South Carolina, and he and my older sister were the ones that pooled their resources to, to build a house.  And the house is still there.  They live there now still.  Then I'm next.  I am the seventh born, and I live here in Atlanta, Georgia, well in Sharpsburg, Georgia, but in metro Atlanta, with my husband Jewel [Jewel Davenport].  My, the twins that were stillborn were born in 1961 so I was, I was born in '57 [1957], so, what's that, I was four years old when they passed away, when they were still born.  Then my younger sister, Wanda Barr [Wanda Barr Spencer (ph.)], lives in Columbia, South Carolina, and she has a son, Carson Alexander Spencer [ph.].
Story_ID: 638294
Speaker 1: And when I think in terms of all of them, I shared a little about my older sister [Ella Barr (ph.)] and her being the first to go to college, and she often talks about how difficult that was to go to school.  She was destined, she had to go to school because she had a rash, she ended up with psoriasis and psoriasis to the point that she could not work really in the fields without having an outbreak, and then my father [Luther Barr], because he felt that you needed to work if you were there, he bought rubber gloves for her to work in and for anyone who knows anything about psoriasis, all that does is just irritates it even more, and so she spent a lot of her time broken out and just really living in pain for the most part.  And so my mother [Mary Brown Barr] said to her, "You better go to school, you see that this is not something that you can do," and so she set her mind in going off to college and that's what she did, but she talked about the times when she had no money and she just barely had soap because you had to bring all of your toiletries and all of that, but even through all of that, you know, she survived, and even went on after graduation from Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina, to Winthrop College [Winthrop University, Rock Hill, South Carolina] where she received her master's in special education.  My, I told you about my second oldest, Rose [Rose Barr (ph.)], who went to OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers].  Delores [Delores Barr (ph.)] who was educated in Job Corps.  Alean [Alean Barr Scott] who was the fifth sister, actually made the highest on the NTE [National Teacher Examination; Praxis Series], prior to going into school at Allen University.  She did get her degree in education, but she ended up working for Southern Bell [Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company], BellSouth [BellSouth Corporation; AT&T, Inc.], during that time and retiring from that and she's now in her second career, doing taxes.  She works in taxes in Columbia, South Carolina.  My brother [Alfred Barr], as I said, was in the [U.S.] Air Force.  And my youngest sister [Wanda Barr Spencer (ph.)] works with international students.  She went on to get her master's degree in Columbia, South Carolina, but she processes the international students for the University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina].  One story about my sister and I is that I was working on my master's here, she started first in Columbia.  She went to Wesleyan college [Southern Wesleyan University, Central, South Carolina] and I went to Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].  I received a full scholarship from Clark Atlanta University for their weekend working professionals program, and that was the first, I was the first to receive this scholarship and this was for nonprofit leaders in the city.  And, and the great part about it is that I ended up with that degree, that scholarship because the then dean talked about the program coming and I said, "Do you have any money for a starving nonprofit executive director?" And he said, "Oh, I don't know," but about two years later they called me and offered that degree to me, that scholarship to me.
Story_ID: 638295
Speaker 1: So tell me about elementary school.
Speaker 2: I attended Stuckey elementary school [Stuckey School] in Johnsonville, South Carolina.  And it was during my elementary, I think, between, I believe I was in fourth grade, that we became integrated and so Stuckey was prior to that, I'll mention the fact that Stuckey was a black school where all of the black students attended, and we would get all of the books that were passed down from Johnsonville [Johnsonville Elementary School, Johnsonville, South Carolina], which is where the white kids attended, so when their books became ragged, then we would get the books from that school.  Then they decided to integrate and when we integrated, it was just almost, it was, it was devastating while it was supposed to be good, you know, for everyone concerned, there was still two factions, you know, two classes, two sets of people on, on the campus, and the high school [Johnsonville High School, Johnsonville, South Carolina] was one place and then the elementary and the middle school was, was at the same place, and it was difficult because there was a lot of fighting that took place, you know, the white students in particular.  Just wasn't something, and I don't know what it was what they thought.  I think most of when we don't like something and we have an aversion towards it or we fear something, I think it comes from our parents.  It comes from adults that are passing, they are passing down information that just isn't correct, and so in their minds, they were better than us, and, and so they did everything to keep us separated and I remember when we started riding the bus, the white students didn't want us to sit by them on the bus, and they did something that we never did when we were riding the bus.  If I walked on the bus and there was a seat, this is when we were all black and going to school together, if there was a seat, you walked up to the seat or the person and they slid over or they turned around, they let you in.  Well, when we became integrated and the white students were doing this to each other, and I'm not sure what the rationale was, but they would have to ask each other, "Can I sit down?"  We weren't use to that.  "Yes, I can sit down.  There is a seat," and so then the white and if the person told them no, they'd go find another seat.  Well, we couldn't handle that.  I know I couldn't.  And so there was a time I got on the bus, the bus is full pretty much and there was this girl by the name of Pam Coker [ph.] and I walked up, you know, and she just looked down, she wouldn't even look at me.  I said, "I wanna sit down," and she wouldn't move and so I put my books across her on the seat.  She knocks my books on the floor.  Oh hell, I mean really basically, that's not a word I would have ever used, you know, my mother [Mary Brown Barr] would have never heard me say that.  So I tried to push, and I told her to pick 'em up, she wouldn't, so I try to push my way into the seat and she wouldn't let me in so here comes this big white guy and he's trying to, he's hitting me and so then my brother [Alfred Barr] starts hitting him and all this commotion over a seat.  So when I got to school, all of us had to go to the principal's office, and, and Mr. Lohr was wonderful.  He was the principal, Tom Lohr [Thomas Lohr].  I wish I could find him now if he's still alive, but he really understood the significance of relationships and he knew how to treat people.  And so I went to the office.  He said, "Well, Leona [HistoryMaker Leona Barr-Davenport] what happened?"  And I told him.  And he said, "Well Leona, you know, you're one of our leaders here at the school and, you know, I just don't want to see you getting into fights and things of that nature," and I said, "But Dr., Mr. Lohr, it wasn't right."  He said, "I know it isn't right, but you've got to understand where we are."  And so in his own way he was telling me, I understand what you're dealing with, but you've got to also know what you're dealing with in the community.  And I told him, I couldn't, I couldn't handle it any other way.  And he said, he told me, "The only reason I have you in here is that I needed to bring you in," he said, "because you really haven't done anything wrong," and he communicated that to me, but it was just one of those things where we constantly just had to fight for basic privileges, you know, to have a seat, you know, because there were some people who were told that they couldn't sit down and they would stand up all the way to school.  And this was white or black people that one of their peers would say, "No, you can't sit down."  Well, I couldn't, I couldn't handle that.  And neither could my siblings.  So that was something that really was a difficult thing for me in that integration process, but you continue to see some of that in its own way as we went on through school.
Story_ID: 638296
Speaker 1: Because when I ran for student government president--
Speaker 2: What grade was this?
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm all, I'm all the way in high school (laughter).  Now, well let's go from Stuckey [Stuckey School, Johnsonville, South Carolina] to, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) yes.
Speaker 1: Stuckey was--
Speaker 2: Did you start school when you were five?
Speaker 1: Yes, I started before I should have and I'll tell you something that was interesting.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My mother [Mary Brown Barr] sent me on to school even though I was not supposed to go because I wasn't six.  How was it?  Somehow I was five, my birthday was not going to be until November 30th, so I was gonna be six until November 30th of that year and so I really shouldn't have gone to school.  My mother sent me anyway.  And so I remember the principal, who was a very tall man, Mr. Bradley [Lamar D. Bradley], and I can't think of Mr. Bradley's first name.  He came to the class and he knew that I wasn't old enough and he said to Miss Eaddy [Lucille Eaddy] and I can't think of Miss Eaddy's first name right now.  But Miss Eaddy had taught everybody first grade it seemed like.  You know how adults will talk as if they think children can't comprehend, so he told Miss Eaddy, he asked where I was and she pointed me out, and he says, "If she doesn't learn like the rest of the kids at the same pace, don't waste any time on her."  And I remember hearing that.  Well I left half those kids that were supposed to be in there in the first grade, I went on to the second grade because my, my parents were sticklers about learning how to read, so somehow, and I don't even remember the process, but you know you had to study, you had to read, and so they were like, "Get an education, get an education."  And so, but I remember hearing that in particular and another instance, I think a teacher sent me to the office one day and I walked in and they had the high school students in there working in the office and I remember one of my sisters' classmates being in there, and I walked in and I spoke and they kept talking.  They didn't give me any attention and I remember, no, no, I hadn't spoken yet.  I walked in and they kept talking to each other and then I heard one of the students say, "Let's see if she has sense enough to speak."  And I thought, and I try not to do that to children now because people like to, at that one point, act as if students, as if kids couldn't hear, and couldn't comprehend, and so I walked in and I said, "Good morning, Miss So and So sent me here to ask for whatever," and, but it was just that sense of them ignoring me because they felt that they didn't have to give me any attention, but I remember that in elementary school vividly for whatever reason.  Middle school, I, I just recall thinking, being, it was a sad time to some degree.  We, there were some people that were better off than we were and so they could go to the dining hall and eat lunch and things of that nature, and we had to bring, if we were going to eat anything, bring something, and so we'd bring lunch, and on some days we didn't have anything, so, and if I had a nickel, the teacher would make me spend three cents on a box of milk and get two cookies, where if I had had my choice, I would have had five cookies.  But that's, but she was just trying knowing that some students were just not at the same level as others where you could go to the dining hall and eat, but just trying to make sure that there was something healthy about what you were eating.
Speaker 2: In either elementary school or middle school, were all your teachers white?
Speaker 1: No, no, the--in elementary school they were all black.  It wasn't until we went to middle school that we started getting some white teachers and then in high school the majority of them were white.
Speaker 2: So the principal at Stuckey was white?
Speaker 1: No, the principal at Stuckey, Mr. Bradley, was black.  That was elementary school and middle school, and then when we went to high school, the principal was white.
Speaker 2: And in the classrooms, I mean the classrooms were, I mean, integrated, they were white students in the classroom?
Speaker 1: Once they, right, once we integrated, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was in middle school.  It didn't happen in elementary school.
Speaker 2: So white kids came to Stuckey which was an all-black school at one time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, um-hm.
Speaker 2: And then black students went to Johnsonville [Johnsonville High School, Johnsonville, South Carolina] as well?
Speaker 1: Yes,
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 638297
Speaker 1: Was there a teacher in elementary school [Stuckey School, Johnsonville, South Carolina], or middle school, who was encouraging or inspirational or just someone that gave you--
Speaker 2: Right, a couple of things that, that stand out for me.  There was a husband and wife team, Coach Sparrow, Henry Sparrow I think was his name, and his wife Sandy [ph.].  No, that wasn't his wife.  His wife, I can't remember her name right now, but she was the home economics teacher. But they really took a liking to me, to the extent that Coach Sparrow asked, I think he asked me.  I'm pretty sure he did because I don't think I would have asked to be the manager of the basketball team.  He coached the middle school basketball team, middle school and eventually high school, and manager just meant that you were there to take care of the needs of the players and, and things of that nature.  Well I decided that I was going to take it to another level, you know where managers in the past would always dress down, wear jeans, this, that and the other.  Well I dressed like the coach, and so I was in home economics and so his wife was teaching us how to sew, so I made myself these, what I thought at that time was just these great jackets and so I would dress up and so when the coach walked out, I walked out with him and, you know, I just created another attitude for the role.  And I remember getting a lot of comments on that because, you know, I think life is about what you display in many instances, so I played it up, and, but his wife was just, she was a good teacher and I learned how to sew under her.  There was another teacher named Sandy Smith [ph.].  She was a English teacher and she was really encouraging in my writing because I'm a, I'm a fairly good writer and so she was very encouraging, she loved my storytelling and was just always very, you could tell, I don't think she was from the South, I think she was from the North, but she had a different way of thinking and doing, encouraging creativity and thinking and she stands out in my mind quite a bit because she was exceptional.  There was another teacher that stood out, not so much that I think, it wasn't that she was encouraging, it was what she did.  I had, a, a problem with procrastination and so if I had homework, sometimes I would wait until the absolute last minute to do it.  It was because I could, I knew I could, and I wrote this essay she asked me to write or everybody to write and she gave me a A minus on it, and so I asked her and I looked at it and there was, I think there was a comma that was missing or something.  And so I asked her, I said, "Why did I get an A minus on this?"  She said, "Because it wasn't your best work."  I didn't argue because I knew it wasn't, I knew I had just written it the night before.  I knew that I waited until the last minute and I know and I knew what I could deliver, and that was something to call me to task, you know, that sometimes you can't complain about what you get when you know delivering your best and so that really stuck with me.  But her name was Louise Eaddy [sic. Lucille Eaddy], and she's still in Johnsonville, South Carolina now, interestingly, she married one of my classmates (laughter). So that happened while, they got together while he was working at the editor of the yearbook and she was over the yearbook.  And I remember our having a conversation, my classmate and I, why he wasn't going to the prom and he said, "Well Leona [HistoryMaker Leona Barr-Davenport], it's just too complicated."  I said, "Well what could be complicated about going to the prom?"  He said, "Well, you wouldn't, really wouldn't understand."  So, of course, it wasn't until we graduated and the two of them got married, oh, okay.  But, anyway that was an interesting situation in, in my high school life [at Johnsonville High School, Johnsonville, South Carolina].

Speaker 1: You talked about some of the things that you did during so, okay, Stuckey [Stuckey School, Johnsonville, South Carolina] was still the name of the middle school (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They eventually changed it. Okay.
Speaker 1: They eventually, but it wasn't immediate.
Speaker 2: Well while you were there, it was still Stuckey?
Speaker 1: Right, Stuckey.
Speaker 2: And what is the name of the high school?
Speaker 1: Johnsonville High School [Johnsonville, South Carolina].
Speaker 2: Okay, so you went to Johnsonville?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Tell me more about your extracurricular activities.
Speaker 1: I was quite involved, teachers, you know, because of my training, just at home, and enjoying anything that wasn't farm related.  I didn't like the farm at all.  And so I just really got involved in everything at school.  You know I was one of those students, unless I was totally, if I was bedridden and I didn't go to school, but otherwise, I went to school every day because I did not want to, my father [Luther Barr] to have access to me during the day because if you were home and if you weren't literally in the bed sick, you were going to have to do something.  So we didn't play that, we went to school because we wanted to go to school.  And periodically, he would keep us out of school to work.  So as a result, all of us loved school, went to school on a daily basis, but I loved the drama, I was in the drama class and teachers would look to us to do different things.  At one point we made a float for a parade, for a Christmas parade, and we were just leaders in different areas and different programs on, on the school campus.  I just enjoyed being involved.  And the principal would always choose me to, to be involved in some particular area, and I was responsible and I think I was, I've always been an old soul and people saw that, and, and, responsible and I cared about, you know, in going back to my mother [Mary Brown Barr] and how she wanted you to always care about how you look, what you delivered, what people saw when they saw you and how you treated people.  And so I tried to carry that into my day to day and people saw that we were always engaged, but the drama club just really stands out for me because we pretty much ran, I'll say I ran that (laughter), the drama club.  And we did great things.  In fact, the teacher, Esther Cooper [ph.], is still alive and she lives in Kingstree, South Carolina now, but she was over the drama club, and we were very engaged in that and that's one thing that stood out, and just in different, different areas.
Story_ID: 638299
Speaker 1: What about student government?  Were you involved in that at all?
Speaker 2: In yes, student government, I was, and I'm trying to remember if I held any offices before I ran for student government president.  I'm not sure, I can't remember right now, but I decided to run for student government president and there were two other white boys who ran, and one was Gene Beckman [ph.], and I don't remember the other person's name.  No, it was just Gene Beckman and me, there wasn't another person.  Well, for whatever reason, the principal thought or decided, I don't know how the vote turned out because the principal decided that he didn't want to have one or the other, so they made us co-presidents of student government association.  So I always thought that was interesting.
Speaker 1: Was this in high school?
Speaker 2: High school.
Speaker 1: And who was the principal?
Speaker 2: Mr. Graham [Charles Graham], and I can't think of Mr. Graham's last name.  In fact, I think he is still in Johnsonville [South Carolina] now.  My sister, my oldest sister [Ella Barr (ph.)] still communicates because she ended up teaching at Johnsonville High School [Johnsonville, South Carolina], but Mr. Graham was the principal when they decided that we would be co-presidents of the student government association.
Speaker 1: How did that work out for you?
Speaker 2: It worked out fine.  I think we were, I'm sure there was some underlying, there were some meetings after the meeting or meeting before the meeting, but I think that was on both sides (laughter), you're always strategizing to try to get your way if you will, but it worked out.  I don't remember anything in particular that stands out that didn't work.  In fact, it's very interesting, about a year ago I signed up on Facebook I think it was, or Myspace, I think it was Facebook and I received an email from Gene Beckman, or he said, "Oh my god, is this Leona Barr [HistoryMaker Leona Barr-Davenport] from Johnsonville, South Carolina?" And I sent him a note back to say, "Yes, it is."  And so it must have been a pretty decent, you know that he saw my name and he reached out and he connected and we're going to have a class reunion for the first, well this will be the first time I will be able to attend, in early next year, so, but yeah that worked out.

Speaker 1: Now during these years in elementary [Stuckey School, Johnsonville, South Carolina], junior high school, civil rights, you, we talked about desegregation in the schools, but what else was going on in your community?  Was your family involved?
Speaker 2: We were not, excuse me, directly, I think because of where we lived and the lack of transportation.  The things that I remember is that my parents [Mary Brown Barr and Luther Barr] being vigilant, my parents and my uncles being vigilant in voting.  And making sure that they took advantage of the opportunity of the people having died for the opportunity to vote.  We did not have, you know, we listened to the radio for years.  I believe we were, we didn't have a television when John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] died.  We did have one when Robert [Robert F. Kennedy] because I could vividly remember seeing that sight repeatedly of Rosey Grier and all of the, all of the melee that took place when somebody said something, said he has a gun and this, that and the other and, and all that went on with that, but we, John Kennedy, that was on the radio and so most of what we heard was by way of radio or you received it from church, you know, in notices that went to churches.  But the thing that really stands out to me when I think about civil rights is that I remember the, these must have been the primaries because it was during the summer.  My parents would come home from the field and they would wash up and put on clean clothes to go vote.  Now the whites didn't do that, but I think my parents considered it such an honor and they did not want to hear any negativity from the whites that were managing the polls, and they took pride in it and whoever had the car, and you know, because we didn't always have a car, where it was my uncle or my father's brother [Leroy Barr], my mother's brother [Raleigh Brown], or my father that had the car, everybody that could fit in that car, they would load up and they'd go vote no matter how long it took.  And that sticks with me because of some of the lax attitude that we have today with people who do not vote when you think in terms of people having died for that, so.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the first time that you voted?
Speaker 2: Yes, actually it was here, no it wasn't here.  It had to be in Columbia [South Carolina].  I voted absentee in Columbia.  I'm trying to think, who was the first person I voted for, which president? I'm trying to think.  And I'm drawing a blank on that.  But I just remember that pride and having said, "This is who I chose."  Because of that thought, that memory of my parents, but I became more engaged.  I moved to Atlanta [Georgia] in '79 [1979], immediately after graduating from Benedict College [Columbia, South Carolina] and when I moved here and I began to see the Andy Youngs [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] and the Maynard Jacksons and Julian Bonds [HistoryMaker Julian Bond] and people who were just people, but what was different about them was that they woke up every day with a different drive, a different vision, a different attitude about what they had to do to make a difference, and I, UI think some of that eventually, after I spent about two to three years having a good time, I think I really realized, okay, this is significant, this is significant, and you can do as little or as much as you wanna do.  And it's left up to you, you have to be the one to satisfy, be satisfied with what you deliver to the marketplace, so.
Story_ID: 638301
Speaker 1: Before we go on to, to college [Benedict College, Benedict, South Carolina] and end your high school years [at Johnsonville High School, Johnsonville, South Carolina], let's talk a little bit about religion in your home and how it affected you growing up.
Speaker 2: I'm gonna start out by saying I didn't officially join a church until I went to college.  So I, the first church I joined was Bible Way Church [Bible Way Church of Atlas Road] in Columbia, South Carolina, but we were required to go to church growing up.  I mean every Sunday for the most part, you are required to go to church.  Everybody in the house.  And so we did, we, you know, we went, rather we were riding or walking and so if we were walking, it was a good mile or more, and there were times my father [Luther Barr] did have a car and there were times we didn't, but you had to go.  Every now and then you got an okay not to go and that would be, say my mother [Mary Brown Barr] was sick with asthma like that, or somebody was sick, but that was the only time you didn't go to church and you went to Sunday school, and I think back on Sunday school now and it really, you know, older deacons, you know, teaching Sunday school.  I don't know, you know, how much of what they were teaching was made more than what they remembered, you know.  We had Sunday school books we read, but it was good for just developing repetitiveness and the action of going to Sunday school, so I do, I remember that.  My [paternal] grandfather used to ring the bell, Grandpapa Ben, Ben Barr [Benjamin Barr, Sr.].  He used to ring the bell for the church and so on Sunday mornings he'd get up religiously and he'd go to church and he'd start ringing the bell and people for miles around could hear that bell, and they knew that it was time.  This was St. James Baptist Church in Johnsonville, South Carolina, and when they heard that bell ringing they knew that it was time to go to church.  And he was the church, I think they call it section [sic. sexton] or something, but I don't know what that, I think it's S-E-C-C-T-I-O-N [sic.].  I think it meant a lot of things but one of the things he was responsible for was ringing that bell and making sure that the boys went into church.  They'd try to hide, they'd try to do some of everything not to go to church, but he walked those church grounds and he made sure that they went in and they were just, they would be angry, but he said, "Boys you got to go in the church," you know, and he was tall, he was a tall stately man, very dark, very, you know, demanding in his demeanor, you know, country man, and he would just make them go in the church every Sunday, and that's probably why my step-grandmother, Annie Bell Barr [Annie Barr] took on her role of being so matter of fact and directional in church because of his role as the church section, but we, we went and they had little programs and different things that they wanted us to be engaged in, and the choirs, and--
Story_ID: 638302
Speaker 1: My father [Luther Barr] was a quartet singer and he sang quartet all of his life up until he couldn't anymore.  He developed prostate cancer near the end of his life and that's really what, what he passed away from.  But they sang, they went around South Carolina as far as they could, as they could afford, singing quartet, and they were good, you know, different names, the Southern Four, the Johnsonville All Stars and, in fact, I have a picture of them as they were going around singing and that group picture that they take.  But he loved it, and his love for singing actually rubbed off on almost all of us because my, my second--two older sisters [Ella Barr (ph.) and Rose Barr (ph.)], the two that lived in Wilmington, Delaware, they actually sing gospel music there in Delaware together.  And all of us are very engaged in choirs, well all except for my older sister and my brother [Alfred Barr], but we loved to sing and even has gone on to the grandchildren.  Carson [Carson Spencer (ph.)] is an avid singer.  He loves to sing.  But church was just, it was a ritual.  It was what you did and you have to do.  And I remember years, I must have been in middle school or high school and I remember one Sunday when they were inviting people to join, I'll back up, after my [paternal] grandfather died, Grandpapa Ben [Benjamin Barr, Sr.], then that role, my father took over that role and, and he would, he became the church section [sic. sexton] and he'd walk, drive, whatever was the situation at that time.  He'd go to church every Sunday, left religiously.  I can't remember if he taught Sunday School or not, but I remember him always having a Sunday school book and he would go every Sunday, he'd leave before we would and go and was very involved in everything that was going on, so one Sunday they asked people to come up and join the church, and my father went to the front of the church.  I was shocked because all of these years I just assumed, based upon his actions that he was already a member, and he wasn't.  He was serving in every capacity in the church and so, it was just interesting for me to see that.  I was just shocked.  And then, wasn't long after then, my mother [Mary Brown Barr] joined, but she had had a church.  She was a member of Beulah Baptist church, which is on Cowhead Road in Johnsonville, South Carolina, and she'd been a member when she married my father and she just never moved her membership.  And so she joined St. James Baptist Church [Johnsonville, South Carolina], but it was just so interesting that their commitment was so strong to that church and that entire piece of our going to church and being involved when we learned that, or I learned that, that they were not members there.  It was just amazing.
Story_ID: 638303
Speaker 1: So now your last year of high school [Johnsonville High School, Johnsonville, South Carolina] and how did you decide where you would go to college, and who helped you?
Speaker 2: In high school, there were two tracks.  There was a college track, then there was a, what did they call it, it was manpower, or something of that nature.  And there was a guidance counselor named Sarah Eaddy [ph.], older white woman that believed in being fair and she brought me into her office and she said you know, "They want me to put all the colored people on this manpower track," she said, "but I'm not going to put you in there," she said, "because you are too smart and you just as good as these other kids, these other white kids."  She said, "I'm gonna put you on the college track level."  And so I was taking some classes and going down the college track.  And so as I came close to graduation, I remember sending out several applications for college and Benedict College actually gave me a full scholarship, and the full scholarship was based upon the fact that our revenue, because we were poor, one of that and the other was based upon my grades.  And so I went into Benedict College for the full scholarship.  And so that was, that was my choice.  That was why I chose Benedict because they came with the entire package.  Benedict College is in Columbia, South Carolina.  It's a parochial school run by Methodists and it's right across the street from Allen University [Columbia, South Carolina], which is where my older sister, Ella [Ella Barr (ph.)], and my fourth older sister, Alean [Alean Barr Scott], attended Allen University, both of them.  But I went to Benedict College you know, green and hadn't really been away from home that much, so it was, it was eye opening for me.  The good part about going to Benedict College is that my sister Alean and her husband Vanderbilt Scott actually, they lived in Columbia, and so, you know, my mother [Mary Brown Barr] didn't feel that she was sending me off to where there was no one, and, and they were very supportive, very supportive.  I recall one time in calling my brother-in-law, asking him if he could take me to the dentist, and he said, yes, without any hesitation.  He comes from clear across town to drive me a block or two down the street from the school.  I didn't know, but they were so supportive that they never said, "Leona [HistoryMaker Leona Barr-Davenport], you can walk," you know, that's someplace, but we come from a protective environment and, and so I still carried that.  I think I'm probably bolder and more brazen for lack of a term, better term now than I've ever been, you know since I moved to Atlanta [Georgia], because Atlanta teaches you another level of responsibility, but they were very supportive and, and college was, college was good for me, very good for me.
Story_ID: 638304
Speaker 1: Who was the president of Benedict [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina] at the time you were there?
Speaker 2: Ponder, Dr. Henry Ponder [HistoryMaker Henry Ponder] was president, his wife Eunice Ponder [Eunice Wilson Ponder], and so I received my degree under his leadership.  I was very active in college, joining various organizations, and I was in the honor societies and just got involved at different levels.  I've never been sports oriented even though I was manager of the basketball team in middle school [Stuckey School, Johnsonville, South Carolina], but I've never really been sports oriented, but organizations that, or clubs that focused on capacity, you know, being better, you know, based upon grades and things of that nature, I was involved in I wanna say, Kappa Alpha Mu Honor Society [sic. Alpha Kappa Mu Honor Society] and various.  I pledged into Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority as a freshman.  Unfortunately, the chapter was suspended because there was some hazing that took place.  It didn't happen to me, it happened to one of the other girls and so it was suspended, and it was not reinstated until I was a senior leaving Benedict College, so I never did get the true benefit of, of being involved in a, a sorority on campus.
Story_ID: 638305
Speaker 1: While I was there [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina], I ran, I decided to run for Miss Benedict college, and I ran for totally a, a reason that had nothing to do with the role.  I ran because I wanted to break the cycle of the queen looking a certain way and, and doing all these different things and as I remember, when I decided I wanted to run, no one expected that of me.  They expected me to run for student government president because I had served as secretary one year, and, but I decided I wanted to do something out of the box, and so I decided to run for Miss Benedict and people were shocked but I had a soror who, Jocelia Roberts [ph.] was her name.  Jocelia could sing the birds out of the trees and they had planned for Jocelia to be Miss Benedict and they thought she should be Miss Benedict because she could sing.  Now Jocelia, as it relates to overall looks and all of that, I'm of the darker hue, and she was more in the middle, but people thought that the songbird should get it.  Well, fate would have it that Jocelia would travel somewhere that day with, I think it was the Kappa--the Alphas [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], and she did not make it back in enough time to qualify, so she did not get on the ballot, so they tried to run a write in campaign.  Didn't work.  I ended up winning Miss Benedict basically totally different from what people had seen over the years as queens, and I remembered over the holidays before the voting took place, I went home and I said to my mother [Mary Brown Barr], "Is it wrong to pray for something that's not important?"  And my mother was always very matter of fact, and she said, "If it's important to you, then it's important," and she walked away.  And that was, that was my confirmation, you know.  It was something that I wanted to do for a cause. But in going back to the fact that everyone expected me to run for student government president, oh what's Darryl's last name?  Darryl's father was the pastor of Bible Way Baptist Church [Bible Way Church of Atlas Road, Columbia, South Carolina], Darryl Gray [ph.], and Darryl Gray is actually a state senator in South Carolina right now, so he's always been aggressive.  He was a day student.  It was one of the first times that a day student had ever won the title of SGA [Student Government Association] president, but Darryl always dressed for what he wanted to be, and Darryl had heard from someone that I was going to run for SGA president or they thought that I was, so Darryl being the politician that he was, even in school, came to me and said, "Leona [HistoryMaker Leona Barr-Davenport], I don't know if you know, but I'm thinking about running for SGA president." And I said, "Yes I heard that."  And he said, "Well I was just wondering if we could run together and you would run for vice president."  And I thought to myself, how dare you.  If I wanna run, you know, but I didn't tell him, I didn't tell him this.  If I wanna run, I'm going to run for SGA president.  Well, I said, "Darryl, I'll tell you what, I'm not going to run for SGA president and I'm not going to run for vice president.  I'm going to run for Miss Benedict."  Darryl said, "Oh great."  He never said, you know, exactly why, but I knew he was strategizing what he, what he scheduled a meeting for us to sit down together, so he was glad to know that I was not going to be in his way at all.  I ran for Miss Benedict, I won that, and so that was, that was an exciting time.
Story_ID: 638306
Speaker 1: So th- this Miss Benedict competition was that when you were campus queen, is that the same thing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you had a big spread in Ebony magazine.  It was a big (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: What was that like?
Speaker 2: It was nice because we, we got calls from people across the country, you know, family members saying there's a picture they chose to send to Ebony was really, it was a side angle, so people couldn't really just look and immediately know it was me.  And so family members started calling and saying, "Is that Luther [Luther Barr] and Titter's [Mary Brown Barr] daughter?" 'Cause see my mother, and so it was exciting.  And I still have a copy of that magazine today.  But I got that and it was good because there was a coronation and my father did come to that.  He typically didn't come to much.  He came to the coronation, and I'll backtrack, you know, as I said, he didn't, he didn't engage in our lives a lot probably because he knew it was going to cost some money, especially when we were in high school [Johnsonville High School, Johnsonville, South Carolina], and I don't know if it was a matter of him saying I'm not interested, or I can't show any interest because we can't afford it.  So I don't know which it was and I've never, I never asked the question because even for my graduation from high school, I graduated magna, I believe it was magna cum laude, and he was, had a singing program that Sunday afternoon, so he never said he was coming to the graduation and see my older sister [Ella Barr (ph.)] was teaching at the high school then so my mother and I and probably my brother [Alfred Barr], no my brother was probably in the [U.S. military] service, my younger sister [Wanda Barr Spencer (ph.)], we went to my graduation and we just, my father never showed any interest that he was coming.  But he was there and the way we found out is that the next week he and my mother were talking and he went on to tell my mother that when they called my name and said, "Leona Barr [HistoryMaker Leona Barr-Davenport] graduating with honors, magna cum laude," somebody said, "Isn't that your daughter?"  But he never said a word, so, you know, he never, not to me and so my mother knew then at that point and she told me that he was there.  But, you know, that was just, just him.  That was how he operated.  But we have pictures of the coronation at Benedict College [Columbia, South Carolina] with, with him being there.
Story_ID: 638307
Speaker 1: So what else went on during your college years at Benedict [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina]?  Wh- what were some of the other things that you, you think about?  I wanna go back and just ask you, what, you said that you ran for queen [Miss Benedict] because you wanted to break that cycle of whatever--
Speaker 2: Well, there was a cycle of the queens all being light skinned and having long hair.
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you was there a Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] chapter?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what made you chose AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] versus Delta, when it kind of the same (unclear)?
Speaker 2: On my campus, it was opposite.  On my campus, the Deltas were the light skinned, long hair.  You know you can look back in the yearbooks and just see the difference so the stigma was totally different.  In fact, I didn't know that because visually that wasn't what I saw, but I've heard it since, you know, I've left, left there.  But that is interesting, but I just wanted to, at that time it was like, it doesn't have to be that way and, and who said that was the rule.  See when you give me a rule, there has to be a rationale behind it.  You know, why, who said it? And even if it's said, what makes it etched in stone and so that's the kind of thing that I pull away from, you can't tell me that everyone has a living room and a house and decide that, you know, you have to have a living room.  Why, you know?  I'm always looking for the why.  There is nothing that says I can't do this.  There is nothing that says I shouldn't, and really who has the authority to tell me, unless it's something illegal, that I can't do.  So that's always been my, my train of thought.  I really step quite a bit to my own drum.  I try to think diplomatically and fair, and fairly in, in my dealings.
Story_ID: 638308
Speaker 1: So let's go on to your studies, and from what you have told us so far, I mean you're a great student, you know you did very well in most subjects.  Was there a subject that you just did not do well in?
Speaker 2: Well, interestingly enough, I'm really not very, a great math student, not great at math at all, but when I went to Benedict College [Columbia, South Carolina] my plan was to study journalism and, each student had to take economics.  Well the head of the business department was Dr. Enjocku [ph.] and in the economics class, I think Dr. Enjocku sat and he actually tried to choose students that he thought he could recruit into economics because they really didn't have a good grouping of economic students so he pulled me and a few other students aside while we were taking the class, you know, "What are you studying? What do you want to get your degree in?"  And I told him.  And he said, "I'd like for you to consider economics." And I remember saying why and this, that and the other, and when he explained it, it made sense.  And I said well, you know, economics really, you know, runs the world.  If you think in terms of just the entire thought process, and I say, "Okay," and so I changed.  Well, when I changed, unfortunately what also changed in my life was that I got a boyfriend and, you know, my life became more complicated and was just too much going on that really had nothing to do with the price of tea in China, really, and my success.  And so I kind of let some of my outside social life take control and economics just really, just didn't work for me, and the other reason it didn't work, is that all of the teachers, the main teachers, were international.  They were from another culture, and so there was difficulty in me understanding them, and so if I can't understand you, I really, really cannot, because I learn by being involved, being engaged.  I can read it, but then I still need to understand, you know, the specifics of it.  And I just had a difficulty in really comprehending the lesson in economics.  I made it through.  I mean I ended up, I think I graduated as I recall, cum laude, but still, that was a period for me where suddenly it was like you know, this, this isn't working for me, but I was too far into it to switch back to journalism or a thing of that nature, but it, you know, school was, it was, it was good. I enjoyed it, I enjoyed it overall as an experience.
Story_ID: 638309
Speaker 1: Were there any other professors that made an impact on your life while you were in college [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Other than Dr. Enjocku [ph.], and this, this is in college, there were more administrators.  I remember Dr. Tallulah Walker [ph.].  She was a guidance counselor if you will.  Somehow I always tended to connect with the counselors and the people who handle, you know, student direction and all of that.  And I could talk with her, you know, about what was good and what wasn't.  Another administrator, Dr. Eddie Burnett.  In fact, I recall Dr. Burnett, there was something going on in my hometown that Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] had come into my hometown of Johnsonville [South Carolina] to picket and to, you know, talk with one of the industries there about, and there was a program going on and Dr. Burnett called me on campus and asked me if I wanted to ride home.  He was going to the event and he said, "Do you want to ride to your hometown with me?" And so I did.  We went to the program and then we went by mother's house.  He left with biscuits and cake, and I don't remember what else, but from that point on, he started sending messages that he wanted, asking my mother [Mary Brown Barr] for certain things, so she ended up feeding people on my campus.  But, you know, they--the administrators really were people that I connected to more so than anything else.  And one of the things that ended up happening while I was in school, I had full scholarship, but then I believe it was either the last year or last two years, something happened with one the scholarships, and I needed to pay some of the tuition.  And so I went to a business owner that was right behind the school and his name was Dr. Walter Louis Jackson [ph.].  He owned the dry cleaners, Fifty Minute Clean Right [ph.] was the name of it and I told him that I, what had happened on campus and I needed a part-time job and of course, his was perfect because all I needed to do was walk out of the back gate.  And he hired me and it was so funny, he spent so much time telling customers when they came in, "That's Miss Benedict over there."  He was very proud of having college students working there for him cause I even recall one of my cousins actually, Gloria, Gloria Jean Brown [ph.], working for him and doing payroll towards the end of her school year at that time, but, you know, they were all people that were involved in the school that I think that had the greatest impact on me.  The teachers who were good.  Again I enjoyed the process of going through school and being involved.  There was a professor named Dr. Kinley [ph.] and Dr. Kinley never taught me but he was the high energy, get involved professor in the business school and, but, you know, people like that just, it was just their passion for what they did that really stands out for me.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what the picketing that was going on in Johnsonville?  What it was about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Johnsonville?  I think it was about fair wages.  As I recall it was about fair wages.  Blacks were beginning to work at, they were hiring blacks to work at the yarn, it was yarn.  Wellman Industries [Wellman Plastics Recycling LLC, Johnsonville, South Carolina] was the name of the industry and they actually processed yarn, and it was one of the few industries or people, black folks called it job working.  It was one of the few areas around that blacks could typically be hired also, and it was centered around fair wages at that time.  I would have to go back to my sister and see if she remembers.
Story_ID: 638310
Speaker 1: The other thing is that your brother [Alfred Barr] was in the [U.S. military] service at this time.  Was, Vietnam [Vietnam War] was a little before this time, but was your brother in the service during that time?
Speaker 2: No, no, my brother is two years older than me, so Vietnam had pretty much, that portion of it, had already gone by.
Speaker 1: Okay. Were there any, were there any people who were affected by the war?
Speaker 2: I have a cousin.  His name is Jimmie McGill [ph.].  He's my first cousin, my mother's sister's son, Idena McGill [Idena Brown McGill (ph.)].  Jimmie had some impact.  He was in Vietnam and I think he had some, from what I understand, some problems with drugs and things of that nature.  He's now a minister in South Carolina, but he was in the service during that time and he did, he's had some issues since then, you know, medical issues, and so I think that's, you know that's what we saw directly in my family were people who had been in Vietnam.
Story_ID: 638311
Speaker 1: You talked about earlier, you wanted to be a writer, you wanted to go into journalism and switch to economics, ah not really, you know, enjoying that so much (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: When you were preparing to leave college [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina], what did you, what did you think that you do?
Speaker 2: You know it's very interesting.  I thought that I would eventually go on to work on my master's [degree], and this is what's interesting.  Dr. Enjocku [ph.], again, called me in and he says, he always was very professional, "Miss Barr [HistoryMaker Leona Barr-Davenport]," as he would say, and he said, "I've got a full scholarship for you to go to work on your master's in economics at Howard University [Washington, D.C.]."  And so dealing with this social relationship again, the social life, I said, "Dr. Enjocku," I said, "I wanna work on my master's, but I wanna get it in business administration," and I asked him if I could use the scholarship for that and he said, "Hell, no."  In fact he said, "Hell no," you know, he was very animated and, and so I didn't take the scholarship.  I went home for a minute, but I knew that it could only be for a minute, because I did not want my mother [Mary Brown Barr] or anyone to get used to me being there.  So I went home, stayed for a while and I found a little part-time job back in Columbia [South Carolina] and then I moved to Atlanta [Georgia] with one of my classmates.  She had been hired by the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] and I moved under the guise that I was going to come here and work and work on my master's and I did not do that immediately.
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you, well let me first say, what year did you graduate (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I graduated in 1979, late.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 638312
Speaker 1: This first--wait, were your parents [Mary Brown Barr and Luther Barr] still sharecropping [in Johnsonville, South Carolina] at this time?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes. In fact they had, had, had dealt with a number of things.  Towards the end of my college [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina], I recall there being some, something about the company that handled the fertilizer that they bought their fertilizer from, had sent out, there was a wrong combination of the materials.  As a result my father's crop didn't do well at all because the fertilizer was not properly made.  And so he hardly, they hardly made any money at all that year and I remember hearing my sister and my mother talk about how devastated he was because what would have to happen is that if you didn't make any money, then you would have to borrow from the owner to make it through the winter and then if the next year you didn't do well, then what, you would split the profit and then the money that you owed them came out of that.  And, and one of the things that was always interesting and we talk about it to this day.  There was a store owner, it was Thurmond's Grocery Store [ph.] that wasn't far from where we, it was very close to where my sister and brother [Alfred Barr] actually built the house and it wasn't that far from where we lived initially, but a little further.  You know, we, he let farmers keep a running total, you know, if he didn't have any money, he would, you would go and get your groceries and he kept the books.  And I often just wondered how clean those books were and because you just wonder when, but he did pay him off eventually.  But, you know, that was a good thing that they could do that, but then you would have this money that you owe, the grocer, you'd have the money that you owed the landowner so you could operate in the deficit nonstop.  And so that was something that was always interesting to me.  And, and that was the life, that was what we did.
Story_ID: 638313
Speaker 1: Okay so you, you said your first job, it wasn't in, it wasn't in Atlanta [Georgia], you took an accounting supervisor position at GenCom [ph.].
Speaker 2: Broniec, Broniec Associates [Broniec Associates, Inc.].  That was Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was in Atlanta.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, in fact, I'll go, I consider my very first job, which I don't have on my resume, is the job that I had at Fifty Minute Clean Right [ph.] while I was in college [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina].  And then when I came to Atlanta, I don't recall how I learned about this job, but it was at Broniec Associates.  I walked in one day, I remember looking, I didn't have a car, I didn't have transportation at all.  I took the bus to this building and I was so confused, you know, in getting there, I remember looking for the building and there was this woman coming out of the back door, and I said, "Are you familiar with Broniec Associates?" No, not Broniec, no--Gencom.  I said, "Are you familiar with Gencom?" And it was General Communications [ph.] is what it was at that time.  And she said, "Yes, this is the building, this is the back," so I never forget I went in for my interview through the back door.  I'll never, that just stood, that stands out for me.  And so in going they took me to the front and I remember seeing this black lady in the building, the only black person that I saw in the building as I went to the front.  They took me to the front for the interview.  And so I was hired, I was hired for the position, and when I came in they gave me, I had an office and everybody was white and I didn't see the black woman.  So I think after about a week or so I finally said, "Didn't I see an African American woman here?" And they said, "Yeah, you took her place."  So, anyway, she had gotten another job and so they were hiring to fill that job.  And it was a pretty big job at the time because she was actually dealing with the customers.  Customers could call to complain, to ask questions about their bill, and, you know, there were a number of different things that she did that were sizable.  And I developed a great rapport with the staff and everybody there.  One of the women that was there was from England and she actually handled the call center, and Mary [ph.] had been very good friends with Gail.  Gail Hogard [ph.] is the woman whose position I took and we became best friends.  Mary actually introduced us so we became best friends and still are friends now.  But Mary befriended me and, and, you know, just brought us to her house and just did all kinds of things and she just loved African American people.  She loved people period.  But it was a good company to work for.  I was there for four years.
Speaker 1: What year did you start?
Speaker 2: Wow, that's a good question.  Let's see.  I want to say I was there from '79 [1979] to eighty--I was there four years, so it must have been late '79 [1979] and then I left there, I think, in 1984.
Story_ID: 638314
Speaker 1: And then I went from GenCom [ph.] to Broniec Associates [Broniec Associates, Inc.].  That was the accounts payable auditing firm out in Stone Mountain [Georgia], and that was a very interesting job because the owner was Polish and, it wasn't interesting because he was Polish, he was an interesting person.  His name was Frank Broniec [Frank D. Broniec] and we didn't know, I didn't know when being hired that Frank was bipolar, and so he was on medication all the time and we came to realize that anytime he was having these relapses, it was when he must not have been taking his medication properly.  But what began to happen at that company is that the company on any day you never knew what the personality of the company was going to be because it was a small company and we did accounts payable auditing for retail companies.  And so if he was not in a good mood, if he was not happy, everybody felt that, everybody felt it.  And so we had a number of run ins, he and I, things went well for a while, it was interesting, he wanted, he was glad that he had all of these employees that had degrees or master's [degree], but he wanted you, he wanted to communicate to you and pay you as if you were a non-degreed person, and so you can't have it both ways, so we had a number of run ins with that.
Story_ID: 638315
Speaker 1: So what were some of the other things that happened and tell me more about your work there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  With Broniec Associates [Broniec Associates, Inc.], as I said, we were accounts payable auditors and basically what we did was to go in and audit the paperwork of retailers, and this were invoices and statements, and so you found errors.  If you would find an error where the buyer agreed to buy, to pay fifty dollars per dress, but it was billed at seventy-five dollars per dress, and so when you found that error, let's say they ordered a thousand or ten thousand of these items, so the error was ten thousand times the twenty-five hundred which was the difference.  And so we would write up these orders called charge backs and so you would send that charge back to the manufacturer and nine times out of ten, they would pay it because this is an ongoing relationship.  So the business was built upon finding errors and so when they paid it, the company received half of the money and then the company, Broniec Associates, and then the company we were auditing for, say Macy's [R.H. Macy and Co.; Macy's, Inc.], they received the other half because we found this money that they didn't know that they even had.  But in working with Frank [Frank D. Broniec] and Broniec Associates, it was very interesting because of the way, as I said, he wanted to treat you differently from your level of education, and there was an opportunity that came up for a promotion, and I really should have been the person in line for the promotion but there was another lady that had come in and I don't even remember her name now, and when he announced the promotion, he promoted her.  But this is what he did.  We'd have these weekly Friday morning meetings and so he called me into his office prior to the meeting to say, "Leona [HistoryMaker Leona Barr-Davenport], I'm going to promote someone today."  And I thought that was interesting, so I thought that he was calling me in to tell me that he was going to give me a promotion.  And he said, "Who would you think that would be?"  And I said, "I think it would be me."  And he said, "Well no, it's--," her name was Amy [ph.], "No it's going to be Amy." And he said, "How do you feel about that?"  I said, "I don't, because Amy has been here less time than I have, I've done X, Y, Z," so forth and so on, and I told him why, went into the meeting and he made the announcement.  Well that same week he gave me an extra check in my payroll, so it was payoff money (gesture), quiet money.  So we went through that and then something else transpired.  I don't recall.  They brought me in.  After that I withdrew and I worked, I did what I supposed to do and that was it.  So they called me in and he said, "I sense that you're not happy."  And I said, "No I'm not."  And he said, "Well this is what I'm going to do.  I'm going to give you--I'm gonna pay you and give you two weeks to try to find another job."  It was about that time, there were several other people, white and black, had left because of something that had transpired.  He said, "I'll give you two weeks to look or a job."  He said, "If you don't find anything come back and we'll renegotiate."  Well once I left, I knew I was never coming back.  He had given a letter basically saying what he was going to do, he was giving me this time off so I could find another job.  Well I didn't go back and then I filed for unemployment.  Well he fought it with every breath, life, all the breath in him.  And so when I went to the [U.S.] Department of Labor they said, "Did you quit?"  I said, "No, he let me go," and the letter pretty much validated that.  Well he had this way of writing and the writing you could tell it was almost as if he was writing with this prophetic, you know, anger and something, and they could see it in the paperwork.  They granted me the unemployment and he just, he took it to the, just kept continuing to fight it until I found another job.  But it was one of the most interesting situations I ever been in, but I always had to fight for my increases and I have a good friend, Carla Jackson [ph.], who started work there after I did and Carla told me after we left, she said, "Leona, I knew every time you got an increase." And I said, "How?"  She said, "Because I got one."  Every time I went in to fight for myself, others benefited from it.  And so that was, that was very interesting, very interesting.
Story_ID: 638316
Speaker 1: Were there any other times that, I don't know whether you felt discriminated against in that position, but were there any times that you can think about that you felt that you were discriminated against?
Speaker 2: Absolutely. You know, being a business owner period is difficult unless you're operating at, you know, a certain, and even at operating at a certain level, there's just certain casualties that comes along with being a business owner.  Well, I, at that time, traveled to South Carolina as often as I could, I mean, my heart, which was my mother [Mary Brown Barr], was still in South Carolina, and one weekend I was going to be traveling and I was going to leave from work because it made more sense.  The company was out in Stone Mountain [Georgia] and so it made more sense for me to leave from that particular location than to come back to the south side and leave.  And so I went in and they had not given us our payroll checks, so I went in and asked for the check and this was from his vice president because Frank [Frank D. Broniec] was not in at that time.  He had the checks.  And I said, "Jerry [ph.] I'd like to get my check," and he says, "Well we're not going to give them until the end of the day."  And I knew, we all knew what they were doing, they were floating, they were wanting to make sure we didn't get to the banks until after two [o'clock].  And I said, "I'm traveling, I have to have my check."  So Jerry goes in the stack, he finds my check and he throws it across the desk at me.  I picked it up and I flung it back and I said, "Don't you ever do that again."  And I walked out and I left the check on the desk.  We comes to me later and he hands me the check and I was able to go to the back and get it cashed before then.  And see I know that he handled it in that manner after the fact.  See, nobody else saw it.  I could have challenged him in front of everybody, but I didn't. You know, I try to take the high road typically when you dealing with something like that, but from that point on I never had to worry about him respecting me in my role in my capacity, but I told him, "No, you don't address me that way."  And I think that's something that he probably would have never forgotten because it has, it stuck with me because I remember, it was just the attitude and Frank really tended to, the owner, to promote the white guys in the company [Broniec Associates, Inc.] before he promoted anyone else and so Jerry had taken on his attitude and his personality, and interestingly enough, I left the company, and several years later Frank had a heart attack in his office.  And staff people heard something but he was so, such a strange guy nobody thought that it was anything like he was dying, so no one paid it any attention so it was about thirty minutes to an hour before anybody even checked on it.  So, it was one of those interesting situations.
Speaker 1: So you were there four years.
Speaker 2: Four years, um-hm.
Story_ID: 638317
Speaker 1: And was your next job with the Atlanta--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Interestingly enough I had began to volunteer on behalf of Broniec Associates [Broniec Associates, Inc.] with the Atlanta Business League [Atlanta, Georgia].  The chairman of the Atlanta Business League at that time was John Cox.  John Cox is an African American executive with Delta Airlines.  He was the community affairs person with Delta, and he also chaired the Atlanta Business League's board of directors.  Frank Broniec [Frank D. Broniec] and John Cox both sat on a board at the airport.  It was a board that was, it was interfaith, it was interfaith chaplaincy as I recall.  It was, it's the chapel that's at the airport.  I'm not sure what it's named now, the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta National Airport [sic. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia], but they were on the board together and so I was the company representative and I really enjoyed it.  It was my first real exposure to African American business owners en masse and, and it was interesting to me to watch how they operated and how they were dealt every negative blow there was, and every day they got up and they kept going, you know.  They might be in a business that went out of business and it was as if they just got up, brushed themselves off and said, "Okay, what's next?"  And I started to see that and just to respect the dedication and the drive that black business owners had, and so, as a result of that, Ed Menifee who was then the executive vice president of the Atlanta Business League knew that I was in between work and he said to me, he calls me Miss Benedict because I was, when he found out that I was Miss Benedict college [at Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina] he said, "Miss Benedict why don't you come work with me for a while until you decide what you wanna do?" And I said, "Okay, I'll give it a couple of years." And so it was during that period of time those two years that he left the Atlanta Business League, but because I had only planned to be there a couple of years, I didn't have, didn't think about applying for his position.  I stayed in my role and was there for the next president, helped in getting her acclimated and she was there for right at four years.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Valerie Montague [Valerie Hampton Montague Goldston], it was Valerie Montague at that time and so I was there during her four years and even at the end of that time as she was leaving, the board of directors, the chair was Thomas W. Dortch [HistoryMaker Thomas W. Dortch, Jr.].  Thomas is still involved with the Atlanta Business League today and so is Ed Menifee by the way.  They were looking at doing an executive search for a president of the Atlanta Business League, and I'm still, this is not on my radar, and one day this voice was clear as a bell, it said, "Leona [HistoryMaker Leona Barr-Davenport], you are the right person for this position right now."  And, you know I heard it and I remembered, you know, was almost startled, but I heard it and I received it and I thought about it and I realized at that point, with where the organization was and the transition it was going through, that I was, and so I did communicate that, that I was interested.  It wasn't immediately received by all the leadership.  You know sometimes people have a tendency of seeing you in a certain role and when they see you in that role, they can't visualize you outside of that, but, you know, God would have it and I believe that it was a plan that was bigger than me and bigger than the Atlanta Business League and bigger than the people that were involved, that there were some folks that really believed that I needed to be in this position and they fought for it.  People like Dr. Shirley Bradley Carmack who, at one point, was the head of anesthesiology at Grady [Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia].  She is now one of the top level direct marketing people in the country.  She was a huge supporter.  I remember Daryll Harris Griffin [Daryll H. Griffin] who is still involved with the Atlanta Business League, writing a letter of support for me unsolicited.  We didn't have a conversation.  And I just remember different people stepping up and just speaking up on my behalf.  I never, other than letting them know I was interested, I never fought for the position, and, and so I believe it was, it was for me.
Story_ID: 638318
Speaker 1: Now you began working there in 1988.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what was your first position?  What did you do when first got there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was executive assistant to the executive vice president and that was my role.  I was the administrative person for the organization and so I served in that capacity for those two years when I worked for Ed Menifee and then when Valerie Montague [Valerie Hampton Montague Goldston] became president I was promoted to manager of member services, and I may have served in one or two other roles.  Well, I was assistant director at one point.  Yeah, during Ed Menifee I went from executive vice president, executive assistant to the executive vice president to assistant director.  So I served in different capacities with the organization, up until I was made acting president in 1997.  I believe it was April and then in December I was officially made president of the organization [Atlanta Business League, Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 638319
Speaker 1: Now be- before we go any further, any--can you give us a little history about, about the organization?
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.  The Atlanta Business League [Atlanta, Georgia] is a, was founded in 1933, the national, let me back up.  The national business league [National Negro Business League] was founded in 1900 by Dr. Booker T. Washington.  And the Atlanta Business League was founded in 1933.  The Atlanta Business League was founded on the same premise that Dr. Washington founded.  He believed that if African American business owners were ever going to achieve economic parity that we needed to begin to grow our own business and hire people in our own neighborhoods.  And so that was the focus, that black business owners needed to have an organization where they could talk about what was happening in their business, what was happening in, in the business world as a whole, and to connect, and that we needed to hire our own because in many instances, people hire people that look like them, and if we were not going to build our communities and there was no one that's going to.  And so it was the same premise that we, that we found at the Atlanta Business League.  We wanted to foster the growth and development of African American business owners in metropolitan Atlanta [Georgia] and that has been our mission and we accomplished that goal in a number of different ways.  We have, we developed programming over the years, we, some of it has not changed, but a great deal has been added and tweaked.  We provide a number of seminars, education and training is the major focus of everything that we do.  We believe that if we grow the entrepreneur, if we take a holistic approach to developing the person if they're not there, then they're not where they need to be, 'cause we want to take them where they are to where they need to be.  Some come already where they need to be educationally, but process wise they're not there, so our goal is to bring that information to the table, to bring them access.  We bring in CEOs from various walks of life to talk about what their industries are doing, what their businesses are doing, how business owners can get to do business with them.  We provide access, and we also ask those CEOs to bring their people from procurement and from diversity so that our members will have an opportunity to meet them.  So it is an ongoing programmatic piece of bringing what the membership needs to the table, constantly serving it up and we do not certify in any way.  We have other organizations in the city that provide certification for African American business owners who need certification to say that they're black.  There are other groups who do that, but ours is more in development.
Speaker 1: Now--even though this is an all-black business organization.
Speaker 2: No, the mission of the Atlanta Business League is to encourage the development and growth of African American business owners in metro Atlanta.  Our membership is, is somewhat diverse because corporations are members of the Atlanta Business League, you know we have corporations such as Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company], Georgia Power [Georgia Power Company], AT&T [AT&T, Inc.], The Home Depot [The Home Depot, Inc.], various companies that are members of the organization and they are there to say we support this initiative because if we're going to help develop the economy of metro Atlanta, we have to be inclusive, so this is one of the organizations that we want to be a part of so that we can help fulfill our internal goal while also filling the overall goal of economics in this state.  So it is, it is, the focus is on black business owners but we bring in people from all walks of life to accomplish the goal.
Story_ID: 638320
Speaker 1: The staff when you first, is the staff diverse as well?
Speaker 2: No, the staff is not diverse.  It is not diverse, and, and it goes back if you think, think about what Dr. Booker T. Washington said.  He wasn't saying only hire black people.  He was saying you are likely to be the ones to hire your own folks.  I've never had anyone other than African Americans to apply for work with the Atlanta Business League [Atlanta, Georgia] during my tenure, and I would venture to say that that has been the same.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What I guess I should have said is as far as the infrastructure of the company being all black, you being one of the few women even though it's all black, did you have any resistance as you were coming in and beginning your leadership role?
Speaker 2: I think the resistance that I saw real or perceived, see the previous president was a woman and so the only resistance that I saw was in people who had gotten used to this 5'10", 5'11" woman who walks into the room, you know the stature is different, and I think that, and then also the resistance came from others who had perceived me as the processor, the implementer, not the leader.  And so at that point, that was really where I saw any resistance from people having a picture that they had painted, real or contrived and then changing that and being accepting of new leadership.  And I think that happens almost in, in every situation is that people get used to a certain level or style and if they like it, that next person has to come in and almost flip it around so that people see them for who they are.
Speaker 1: Well, you watched Valerie [Valerie Hampton Montague Goldston] become the leader so you from the outside looking in was able to see some of the challenges that she went through--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --was there anything that happened that you, you could sidestep in your role?
Speaker 2: I think, one of the things that I did that was different and I had the opportunity to do it.  See I began to build relationships and coalitions in my role as second in command.  There were relationships that built with various entities in the city, you know.  There was a government agency and I won't mention who they are who actually mailed all of our materials for us.  That was their support of the organization.  And that was a relationship that I developed.  And so there were different relationships like that of people that had connected if you will to me that I had in place that she didn't have in place when she came in, and see she was following a long line of men in that role.  Now what I would say that Valerie benefited from, her husband Owen Montague, is a technology buff, so he was able to help her from the outside in building the technology infrastructure for the organization.  She is an excellent writer, so she brought something to the table that had not been a part of the organization before.  And so she built upon her strengths and so I think that's significant that she built upon her strength and then she had this outside source, and one of the things that I can celebrate is that Owen is a contractor, her ex-husband, Owen Montague, is a contractor for the Atlanta Business League now.  We had a great time and that went away for a while because he was doing some other things, but we reconnected, I want to say in 1993 I believe it was, when we--might, might have been 2003, let me back up, 2003.  We reconnected and started working together again and he is now just a, just a great value for the organization because of his interest in technology and, and we work great as a team.

Speaker 1: What are some of your accomplishments or what are you most proud of?
Speaker 2: Wow, that's, that's interesting.  If I think in terms of the Atlanta Business League [Atlanta, Georgia].  I am extremely proud of the programming that I brought to the organization.  We had a focus on women, but I took it to another level in creating a publication that highlighted African American women, that is just a great coffee table publication that we've been doing now I believe for about ten to twelve years, brought that to the table.  Some of the current programming even as manager of member services, we started our Women of Vision Breakfast because we realize through our Super Tuesday activities and Super Tuesday is a full conference that takes place each year and that Super Tuesday Conference was created by female business owners and professionals who were members of the Atlanta Business League twenty-six years ago and we continued that and have grown over the years, but as we were working on those committees, the committee members would get together and we could hardly stop them from talking.  And they were talking about everything, family, business, relationships, and we thought we need to find another way to do this, and so our Women of Vision Breakfast grew out of that.  We needed another forum for them to be able to talk and get together and network and that's how we started our Women of Influence list [Atlanta's Top 100 Black Women of Influence] back, it was in '94 [1994], Valerie [Valerie Hampton Montague Goldston] was president at that time, but we started that particular breakfast with me as manager of member services.  And so we, those are some of the kinds of things that we taken and continue to add value to and for the organization.  We've just created a great place for African American business owners and professionals to be.
Story_ID: 638322
Speaker 1: When I think in terms of accomplishments for me, it was a big deal in completing that working professionals weekend M.B.A. at Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia] and being not only wanting to go through the program, but being selected to receive that first scholarship, and going through programs such as Leadership Atlanta and Leadership Georgia [Atlanta, Georgia] and just really expanding my outreach so that I could then bring that back together to feed into the organization and create a better box, if you will, a better organization for the members to be proud of.  So those are some of the kinds of things when I think in terms of what am I proud of.  I'm proud of coming from South Carolina and being a sharecropper and growing from where I was to where I am because my husband [Jewel Davenport] said to me, "Leona [HistoryMaker Leona Barr-Davenport], you know for all intents and purposes, you all were not supposed to make it," and when he first said that to me I became angry 'cause I thought who are you to decide on whether we were supposed to make it, but then I stopped and I regrouped and I thought about it, and now I realize what he was saying.  We were not supposed to grow out of that area in participation and even if we had, you may not have necessarily have the drive to do bigger and better things and so I understand now what he's saying, so I'm proud of that because we had parents [Mary Brown Barr and Luther Barr], neither of whom had graduated high school, but neither was ignorant and they stressed education, they stressed, you know, being better, doing better, being responsible and, and that's what they showed us.  So that's where the problem is come, that's what I'm proud of.
Story_ID: 638323
Speaker 1: Since you mentioned it, 'cause we were gonna get to it--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you did get married.  Tell me, is there a story about how you met your husband and who he is.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My husband is Jewel Davenport and he was born in Pensacola, Florida, and interestingly enough, he was born to a young mother and when he was born, he had an aunt or his mother's aunt was about, they were about to go fishing and she said she's too young to take care of this baby, she didn't go fishing, she went to pick him up and she raised him in Pensacola.  But his aunt raised him so that's something I didn't get a chance to meet her.  I so hate that because when I hear him talk about her he is, my husband is, was born in, I think 1943, and as a young man he had a television in his room which is unheard of, when you think of some of the things that he tells me.  But I think even with that, he has a sense of missing out on being at the house with his other siblings when they were growing up.  But we met in 1988, late 1988 and we married in 19--let me back up, that was '89 [1989] and we married in 1990.  A good friend of mine and his, his, he had worked with a gentlemen by the name of Booker Izell, Booker T. Izell.  Booker retired from Atlanta Journal-Constitution here in Atlanta [Georgia] not long ago and they knew each other in Dayton, Ohio.  My husband eventually moved to Dayton many years ago where he worked with General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] and Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC], after he left the [U.S.] Navy.  And he worked with Booker and then when Booker moved to Atlanta, I met him as a result of being involved with the Atlanta Business League [Atlanta, Georgia] and, and there was a lady that we knew and so when Jewel came here he was divorced and he'd left General Motors and he and his wife introduced us, and so that's how we met and we married in December of 1990.
Story_ID: 638324
Speaker 1: Now, you go back to get your master's degree.  What year did you get your master's and where?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I went back to get my master's in 1999 at Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].  I graduated in 2001 and it was wonderful.  I received my master's in marketing and it was a powerful experience for a number of reasons.  We were seeing a major change in corporate support and corporate sponsorship and partnership and I realize that I was not speaking the language that they needed to hear, so going through that program really provided a totally different lingo if you will, a totally different presentation style because companies wanted to know statistics, they wanted you, you to answer all questions, the who, what, when, why and how, and so after going through the master's program at Clark Atlanta University, I gained a greater appreciation of the how and my presentation style totally changed and that was one of the pieces when working with Owen Montague.  We sat down with my master's in marketing, to say, "Okay, how do we tell the ABL story," and so he and I met for probably every week for about two months to just talk about the Atlanta Business League [Atlanta, Georgia] what we were doing because we knew what we were doing, people who attended the events knew what we were doing, but there was nothing that really said it.  And so we would sit and talk about all the programs of the Atlanta Business League, what it was, who attended, how often we held the program, how many people we reached.  I mean it was just an ongoing piece.  And so after we met, Owen came back to me with this grid and the grid, it was called the ABL at a glance and by the numbers, and we began to use that as our marketing tool and we saw major changes in, in our support and just in how we were being received because we were delivering the goods in the manner that they wanted to see it.
Story_ID: 638325
Speaker 1: What are your future endeavors looking like?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I'm constantly thinking about what my next ten years should look like, you know what, because at fifty two, you know you have to start thinking about how you want to move to the next level and how you want to retire and Dr. Johnnetta Cole [Johnnetta B. Cole] wrote in her book, it's a small book of quotes called 'Dream the Boldest Dreams' ['Dream the Boldest Dreams: And Other Lessons of Life'] and one of the quotes that she has in there is: leave while they still want you.  And so that sticks with me and that resonates with me and so my goal for these next five years is to be very thoughtful and purposeful in looking at what I am going to bring to the table and how we can build the kind of infrastructure that allows for someone else that's coming along.  And so that's something that we're doing while we continue to build a program and one of the things we did very recently earlier this year, we hired a younger graduate from Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], not to say he's interested or would be interested in being president of the organization one day, but the idea is to begin to send this message at a younger level so that there are other people that are buying into the overall idea and concept because I think that's what happens to too many organizations in the city and in the country.  We lead it until we can't lead anymore and we've not built a structure that allows for other people to come in and appreciate what's there, and so you lose, and so that's my goal for the Atlanta Business League [Atlanta, Georgia].  Now my personal goal over and above that, you know I've thought of a number of things.  I'd like to do some teaching in the university system, you know, along the lines of leadership, things of that nature.  At one point I actually thought about the diversity, you know, working in diversity in some of the corporations but that's beginning to change so much.  The thrust is there but it's somewhat different because the last ten years have been, it's being built and I would have preferred to be on the building end, but, you know, that's still something that's a thought.  I'm still open to total entrepreneurship in running a business of my own, so that's not out of the realm of what could possibly happen because I've had some successes in non-profit and I think I've made some strides in different areas and built relationships that, that could be positive, but, but that's what I'm looking at.
Speaker 1: What type of business would you start?
Speaker 2: Well, I am thinking more along the lines of consulting, consulting in a non-profit, I don't know if I want, it's not fund development, but non-profit development, you know, what's, because I think we've built a good communication tool for the organization, and a number of other organizations want to utilize our tool but we have to be very careful in how we utilize it and, and how we stretch it, so I think the number of organizations, other organizations need to look at what they need to do because I want to take ours to the next level.  I mean we just recently and we were behind the eight ball, added Twitter and Facebook to the Atlanta Business League.  We have that as a part of our distribution, but we've done a great job in building brand through outreach in different ways and I think a number of orga- other organizations could use that, and, and I could also work from the corporate side in helping them to identify good solid organizations that they should be engaged in.
Story_ID: 638326
Speaker 1: You also mentioned that you're a participant in Leadership Atlanta and Leadership Georgia [Atlanta, Georgia].  How did you feel about those organizations?  I mean were, were those organizations or programs very beneficial to you?
Speaker 2: They were very beneficial.  I would venture to say I did not get the full thrust of Leadership Georgia.  That's a five weekend program and due to circumstances beyond my control I had to miss two of those weekends, but what it did was to expose me to areas in Georgia that I probably would have never gone to or known anything about, so it gave me a greater appreciation for the state and the programs that are available in different areas outside of metro Atlanta [Georgia] so that in and of itself was powerful. Leadership Atlanta was stronger for me because it is a nine week program where you are being exposed to different aspects of metropolitan Atlanta, the prison program, you know how property, how communities are developed, just so many different aspects that you don't have any knowledge of the internal workings and then there's a great relationship building that comes out of it.  You meet people from all walks of life.  You might meet attorneys, other organization leaders, people from Corporate America that you may not have ever had a chance to build a relationship with, so it connects people from all walks of life and in many instances you build relationships that you take on from that point into the next level, but it raises awareness onto the nth degree of what's happening in your community.
Story_ID: 638327
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, is there something that you might have done differently?
Speaker 2: You know I question, I tend not to say I would of, could of, should, but I look back and I often think of that scholarship I gave up to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] years ago.  I believe typically things were in divine order and it wasn't, just wasn't my time to take advantage of that scholarship to work on my master's [degree], you know, so I think about that and say what would I have been doing had I done that, but then I look at where I am in my life now and I don't know that I would have had it any other way because running the Atlanta Business League [Atlanta, Georgia] and being in the roles that I've been with the Atlanta Business League has allowed me to be exposed at various levels and people in the community, the corporate side, the small business side, the community side.  I touch people from all walks of life so it gives me the best of all worlds.  Am I making a lot of money?  No. but I'm making a decent living and so the question becomes what's more important and so when it comes to a state of satisfaction I think I've achieved a great deal of satisfaction.  I'd love to be able to do more, touch more and make a difference in so many more people's lives and so through the organization we work at making sure, you know, similar to HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers].  We work at making sure that we talk about people in the community that are making a difference and putting them out there and educating the community on what's happening right in their midst and they may not know anything about, so I take a great deal of pride in being a part of that and, and it makes a difference in people's lives and it connects them in a way that they would have not been connected prior to.
Story_ID: 638328
Speaker 1: So what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: My, wow, I, I think when I think in terms of my legacy, and this is going to be so cliche-ish, cliche-ish, but basically I want my legacy to be that I made a difference by touching people where they were, and bringing them closer to the camera, to the screen so that other people could see who they were, and difference that they were making.  And so that's, that's the legacy, making a difference in growing entrepreneurs, highlighting professionals and connecting people at various levels.
Story_ID: 638329
Speaker 1: Well you told me that, that you were married [to Jewel Davenport].  Did you have children?
Speaker 2: No, we do not have any children.  I have a wonderful, well two stepdaughters, one that I know extremely well and she's just one of the best people I know in the world.  Her name is Stephanie McClendon [Stephanie Davenport McClendon].  She lives in Colorado with her three children, but just a wonderful young lady.  I've watched her just, she's just dynamic in being focused and, and making whatever sacrifice she needs to make.  So I didn't have any directly but I have some indirectly.  And then I helped in some way I believe to raise my nieces and my nephews, my two nieces, Vanice Scott [ph.] and Valicia Scott [ph.] to help raise both of them and my nephews Carson Alexander Spencer [Carson Spencer (ph.)] and Javon [Javon Scott (ph.)] and so those, those are my children and, and, and so that's where I try to make a difference in, in as many ways as I know how.
Story_ID: 638330
Speaker 1: In that aspect if you had to send a message to the future generation, to the grandchildren of Carson [Carson Spencer (ph.)] and Vanice [Vanice Scott (ph.)], what would your message be for the future generation?
Speaker 2: Focus.  You've got to make a decision about something.  I think for the future generation they need to, to make a decision and work towards that, with the understanding that you might move off of the path periodically.  And so if you move off of the path, that's okay, but either get back on it, or redirect the focus.  I'll use my niece Valicia [Valicia Scott (ph.)] as an example.  When she initially left school or was about to graduate she was going to go to school to become an accountant.  Well for me that wasn't vast enough, and that's just my opinion.  And so when I knew that that's what she was going to do, I began to make a conscious effort to expose her to some other things.  I was able to get her into the OBAP program which is here in Atlanta [Georgia].  It's the organization of black Atlanta pilots [Organization of Black Airline Pilots; Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals].  They have a two week program where students can come and learn about aeronautics and being a pilot and actually go through the assimilation process, and so she, I was able to get her into that program.  Well after going through the program, she said, you know, "I think I'm gonna get my degree in mechanical engineering," because she was amazed by how an airplane, something that massive can stay up in the air, and this was right after the last part of the program, the students have an opportunity to pilot an airplane with, of course, a licensed pilot in there, and she flew over Six Flags [Six Flags Over Georgia, Austell, Georgia] and they were low enough that they could see it, and what was interesting is when I picked her up that afternoon, she just had this glazed look on her face, and she said it was just amazing, it was just amazing, that's all she could say.  Well she went on to Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], got her degree in mechanical engineering, but then she decided, "I wanna go back into math and education," to get her master's [degree] and she said she saw the difficulty that students were having in math because she's excellent in math.  It's second nature to her.  And so, this was also a direct result of her teaching students who had failed the math courses as freshman.  So she got her master's in education and I was downhearted because I thought, oh my god, you know, but any way she said, "I think this is something I should do."  I said, "You know you're not gonna make as much money as in mechanical engineering." And she said, "Yeah, I know."  And so anyway after she got her master's and she decided to work on her Ph.D., still at Florida A and M, she has gone back to mechanical engineering, and so I love it because she at least knew that she had options and I had done my part and her parents in trying to keep her focused and the same thing with my older niece.  I mean she started out working in purchasing at the University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina] and it was pretty much a dead end job, but one of our cousins got her involved in a program called PACE [Program of Alternative Certification for Educators] in Columbia, South Carolina, and this is where professionals can actually go back into the school system, use their degree as their credentials, but they're taking courses throughout while they teach and so that's, so now she's in education and she loves it, she loves it.  So I think when you think about children you think about youth, you got to give them what it takes in order to see a bigger picture, but they've got to focus on something and you've got to make a difference.  I mean at the end of the day you want account for something.  If that is for yourself, if for your family, our children, you need to account what difference did you make in your time on earth and I think that if, that, that to me is important and I would hope that it would be important to them.
Story_ID: 638331
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we did not talk about that you would like to speak about?
Speaker 2: Well, one thing that I, I missed when we were talking about growing up.  The owners of the property where we were sharecroppers had a son.  Well this was the owner, it was the son of the owner of the property.  They eventually became the owners after their parents died.  Well they had a son who loved my mother to death.  I mean he just loved her to pieces.  As a little boy he developed a love for her and he would be missing at home and if he was missing they knew that they could come and find him at our house, and so he would just leave home and he wasn't even five, probably along the lines of three, four, three four and five.  And he would come to spend time with my mother, and his parents, even to the point where he had a little friend, might have been his cousin, he brought his cousin to see Mary [Mary Brown Barr].  That's what he called her.  And he was just enamored with her, you know, talking with her, and she'd take time and she'd talk with him and if she was doing something they'd want to do what she was doing.  Well his parents couldn't figure out how to break this, how to stop him, so I guess they sat him down and they talked to him about the difference between him and my mother and, so one day he came back to the house and he said, "Mary, you're colored aren't you?"  And she said, "Yes."  And he said, "And I'm white?" And she said, "Yes."  He said, "I'm not gonna be able to come back here anymore." And so his parents pretty much just drove a wedge between what he loved and my mother. The unfortunate part is that he lost, you know, he lost because of that.  But even before my mother died if she was in the grocery store he would always--because the thing that was interesting is all of us went on to some kind of further education or college, but the children of the sharecroppers, none of them did, and so this young man's name was Jamie [ph.] and Jamie was working in the grocery store and even when he sees my mother he'd just smile.  It was a sheepish kind of smile, but always acknowledging her presence, but that was something, it just stuck with me because adults are really the culprits in all of this.  If they would stop, you know, setting these thoughts in their children's mind and allowing them to develop, it would be such a different world.
Speaker 1: I absolutely agree with you.  If there's nothing else, then I'd like to thank you so much for taking time out of your very busy schedule to share your story with The HistoryMakers and with the world and we just really appreciate you taking the time.
Speaker 2: Well thank you, I, I, I hope I brought some value and, and I hate that I, so many things I couldn't remember or had specifics, but you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. It's fine.
Speaker 2: But thank you.
Story_ID: 638332
Speaker 1: Before we leave, you are involved in some other organizations that you volunteer your time on boards and have received a number of awards.  Talk to me about those things that are important to you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. Well, some areas that I am extremely passionate about and I try to work in and volunteer in the city or organizations that are youth oriented and those that are focused on seniors.  The Southwest Atlanta Youth Business Organization [Atlanta, Georgia] is an organization that teaches young people, age seven years old all the way up to twenty-one, on how to be entrepreneurs and there is an entire full scale program so I've worked with them for many years, and they've presented the advocate of the year award to me two, a couple of times actually I received that award.  Concerned Black Clergy [Concerned Black Clergy of Metropolitan Atlanta, Inc.] which is an organization of pastors here in metro Atlanta [Georgia] have presented the President's Award to me for my leadership here in the city and I've with them on various instances, I remember when we were having the fight here in Atlanta with affirmative action program as it relates to business being able to do business, African American business to get business from the City of Atlanta and Concerned Black Clergy was actively involved in that so the president presented his award, the President's Award to me for that.  Rolling Out magazine has recognized me as one of Atlanta's twenty-five most influential black women.  Most recently and in 2009, the Atlanta Business Chronicle named me as one of Atlanta's 100 most influential black people here in metro Atlanta because my role with the Atlanta Business League [Atlanta, Georgia].  And I have a list awards that I'm just very proud of.  There is a gentlemen that I'm sure you all know called George Fraser [HistoryMaker George Cylie Fraser] and George Fraser said in a speech one time, he was thanking the president of an organization for calling on him and inviting him to speak and he made the statement that, "When you find yourself not being used, it might mean that others have deemed you useless," and that's something that's really stuck with me over the years and so when others, you know, are thankful and thank me for work that they see that I'm doing or for the outreach that I'm making in their area or in reaching out to people, I'm really proud about that because I know that it's the thing that I should be doing.  It's the rent I pay for being here and so with those awards and, and, and there are several others, I am just honored and humbled by my name being called.
Story_ID: 638333
Speaker 1: You mentioned that you joined the church when you went to college [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina]. Do you have an affiliation in Atlanta [Georgia] with the church (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, yes.  I am a member of Antioch Baptist Church North [Atlanta, Georgia].  Reverend Cameron Madison Alexander is the pastor there and he has been the pastor for forty plus years.  He is a civil rights activist and just a good solid leader in metro Atlanta.  We've built a complex if you will at Antioch where we truly serve people who are needed and who are in need, not only, you know, from a physical vantage point but from their religious standpoint and the church is just a wonderful church and Reverend Alexander is a powerful leader.
Story_ID: 638334
Speaker 1: You talked about affirmative action and your part in that.  What was the outcome of that (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The outcome of the affirmative action fight that took place under the leadership of Mayor Bill Campbell was that the program was rewritten.  It was rewritten so that it was still inclusive of African American and minority business owners, but it was a different kind of outreach where there wasn't a quota, there is a requirement for businesses to lead the major contractors to work to do business with a small business owner.  There has to be a small level of participation, so the terminology changed.  There is not a quota.  There is not a percentage, but they must work to do business with a minority and African American or female business owner.  And it's a continuous work in progress because those programs are being challenged around the country and here are many who do not believe they need to exist, but we know that they do.  They need to exist because left unmonitored, there are many small business owners, African American business owners, female business owners who would not have a chance to do business at all because people do business with people they know.  And right or wrong that's what they do.  And so we have to find a way to be inclusive and if we're going to change the landscape of the economics, everyone should have an opportunity to do better and to do business where they work, live and play.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is there anything else?
Speaker 2: That's good, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Thank you.
