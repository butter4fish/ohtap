Story_ID: 260779
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Welton Flynn] side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Inez, I-N-E-Z, Willis, W-I-L-L-I-S, Flynn, F-L-Y-N-N.
Speaker 1: Okay and how far back can you trace your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: I can't trace it very far, but my son can to her birth, and we've given you a chart to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Incidentally, what is her birthdate and birthplace?
Speaker 2: My mother was born September 1st, 1900 in Blackville, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: In--I'm sorry where?
Speaker 2: Blackville, B-L-A-C-K-S-V-I-L-L-E [sic.], South Carolina, Blackville.
Speaker 1: Okay.  South Carolina, okay.  Is there a historic significance to that name in South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Not that I'm aware of.  It was a small town, basically African Americans.
Speaker 1: That's what I'm thinkin' it might--Blackville, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know whether or not that name came from that, but that's--I never asked that question, fascinating.  But it was--that was its name, Blacksville.
Speaker 1: Yeah it sounds like there is some kind of connection.  I know there's a Black River in South Carolina too, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I never thought about that, now you've stimulated my interest, I'll have to try to figure that out.
Speaker 1: Yeah, South Carolina being one of the states where blacks outnumbered whites for many years and may still today, I don't know.  Okay, and--well so do you--did your--are there any stories about your ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Not that I'm--I'm particularly aware of.  My mother was a school teacher, sort of unique for her time, but chose not to teach after she married my father.  She just wanted to have babies, of which she had twelve.  So I'm not aware of any unusual events.  She's just my mamma.
Speaker 1: Okay, well it doesn't have to be unusual, it could be a favorite story, somethin' fun even there, you know?
Speaker 2: I'm--I'm writing a book right now and I've been asked to talk about what I remember about my mother.  And what I remember about her is she was devoted to her family, enjoyed cooking, was excellent at it and fed everybody.  I'm mean, that's my vivid memory of her at the stove making food, cooking and serving anybody who came to her door.  Which I, as I matured, think of an expression of love.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know where she went to school, and you know?
Speaker 2: She went to school in Blackville, South Carolina and some little junior college at the time, but I really, unfortunately, don't have all those facts.  I may be able to fill them in, because I know that my son does have them.  Because he's made numerous trips to South Carolina checking archives and doing pictures of tombstones and tracing our family history back to the beginning of the census taking.  So he may have some answers that I don't have.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or that he gave me and I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Did--was her family like--were there a lot of schoolteachers in the family or were they mostly farmers or?
Speaker 2: No my mother was--had one--had one other sister who was a schoolteacher and a sister who was a nurse.  Her brothers were just workers.  They did well.  My grandfather raised asparagus.  He has some asparagus farms.  So they were, I guess, kinda low-middle income, not absolutely in poverty or at a poverty level or at a high level, high economic level.  So I think that who they became educationally had to do with my grandfather's ability to support their education.
Story_ID: 260780
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name was Welton, W-E-L-T-O-N, Alfonso, A-L-F-O-N-S-O, Flynn, F-L-Y-N-N.
Speaker 1: And what's his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: January 3rd, 1895 in Williston, W-I-L-L-S-T-O-N [sic.], South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was the town next to Blackville [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No the story I was told was the he was dating my aunt and became attracted to my mother [Inez Willis Flynn].  And that was--the history was us after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now what do you know about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Probably very little.  Again my son can and you know, we can fill these in if that's--if that's possible.  And I did give you a kind of lineage of how--how I became part of who my mother and father are.  But I can't trace that for you because, quite frankly, since he had it and archiving it, I just left it there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I noticed on the--on the family tree, the name Flynn is spelled different ways--
Speaker 2: My father changed it.
Speaker 1: --Flint and then--
Speaker 2: Daddy left South Carolina and originally went to Washington [D.C.] and for whatever reasons he changed the I to a Y and we became Flynn.  Still in our family I have some cousins who still spell their name Flinn, F-L-I-N-N, and still others who spell their name F-L-I-N-E-S.  So there're several different spellings of the name which I understand came from an Irish background.
Speaker 1: Right.  In fact the first name of the earliest ancestor on the chart, his first name was Flint.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) His last name was somethin' else.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Then everyone else became a Flynn after that.
Speaker 2: Right.  Daddy changed it and when he did, everybody else kind of varied their spellings of who they were.  But if you see us, you'll know we all came from the same genes.  We all are tall, we all about the same complexion, we look alike, we relate, but the names are different.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now did your father talk about growin' up in--yeah?
Speaker 2: My father talked about growing up only in the regard that it was difficult to earn a living as a black man.  And he moved about a lot originally.  He left South Carolina, went to Washington, left Washington went to St. Augustine, Florida and eventually ended up in Jacksonville [Florida] where I was born and where our family matured.  But I think that was chasin' work more than anything else.
Speaker 1: What kind of work did he do usually?
Speaker 2: Common labor.  When we were in school, my father was a janitor in the post office and the bank and the church because they were all like a block apart.  And after school my mother would make his dinner and we would take it to him because he was walking late--working late into the night.  So we would take dinner to him and sit with him and spend time with him because we may very well have been asleep when he came home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there a--let's see okay--so he moved to Jacksonville, was he--was he married at the time he moved to Jacksonville?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  He and my mother were married.  Oh yeah they were married very, very young.  I think my mother was maybe just at her nineteenth birthday.  They married in South Carolina and she went with him from place to place.  I have a brother, the product of that marriage, who is celebrating his eighty-fifth birthday this year.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they're long livers, they live a long time.  My dad died at eighty-five, my mother died at seventy-five, and she was considered young because her sisters lived to ninety, ninety-three, and one to 106.  But, yeah, they were together almost sixty years before her death.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, did you know your grandparents on both sides (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No I did not.  No.  I vaguely knew my grandfather on my father's side, but not the others.  They were dead before we were old enough to remember, probably in our very, very early years.
Story_ID: 260781
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters did you say you had?
Speaker 2: I had--my mother [Inez Willis Flynn] had twelve births.  I grew up with eight children because there was some stillborns along the way.
Speaker 1: And you are?
Speaker 2: I'm number six living of the eight.
Story_ID: 260782
Speaker 1: Now you were born in Jacksonville [Florida].  Can, can--do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I grew up in a small little, what my sociology professor calls a village where everybody took care of everybody's children, disciplined everybody's children, didn't lock their doors.  And spent most of my time in church or school.  We did one, we had one social event outside of the church and we were allowed to go to the movie on Saturday afternoon if we had done all of our chores on Saturday morning.  But I grew up sort of like a nerdy kid, church all day on Sunday, a scholar and so I studied a lot.  Graduated at the top of every class I ever stepped into.  But I don't remember hardship.  I remember being loved a lot.  Enjoying my dad [Welton Flynn] a lot.  I had a very, very close relationship with my father.  And kind of being an obedient child, nothing spectacular, just peacefully.
Story_ID: 260783
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growin' up?
Speaker 2: Well there weren't a lot of sights.  We lived--our little village was sort of rural from the urban part of the city [Jacksonville, Florida].  So there were woods, you know, walkin' through the woods, dirt roads, singing.  We lived in a little community of staunch Baptist and I guess one of my fondest memories is being pulled around in a red wagon with my Sunday school teacher who sold peanuts in little bags.  She used to make little bags of peanuts and she sold 'em to the neighbors to collect money so that she could buy clothes and toys for children at Christmastime.  And she didn't have--she had a son, but she had no daughters and there were so many of us my mother [Inez Willis Flynn] didn't mind her kind of her pulling me around in this wagon.  So I think one of my fondest memories is riding down--around dirt roads in a red wagon with this darling woman selling these peanuts.  Her name was Miss Adeline [Brown (ph.)].  She taught me the Bible.  She taught me how to pray.  She taught me to understand that a relationship with God was more critical than anything else.  And we used to put up a Christmas tree in the church.  She taught me how to teach Sunday school.  And I spent a good bit of time with my godmother, who also didn't have any children, and she taught me things about beauty.  If you had known her you could look at my condo and know that she had some impact on me.  So I spent a lot of time with those two women and I guess they're my mentors.  They sort of made me who I am.
Story_ID: 260784
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school you attended?
Speaker 2: In grade school it was Douglas Anderson Elementary School [Douglas Anderson School; Douglas Anderson School of the Arts, Jacksonville, Florida].  In high school it was Stanton High School [Jacksonville, Florida].  At the time that I was in high school, schools were segregated and there was one high school for black kids in Stanton--in Jacksonville [Florida] and it was Stanton High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have any idea who Douglas Anderson was?
Speaker 2: He was a resident of the community who gave a lot to our little area what--which was known as Southside of Jacksonville.  And the school was named for him after his death.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this was a black man from the community?
Speaker 2: Yes, a black man.  Educator who gave a lot to--to children and to the community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's often the case, but it's amazin' to me sometimes that people don't know who their--their schools are named for.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, fortunately Douglas Anderson had children who eventually went to those--went to that school and he was like a pillar in the community so you almost couldn't grow up in that community and not know who he was and his contributions to many families.
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you were in grade school, I mean, how would you describe yourself?  Now you said you were very studious and?
Speaker 2: Anti-social, kind of.
Speaker 1: Anti-social?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Kinda didn't do anything but study.  I--I think of myself as, and I've coined the word lately as nerd, but I'm very shy.  I'm still shy.  But I was shy at that point to being almost reclusive.  Studying, interacting or becoming engaged when I needed to.  But I spent a lot of time in my head.  And so that--I wasn't very outgoing as a child.  I had two very good friends in high school, one of which lives--still lives, the other one has gone on, and we still communicate.  But there wasn't a lot of friends.  I tended to, in high school, spend time with boys and that was because I was interested in math and for some reason so were they.  And I have one high school friend, she and I used to study together.  She was valedictorian of our high school graduating class and I was salutatorian.  So we used to study together all of the time and sort of helped the guys in the class with things that they didn't know.  But I have always been and remain a serious student, and spent a lot of time reading.  And I probably have interacted with people more as a mature adult than I ever did in my life.  And I still prefer solitude.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what were your favorite books then?  Did you have?
Speaker 2: The Bible.  It was the first one I read, it's the one that I read the most now.  All of the classics, I guess, I read because I had to because people said to me, you have to read those.  But the Bible to me is the most important book.  I read things that are derivative of the Bible, but I live with it.  And that's been so since I could recognized words.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when-- high school, I guess, now were you involved in activities at school other than studying and a?
Speaker 2: Actually not (laughter).  In high school I spent a little bit of time with what we called safety patrol, you know, helping people out around the school and helping people find their way, sort of like a tour guide for new students, that kind of thing.  But if you ask anybody about me during those days, and especially my sisters, they would say she just read all the time and that's, that's what I did.
Story_ID: 260785
Speaker 1: It seems to me you were probably active in church, I guess (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay and what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Jerusalem [Missionary] Baptist Church [Jacksonville, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay and, and what did you do at church?
Speaker 2: From when I was probably ten or eleven years old, I was the secretary of the Sunday school, sang in the choir, taught Sunday school (unclear).  And helped Miss Adeline [Brown (ph.)] sell peanuts and raise money for kids or Christmas.
Speaker 1: Now you did--that's a lot, you know.  The only thing left is to preach I think.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well you know, I guess at some point I might--would have been able to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, who was your minister?
Speaker 2: At the time when I was growing up his name was Reverend Saul Cooper.  A little guy, as close to a saint as one could be.  We used to always laugh that when Reverend Cooper walked down the street the drunks stood up straight because they didn't want him to (laughter) want him to see 'em drunk.  He was--he and my mother [Inez Willis Flynn] and father [Welton Flynn] were very close and very devoted to each other so he spent a lot of time in our house.  And he died shortly after I went to college [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  So actually I grew up with him as a little kid into my teenage years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he had that kind of internal authority so that people respected him?
Speaker 2: Yeah he did, he did.  And it was always fascinating to me, and even more so now, that he was very short and very thin in physical stature, but his spiritual persona was like the Eiffel Tower [Paris, France].  And I mean everybody respected him.  I mean, even the craziest person spoke highly of him.  And he reared three or four daughters, all who were schoolteachers, and went on to do wonderful things and taught many of us.  So he was really a very, very strong role model to those of us in the community.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: And so he drew us into the church by his behavior.
Story_ID: 260786
Speaker 1: You grew up during, I guess, a time period that Zora Neale Hurston writes about in Florida now, you know.  And do you draw any similarities, can you see any similarities to what she writes about and how you grew up in 'Their Eyes Were Watching God,' and other pieces that she writes--she wrote?
Speaker 2: Not, not so much for me personally.  I don't disagree with what she wrote, but I don't--I--I'm not moved into it if I can use that terminology, but I think what she writes is factual.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Did you like music growin' up?
Speaker 2: Yeah I did, I still do.  I--my choices are spiritual movies--music and classics.  My favorite composer is [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart.  And if you weren't talkin' to me right now, that's what you'd hear.  I play it all day, all the time.  I enjoyed from a youngster the opera and still do.  I like orchestra, at least to hear it on the radio when I was a kid and most of it at my godmother's house, 'cause that's what she did, she played music and made her house pretty.
Speaker 1: Is your godmother the same lady as the peanut (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As the peanut lady?  No two different ladies.
Speaker 1: Two different people, okay, that's right.
Speaker 2: Two different ladies.  Frankie Thompson [ph.] was my godmother and Adeline Brown [ph.] was the peanut lady.
Story_ID: 260787
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers in school that were particularly--
Speaker 2: Yes, Mrs. Black, Mrs. Vivian Black [ph.] in probably my third grade said to me that I had significant intellect and that I could do anything I wanted to do.  And she talked to my parents [Inez Willis Flynn and Welton Flynn] about having me skip a grade because she thought that I was so ahead of what was going on that I might get bored and they did.  And so it made me graduate from both high school [Stanton High School, Jacksonville, Florida] and elementary school [Douglas Anderson School; Douglas Anderson School of the Arts, Jacksonville, Florida] in half year, rather than a full year because they moved me forward a semester.  But she remained close to me until I went to college [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  And then there was one other teacher, Mrs. Timberlake [ph.], that I've--in--in public speaking, I often refer to me as my hors d'oeuvres teacher.  Because she used to go to social events on Sunday and her--we had early class with her on Monday and she would tell us what she ate.  And I remember her standing up one day and saying to us, last night I had hors d'oeuvres, spell it and then tell me what it was.  Because we were not poor in the sense that people usually think about poor, but we did not have a lot of social exposure.  So I always remember her hors d'oeuvres discussion and quite frankly can never eat one know without thinkin' about Ms. Timberlake.  She had a great need to have us learn and behave in an acceptable social manner.  And taught us how to dress and not to call attention to yourself by being out of line with what the social structure said you should be.  As a matter of fact, I might even describe her as rigid in that regard.  But she had a great impression, a great impact on me.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was an English teacher.  And then there was Miss Curry [ph.], who was my trigonometry teacher and I think stimulated my interest in math.  It was just fascinating to me how much she knew and how she could do it.  And so I hung out with her a lot because I wanted to learn what it was she had to teach and she encouraged me to--she and another high school teacher, Miss Curry encouraged me to go to college.
Story_ID: 260788
Speaker 1: When you were a senior in high school [Stanton High School, Jacksonville, Florida], I mean what were your college prospects?  Did you know where you were gonna go at that point?
Speaker 2: I did not.  I ended up at Tuskegee University [Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama] because a couple of people ahead of me, a grade ahead of me were in Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: So you knew some people that were already there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My choices were not really very broad or very extensive.  I--I considered Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], and opted not to go to Florida A&M because that was almost my entire high school class.  That's almost where everybody went.  And I went to Tuskegee because there were, I think, maybe five other people that I knew from school there already.  And at the time, their nursing school was highly rated and I had been encourage--encouraged by my father [Welton Flynn] to be a doctor and I didn't wanna do that.  So to kinda compromise, I wanted to go in nursing.  And so Tuskegee had one of the top rated schools at the time and Mrs. Curry [ph.] assisted me with looking at that and so I arrived at Tuskegee.  And Tuskegee's tuition was affordable to my brothers who really paid it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well that's really something, your brothers paid your tuition?
Speaker 2: My brothers paid my tuition.  One of them I spoke to this morning.  Tuition at the time at Tuskegee was about $225 a quarter, 'cause we were on a quarter system.  And they raised the money to do it.
Speaker 1: That's something, now--
Speaker 2: One of which is dead.  And they drove me to school from home every time I went home and they came to get me every time.  I was never--I never traveled on the train or anything because Tuskegee was remote and they felt that something might happen to me.  But my two brothers raised money and my father really filled in because they--they did it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my older brother, the one I mentioned of eighty-five, now probably had the biggest burden of the finances because he was older at the time and you know, successful.  He is now a very successful businessman, but even then, he was beginning to so.  So he--he and his wife did a lot of it and I worked part of the other time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how far away was Tuskegee from home?
Speaker 2: Probably about four hundred--three--three or four hundred miles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It took them seven or eight hours to drive, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah those were the days when you couldn't go real fast I guess on the road?
Speaker 2: No, no.  And my brother that I spoke to this morning used to get tickets, because he would drive fast.  And the South was not friendly to black men, especially young black men and it was always a real worry to my mother [Inez Willis Flynn] and father when he was doing the driving because he was a bit undisciplined as a young man and he would just want to see how fast the car could go.  So it was of some concern to my parents every time he came to get me because they expected that somebody might put him in jail and you know, something bad might happen to him.  But nevertheless, he only got one ticket that I recall and we laughed about that most recently.
Story_ID: 260789
Speaker 1: When you were comin' up before I take you to college, what were race relations like in Blacksville [sic. Blackville, South Carolina] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dreadful, dreadful.  You mean Jacksonville [Florida]?
Speaker 1: Yeah Jacksonville, right, right.
Speaker 2: Dreadful.  So much so until there was occasion when my father [Welton Flynn] sent one of sisters with my brothers to be sure that they were just not alone.  We lived in segregated areas of the city.  We rode in the back of the bus.  We were limited in what we said because there was a fear that if you said too much you would be arrested.  Not the women so much, but the men.  Black women, for the most part except for those people who were teaching or--or nursing, were domestics.  They either did laundry in their homes or they went to white people's houses and, and did the work one way or the other.  But while they could do those things in their homes, they were never afforded the opportunity to sit at the counters or do the same things that other people could.  So it was pretty terrible.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The interesting thing about that, if I had to think about it, they didn't seem to think it was terrible.  I mean they--
Speaker 1: Mean the black community or the--
Speaker 2: --yeah.  They knew what was expected and as I reflected on that a lot in my adult years, they knew the expectations and they met them.  So there was not as much pain as we saw in the '60s [1960s].
Story_ID: 260790
Speaker 1: You graduated from high school [Stanton High School, Jacksonville, Florida], was it 1950 or?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And you were valedictorian you said?
Speaker 2: Salutatorian.
Speaker 1: Salutatorian.
Speaker 2: Salutatorian.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah I was the second highest both in high school and--junior high school and high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  SO, well how did you like Tuskegee [Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?  Did you have a chance to visit before you actually enrolled or did you?
Speaker 2: No.  I enrolled through the mail, arrived at Opelika, Alabama because on that occasion by brother did not--my brothers did not drive me, I went on the train.  And Opelika has a very--did have a one-room train station for black people to arrive in, probably about the size of this room.  There was a picture of Booker T. Washington because most of the students, most of the people arriving were going to Tuskegee.  And there were two or three cab drivers who always met the train almost as their mission or ministry to get students to Tuskegee campus.  And one of those men took me to Tuskegee campus to where I had been told to arrive.  I think at the time that I went to college, visiting colleges were--was not so common for--for us.  Our teachers helped us identify the colleges, get through the admissions process or the application process and gave us a little briefing about what we're supposed to do.  And for those young people whose parents can afford it, their parents ended up takin' them.  My parents [Inez Willis Flynn and Welton Flynn] could not.  And so I made the journey alone.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So well what did you think of Tuskegee, what was your first impression of Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Comfort.  Tuskegee for me was a very nurturing environment that permitted me to be myself and learn at the same time.  I go back on vacation occasionally because I like it that much.  I came of age at Tuskegee in understanding a number of things, one of which was race relationships.  And Dean [Charles G.] Gomillion was very active in the [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] plight.
Story_ID: 260791
Speaker 1: The chapel at Tuskegee [Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] was torched by the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] at the time that I was there and we watched from our dormitory windows as the chapel was destroyed by fire.  And it was done because of Dean [Charles G.] Gomillion's active participation in civil rights.  And I think what that lesson taught me was that what you believe in you have to stand for.  In ways that, only in my sixties did I realize what an impact that had made on me, that he didn't back down.  He was not killed; he lived to a nice old age.
Speaker 2: So what year was this when the--when the chapel was torched?
Speaker 1: See I graduated from Tuskegee in '54 [1954], so it must have been '52 [1952] or so [sic. 1957].  And a new one was built in its place, but those windows in that chapel had been made by the students and so they were priceless collections.  It was a significant pain for all of us.  But I think that as a community, as a culture within Tuskegee, while losing the chapel the lasting lesson is the one that I tell you about right now.  And for us--for those of us in nursing it was more vivid, because the chapel happened to sit diagonally from our dormitory window.  So we could stand in the window and see those flames.  And next to it were people's graves like George Washington Carver and Booker T. Washington, and the Moats [ph.] and the Mortons [sic. Motons], all of which who were the founders and stabilizers of Tuskegee.  So as that chapel burned, we could also see the stuff falling on their graves.  It was a powerful experience, but when the pain subsided it left most of us with the courage to do what we must and to do it without rancor because that's what Dean Gomillion did.
Speaker 2: Now the chapel was burnt.  This is like prior to the activities of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] actually, '52 [1952] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 2: So Dean Gomillion, was he involved in civil rights activities on his own in Tuskegee [Alabama] in the Alabama area?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was. Yeah, he was kind of like a rebel.
Speaker 2: I just wanna make sure he gets the credit that he (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He deserves it.  It's a very--and he was dean of students and I don't quite know the history of what he did to bring on this, excuse me, anger but it did.  But the community of Tuskegee, as well as the board was in great support of what he did--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and was way ahead of, of, of King's activity.  But he then participated in King's activity when it did start.  So it was mid-'50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Was there any discussion about, now you may or may not know this. but was there any discussion about actually what happened that night, did somebody see anyone come on campus (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.  I don't know that.  All I know and as I--it's as vivid to me now as it was then, I can see the flames.  But we really, I was not privy to any information of how it happened.  I don't even recall that I heard rumor.  I just know that it happened.
Story_ID: 260792
Speaker 1: Sort of a little plaza there sort of with a statue of Booker T. [Washington], then you have the graves of Booker T. and--
Speaker 2: And the chapel sits right there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: There're the graves, the chapel and then the lifting of the veil that Booker T. does that says, "Let no man drag me down so far as to make me hate him," is right there.
Speaker 1: Okay, well.  At that time--I imagine at that time there was the little museum that's there, there was the works of George Washington Carver was--
Speaker 2: George Washington Carver Museum [Tuskegee, Alabama], it was there.  Yeah and down in the valley, sits down in the--you have to go down a couple of steps to--to get down to it.  But that was not destroyed, and to my knowledge, not ever attacked.
Speaker 1: Yeah, was it impressive I guess that's what I'm askin' and for you to go and you know, to--I think for a lot of people that go to Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] that go to that little museum and they see the works of Carver.
Speaker 2: I think everyb--everything about Tuskegee [Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] was then and is now impressive to me.  I think I could honestly say that most of my public service, the motivation for it, was formulated while I was at Tuskegee.  It matured when I moved here.
Speaker 1: Okay now, was Monroe Work still alive then, do you know?
Speaker 2: What's his name?
Speaker 1: Monroe Nathan Work.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah he was a--like a--he published this African handbook ['Negro Year Book: An Annual Encyclopedia of the Negro'] or encyclopedia type book every year which was a monumental task and he did it every year for a number of years.
Speaker 2: I was impressed with--I guess, one of the learning lessons for me from Tuskegee is how much you can do with little.  Because many people earn their living off the land, but you never felt deprived.  And I think that that left quite an impression for me.
Story_ID: 260793
Speaker 1: You were in the nursing--the School of Nursing [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, School of Nursing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how was that, I mean how did you?
Speaker 2: Well that's an interesting question.  The hospitals in the South at that time were so segregated that Dean Lillian [Holland] Harvey concluded that she would not tolerate having us have our clinical experience in segregated hospitals.  So she arranged affiliations for us in the northeastern United States and I received my medical/surgical nurse training and pediatric clinical experience at Morrisania Hospital in--in the Bronx [New York, New York], and my psychiatric experience in Brooklyn [New York, New York].  She was a New Yorker, she was a graduate of Lincoln [School for Nurses, New York, New York] and New York University [New York, New York] and she had contacts and relationships with other nurses.  Our classes were small.  My class was twenty in the beginning and thirteen of us graduated.  So it was reasonably easy for us to place us.  So what we did, we were six and six.  Six came to New York [New York] while six was in the academic side and six weeks changed places for--for our experiences.  But she was adamant that we would not be treated in a segregated manner.  So she brought us to the northeastern part of the New Yor--the United States to get our experience.  We also did our psychiatric experience in the VA Hospital [Tuskegee Veteran Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus] of Tuskegee [Alabama], which was probably one of the largest employers at the time in Macon County [Alabama] and--
Speaker 1: So this is--I take this is a segregated--
Speaker 2: VA?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was then, I don't know what it is now.  But there were  (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh I don't think it would be now, but I--
Speaker 2: Yeah it was huge.  I don't want to repeat a number 'cause my memory may fail me, but somehow I think it was close to five or six thousand beds at the time.  Huge place, I mean it was like a community all to itself.
Speaker 1: So did they take in VA patients from all over the South (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Veterans (unclear) from all over the South and who had any kind of mental illness, and--and we did our clinical experience there.  So we didn't get into--we as students didn't get into very much racial abuse because Dean Harvey was so protective.  She just wouldn't permit it.  And at that time, there were not men, so she was especially concerned about, as she used to say, people's daughters.
Story_ID: 260794
Speaker 1: This morning there was a piece on the History channel about the history of blacks in the [U.S.] military.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And they talked about World War I [WWI] and [World War] II [WWII], and the horrible experiences of black soldiers here and abroad.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean, I could just imagine that the VA Hospital [Tuskegee Veteran Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama] down there had like--did you hear any stories of people or what happened?
Speaker 2: Well there--I think what is, as you're talking to me and I'm pulling forth the memory, what was very worrisome to me was that how many black men had been damaged by the war and were really out of their minds.  I don't know from a clinical perspective whether the experiences they had in the [U.S.] Army did it or where it came from, I just know they were.  And I mean violent to the point that when we, as students, worked with him--them we were accompanied to the patient's bedside by two people bigger than ourselves so that the patient would not harm us.  And so those men for the nursing students became like bodyguards, even though they were psychiatric--called psychiatric attendants.  But it was painful how many black men were there.  My husband [James Brisbon] was a World War II veteran and he often told me stories about how they were treated, especially outside of the continent of United States.  So my experience at Tuskegee [Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and my long journey with him kind of gives me a picture of how soldiers were treated, less than human sometimes.
Story_ID: 260795
Speaker 1: Now there's another ugly aspect of Tuskegee [Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] that--
Speaker 2: Is the experiment [Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male].
Speaker 1: Right and being in the nursing school [School of Nursing], did you hear any inkling of that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually that Tuskegee experience was not so much a part of our training because we were at John [A.] Andrew [Memorial] Hospital [Tuskegee, Alabama], which for the time, was an elite black institution because everybody there was so educated and--and clustered.  It was a small hospital.  The research that was done on the citizens of Tuskegee [Alabama] was done by the government and as not necessarily sanctioned, known or understood by John Andrew Hospital.  I cannot say that for the VA [Tuskegee Veteran Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama].  I just don't know.  But it was not a part of John Andrew.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So did you ever--was the nurse there, a Miss Evers [Eunice Rivers Laurie], was she--was she there when you were around?
Speaker 2: No, didn't know her.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Dean [Lillian Holland] Harvey, a woman by the name of Mrs. [Queen] Esther [Knight] Carter were our guiders among our nursing professors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All black women of considerable education, even at that time Ph.D.s.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well but anybody--I mean was it in the air, did people talk about that at all in the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: No, I learned about Tuskegee experiment in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  But I having done public health nursing in Macon County [Alabama] in the rural area of Tuskegee, I can understand how people would have been misled and how they would have been subjected to what was reported to have happened.  While not observing it or being a part of it, it is certainly within reason to me how it was done.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you mean that--well what do you mean by that in terms of the within reason?
Speaker 2: Because people could be easily misled, very trusting and would have participated in whatever anybody said was likely to help them without really having the capacity to ask a whole lot of questions.  You need to understand that in the rural of Tuskegee, probably most of those people had not been any further than town in all of their lives.  And so and you can see my anger getting up about that.  If you said something to them they believed it.  I know that from my public health experience.  Fortunately, we didn't do any bag things.  But they were so glad to have people come and offer services that they would have responded in ways that ended up being very detrimental to many of them.
Speaker 1: Yeah I think there's even a story that Charles Spurgeon Johnson, who became president of Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] at one time, wrote an article about it and he was--he was basically blinded to what was actually goin' on himself, you know, and a lot of people--
Speaker 2: I think that I can easily see--as a mature adult I can see how that would have happened.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's a lot of people trust in government too.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep.  And people in need of help and believing that it was in--it was the right thing in front of them because they were not given full disclosure.
Story_ID: 260796
Speaker 1: Let me flip to the happy part of Tuskegee [Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] (laughter).  Did you--how was your social life at Tuskegee, did you ever?
Speaker 2: Pretty good.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause I know your serious and everything, but did you have fun at Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: At the time that I was at Tuskegee I wouldn't say it was a fun place.  We were expected to be in at a certain time and I don't remember whether it was six or eight o'clock.  But you couldn't go out of the dormitory without signing out and signing in after dark.  You could not leave the campus without written permission from your parent or guardian.  You were required to go to chapel twice on Sunday.  And at that time march in an assembly line according to class from the cafeteria to the chapel.  You were expected to go to chapel on Wednesday nights.  And the social activity was basically football, basketball, sororities, fraternities.  I'm not a sorority person.  Not enamored with sports.  So I guess I've been a continuous kind of loner reader person.  Have friends, classmates that I'm still in touch with.  And before I graduated they thought it would be well to drop me out of the window 'cause I was one of the students who had not slipped in at night.
Speaker 1: To drop you out of the window?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we had this--people would go out and the door got locked at a certain time and we had to arrange to get them back in the dormitory.  So we got them in the windows on the basement level of the dormitory.  And since I had--me and one other classmate had never done that, they thought it would be wise to drop us out the window to put us in just to be sure that we were full members of the class (laughter).  So, no, I--I think Larry [Crowe] that I have been consistent in my life.  I still am a person who--who just--fun for me is being able to go to the opera or read a book or spend some time with my family.  It's always been that way and it still is.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you weren't tempted at all to join a sorority?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, I guess, my sister says I'm old fashioned and maybe that's true.  Activity has always been for me purposeful.  And if it has no real purpose that I can define, while I'm not critical of other people doing it, it is not something that I wanna do.
Speaker 1: Well you know they--the argument they always give the black fraternities or sororities, no matter how much they're having, they say that they are a service organization first and foremost (unclear).
Speaker 2: May very well be, I just never felt I had to be a part of anything to give service.  Service for me is an act of love and giving.  And I can do that from any perspective.  I don't really need a structure to do that.
Story_ID: 260797
Speaker 1: I guess was it your senior year that you went to the Bronx [New York, New York] and to New York [New York] to take training (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Second, junior year.
Speaker 1: Junior year?
Speaker 2: Yeah junior year.  Late sophomore, early junior and most of the junior year was spent off campus.
Speaker 1: Now what was--was that a shock goin' from Jacksonville [Florida] and Tuskegee [Alabama] to the Bronx and Brooklyn [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh.  But the--I guess the only word I can think of is the protection of Dean [Lillian Holland] Harvey, moved us from place to place without really feelin' like you were moved because the rules at Tuskegee [Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] were applied in New York.  Because she had this--she had daughters herself and she had this very personal commitment that nothing would happen to us.  For me, I saw a lot more of New York because a large part of my father's [Welton Flynn] family lived in New York.  And so I got to see a lot of New York and I had a good time in New York.  I got to shop and go to theater and go to movies and spend time with them.  But that wasn't universally true.  But all of my father's nieces were in New York and when they learned I was there they embraced me.  I also had a first cousin there who, on my mother's [Inez Willis Flynn] side, she and her husband made sure that I was okay, you know, outside of the dormitory.  But when I went to school, women who taught us were very responsible and felt that they had to take care of us.  So there were a lot of rules, there were a lot of rules, and for the most part, we followed them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you--okay well did you learn--what's the most, I guess, significant thing you learned about New York, I mean, when you were there?  Did you, how did that like broaden your world sort of?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that it--it taught me something about diversity and how having come from Jacksonville through Tuskegee to go to New York and see people mingle without a whole lot rancor and live together was probably a meaningful learning experience.  That it didn't have to be separate and it didn't have to be struggled.  You didn't have to live with people to get along with them in the workplace or to get along with them in restaurants or whatever.  Because I don't recall having any racial incidents in New York, even in the late '50s [1950s].   They might have been there, we may have been protected, but riding the subway, riding the buses, walkin' down the street, doing whatever we were doing didn't feel like the South.  So I think that was--was--was a cautious learning experience about diversity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably is the biggest lesson that I learned in New York.
Story_ID: 260798
Speaker 1: At Tuskegee [Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], itself, did you have white instructors at Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: None?
Speaker 2: No.  As a matter of fact, I went back to Tuskegee to recruit when I still was working in nursing to recruit students for the university hospital [Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And I was stunned because one of my old instructors was still there and she was showing me around.  And there was a white guy in the chemistry class and there was a white woman in the nurse practice class.  And I said to her, why are they there.  And she said oh dear, its--they're teaching.  And so it was like, where have you been.  And they still called us by last names, like Miss Flynn [HistoryMaker Delores Brisbon], times have changed is--is what she said.  And they're--they're many there now, but there were none when I was there.  There were no white people in Tuskegee except the people on the board.  One of which at the time was a Rockefeller and one was Basil O'Connor.  And I remember them only because they gave such significant dollars for scholarships for black students.  But no there were no white people there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's in contrast with some of the schools like Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama] and I think Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Mississippi] actually had like--they were founded by the American Missionary Society [sic. American Missionary Association] and white teachers were actually on campus?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, not at Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And you--you--you know that Booker T. Washington came out of Hampton [Normal and Agricultural Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] to find Tuskegee for black students.  That's why it was there in Alabama because the Alabama folk couldn't get to Virginia.  And so he was commissioned to find the school in Tuskegee.  So it's not, I don't think, unexpected that the environment would be both educationally focused by black teachers or that the students would be black until the Civil Rights Movement when everything changed.
Story_ID: 260799
Speaker 1: You graduated in '54 [1954]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954], okay.  And when you were on the verge of graduation what was your next move, what were you plannin' to do?
Speaker 2: Well before I graduated from Tuskegee [Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] I had been offered a job at John [A.] Andrew [Memorial] Hospital [Tuskegee, Alabama] to teach operating room nursing.  So it was just not a thought for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you took a job at John Andrew right after graduation?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I worked at John Andrew from '54 [1954] probably until late '56 [1956] in many capacities.  This was a small hospital.  So if you were hired as a supervisor, you were a supervisor/teacher because you were expected to both supervise and teach students that were receiving their training.  And my first job was obstetrics and then I moved into obstetrics--I mean was operating room and then I moved into obstetrics, and then I became assistant to the director of nursing.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And from that job I was recruited to Dillard University's Flint-Goodridge Hospital [New Orleans, Louisiana] to serve as the director of nursing, a job which lasted just over two years.  And I became ill and went home to my parents [Inez Willis Flynn and Welton Flynn].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now so you became ill when you were at Dillard [University, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this must've been pretty bad to?
Speaker 2: I had hepatitis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Probably contacted from a patient.  I don't know where it came from, but that was the diagnosis, that was the speculation.  And I needed to rest for, they said, three to six months.  And so I went home.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you went home to Jacksonville [Florida] and--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh with my mom and dad.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what happened when you got well, had you planned to go back to Dillard or?
Speaker 2: I didn't know what I was gonna do (laughter).  So my Aunt Remell [ph.] came to visit my mother, my mother's sister.  And she said to me, why don't you come to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And I think she was there maybe in August.  By November I was in Philadelphia.  She took me to the university hospital and introduced me to the director of nursing and I was almost employed on the spot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a head nurse in neurology.
Speaker 1: At the--at the--
Speaker 2: University of Pennsylvania Hospital [Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: University of Pennsylvania Hospital, okay.
Speaker 2: At 34th [Street] and Spruce [Street].
Speaker 1: Now that's a big deal (laughter).  Penn is a big d--is a--
Speaker 2: The woman who is back there lookin' at my grandchild right now and I were the only two black nurses.  I met her in 1959 and we've been friends ever since.  We grew our children together.  Our husbands were great friends.  And the relationship started in the university hospital because we were the two--only two black nurses in university hospital.
Story_ID: 260800
Speaker 1: I don't wanna skip past anything.  Now you must've met your husband [James Brisbon] around this time too--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or just before that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah just before that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: I met him in a shoe shop (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I took my shoes to have some heels put on and we started a conversation.  And he challenged me to eat a foot long hot dog.  And I said I could do it and I couldn't.  And from that we just became good friends.  We really weren't lovers in the beginning--
Story_ID: 260376
Speaker 1: You got married in what, was it '50 [1950]?
Speaker 2: December the 15th, 1954.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you were--so that was in Tuskegee [Alabama]?  Is that--okay, all right.  So in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], you're at Penn [Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you're one of--were you the first black nurse?
Speaker 2: Dorothy West [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dorothy Clark [ph.](simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In the next room (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah the woman that I said was babysitting my grandchild.
Speaker 1: Okay we got to interview her too at some point.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But you were the second or?
Speaker 2: I think I was maybe the third.  There was another woman that came after Dorothy and then me, who was in Hibner's [ph.] jobs and there were probably two or three other black nurses, but there was less than a half dozen of us in 1959.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Out of how many, you know, would you say?
Speaker 2: Probably four hundred.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that puts it in perspective, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  University hospital at the time that I went there was just under a 1000-bed hospital.  And was seeing--was bringing in something like 20,000 or 25,000 people a year for care.  And then did then and now still has about a two-and-a-half block complex.  But there weren't very many black nurses there and as a matter of fact I would even go so far as to say there weren't a lot of black patients there unless they had unusual diseases.  I was--I accepted a position as head nurse on neurology and I may have had maybe two or three black patients out of twenty six on any one day.  And they really had unusual diseases like Guillain-Barre or Lou Gehrig syndrome [Lou Gehrig's disease; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)] or multiple grav--multiple gravatis [ph.] or something like that, they didn't just have a stroke which is a neurological condition.  Philadelphia General Hospital [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was right next door and Presbyterian[-University of Pennsylvania Medical Center; Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was stronger, which was in the immediate community.  We just didn't see it.  Mercy Douglass Hospital [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was still there at the time in West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  So we just didn't see a lot of black patents.
Speaker 1: Now the University of Pennsylvania hospital is more of a ex--is experimental kind of cutting edge kind of a place?
Speaker 2: It's a medical--it's a medical school research hospital.  And the patients that come there are people with very difficult diagnoses, although the obstetrical service is basically people from within five miles of the hospital.  And since within five miles to the north of University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], that's a huge black population.  That's where Dorothy spent her career with those patients and babies.
Story_ID: 260377
Speaker 1: Well what were your experiences there as a minority nurse?
Speaker 2: When I first came to university hospital [Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] I used to walk to work and so I wore street clothes.  So it was necessary to change from white stockings and hat and all of that.  And most often I had offensive notes left on my locker.  My stockings were--I had to start takin' 'em to wash them because they would just disappear.  And people would make, what they thought were polite, but they were offensive comments to me.  One that I remember very, very long time is one woman said to me, you know, I've never ever met anybody black doing anything other than takin' care of children in my community.  And without revenge I was very happy to fire her when I became the nursing supervisor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very happy to fire her.  She did some stuff that was close to unethical and I--I usually am a person who is very bothered when people's jobs are at risk, even if I have nothing to do with it.  I didn't feel a clue of anything but to tell her she should leave.  I'm not proud of that, but it seemed to bring justice to some of the behavior that I observed in her that was not necessarily about care, but discrimination.  So there was some painful experiences in the early years, but balanced against that, there were a number of very supportive people in positions of authority that kind of took care of balancing out the pain that I felt from others.
Story_ID: 260378
Speaker 1: How long did it--did you--now you rose from, you know, a nurse to the director of nursing.  How long a period of time was that?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: I mean how long a period of time did it take to become the director of nursing there?
Speaker 2: I never became the director of nursing there.  I became the chief operating officer of the whole shebang.
Speaker 1: Oh that's--okay, alright, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I--I ran the whole hospital [Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I--I went from head nurse to supervisor to strategic planner--
Speaker 1: I guess that's maybe where I'm confused.
Speaker 2: --to chief operating officer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So here a nurse does not mean you're?
Speaker 2: No the head nurse was a specific unit, twenty-six beds.  And then I went to head nurse of forty patients.  And then I became a director or a supervisor of two hundred patients.  And then I left that and became the planner and strategic leader for positioning the hospital and renovating it.  And then I became the chief operating officer and Ebony's article talks about the--the responsibility for $300 million research facility.  And at the time, I was the only black woman in America doing it.  That's why Ebony did the article.
Story_ID: 260379
Speaker 1: So you're CEO [sic. COO] of--of the [Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. Right, okay.
Speaker 2: And I did that for eight years.  And--
Speaker 1: So, but how long did it take to get from one--from when you started to becoming a CEO?
Speaker 2: From '59 [1959] to '79 [1979].  'Cause I was appointed in '79 [1979] as the chief operating officer, yeah '79 [1979].  Twenty years.  I spent twenty eight years of my life in the hospital at University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And needless to say, I guess we've already said it, but you were the first black woman to become the CEO of a hospital?
Speaker 2: As far as I know.  I don't know of--of that kind of hospital.  Now you realize that there are numbers of hospitals and Penn had had a woman before me, but they hadn't had a black woman.  They'd had one woman before me, a white woman who also was a nurse and her name was Elizabeth [C.] Berrang.  But of a medical school teaching hospital, University of Pennsylvania sits in a family of about six or eight elite hospitals in the United States.  So I think that the celebration of my appointment had to do with that elitism.  And the scope of responsibility that I had because I controlled the money, and that just didn't happen.  Not to speak of which, I was not educationally trained to be the kind of leader that the hospital required and that's why I say that the balance between the pain and the ugliness that happened in the early years came with people who recognized that there was something more that I could give to the institution and didn't let the color of my skin rule.  And it basically was a Jewish guy by the name of Mark Levitan, who is now dead and the dean of the medical school whose name was Edward [J.] Stemmler, or whose name is Edward Stemmler, and the president of the university who was Martin Meyerson, and the chairman of the board of the hospital, Samuel Ballam [Jr.].  Those men never seemed to pay attention to the fact that I was a black woman.  What they paid attention to was what I was doing for the hospital.  And that's, I think, is what you'll see in the Ebony article.  That's what brought Ebony to--to see me.

Speaker 1: What was the biggest, I guess, obstacle to becoming CEO [sic. COO]?
Speaker 2: I was never sure.  At my twenty-fifth year wedding anniversary when people from Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] came to celebrate with us, Claire [M.] Fagin, who was then the dean of school of nursing, said that I had a triple whammy that I overcame to run HUP, and that was I was black, female and a nurse.  And all of those would say that I shouldn't be where I was.  But--and I've always remembered that.  So I was never sure.  I can tell you that in many instances in which I had responsibility for making decisions, I could never tell whether the decision was challenged because I was a woman or because I was black.  I don't think it was ever challenged because I was a nurse, because there was a considerable amount of respect that I knew the business.  But there was significant challenge to something that as we talk, I still can't tell you what it was.  Whether it was because I was black or a woman, couldn't tell.  But because I was certain of what I was doing for the outcome of patients and because the board of trustees at the University of Pennsylvania supported and gave me their full authority, I was never necessarily inclined to try to figure out what it was.  I was focused on carrying out the responsibility that I accepted.  And that might have caused me a great deal of difficulty personally.  I mean in, inside of my person.  But I never failed the institution.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there any one incident that pops out of--?
Speaker 2: Yeah one that pops out is that I had a habit of making rounds to patient floors because I wanted to see for myself what was going on.  And on one such occasion, I happened to walk in a unit and I heard a loud voice and one other voice, not so loud, saying, "I'm sorry I didn't do that."  And I walked in and it was the chair, a male white guy from Kentucky, yelling at a black woman, who was a nursing assistant.  And he was reasonably loud.  And I walked over to him and I said, "I would like you to lower your voice."  And he said, "You can't tell me what to do."  I said, "But I can fire you.  Would you like to step into the utility room," and he did.  And I said, "I'm [HistoryMaker] Delores Brisbon."  And he said, "I didn't know who you were."  I said, "But you do now and that kind of behavior, regardless of what the woman did if she did anything, is unacceptable.  So you have to stop it."  And because I was not as mature then as I am now, I said to him, "You've probably haven't ever dealt with a black woman anyplace in your life other than in your kitchen.  I don't do my own kitchen and I don't permit that kind of behavior in my hospital."  He is one of the closest people, he sends me Christmas cards and pictures and oranges every year.  He is no longer working.  But that probably, the tone that I was able to maintain on my--in my voice and my ability to control my anger, I think was probably one of the most outstanding experiences in my mind.  There were many such occasions, but nothing as striking as that.  And I had to call one other physician, I probably had more problems with physicians then I did anybody else, who really was not doing his administrative responsibility at Penn [Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And I called him on it.  And he said I didn't have the authority to do anything about that and he went to see the dean.  And he said, "Yes she does, as long as you're in administration she can do whatever she wants."  He later retired from Penn, went to another university and most recently came back to interview me.  And his question was, "Are you still as tough as you were, wear silk dresses and smile, because you are understated but you're like steel."  I took from that comment that he still hadn't understood the issue.  So those are two kind of lasting impressions.  I still don't know whether that was because I was a woman, on either occasion, or I was black.  It--they are so cloudy I can't--I couldn't articulate it, but I do know that I was challenged.
Speaker 1: Do you ever think it's probably both or (laughter) at the same time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I think so.  But I really have to tell you, it didn't bother me a whole lot about what it was, I just felt that I had accepted a responsibility to do a job, I was well paid to do it, and I had to do what I needed to do to carry out that responsibility so I could live at peace with myself.  Other people's issues don't bother me a whole lot.  My issues are what I examine and try to resolve.
Story_ID: 260381
Speaker 1: What are you the most proud of in terms of your, your a--your tenure as a CEO [sic. COO] of a hospital?
Speaker 2: I don't know that I have any one single event.  I'd have to say to you that I think the proudest thing in my life is my children.  I've got two, absolutely up-front, wonderful human beings that nothing, anything else I've ever done pales to that.  So I think that I did outstanding work at--at the University [of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], but I think that everybody else did too.  I think that I set a culture of expectation for excellence.  I was clear about what I wanted and people who wanted to be excellent responded to it.  Those who did not opted out.  And I think as a result of that, the patients there under our care got excellent care and we managed a financially responsible institution overall.  I think--but I don't think that there is any single moment or single event that makes me prouder than any other.  When I ran the hospital [Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] we built the Silverstein Pavilion which is--is there.  We planned and started the construction of the Founders Pavilion, all of which is my work.  We put in the first MRI in the hospital.  I have had and still maintain wonderful relationships with almost every chair of a department.  When James [Brisbon] died, they all showed up from far away as Seattle, Washington.  But I don't know that there was a single incident.  What's important to me is relationships and I try to take care of those at every level of the institution.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How long did you serve as CEO?
Speaker 2: Eight years.
Speaker 1: Eight years?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So from--
Speaker 2: Seventy--from wha--what '79 [1979] to '86 [1986].  Seven years I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay and so you--did you retire in '86 [1986], is that what it was?
Speaker 2: Yeah I got tired.  And my husband was also, James had Alzheimer's disease and he was beginning to show the symptoms of it.  And I was really quite tired because I maintained this long marriage, reared these kids, and did this career at some cost to my own energy.  I was worn out.  And we were having a search for the next top level job and I didn't wanna do it and so I decided this is the time to exit and I did.
Story_ID: 260382
Speaker 1: I was probably home, I left in December.  I think I got the first call in February from a colleague of mine to come and--and help him with some work.  I indicated I wasn't interested in working.  He said just come, come talk to me.  And by the end of that year, I had eight clients and I had established Brisbon & Associates [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] without thinking about it.  A business that I ran for fifteen years and twelve of which both my children worked for me all day.  And they worked for me as associates during the day and I became their mother at five o'clock (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: They were not allowed to call me mom during the day.  They had to call me [HistoryMaker] Mrs. [Delores] Brisbon.  And they were not allowed to refer to me as my mother on the telephone, they could refer to me as Mrs. Brisbon.  But we--we worked together for twelve years and my daughter decided to go to medical school.  She is now family practicing physician at [Thomas] Jefferson [University] Hospital[s, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And my son is a human resource professional.  So that's why I said they are my proudest accomplishments because it's not easy to balance being a mother of two young adults and be their boss at the same time.  It was pretty clear to me that it was unique when I had to write my daughter's, she worked for me ten years, and I had to write her--write a balanced reference for her to go to medical school.  It was a tough--tough call, but I did it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So Brisbon & Associates was started--
Speaker 1: Was founded in '87 [1987] and closed in 2002.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: And our clients were people like [The] Children's Hospital of Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Medical College of Pennsylvania [Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], William Penn Foundation [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you know, big--big--big--big boys that we did.  The largest municipal union in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], we managed their health and welfare fund for almost eight years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we never wrote a proposal and we never had a competitive process.  People invited us to work with them and that I'm very proud of.
Speaker 2: That is something, I mean that's quite a--
Speaker 1: I never--I never had to go market much my services.  Every single client we gained was on referral from somebody else.  And they were not minor--they were the biggest organizations in Philadelphia.  The Hospital Authority of Philadelphia [The Hospitals and Higher Education Facilities Authority of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which has a $4 billion portfolio, worked for them for almost sixteen years until their president retired.
Story_ID: 260383
Speaker 1: Well that's something.  So well, you closed [Brisbon & Associates, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in 2002?  You just like, were you just tired of?
Speaker 2: My husband [James Brisbon] was getting more ill.  His course of Alzheimer's was fortunate in a way because he never lost his present memory.  He knew his children, his grandchildren, his close friends like Dorothy [Clark (ph.)] and her husband, and I until the day he died.  What it did do to him was work havoc on his body.  He had three heart attacks.  He had--his mobility got very bad.  His judgment was bad.  He just couldn't keep himself safe.  And I decided that no one could take care of him better than me.  And so I stopped doing everything else and devoted from the end of 2002 until he died in--in this past November, I devoted my entire time to him.  And that's really why Payne Brown called me and said you have to have HistoryMake--[The] HistoryMakers talk to you.  He said what he thought was unique about me and I guess it was kind, was that I gave up everything to take care of my husband and didn't complain about it.  And I did that.  And so he said you need to teach us how to be married.  And so we laughed.  And so when I got your first invitation I was talkin' to him and he--he knows Julie [Julieanna Richardson], I guess, personally.
Speaker 1: Yes, they're very good friends.
Speaker 2: And--and he said to me, I want you to do this and I said okay.  And then Bret Perkins who is also a Comcast [Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] guy called me last week and he said I understand that--that you're thinkin' about not doing this.  And I said yeah.  He said, you do it and he hung the telephone up.  And that's why you're here (laughter).  So, but Payne is a--is a very close mentoree of mine.  They see some uniqueness that I don't necessarily see.  I just do what I have to do.  I never necessarily thought it was unique for me to run the [Hospital of the] University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I thought I accepted the responsibility and they paid me, and I did it well.  That's just who I am.
Story_ID: 260384
Speaker 1: Do you have a philosophy of how to be married.
Speaker 2: Yeah I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that when you marry somebody you should understand that you're not gonna change them.  And that you need to celebrate the good parts about them and compromise on the not so good parts about them.  And that it's a continuing process, it's an evolutionary process, it's not static.  And that equality doesn't mean that every single issue has to be equal.  It means that overall the relationship has to be balanced and that makes it equal.  Because nobody--any--no one can give any more than they have the capacity to give.  So I think, at least, in some marriages that I've--I have watched, people get married on one premise and then expect people to do somethin' they never committed to do and then they have to divorce.  When James [Brisbon] and I met, he said to me, I--I'm--I'm not gonna make a lot of money.  I will love you until I die.  You tell me what you want and to the extent that I can do it, I will do it.  I will tell you when I can't do it and what do you want.  And I said, I'm a bird so I can't be held down.  And he said I don't need to do that.  I mean, this was a conversation that we had that guided our marriage to the end.  And we never reneged on it.  He never tried to change me.  I tried to change him, realized it didn't work and that stopped.  Because he was extraordinarily stubborn, but he never deviated from who he told me he was.  He lived that.  And--so my philosophy is if you think you're gonna change someone, you shouldn't marry them because it's not gonna happen, but importantly it's not fair.  I also think that we should not expect anybody--we should not expect our spouses to make us happy.  Our happiness come from the inside.  And it's our equal responsibility is to try to make each other content, because I've not decided what happy is.  So that's basically my philosophy. And I think that over the evolution of a marriage, each spouse changes and the needs are different.  When I was working and James' business was going quite well, we were both working, he compromised a lot because he was self-employed in order to permit me to do what I needed to do.  When he became ill, I felt the balance would be made if I stopped doin' what I was doin' to take care of him.  And that's what I did.  And that's what I said to Payne [Brown], and he said well people don't do that.  I said well, but that's what I did.  And he said well I know you did 'cause I was there.  But that's kinda the way I feel about it.  We had what I would have to define a closed marriage.  We did not allow anybody in it.  We--our difficulties were discussed sometimes all night to the point that we may have agreed to disagree.  But no one was invited in to help us.  No one.  We never permitted our children to get in our marriage.  We never talked to our kids about each other so much so until they said we were so joined at the hip you talked to one and you get the answer of both.  But that's kinda what we were about.  I think that when, for me, when I said forsaking all others, I did that.  There was nobody allowed in.  I did--Dorothy [Clark (ph.)] is the closest person to me that I know.  She doesn't talk to her marriage about--talk to me about her marriage, which is longer than mine, and I never talked to her about mine.  We might make comments about oh yeah if he wakes me up one more time to ask me how I feel I'm gonna hit him.  But beyond that, there is no--no disclosure of what is going on.  So I think that that's what marriage is about.  And it's a service to each other.  That's my philosophy of marriage.  And it worked.
Story_ID: 260385
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you, I guess about some of your volunteer activities and I guess particularly your current activity with Mother Bethel A.M.E. [Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: I have always been a church worker.  As I told you, elementary school [Douglas Anderson School; Douglas Anderson School of the Arts, Jacksonville, Florida], I participated in church all the way through college [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  When we lived in West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], we were worshipers at Monumental Baptist Church [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] for over thirty years.  Ten of those years I spent as chair of the trustee board, raisin' money, helping the church do its things well.  When we moved to Society Hill [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I had decided that my church volunteer work was done.  I was not gonna get involved anymore.  But the pastor of Mother Bethel asked me to help him with fun--putting together a foundation, which I did.  We had the foundation incorporated, helped select the board of directors, and as of yesterday--from 2001 to yesterday, we raised a one million thirty-five thousand dollars.  Better than 75 percent of it coming from government or quasi-government.  We achieved a $450,000 Save America's [Treasures] Grant from the National Historical Trust [sic. National Trust for Historic Preservation], [U.S.] Department of [the] Interior.  A $100,000 as a congressional award that one of the senators achieved for us to plan, and $200,000 from the Delaware River Port Authority [Camden, New Jersey].  So three-quarters of it came from government or quasi-government.  Comcast [Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], PECO [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], several foundations make up the balance of that.  And it is to try to preserve the church, which needs a considerable amount of repair.
Speaker 1: Now this, this church is--we're talkin' about the oldest black institution in the United States?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Mother Bethel A.M.E.
Speaker 2: Right.  Find--founded by Richard Allen in 1787.  It's the fourth church on that site.  It sits on a piece of land that has been held continuously by blacks longer than any other parcel in the United States.  And it is the vision to build a larger museum over the parkin' lot.  And if you see the [Richard Allen] Museum when you go, you will see that it's in reasonably crowded space.  It's not environmentally safe and the archives are rich and treasured, and so they need better--a better house.  And that is what the project is about.  But before that could happen, it's necessary to show up the church and preserve it.  And it needs about $3 million worth of work.  So the Save America's Treasure award at four hundred and fifty [thousand dollars] has to be matched and that's the foundation's [Mother Bethel Foundation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] initiative to match that and then raise the additional two million.  And once that's done, to build the new facility.  So it's a challenge.
Story_ID: 260386
Speaker 1: It's a new foundation [Mother Bethel Foundation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  It was incorporated in 2001.  It takes anywhere from four to five years for a foundation to become of age.  This one is four years old and it didn't see a lot of money in the first two-and-a-half years.  It's only been in the last eighteen months that the money that I mentioned to you has been raised because I think the public trust is now established for it.  The challenge is to find another $21 million to complete the project.  And so we've reached out to a number of people.  A year or so ago, the late [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis came to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] with Comcast's [Comcast Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] sponsorship and sort of videotaped the story for us.  And I'm so happy that we have that now since, you know, he is gone.  And that's kinda where we are.  The--the issue--
Speaker 2: So the story was videotaped for a?
Speaker 1: For a special event.  But Ossie came to Philadelphia and did it in the, you know, in the church [Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and we had a goo--rather spectacular event where many people showed up to hear what he had to say.  We made a trip to--two trips to New York [New York] and did part of the videoing and then he came to Philadelphia and completed it.  So that we could get the story on tape so as we go out to try to sell the project, we can show what people may not be able to visit.  So--
Speaker 2: Is that tape available to the public?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess we could get one for you.  We haven't put them on sale or anything, we did it as a working document.
Speaker 2: It seems as though that would have an appeal, you know, way beyond what you might imagine?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes I think so, yeah.  So that's kinda where that is.  I'm kinda at a fork right now of--of whether or not I've done as much work as I need to do and to shift this to somebody else, you know, to raise the money.  And that has to do with the fact that I'm seventy-two years old.  It's going to take me a good while to heal and recover and I don't necessarily want to delay the work because of my personal circumstances.  So that's kind of a--a question mark as we talk today--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --about where I'm--where I'm gonna go and what I'm gonna do with that.
Story_ID: 260387
Speaker 1: --Other causes that you're, that you're--that are particularly close to you that you're workin' on?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  I--I will, with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, look at ways of helping people to understand better the devastation that Alzheimer's does to families, and particular families who are isolated or less resourced than [President] Ronald [Wilson] Reagan or [HistoryMaker] Delores Brisbon, because I think we're atypical.  There is 268,000 families in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in the immediate area of Philadelphia taking care of people with Alzheimer's at home.  And it's a devastating experience.  The public isn't aware of it, the state doesn't help.  So I'm gonna take that on as my war, as a memorial to my husband [James Brisbon] because I can.  So that has become a passion for me since his death.  I serve on several boards of higher education.  I'm a governor at the Eastern Baptist [Theological] Seminary [Palmer Theological Seminary, St. Davids, Pennsylvania] and I'm a member of the board of trustees at Eastern University [St. Davids, Pennsylvania].  That's--those are both Christian in ventures, so they are comfortable for me.  And I am a member of Mercy Health Systems board which is a Christian, Catholic ministry healthcare system and I chair the operations committee.  And just recently have been asked to cha--to work on the search committee for the new president.  So those are the activities that I'm involved in.  I think that if I conclude that I'm gonna go do Alzheimer's, I think I will need to move the foundation [Mother Bethel Foundation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] to other hands, but I think it's at a place where it can be rather than trying to manage both of them.  Because my passion right now is to--to--to help people who are suffering with this disease because we lived with it for seventeen years and we didn't have to reach out for help because God had blessed us with what we needed.  But there are so many families that just don't have that and there is an opportunity right now to do that in the commonwealth.  So I'm probably gonna do that.
Story_ID: 260388
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I'd like to see a decrease in violence among young people.  I'd--I would hope that in some way we could get guns out of the hands of kids.  I would also like to see the health status of black Americans changed.  I'm aware of the fact that diseases that kill us are not understood by us like diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and Alzheimer's.  So I would like to see the health status of black Americans change.  I'm not unique in that--in that the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] sees it as a crisis, other black organizations are looking at this crisis as well.  But as a veteran of healthcare, I can tell you that nothing's more pressing.  It almost has to be our mission.
Story_ID: 260389
Speaker 1: When you look back at the things that you've done in life, are there any--do you have anything that you would do differently, any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I think that I probably wouldn't work so hard.  I think that I would do the same things, but I think I would pay a little more attention to me.  Because the work that I've done, while I've enjoyed it and I've been good to it and it to me, it has taken its toll on my soul.  So I think I would do it differently.  But I can't tell you specifically what that would be.  I would--I would continue do all--I have twenty-one people that I mentor right now.  I wouldn't change that.  I wouldn't change my work with the church [Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I wouldn't give up one moment with my children and grandchildren.  I think I'd look differently at the hours that I put into work.  It's not regret, it's that if I had opportunity I probably would do a different balance.
Story_ID: 260390
Speaker 1: When you look over your life at this point, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Service.  Compassionate service.  A woman who--with whom I've sat many hours when her husband was dying from Lou Gehrig's disease [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)] said to me yesterday, if you don't ever give anything to anybody else again, you've given enough.  So (laughter) I thought, well yeah, that's right.  Because aside from the things that we've talked about today, I have what I call my old ladies ministry, and that is women who are widowed or alone, who have nobody to look after them.  I take them to doctors and be sure that people don't abuse them.  Sometimes sell their homes and move 'em into retirement communities if that's what they want.  And try to look over their finances to be sure that they're not ripped off.  And she was one of them, who was saying to me yesterday, you've given enough.  My family says that to me.  So I think that my legacy will be service.

Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Inez Willis Flynn] and father [Welton Flynn] get a chance to see you become the CEO [sic. COO] of the hospital?
Speaker 2: My mother did not, my father did, yeah.  It--I was appointed just at the end of his life.  And he's--he was in university hospital [Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] at the time.  (Laughter) He said to me, that everybody keeps coming in saying that they know you.  And I keep tellin' them so do I (laughter).  I told him that was kinda funny, and he said--I said what does that mean daddy?  And he said, I get the feeling that you must be the most important person in the hospital.  He said because everybody says I know your daughter and he said I keep saying, so do I.  Because after my mother died he moved with us.  So he died with me here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and I took him back home for his burial.  Yeah, yeah.  So he did.
Speaker 1: Is there anything you want to tell us that you haven't talked about, I mean that we haven't asked you?
Speaker 2: I'd really like to tell you about my husband [James Brisbon], but I can't.  I mean, that was just a rich and wonderful journey, but I just can't talk about it.  I mean, it's too--it's too fresh and I couldn't get through it.  I thought when you were coming that I could, but from what I'm feeling I know I can't.

Speaker 1: This picture was taken with Frank Betz when our daughter was in elem--in actually nursery.  The University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] had decided to discontinue a small school that she attended and I decided I didn't want that to happen.  And so I took on the school district, the University of Pennsylvania who at the time was my employer, to not do that.  After quite a struggle they agreed and we started, they built a--the University of Pennsylvania constructed a new center.  That was the occasion of the celebration in which one of the rooms in the building was named for Frank and I.  It's called the Betz-Brisbon room.
Speaker 2: That is me walking in front of the University of Pennsylvania hospital [Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  A picture taken by an Ebony photographer celebrating my climb from head nurse to chief operating officer.
Speaker 1: This is a board meeting at the hospital of University of Pennsylvania in which I am presenting to them the financial status of the hospital, which was done once a month.
Speaker 2: It was my habit when I managed the hospital to make rounds throughout the clinical areas and that's a picture with two of my associates.  We're in the emergency room visiting with the chief of emergency medicine.  That's Kathy [ph.] and Jim Emerick [ph.] walking with me.
Speaker 1: I'm in the department of radiology talking to the chief of radiology about new machinery he used which seemed to be an ongoing request over and over and over.
