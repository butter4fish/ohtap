Story_ID: 62130
Speaker 1: Now, we're gonna start out, and I wanna take you back to your youth and really ask you about your family.  And I'd like to have-let's start with your mother.  And I'd like to have her name, and if you could tell me what you know about her background and he family?
Speaker 2: My mother was Anna Silva Garcia.  She was Portuguese Cape Verdean, and was born in the island of Brava in the Cape Verde Archipelago.  Her father was a ship owner, mariner, who transported persons and products from Brava and the other islands of the Archipelago and also from Africa to the Caribbean islands and South America and North America.  I found out recently that my maternal grandparents made their living transporting captured Africans to the South America, the Caribbean Islands and North America.
Speaker 1: How did you find that out?
Speaker 2: Well, I visited the Cape Verde Islands in 1995, and I went to the village, Sintra, in Brava where my mother and father were born.  And I interviewed some elderly relatives, elderly people in Brava, some of them as old as 98, 100 who remembered, knew my maternal grandparents.  And I learned about this aspect of my background, and that's how they earned their living.  And they were of the upper class of the Cape Verdean society in the Cape Verde Islands.
Speaker 1: That must have been an interesting discovery?
Speaker 2: Well, in fact, it was a little shocking because I have earned the reputation in this country and particularly in Chicago, of being a civil libertarian (laughter).  And it took me aback, a great deal to learn (laughter) that in my ancestry were owners of ships who carried captive Africans.  First, they took them to the Cape Verde Islands for the purpose of seasoning them before they brought them to the West Indies, South America, Brazil and parts of North America.  But that's what it was.
Story_ID: 62131
Speaker 1: Did they talk about what countries they primarily came from?  Was there any discussion?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they would--usually--you mean the Africans?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: From the West Coast of Africa.
Speaker 1: But was it Ghana?  Was it, no, it would not have been Ghana--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --at the time.
Speaker 2: Well, along the West Coast.
Speaker 1: Senegal, I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Senegal.  Well, you see, Senegal, where Senegal is now is Dakar, and there's a cape there.  If you were to look at a map of Africa, look at the map of Africa, you will notice that there's a certain point about the middle of Africa that has a projection into the Atlantic Ocean.  It's the farther most projection of the African continent into the Atlantic Ocean.  At that projection, is a place that the Portuguese named Cabo Verde which means the "green place".  And then years later, under the Kings of Portugal, there was a discovery of the Cape Verde Archipelago which is 250 miles or so west of this projection, this Cabo Verde.  When the Archipelago was discovered, the Portuguese Ilia de Cabo Verde because it was directly West of this cape, the "green place".  Now, reason why they called it the "green place", I saw for myself when I visited the Cape Verde Islands in 1995, there is a peculiar vegetation in the Cape Verde Islands, green in color, beautiful green.  The ground is volcanic ash, brown colored, deep brown color, volcanic origin.  And this green cover runs all over the place, and you can see it for miles.  Thus, it gets its name, Cabo Verde.  So, that's where mother and my father were born.
Story_ID: 62132
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell me what kind of person your mother was?
Speaker 2: My mother was mainly uneducated.  I don't recall ever hearing either from her or from my father or from anyone else who knew her that she had an education.  However, she was cultured, intelligent, and the thing that I remember most about her was that she was stern and had excellent character.  She used to speak with me in the language of the Cape Verdean people.  In fact, before I became emancipated from the family, we didn't speak English.  My mother and father never spoke English with me or with members of our family.  They spoke Creole. And my mother used to say me, whenever she had me do something, and I rebelled or didn't want to because the job was difficult or unpleasant, she used to say me in Creole, "Farabad ju nuncung Ghana say dono" (ph.) which means, "Work never betrays the worker".  And she would point to me and make me do the work.  I'll never forget that.  And the other thing about her that I remember most--and I've said this many times, in all the time that I knew her and also my father, I never heard either one of them ever express a vulgar word because they weren't like that.  They were cultured, even though not educated, you see.
Speaker 1: They represented civil society.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  My mother and my father, they never gave me material things.  I don't have an independent recollection of ever receiving a little gift from my mother or my father, like boys get, baseball bat, glove (laughter), bicycle, never.  But they taught us hard work and character, see.
Story_ID: 62133
Speaker 1: And your father, what about his background.  I know he was also--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Now, my father was different than my mother in this respect.  I know more about my father's background than I know of my mother.  My father was born the son of a man named Antonio--no, just a moment.  No, his father's name was Theophillis (ph.), Theophillis Neves Leighton.  He was a Caucasian, born in Lisbon [Portugal].  And then as was the custom of the Portuguese government in the early days of the Cape Verde Islands, they brought Portuguese from Portugal and they lived in Brava, San Anton, and the other islands.  I am told by a cousin of mine who's written a biography about Myra Newness, that my paternal grandfather, Theophillis Neves Leighton, was law trained in Lisbon and held a government position in Brava.  I've seen a picture of him, and I've seen a picture of my paternal grandmother who was a black woman.  She was 100 percent African.  And he was a hundred percent Caucasian.  I've seen a picture of her, seated in a chair, and on the right hand, slightly behind her was this handsome Caucasian man, Theophillis Neves Leighton.  And I remember vividly taking in that picture, and I could tell, of the two of them, who was the boss of the family (laughter).  It wasn't the handsome, Caucasian.  It was that black woman who was the mother of my father and seven other children in Brava.
Story_ID: 62134
Speaker 1: Now, my father never told me that he went to college or that he was a graduate of any university or any of that.  But he was well read.  When I entered Howard University in 1936 and took the orientation examination at Howard, I surpassed most of the students in the grade that I received.  Why?  'Cause my father had told me all about Cicero, Plato, Aristotle, Shakespeare.  He used to read Shakespeare's plays to us, and he was an avid reader of the Bible.  Again, he wasn't educated or graduate of a university, but he was cultured, well read.  He took great pride in his handwriting.  And I have a specimen of his handwriting.  You would think it would be an example of some calligrapher, so beautiful did he write, you see.  I've often wondered from whom did I get the idea of becoming educated.  It was from my father, not that he told me to go to college.  He didn't do that, but he exemplified it by his reading, his devotion to the classics, his knowledge of history, which he freely told us about, sitting in a, right behind a shanty on a cranberry bog near Plymouth, Massachusetts, you see.  That's my only explanation.  Why is it that a guy born in New Bedford, never having gone to a high school, would decide to go to Howard University (laughter)?  How?  And I've said already, my mother never told me, you know, "Work hard and go to college".  My father never told me that.  But it was their example because teaching by example is more impressive and effective than repeating the words.  So.
Story_ID: 62135
Speaker 1: Sir, how did your--can you just spend a little bit of time giving just some background on Cape Verdeans and I--can you just, you know, what--do you know much about it or was that inculcated in you because it is its own community.
Speaker 2: My father was a great Portuguese patriot.  Here's another thing that I remember of my father.  I never heard my father or my mother or any Cape Verdean person complain about any oppression, while however, here in Chicago, from almost the first day I came here until almost today, I constantly here people complaining about oppressive conduct by the police, by government officials, injustice in the courts.  My mother and father never told me anything of that kind.  They described the poverty, the drought because Cape Verde Islands is probably one of the poorest countries in the world because of the drought, the lack of minerals or natural resources, but my mother and father never complained about ever being arrested without a warrant or their home searched or their being accused falsely in the courts, nothing like that, never told me anything like that.  And my father was proud of his Portuguese background, yet he became a naturalized citizen in this country and so did my mother.
Story_ID: 62136
Speaker 1: What brought them--did your parents meet in, when they were growing up?  You said they were from the same town.  So how did they--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --meet?
Speaker 2: Well, that's an interesting question which I've delved in without success.  My father migrated to New Bedford, Massachusetts in May, 1895.  He was 20 years old at that time.  He was born in 1875 in Brava.  My mother migrated also from Brava to New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1907.  We have never been able to determine that my mother and father knew each other in Brava.  They met in a little place called, Weir, W-E-I-R, Massachusetts.  Weir is one of these blue-color towns where they manufactured metals and things of that sort, right outside of a place called Taunton.  My mother and father met in Weir.  And they were married in 1911, November, 1911.  Then they both moved back to New Bedford, Massachusetts where all of us were born, my sister, Condeitta (ph.), and then my twin sister and I, October 22, 1912, and then I had three brothers and one other sister, all born in New Bedford.
Story_ID: 62137
Speaker 1: I didn't know you had a twin sister.
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: Are any of your siblings still alive?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have a brother and a sister living in Plymouth, Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: They're younger, they're the youngest?
Speaker 2: They're younger than I am.  I think Virginia is now 70--no, Virginia is now 81 years old.  John, who is the younger of us, I think is 72.
Speaker 1: So there was one older than you, and then there were the twins?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 62138
Speaker 1: Now, why did such a large population of Cape Verdeans settle in New Bedford?  Do you know--was that having to do with cranberries?  I read some place--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, here's the explanation.  The Cape Verde Islands is almost totally bereft of natural resources that contribute to a growing society, like oil, coal, products to be manufactured.  The Cape Verde Islands, totally bereft of that.  However, because they're islands, there are a total of 15 islands and a number of islets that constitute the Cape Verde Archipelago.  Fish and fishing industry, marine activity is the way Cape Verdeans live.  And in the early 18th Century, when whaling became a principal industry in Eastern United States, ships from Rhode Island, Massachusetts, would go within their whaling journeys, and they would stop different places.  One of the places they stopped was the Cape Verde Islands, and Cape Verdean men, needing and wanting a way to get away from the islands would go on board the whaling ships, become whalers and they came back to New Bedford, Providence, Rhode Island, and the other parts of the Eastern Massachusetts coast.  And there began an influx of Cape Verdeans from the Cape Verde Islands to various parts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island.  And it's been increased, and some people say that there are presently more Cape Verdeans in New Bedford, Massachusetts and in Rhode Island, in parts, than you'll find in the Cape Verde Islands.  It's the attraction of the whaling industry and the maritime activities, shipping--I mean fishing and that kind of thing that attracted Cape Verdeans.  Now, when they got to New Bedford, as you know, whaling became obsolete because whale oil became valueless.  Electricity replaced whale oil as a form energy.  Well, Cape Verdeans began looking for other ways of work, and what attracted them were the cranberry bogs of Massachusetts, some in Rhode Island, and they worked in the cranberry bogs.  There is a point in history, say around 1920 or so, '20' [1920] or '30' [1930] when most of the cranberry culture in the East Coast of the United States were Cape Verdeans.  Cranberry growing is one of the most labor intensive forms of activity.  And it consists mainly of what some people call--and appropriately so, stoop labor.  Almost every form of work you don on a cranberry bog requires stooping.  You have to stoop to plant the vines.  You have to stoop to weed it.  You have to stoop to harvest it.  It's stoop labor.  And Cape Verdeans fit into this pattern.  Now, the instinct question is, today, are Cape Verdeans now employed on the cranberry bogs?  I think the answer is "no".  They have found their way into technology and other forms of employment, you see.  But that's what originally attracted Cape Verdeans to Massachusetts.
Story_ID: 62139
Speaker 1: Now, why--what about Cape Verdean culture were you exposed to as a child, and what is unique about it because it's almost its own society in some respects?
Speaker 2: Cape Verdeans, perhaps more than anybody I know of, have a self-isolating instinct.  I'll use myself as an example.  From the time that I was born in New Bedford in 1912 until I left there in August, 1936, to go to Howard University, I didn't know but one African American person.  I had never met any African Americans.  I'd never spoken to any, and none had ever spoken to me.  The one exception was a man who who was a teacher in the New Bedford Public High School.  He took an interest in me because I had never gone to a high school, but I was reading books.  I was in the WPA [Works Progress Administration] classes.  I was studying from the books I borrowed in the library.  His name was Melvin Felter (ph.).  He taught in the WPA class in New Bedford.  And he befriended me.  I guess my interests in being educated attracted his attention.  And I got to know him.  And until the day that I got to Washington, D.C. and entered Howard University, I had had no contacts with African American people because of the self-isolation of the Cape Verdean society in New Bedford.  In fact, in New Bedford when I was growing up, it was considered taboo for a Cape Verdean boy in the South side of New Bedford to go to the West side where the African Americans lived.  Girls would be ostracized from the Cape Verdean society if they ventured out and word came out that they were dating African American boys.  Now, to what extent that still is true in New Bedford, I am not sure.  But it wouldn't surprise me if I were to learn that it largely the same today.
Speaker 1: So what would you say is unique about this?  What was the culture that you grew up with 'cause even when you gave the statement, your mother, you know, would always say to you, it sounded Italian, sort of.
Speaker 2: What's that again?
Speaker 1: The statement, you said, my mother--you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, what my mother used to tell me?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It sounded almost, the accent sounded almost Italian.  It didn't sound--
Speaker 2: Well, that's a Cape Verdean tongue.  That's--see the Cape Verdean tongue of Creoles (ph.) is a mixture of Portuguese and guttural African expressions.  That's what it is.  If studied--made a study of Cape Verdean language, you will notice, it's a mixture of Portuguese expressions and guttural African expressions, you see.
Story_ID: 49217
Speaker 1: Well, let me tell you another thing about Cape Verde.  If you wanna get into a fist fight, you go to New Bedford in the Cape Verdean community, which is very concentrated, right near downtown New Bedford, and you mention to anyone there, it's a Negro, they will fight because Cape Verdeans insists that they're not Negroes, even though they look like 'em.  Now, the reason for that is Cape Verdeans don't seem to know, and perhaps don't want to understand, that there is a difference between ethnicity and nationality because they were Portuguese.  See, they're Portuguese nationals.  Every Cape Verdean, born in the Cape Verde Islands is a citizen of Portugal.  And they consider themselves Portuguese.  Now, Portuguese are Caucasians.  But (laughter) Cape Verdeans think that because they were Portuguese nationals, so Portuguese citizens, they weren't Negroes, which isn't true.  Take right now, in my case, I don't have a single relative, kin or ancestor African American.  All of my ancestors, all of my kin folk, all of my relatives are Cape Verdeans.  So in a strict sense, I'm not an African American even though I am African.  As I told you, my paternal grandmother was a beady-eyed black woman from Angola, which is just across the way from the Cape Verde Islands, you see.  So they will, they will--take right now, when I went to Howard University, one of the things that I did that was noted by a lot of people, I participated in an essay contest sponsored by Town Hall of Vieres (ph.).  And I won second prize in that essay contest.  In the essay that I wrote, I said, "I am a Negro."  Well, you see by that--I said it because I was a student at Howard University.  And in 1936, 1940, we had no problem, what to call black people.  Everybody used the word, "Negro" in the classrooms, in the academic journals.  That's the term that was used.  So when I wrote the essay, I said, "I am a Negro."  Well, when the people of Cape Verde, of Cape Verde extraction read that essay in New Bedford, I was, of course, subject of ostracism (laughter) because I had admitted in writing that I was a Negro, you see.
Story_ID: 49218
Speaker 1: Sir, what was the household that you grew up in?  Can you describe sort of family life, and, you know, culture and what it was like?
Speaker 2: Small family, living in unheated, frame buildings.  I have said to people that we used to work during the warm weather period of the year, this time of the year until late November, December, around Plymouth, Massachusetts in the cranberry bogs and on the strawberry patches, the blueberry bushes.  And then when cold weather set in, my mother and father would bundle all of us up and would, transported us by cart--by car or some other way to New Bedford.  Why New Bedford?  Because New Bedford was the only place they knew where they could rent an unheated flat that was capable of protecting us from the winter weather (laughter).  So I have said, we never lived in New Bedford.  We hibernated there, and I have said that people who know the English language know the difference between living and hibernating.  We went to New Bedford to get protection from the weather (laughter).  We didn't have a home.  My mother and father never owned a place they called their own.  I never lived in a home with my mother and father and my brothers and sisters in a place that we owned (laughter), never.  But my mother and father knew where to find an apartment--a flat.  It wasn't an apartment.  It used to be called a flat, five or six rooms, enough to huddle a family of--well, at the height of our family size, it was a total of nine, my mother and father and the seven children.  My oldest daughter--sister, Condeitta, died when she was 18 in New Bedford.  And my youngest brother, Antonio, also died in the same house in New Bedford.  But at the height of the size of our family, my mother and father had to find a place that could accommodate the entire family.
Story_ID: 49219
Speaker 1: Sir, now, take yourself back to those days in New Bedford, and if you--could you tell me what sights, smells or sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: What's that again?
Speaker 1: Sights, smells or sounds remind you of growing up there?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, they were rather limited.  They're very, very limited. I have no independent recollection of ever playing football with anybody.  I have no independent recollection from my boyhood of playing baseball or having team competition.  As I said, this hibernation that we engaged in, in New Bedford lasted from the end of November, early December until March.  March is the thawing months for people who work out in the farms, the cranberries, strawberry bushes, patches.  And as I've already told you, I don't remember ever having any contact with African Americans.
Speaker 1: So what did you think you--you were Cape Verdeans.  That's what you were.  You were Cape--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You were Cape Verdeans.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And what were you told about your legacy and your history or your color?
Speaker 2: I don't--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It didn't really matter.
Speaker 2: Well, I have no independent recollection of ever my mother and my father sitting down with me--or with us and talking about that. They never did. They never did. My mother and father were not socially active in the community. My father, though I don't remember his ever have been active in politics--it wasn't until I came to Chicago I got to know anything about politics (laughing).
Story_ID: 49220
Speaker 1: It may sound strange, particularly, you know, as I've grown older, the one thing that age brings, I think, it brings a tendency to reflect on the past.  And when I look back to this bare living that I went through (laughter) from the time that I was born in New Bedford until the day that I'll never forget (laughter), when I took a bus in New Bedford to go to Washington, D.C., I had never been outside of New Bedford like that.  I had never been.  I was by myself.  I took a bus in New Bedford, went to Boston, and I got on the train and went to Washington.  I went to Washington because I was going to Howard University.  I had applied for admission to Howard University.  I had that letter--in fact, I have that letter here.  And they wrote me and told me that I couldn't enter Howard University because I had never gone to a high school.  See, when you work on cranberry bogs from March to the end of November, and you get to New Bedford, say an early week in November and go to grade school, and you leave in March to go back to the cranberry bogs, you don't have much time to spend in school (laughter).  So I never went to public school.  So when they told me that I couldn't enter Howard University, there was a postscript like in the letter, written to me by F. D. Wilkinson, the registrar, who told me that Howard University had learned that there are people who didn't have the advantage of public school education, but nonetheless, they could enter Howard as what he called an "unclassified student", one who was not a candidate for a degree and couldn't be.  And he said to me, if you wish to enter Howard as unclassified student, you may do so.  Then he further added in the letter that if I could prove that despite never having gone to a high school and not ever having really completed a public school education, he said, you can discuss that with your professors.  So in August, 1936, with that letter and some money I had earned washing dishes, working in restaurants and hotels all over the East coast, almost, I went to Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 49221
Speaker 1: Sir, I wanna take you back a little bit, just in that early period, and I want, just a little bit more.  I want to understand what you were like as a young person?  You know, what were--were you a quiet person?  Were you, I mean what kind of person--
Speaker 2: That's about, about what it was because, you see, I had very little contact with other people.  When I met Melvin Felter just before I went to Washington, D.C., he was about the only person I spoke with about my ambition to become educated.  See, from somewhere, and I couldn't tell you where this came from, I got the idea that I wanted to be a lawyer (laughter).  At that time I didn't know, no one had told me at that time, that my paternal grandfather was law trained in Lisbon.  No one had told me that.  But I got this idea of being a lawyer.  In fact, I have told people that at the time I got this idea of being a lawyer, I didn't tell anybody.  Why?  If I had said that to my mother and my father, they would have sworn that I had suffered some kind of a stroke (laughter), you know.  They would have taken me to a hospital for mental examinations.  That's how bizarre it was.  I had never met a lawyer, had never spoken to one, didn't know what lawyers did (laughter).  Yet I had this idea that I wanted to be a lawyer.  And so I left New Bedford in August, 1936, armed with this letter from F.D. Wilkinson and went to Washington.
Story_ID: 49222
Speaker 1: But you had spent also, was it a couple years on a ship?  You had spent time in Aruba and the West Indies.  Was that--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --when you took the (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, in the early months of 1939, the reason why I remember it so well--now, wait a minute.  I misspoke.  No, I misspoke.  In the early months of 1929, I was attending a school in New Bedford called Roosevelt Junior High School.  It was a elementary school.  I was then in the sixth grade at Roosevelt.  Now, mind you, in 1929, in early 1929, I was 16 years of age because I was born in 1912.  Now, I told you that my mother gave no indication to me of being informed about the ways of Americans, but she knew one thing that I didn't know, that under Massachusetts law, a boy 16 years old and over did not have to go to public school.  So, she talked to my brother-in-law who was married to Condeitta and who was a steward on an oil tanker owned by the Shell Oil Company.  She got him to get me a job on the oil tanker, and she called the school and told them to send me home 'cause she had this job for me on the oil tanker.  And that's the last time I ever was inside a public school room.  I left New Bedford with my brother-in-law, went to Fall River, Massachusetts, got onboard the Shell Oil tanker and traveled from Fall River, Massachusetts.  By that time, it was about the early winter in '29' [1929].  I went from Fall River to Aruba, Dutch Indies on the oil tanker.  And I stayed around, working on oil tankers for a number of years until I finally decided I didn't want that kind of life, and I came back to New Bedford, you see.  And from 1929 to 1936, I worked in various kinds of jobs.  I was at one time a musician, played in an orchestra until I came to the conclusion that although I had the strength to play a guitar in an orchestra, I had no talent (laughter).  I had no natural ability to play the guitar.  I couldn't, I couldn't perform solos.  I couldn't improvise.  I didn't know how to read music, so I gave up that kind of activity and concentrated on this idea that I had acquired that I wanted to be a lawyer.  I began reading books borrowed from libraries.  I began taking WPA [Workers Progress Administration] classes.  And then, as I told you, finally, I left New Bedford with that letter from F. D. Wilkinson and went to Howard University in Washington.
Story_ID: 49223
Speaker 1: Now, how had you heard about Howard University?
Speaker 2: Oh, let me tell you about that.  In this endeavor--now, here's the funny thing about it.  As I've told you at least once, I have no recollection of ever my mother saying to me, "George, you read books and go to school."  She never told me that.  I don't remember my father ever saying that to me.  However, when I became face-to-face with the problem of going to a college, I then, of course, had to decide where.  Well, to begin with, you'd have to have money to go to college, you know.  Even in 1936, you have to have money.  For some reason, which I can't explain to you, I became a walking encyclopedia about American universities and colleges.  There was then, and I'm sure there is now, you can find in any large library, "Compendium of American Colleges and Universities".  And in that book, you can read every major American institution of higher learning.  And I read that book because I had to decide, where am I gonna go?  I read about Howard University in that book, how Howard University was founded by General O. O. Howard, the first administrator of the Freedman's Bureau after the Civil War, the institution created by Congress to deal with the newly emancipated slaves.  I read all of that.  And I read how Howard University had been founded in 18--I think '86' [1886], '87' [1887], something like that, and how it has grown to this great university where the majority of students were, again, at that time Negroes, Negro students.  And I said to myself, that is the school for me.  I have a chance in that school.  I wouldn't have a chance at Harvard [University].  If Harvard was foolish enough to let me in, I wouldn't get out (laughter).  You see, I had the perceptivity to realize that I had to find a place where I had a chance.  And that's why I went to Howard University.

Speaker 1: So when you arrive on campus--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: When you arrive in Washington, D.C., did you stay on campus?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You didn't.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't stay on campus.  Why?  I didn't have the money.  However, I'll tell you this.  I met a man at Howard University--now, mind you, I didn't know anyone in Washington.  I didn't know anyone at Howard University.  I had never been there.  I had no contacts, no friends, no friendship, no--however, from the very first day, I made friends.  One of the friends I made was a man named Leroy Rec Woodson.  He was a major in the Germanic languages.  He was a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, and he was also assistant to the Dean of Men at Howard University.  I didn't know this, but the position of assistant to the Dean of Men at Howard University carried with it tuition and room in the dormitory, Clark Hall, which I couldn't go to because I couldn't pay for it.  Well, Leroy Rec Woodson befriended me, and became kind of a protector of me as I wandered through Howard University (laughter), trying to get adjusted from August, 1936 and on out.  Then at the end of that first year, Leroy Rec Woodson resigned his position as assistant to the Dean of Men and recommended me to succeed him.  And so that in my second year at Howard University--now, mind you I'd gone the first year.  And F. D. Wilkinson had told me that if could show my professors that I could do college work without ever having gone to a high school, they would consider making me a regular student.  Well, I made the Dean's Honor Roll right from the day I began at Howard.  And in the second year, I was assistant to William Benton West, Dean of Men at Howard University.  I had my tuition.  I had my room in Clark Hall.  All I needed was my clothing and my food, you see.
Story_ID: 49225
Speaker 1: Now, what was that experience like?  You remember you said you wrote the piece saying, I am, you know, I'm a Negro.
Speaker 2: [No audible response].
Speaker 1: You said in a piece that you wrote, "I am a Negro".
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, but I'm wondering, this is your first exposure to black life.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and what is that experience like?
Speaker 2: Well, you see I was a student of history.  And almost right away, I began studying American History and American Negro History.  I became, oh, just absorbed in all the books.  I had some wonderful professors.  One of them was William Leo Hansberry.  You remember that name?  Well, Leo--William Leo Hansberry--I didn't know this then.  I found all of this out later.  He was my favorite professor at Howard University.  He taught "Negro History", and I mean he taught it, taught the whole history of the African race, the evolution of the African in Africa, the African empires, the great kings of Africa, the great societies.  In fact, he used to tell us in our lectures, and there was authentic substantiation for this, but African History shows that there was a period in the history of Africa where African culture was superior to anything you'd find anywhere in the world.  This is what William Leo Hansberry taught.  And he was the uncle of Lorraine Hansberry who wrote "Raisin in the Sun", and he was the brother of Carl Hansberry who in Chicago, was kitchenette king (laughter) of Chicago.  I learned all of this later.  Well, I picked up from William Leo Hansberry, Ralph Bunche, Alaine Locke Charles Wesley, Charles Thompson, Snowden, after whom a library is named here in Chicago.  I picked up the, the real meaning of American Negro History.  I learned, and I became convinced, and I have said this, that it is one of the great pity's that African Americans don't realize what a glorious history they have had in this country, you know, to be where we are today (laughter) in this country as I'm speaking with you, from what they had been, slaves, pieces of property that was sold like baggage, you know, and the whole story, I learned that at Howard University.
Story_ID: 49226
Speaker 1: So that was, really, in many ways, Howard--and you did very well there.  You did--
Speaker 2: Academically?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, you see--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay, let's (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --right from the beginning, and thank God, I made all the high grades that you should at Howard University.  I remained on the Dean's Honor Roll.  I was admitted to all the academic honor societies they had.  At that time, Howard University doesn't have a Phi Beta Kappa chapter.  They had Kappa Mu Society.  I was admitted to Kappa Mu, and then in this time of the year, just at this time of the year in 1940--now, mind you, I'd entered as an unclassified student.  The class I entered with was the Class of 1940.  About this time of the year, I learned that I was gonna be graduated with a degree from the College of Liberal Arts, magna cum laude.  And I had earned all of the qualifications to be admitted to Phi Beta Kappa when and if a chapter was formed at Howard.  Not only that, I earned a commission in the Reserve Officers Training Corp.  I was lieutenant, second lieutenant in the United States Army, and I had a scholarship to the Harvard Law School.  And you want me to tell you how I got that scholarship (laughter)?  Well, when I learned that I was gonna be graduated from Howard University, and I had all these academic honors that qualified me for admission to any law school that I could get into except I didn't have the money.  At that time, the dean of Howard University's law school was William H. Hastie.  Now, William Hastie was from Philadelphia, and one of the things that attracted him to my attention was the fact that rumor had it on campus that he had divorced his first wife and he had married a beauty from St. Thomas, the Virgin Islands.  So, I don't know what led me to this idea, but something led me to the idea of talking with William H. Hastie.  I didn't know Dean Hastie, didn't know him personally.  Now, of course, he knew of me because I was well known on the campus.  I was on the staff of the Hilltop School newspaper.  I wrote columns.  I attacked the administration of the University as not feeding the students.  Well, I made myself famous (laughter).  I was a kind of a Jesse Jackson [Rev. Jesse Jackson] (laughter) at Howard's campus.  So I went to see William H. Hastie, and I told him that I wanted to go to Harvard Law School.  That was the law school I wanna go to.  The only trouble is, I didn't have the money.  I had the academic record, no question about it.  I don't remember what William H. Hastie said to me except that I have a recollection of his having said some things were a good idea, and so on and so on.  Now, mind you, he was Dean of Howard University Law School.  A guy like me with all these academic honors that I had earned--I had won the essay contest and second prize in the nationwide contest.  I'd written columns in the--I'd written an essay against all the Greek letter societies.  I didn't like Greek letter societies, hoity-toity.  I didn't like elitism.  So he knew who I was.  He didn't tell me, "I'll call the dean for you" or something like that.  He didn't say anything like that.  So I left him, thanked him, went back to my dormitory and did what I was doing.  About a week later, I received a handwritten note in personal stationery of James McCauley Landis, Dean of the Harvard Law School.
Story_ID: 49227
Speaker 1: Okay, the note that you got.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  When I received this note from James McCauley Landis, I wondered how it came about that he would write to me.  What I didn't know was, shows you how--I don't know what your religious faith is, but you've heard the express, "God, in his mysterious ways, his wonders to perform".  I didn't know when I thought to go and talk with William H. Hastie, that William H. Hastie was a graduate of the Harvard Law School, was one of the first African Americans to make the "Harvard Law Review" at Harvard.  He was a colleague of Charles [Hamilton] Houston.  I didn't know this then, but I found out later that he and James McCauley Landis, then dean of Harvard Law School, were classmates and had both been on the "Law Review". I didn't know that soon after I finished talking with Dean Hastie, he called James McCauley Landis and told James McCauley Landis about me, that I had all these academic honors and essay-writing ability and student activist and so forth.  That's how I got the letter.  It said, when you are in Cambridge, stop in and see me.  Well, the following weekend, I was in Cambridge.  Again, to show you how God in his mysterious ways, his mercies to perform, I don't remember ever calling Dean Landis and thanking him for his letter.  I don't remember ever writing to him and thanking him for the letter, but instead I jumped on the first bus that weekend and hitch-hiked part of the way, and I was in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Saturday, April 20, 1940.  I called his office from Harvard Square, and his secretary, apparently recognized my name and told me that the Dean was in--now, mind you, James McCauley Landis could have been in Europe (laughter) that weekend.  But, no, by this mysterious way, he was there.  And I sat down in his office, and I told him how I'd worked on cranberry bogs, how my mother and father were immigrants from the Cape Verde Islands, how I had not gone to a high school, how I had gone to Howard, (laughter) you know, I told him the whole thing.  He sat just like you and I are sitting here in his office, just the two of us.  He didn't say anything to me.  He just looked at me.  I remember it clearly.  He looked as if he was analyzing me.  Then when I finished, when I had run out of words, he said to me very quietly, he says, "When you finish Howard, you'll come to Harvard Law School."  He didn't tell me how.  He didn't tell me what to do, you understand?  I pick up my hat and coat and thanked him, left, went back to Washington.  And about a week later, I received a letter from Harrison Dement, Secretary of Harvard Law School telling me that the Dean had awarded me a scholarship to the Harvard Law School.  And that's why I went.  I've told people that I went to Harvard Law School because I couldn't afford to go anywhere else.  It was the only school that gave me a scholarship, you know (laughter).  So that's how I went to Harvard Law School.
Story_ID: 49228
Speaker 1: That's amazing.
Speaker 2: It's amazing, yeah, amazing.  When you think, when you think all the--now, why did I go see Hastie?  Why?  You know, he had a hunch--I am sure that William H. Hastie told William McCauley Landis--James McCauley Landis about our conversation and that, and after I went there--of course, when I went to see Landis in his office, I had to sell him the idea.  See, when I talked with William H. Hastie, I never told him, I don't remember my telling him I want a scholarship to Harvard Law School.  I didn't tell him that.  I told him I wanted to go to Harvard Law School, you see.
Speaker 1: Sir, now, do you go immediately?  Is this 1940?  Yes, you go--no, 1940.
Speaker 2: That was 1940.
Speaker 1: So you start that Fall?
Speaker 2: Yes, the week after Labor Day, 1940, I began my studies at the Harvard Law School.
Story_ID: 49229
Speaker 1: Sir, were your parents, your parents are still alive at that point?
Speaker 2: My father was.  My mother was not.  My mother had died several years before.
Speaker 1: Did your father understand the importance of what you were embarking on?
Speaker 2: I don't think they did.  I don't think they did.  I don't think my mother and father knew the significance of my going to Howard University.  They didn't.
Speaker 1: What did the think of it, and what did your family think?  Were they happy for--I mean what did they, because that was so alien to what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --at the time.
Speaker 2: Now, my sisters, see at that time, at the time I entered Howard University, there was Georgina, Virginia, Arthur, John and I.  We were still living, five children.  We survived our mother and father.  My two sisters, more than anyone else in the family appreciated what I was doing, and they were supportive of what I was doing. Now, you might stop here.  This wonderful experience I had with William H. Hastie and with James McCauley Landis, the scholarship to Harvard Law School, magna cum laude graduate of Howard University, Phi Beta Kappa qualified graduate, no matter how prestigious a scholarship may be, it isn't edible.  You can't eat a scholarship.  And whoever arranged this life in which we live has made this necessity.  We have to eat (laughter).  No one has figured out a way (laughter) of living without eating.  So, so I, when I get to Harvard Law School--now, I, of course, I was thrilled.  And I still remember the first day of school.  Here I was in this beautiful surrounding, Harvard, and I had enough sense to know that I looked in this room, this big room with several hundred first-year law students at Harvard Law School, all sons, all--only sons.  There were no women at Harvard in 1940 when I entered it, all sons of rich families.  I could tell.  Here I was lost in this big world of Harvard Law School.  I then had to face the reality of what I just told you about the scholarship not being edible.  My two sisters took care of that.  I don't remember ever asking them to do this, but they did.  They rented a room in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a little room.  And they furnished me with a place to live, and they furnished me with the food.  I had no money to pay them.  I didn't give them any money.  They worked jobs.  They were, my sister was an employee of the, I think the--she worked for some company, my younger sister, Virginia.  My twin sister was a house maid, a menial, house menial.  And they worked and furnished me with this means of existence, you see.  That's how that was taken care of.
Story_ID: 49230
Speaker 1: Now, the other part of it, at the end of my first year, you know, making it through the first year at Harvard was no easy trick.  I did.  I was successful.  Then I went to work, the summer of 1941 in a restaurant owned by my cousin, oh, the last name is Nunes.  He owned a restaurant in a place called Bristol, Rhode Island.  I worked all summer in that restaurant, then came back to Harvard Law School in the Fall, started my second year in September, 1971--I'm sorry, September, 1941.  And as you know, December 7 [1941] came along, Pearl Harbor [World War II], you see.  Well, Harvard Law School authorities decided that if a student who was in his second year in the law school, and they had to leave to go to military service, that second year would be wiped out because he didn't finish the second year, you see.  Now, here was a blessing in disguise.  Now, mind you, I told you my sisters were working, giving me a room to live in.  Well, Pearl Harbor solved all of my economic problems 'cause remember I told you that when I graduated from Howard[University], in addition to having a degree from The College of Liberal Arts, I also had a Commission in the Reserve Officers Training Corp.  I was a second lieutenant.  In March, 1942--you see, Pearl Harbor occurred on December 7, 1941.  In March, 1942, I was ordered to active duty.  So my law school terminated right there.  I was ordered to Fort Benning, Georgia.  I went.  I did my ROTC training at Fort Benning.  Then I was assigned to Fort Huachuca, Arizona with the 93rd Infantry Division.  I stayed with the 93rd Infantry Division from 1942 to 1945 in Guadalcanal, Bougainville, Green Island, Finchhaven (ph.) in combat against the Japanese on those islands.  I spent all that time from 1940, yeah, early '43' [1943] until 1945 in combat in the Pacific Theater.  Now, here's another thing.  All the time that I was in military service--now, mind you, if I had not been able to get back to pick up my law studies, all my efforts at Howard, all my efforts at Harvard would go down the drain, wouldn't it?  Well, every single hour of the day that I was awake in that four-year period of military service, all I was thinking about was how to get back to Harvard Law School.
Story_ID: 49231
Speaker 1: Well, another thing happened.  When I finished maneuvers in Louisiana with the 93rd Infantry Division, I proposed to my wife, Virginia, who I had met while I was a student at Howard University.  And I was introduced to her by a man whose name was Melvin Evans.  Well, Melvin Evans was the first native of the Virgin Islands ever to be governor of the Virgin Islands.  And he had met Virginia, I don't know how.  But one day he was in the office of the Dean.  It was around May or maybe April, 1940, something (unclear).  He said to me, George, said I have a girl I want you to meet.  I said, okay.  He said, just a minute.  He went to the phone.  He dialed, and said, here, meet Virginia (laughter).  So that's how I met my wife.  Well, I later proposed to her from Fort Benning, Georgia around some of the other places, came back to Washington.  And we get married in June, 1942, and we went to Tucson, Arizona where I went to join the 93rd Infantry Division at Fort Huachuca.  She went back and lived with her mother while I went to the Pacific Theater.  And she gave birth to my older daughter, also named Virginia, now Dr. Virginia L. Reynolds.  And then after I spent all this time in the Pacific Theater, I'll tell you another anecdote that you will find as surprising as any of those that I've told you.  As I have told you, all the time that I was in the military service, I was thinking, how do I get back to Harvard Law School?  See, I had done one year successfully.  I would have lost all of that if I stayed in the military service.  Well, I was sent back to the States on orders in 1945.  And this was around October, 1945.  I left Morotai, in the East Indies, and had to go to Manila [Philippines] in order to find transportation to get back to the States.  I had said to myself, and I had decided for myself that if I ever got back to the United States, after being away almost four years, you know, I would never--they would never send me back to the Pacific.  I had decided that for myself.  I can't tell you how I was gonna do this, but I had decided that.  When I got to Manila--and this was about October, I think 21, 22, 1945, the captain of the unit to which I reported told me, I cannot tell you when you can leave Manila because the whole place is in confusion.  We're trying to move troops all over the Pacific Theater, some to go back to the States.  We don't know when we can send you back to the States.  I said, oh, my God.  What can I do?  I said, look, I have to get back to the States. See, I was thinking, if I get back to the States, I could get back to Harvard, see.  Oh, he said, I don't know what you're doing.  He said, however, he said, you see that tent over there.  He pointed to a tent.  He said there's a man in that tent who is the commanding officer of all the transportation facilities in this part of the military operation.  Go in there and talk with him.  He can put you on a plane and you'll be on your way to the States tonight.  I said, all right.  And I went.  I went to the tent, and I banged on the door.  I don't know if you're familiar with military facilities.  I'm banging on this tent, and a voice inside said, "Come on in, come on in".  I stuck my head and stood in the tent, and who was standing in that tent?  Leroy Rec Woodson, the man that I knew at Howard University.
Story_ID: 49232
Speaker 1: He had been in the military service (laughter), he had.  He was a major, major in the Adjutant General Department, and he was in command of all the transportation that came in and out of Manila at that time.  When he saw me, and I saw him, "Oh, George, where have you been?"  I hadn't seen him since 1940.  Now, this is now 1945.  So we revisited and he told me where he had been.  He had gone to Germany, finished his Germanic studies.  He had taught at Morgan State [University], and then the War [World War II] came.  He was sent to military service and he got to be a major in the Adjutant General Department.  So he asked me, he said, what are you doing here?  I said, well, I'm on my way to the States.  He--I said, what--I said, look Rec, I need to get back to the States.  And I told him the whole story.  I said, look, they took me right out of law school.  I have to get back.  He said, when do you wanna go?  I said, well, I'd like to go today.  He said, just a minute.  He went over to a crank telephone, and he cranked the telephone.  I heard him talking to someone, said, look, what time is the next plane going to San Francisco?  So the guy said something.  All right, 7:00 o'clock.  Okay, says, I have a man I'm gonna send to you.  I want you to put him on board.  He said, where are your things?  I said, outside here in the--said, all right.  Get the orderly.  I'll tell him where to go.  He called the orderly, told the orderly where to take me, and I was on my way.  That evening, about 7:00 o'clock, I was on board a four-engine transport plane.  They used to call 'em C-40's, four engines, and I was going from Manila.  We went to Guam.  From Guam, we went to Kwajalein, from Kwajalein to Johnson Island, from Johnson Island to Manila, from Manila to San Francisco, two days' journey.  And I was in San Francisco.  Now, when I got to Washington--mind you, I'd been away all this time.  My wife--my little girl was born, and she was then about four--five or--no, I think Ann was, this--Ann was a year and a half old at the time.  I had never seen her.  And I got to the home of my mother and father-in-law and my wife Friday evening.  And Saturday, Saturday I called the Adjutant General's Department in Washington to find out about my status.  And I was told that the Secretary of the Army had entered an order releasing me from active duty so that I could return to the Harvard Law School.  When I turned around and told my wife about this, she almost broke down and began crying saying that I had been away all this time.  I hadn't seen my child.  Now, I'm going to Fort Benning, no Fort Devens, Massachusetts to be discharged.  And I told her, as soon as I get discharged, I'm going to the Harvard Law School.  Well, she began saying that here I'd been away all these years, hadn't seen the family.  My father-in-law who was a veteran of World War I told, he said, oh, he's only talking.  They're not gonna release him.  He'll be back.  So the following day, Sunday, I was on a train to Boston, Massachusetts.  From there to Fort Devens, Massachusetts.  And that evening, Monday, the following Monday, that evening about 5:00 or 6:00 o'clock, I was released from active duty as a captain in the United States Army for the specific purpose of returning to the Harvard Law School.  And I returned to the Harvard Law School.
Story_ID: 49233
Speaker 1: Now, you might ask, what happened?  What happened was this.  The Harvard Law School authorities had decided that any veteran who returned from the War would be given the opportunity, if he had two years of legal work to do, would be given the opportunity to study two years of law in one year.  They called it the accelerated program.  So, a day or so after I was released at Fort Benning--at Fort Devens, I was at Harvard Law School.  Not only was I at Harvard Law School, I also was financially secure.  See I had never taken a leave of absence during the time that I was in the Pacific Theater.  I was entitled to what they call "accumulated leave pay".  It came to about $5,000, accumulated leave pay.  In addition to that, when I was released from active duty in October, 1945, I had a period of what they call terminal leave, that extended to the end of March, 1946.  I had pay for all that period.  I was in comparison, well off.  So I went back to Harvard Law School, rented a room in the dormitory, Conan Hall.  In addition to that, I had the benefits of the GI Bill of Rights that paid my family's, paid my tuition at Harvard.  I was well off.  I took the two years law study in one year and in addition to that, in May 1946, before I had finished the two years of study, I took the Massachusetts bar examination.  I did it against the advice of my advisor, Professor Warren Seavey at Harvard Law School told me that I was taking a chance to take the bar examination while I was still studying at Harvard Law School.  See, this was a concentrated period of study, two years of law school in one year.  Well, I thanked Professor Warren Seavey for his advice.  I had gotten to know him quite well.  I thanked him.  I took the bar and passed, passed and was admitted to the Bar of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on October 2, 1946.  I have in my private library two documents that I treasure.  There's another one, but two documents I treasure.  One is my certificate of admission to the Bar of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which is dated October 2, 1946.  The other is my degree, Bachelor of Arts in Law LLB from Harvard Law School.  That is dated November 27, 1946.  So that I was admitted to the bar before I received my degree.
Speaker 2: I know.  I found that very curious when I read it.  I didn't know how that had happened.
Speaker 1: Well, that's how it happened.
Story_ID: 49234
Speaker 1: Did your wife, did she stay in Washington at the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my wife--here's the other thing.  My wife stayed in--remember I told you, when I got back from the War, and I told her that I was leaving to go to Cambridge [Massachusetts], oh, she cried, and oh, she, oh, she made a big (unclear) (laughter).  But her father consoled her and said, nah, don't worry.  They're not gonna let him go.  I know these [U.S.] Army people.  But he was mistaken (laughter).  He was mistaken.  I didn't come back.  I stayed at Howard [Harvard] and finished the, that one year of study.  She stayed in Washington with her mother and father.  The other thing that I wanna tell you.  I have been blessed.  You hear a lot about in laws, you know, jokes are made about in laws, but I was blessed with two of the most wonderful people in my mother-in-law and father-in-law, for reasons which--no has ever told because they never told me.  I never got wishy washy with them, you know.  They admired me, genuinely.  They were a very, very--they were pleased that I was going to finish Harvard Law School, you know, and I was gonna be a lawyer.  And they, they appreciated--they're both very well educated people.  He was a pharmacist by profession and an employee of the Library of Congress.  See, in Washington, they'd mix jobs, you know, work for the government and also follow, a lawyer or a doctor or pharmacist.  Dr. Quivas (ph.) was a pharmacist and an employee, a long-time employee of the Library of Congress.  So they kept Virginia and my two daughters, Ann and Barbara.  I went and finished Harvard Law School.  Now, you might ask me, why did you take the Massachusetts Bar like that?  What was the, what was the importance of it?  Well, the importance was this.  At that time, the rules of admission to the Bar in Illinois read that if a lawyer was a member of a bar that had the same common law tradition as Illinois, and he was a member of that bar, he could be admitted in Illinois without taking the bar examination.  I had read the rules.  And that's why, you see, I had to disobey Warren Seavey's admonition.  And I took the bar.  See, in the meantime, I was working under this pressure.  My wife and two children in Washington.  I had to finish Harvard Law School.  Low and behold, October 2, I was admitted to the bar of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts which was the goal that I had set for myself when I left New Bedford in August, 1936 (laughter).  And this was now, this was now ten years later, huh, ten years later.  I had achieved the goal.  Now, the next question came.
Speaker 1: How do you end up here, and--
Speaker 2: Ah.
Speaker 1: --because I found that so strange.  You had no contact here.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 49235
Speaker 1: Well, we were, you were getting ready to talk about the two Wilkins brothers.  I was asking you who was that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, all right.  When I returned from the War, there were six African American students, including me in the class of Harvard Law School students that consisted of something like 1,400 students.  At that time, there was no affirmative action program anywhere.  And the whole student body of the law school had these six students.  Two of them were from Chicago.  They were both the sons of J. Ennis Wilkins, Sr., and they were both brothers of J. Ennis Wilkins, Jr.  Now, J. Ennis Wilkins, Jr., by that time was well known in this country because he had been a, he had worked in the Manhattan Project to produce the Atom Bomb and was a mathematical genius, so the word was, you know.  But both Julian and Wilkins were top-ranked students at the Harvard Law School.  John was on the "Law Review", and Julian was in a group called the Student Advisory Board.  At Harvard Law School, for many, many, many years, the student population is classified into the top of the class.  The Harvard Law School, "Harvard Law Review" editors, John was one of them.  Underneath that group was the Student Advisory Board.  Julian was on that board.  Now, he's the father of David Wilkins who's now a tenured professor of law at Harvard Law School.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, that group, did you guys come together at all, you know, the people--it was such a small group of, you know, of--well, at that point, you didn't even--
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: Everyone was doing, was there to get their studies done--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  You see, when I entered Harvard Law School, I didn't live on the campus.  So that iso--that kept--see, student study groups are usually people who live together and, nah, I didn't have that.  When I got back, however, I had money to pay rent in Conan Hall.  Now, that's when I met John, Julian, and there was a African American student from Cleveland, Ohio, as I remember.  And the other one who was African American, well known, is William T. Coleman.  He had been a very well-known NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] lawyer who was a colleague of Thurgood Marshall and was on the "Harvard Law Review", along with John Wilkins, and has become a very famous lawyer and partner of one of the--(unclear) Melvaney (ph.) and some others, Bill Coleman.  I have said without much documentary proof to support my statements, that I believe that William T. Coleman and Earl L. Neal of this law firm are the two African American lawyers in the history of the United States who have been financially successful from the practice of law.  Now, there are African American lawyers, Lewis, Ronald Lewis, who gave $5 million to Harvard Law School--
Speaker 1: Reginald Lewis.
Speaker 2: Reginald Lewis, that's right.  But my understanding is, and I'm only saying this in derogation of what, my understanding, he didn't make his money practicing law.  He married a rich, French woman, and then he bought the Beatrice Company.  And he made his money that way.  Earl L. Neal and William T. Coleman have made their money practicing law, going to court, representing high-profile clients.
Speaker 1: Now, I want--so how did you--wait, I want to ask one question before it gets late. [Bishop Charles] Daddy Grace, you said he actually gave you help (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --for this and then what?
Speaker 2: He gave me, I remember, I was advised by Alfred Gomes to go see him in Washington.  And I went.  You know, he lived in one of these beautiful mansions in the District of Columbia.  He was wealthy, filthy rich, but he made all the money from poor African Americans (laughter).  He was a kind of Jerry Falwell, and who's the other guy, Jimmy Swaggart.  He was (laughter).

Speaker 1: How did you end up here in Chicago?  That's what--
Speaker 2: Well, I've explained to people how I did this.  See, when I was admitted to the bar in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I now had--I was a lawyer.  And I had a clear plan of being admitted to the Illinois Bar.  I knew New York City, and I didn't like New York, never liked New York.  I had been in the District of Columbia, went to Howard [University].  I didn't like the District of Columbia because of segregation that was prevalent in the District of Columbia.  I knew Philadelphia.  I wasn't particularly attracted to Philadelphia.  I had gone to Los Angeles on my way to Fort Huachuca, Arizona.  Then I learned something bout Chicago that sold me.  Well, two things I learned about Chicago, but the last one is what convinced me.  Chicago, as it is today, has the largest, had the largest African American population other than New York City.  But Chicago was the only place in America in 1946 that had a black person in Congress.  Now, I had met William R. Ming, Jr. when he was on the faculty at Howard Law School, and I had met him after that and at both times, William R. Ming, Jr. told me about the advantage of practicing law in Chicago, the large Negro population.  And in Chicago, even then in 1946, was all the race discrimination, the race segregation, the restrictive covenants, the fact that a black person couldn't drive a cab in the Loop of Chicago at that time, in 1946, the fact that you couldn't get a, you couldn't--a black person couldn't rent a room in a hotel in downtown Chicago in 1946.  Despite all of that.  I figured that Chicago was the place 'cause people in Chicago did things.  They bought homes, businesses, and they sent a man to Congress.  And I figured a place that would send, the only place that sent a black person to Congress was the place for me.  And that's why I came to Chicago.
Story_ID: 49237
Speaker 1: Now, what did your wife's family think of this?
Speaker 2: They didn't like it.  My wife never liked the idea--well, for one thing, Virginia was born in the District of Columbia.  Virginia was born in that culture of the District of Columbia about which you must--she was the black elite, highly misogynated blacks.  Virginia, in fact, always reminded me that she was descended from one of, I think one of the president of the United States.  I forget which one.
Speaker 1: Not Jefferson?
Speaker 2: Not Jefferson, no.  It's--
Speaker 1: But another --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The other one.
Speaker 1: Lincoln.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, I think, are there some that are going--I think, is it Washington, George Washington?
Speaker 2: Not George, no, it was somebody.  But she used to tell me that she was descended from this president.  Virginia was fair complexioned and very, very nice-looking girl, very well educated.  Her mother was a high school principal in the District of Columbia.  As I've told you, her father was a pharmacist and employee, a long-time employee of the Library of Congress in Washington.  One of her, one of her classmates was the fellow who became Senator from Massachusetts?
Speaker 1: Ed [Edward] Brooke.
Speaker 2: Ed Brooke.  Ed Brooke and Virginia were classmates in this high school--there was a high school in New Bedford--I mean in the District of Columbia where all the hoity toity went.  Well, Virginia was from that group.  She didn't like being lifted up from this environment into which she was born and brought to a wild place (laughter) like Chicago, where she knew no one.  And, oh, Virginia used to tell stories.  She was trained, educated to be a school teacher.  She was a graduate of Teachers College in the District of Columbia.  She didn't like it.  Now, her mother and her father though, though they didn't like it, but as I told you, I was blessed with something that very few people are blessed with.  My mother-in-law and father-in-law adored me, and they showed it in every way.  If we ever had a difference, for instance, when Virginia didn't like to come to Chicago, well, they sat on her and made her come.
Story_ID: 49238
Speaker 1: Now, I arrived in Chicago--I've told people that I arrived in Chicago on October 14, 1946 at 9:47 AM (laughter), and I came here only to be able to find a place where I could prove that I could be a lawyer.  My other objective was to find a way to move my family here.  So mind you, when I got here on October 14th, I didn't know anyone in Chicago.  The only contact with Chicago I had was a letter written for me by Sadie B. Alexander, who was then Secretary of the National Bar Association to Earl B. Dickerson.  That was my sole entre to Chicago.  When I left 63rd and State Street on that train, from that train, that just slowed down long enough for me to jump off the train (laughter), and I went to the Wabash Avenue YMCA at 37th and Wabash, my next thing was to go to 35th and Parkway, Parkway Avenue.  That's what it was called in 1946, to see Earl B. Dickerson.  And I went there.  Earl was then general counsel of the--
Speaker 2: Supreme Life?
Speaker 1: Supreme Life Insurance Company, yeah.  And I went there, and I formed a friendship that lasted until Earl died.  And Earl immediately took to me.  We got to be good friends, except he had no work for me.  He was not, he was not a practicing lawyer.  He was general counsel of Supreme Life Insurance Company.  However, after walking all over the South side of Chicago, from October 14 until the, oh, the middle of November, a lawyer who had graduated from Harvard Law School, told me that a law office at 35th and State--there used to be a building there called Binga Bank Building.  Well, told me that there was a law firm in that building called Temple and Wimbish. And he told me that a lawyer in that office had suddenly disappeared.  Nobody knew what became of him.  Nobody could find him and C.C. Wimbish was tearing his hair.  He said, go talk to C.C.  So I went, 35th and State and met Christopher C. Wimbish.  Did you know him?
Story_ID: 49239
Speaker 1: I know he was a state representative, right?
Speaker 2: He was a State Senator.
Speaker 1: State senator, and he was first black senator--was he the first black senator?  No, no, no.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know because--he was a --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: He was a state--but there was something special about him.  I'm sorry, yes.
Speaker 2: He was a state--let me tell you about that.  As I told you, I hit it off with C. C. Wimbish--
Speaker 1: No, Earl Dickerson, you said you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, first with Earl.  Then I, when I met C. C. Wimbish, I also had a wonderful--as if I had known him all my life.  We became good friends.  He let me come into this office at 35th and State, and that's where I began.  He told me his name was C. C. Wimbish, that stood for Cold Cash Wimbish (laughter).  So he said, look, you can come to my office.  I'm not gonna pay you any salary.  We don't pay salaries.  You come here, be here early in the morning.  And he said, nine times out of 10, there'd be somebody here whose husband's just been shot or shot somebody or somebody raped somebody or robbed somebody for one thing or the other.  They need somebody to go to court.  And I'll send you.  And that's how I started.  Well, do you know, from that day until--now, mind you, this was 1946.  Again, my wife and two daughters were in Washington, D.C.  Well, do you know from that November until around May, I think it was May of '47' [1947], I had made enough money to buy a two-flat building at 1615 S. St. Louis Avenue, way in the West side.  In those days, it was hard to find a building that had a vacant apartment.  Well, I'd found this one, and I bought this two-flat building and brought Virginia and the two girls here.  Virginia never liked Chicago.  She didn't like it.  But because I wanted here, she came, came with the two girls, put her in school--put those two girls in school.  And Virginia began teaching, first in the Chicago Public Schools.  Then she left the Chicago Public Schools and taught in the parochial schools.  She taught at St. Edmonds [Episcopal Church] at Michigan and 61st Street.  And, but she never really liked Chicago.  And I believe that that dislike, that constant struggle, here I am, struggling to make a headway in Chicago, you know, and--but she stood it.  And, but I think it had a part in shortening her life.  I believe that.
Story_ID: 49240
Speaker 1: She just--well, it's a different environment here--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --I'm thinking.  You know, you--if you like that environment, this would be, because (unclear), there's a lot of people, you know, still coming into the city, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yes.  And, and the times were a whole lot different.  I look at Chicago now.  As I told you, when I got here, blacks could not drive a cab or a vehicle in the Loop.  That's why you had the Jitney's [cabs], you know.  Also, the restaurants in downtown Chicago didn't serve black people.  The hotels didn't rent rooms to black people in the 1940s.
Story_ID: 49241
Speaker 1: So now, who were the lawyers of the day, sort of around town?  Who did you, you know, besides these--
Speaker 2: I got to know all of them, almost all of them.
Speaker 1: Can you give some of their names?
Speaker 2: Yes, I can.  In Chicago, in the 1940s when I got here, Chicago had a total black lawyer population that numbered between 300 and 400.  And they were well knit, the Cook County Bar Association had then been founded.  Black lawyers couldn't join Chicago Bar Association, nor the Illinois Bar Association.  This was the picture when I get here.  One thing that I did that helped me out was that when I decided to come to Chicago, I wrote a letter to Walter White, who was then national secretary of the NAACP.  In the course of my education, both at Howard and at Harvard Law School, I read a lot about what the NAACP had been doing in the school segregation problem, and the racial discrimination in the employment of teachers and so forth and in the struggle, which was the primary struggle of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1940s, the struggle against the race restrictive covenants.  So I wrote a letter to Walter White and asked him if I could come and see him when I was on my way from Cambridge to Washington.  And I stopped at the National Office of the NAACP.  I think it was October 4, 1946.  Walter White was very courteous to me.  You know, he was a very friendly kind of person.  And then he told me, said, you know, there's an important meeting going on right now in our office.  Some of the leading lawyers in the United States are in that meeting.  Maybe you'd like to stick--listen to what's going on.  So I walked into the room, and who was there?  William H. Hastie, William R. Ming, Jr., whom I had met at Howard University, James Nabrit, who was then secretary of Howard University.  I knew Dr. Nabrit, Charles Houston was there.  Then in the middle of all that, in walked this big burley fellow.  And Walter White introduced me to Thurgood Marshall.  And that's how I met Thurgood.  And I then told Thurgood, and I told Walter White that when I got to Chicago I wanted to be active in the NAACP, and I became active in the NAACP.  Earl B. Dickerson was active in the NAACP.  So after I met C. C. Wimbish, who was in politics, I then joined the NAACP here in Chicago.  And as I have said to people by way of appreciation, from the day that I stepped foot in Chicago, October 14, 1946, the people of Chicago have accepted me.  They gave me a chance to practice law.  No sooner I was here, after I entered C. C. Wimbish's office, I was at 26th and California, representing black people in serious crimes.  I had never represented people before.  But they gave me the chance.
Story_ID: 49242
Speaker 1: So what did you learn those early years of representation?  You really got to know your way around the criminal court system?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  That's where I practiced.  Twenty-sixth and California.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what learned during that time about lawyering?  I mean you had not really represented anyone before?
Speaker 2: No, I had never.  I just--it was a hands-on training.  And, of course, I was willing to take the chance, and I did.
Speaker 1: Was it--what you--were you at all disappointed about what you were doing?
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: But you--'cause had--was this what you had anticipated doing?
Speaker 2: This is what I wanted.  See, I've told you law students.  Today, they go to big law schools.  They come, and they're looking for jobs in the big white firms.  I never looked for one.  One reason why I never looked for a job in a white firm is because of a conversation I had with William T. Coleman who told me that he was interviewed by a law firm in New York City.  And they told him they were willing to give him a job in their law office, but there was an important condition.  He asked them, what is the condition?  And they told him, that you cannot come in contact with our clients.  So I told Bill Coleman, that's a hell of a way to practice law (laughter), practice law so you don't come in contact with clients.  So I never looked for a job with a firm.  I wanted to do exactly what happened.  I wanted to go to the criminal court, stand side-by-side with someone who needed defense.  I learned it case by case, and I practiced law in that building for 18 years, jury trial, non-jury.  A month after I began practicing, I argued a murder case in the Supreme Court of Illinois.  So I took all chances.  I took all the opportunities.  And I became almost a specialist in death-penalty cases.  I learned that hands on, went all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States in several cases, established the rule of law in several important cases.
Story_ID: 49243
Speaker 1: Sir, can you talk about some of those cases, you know, your important cases?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of the most important ones was a case called, Townsend v. Sain.  One of the burning issues of that time--this was 1951-'52' [1952], was what right does a person who's convicted in a state court have to be heard in the federal court about the constitutionality of the conviction.  Well, Townsend v. Sain settled that question.  And Justice Earl B. Warren wrote the opinion for the majority, ruling that if a person is convicted in a state court, and he raised a constitutional issue, like race discrimination, systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury, coerced confession--by the way, which was common, but he didn't get a fair hearing about it, he could go to a federal court, file a petition for habeas corpus.  And if the federal judge saw that he was not given a fair hearing about this constitutional question, he's entitled to a plenary hearing in the federal court.  Now, that's a very important rule of law.  I had--I argued that Ciucci v. Illinois.  Ciucci was a white man who was convicted of murdering his wife and three children.  They prosecuted him first for the murder of his wife.  He was convicted, but he was sentenced to twenty years in the penitentiary.  Then he was prosecuted for the murder of one of the daughters, and he was convicted and he was sentenced, I think to forty years.  Then he was prosecuted for the murder of the son, and this time, they sentenced him to death.  I took his case to the Supreme Court of the United States on the contention that he was subjected to serial prosecutions only for the purpose of getting a death sentence.  The Supreme Court of the United States took the case and sent it back for hearing.  Despite that, Ciucci was finally executed after about ten years in which I represented him without fee.
Story_ID: 49244
Speaker 1: I also took a case to the Supreme Court of the United States called Napue v. Illinois.  Napue versus Illinois involved a case in which a black man was prosecuted for the murder of a police officer, and when the state got around to prosecuting him, they brought from Stateville [Penitentiary] who was allegedly with him when this police officer was killed.  And when he came to the witness chair, the lawyer for Napue asked, why did it take you so long to come from the lock-up to the witness chair?  Isn't it true, the lawyer asked him, that you and this prosecutor standing right here, have an agreement?  He said, oh, no, it isn't true.  Isn't it true that he has told you that if you testify against my client and he is found guilty, your sentence of 199 years will be reduced?  Oh, no, that's not true.  So, the jury went in, found Napue guilty, and Napue was sentenced to the penitentiary for 199 years.  About twenty years later Napue was in the yard of Stateville, and a buddy of his said to him, you know, Henry, your name was in the "Tribune" [Chicago Tribune] this morning.  Henry said, what for?  He said, do you remember the guy who testified against you?  Yeah, I remember that so and so, sure.  Well, the prosecutor is now his lawyer, and the prosecutor says that he had a deal with him to testify against you and his sentence was gonna be reduced, but the state hasn't done that.  So the prosecutor is now representing the witness to get his sentence reduced.  So Henry said, why that so and so.  My lawyer asked him that question.  And he said it wasn't true.  Well, I took that case to the Supreme Court of the United States, and again, Mr. Justice Warren wrote--
Story_ID: 49480
Speaker 1: So you said the judge ruled.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in an opinion by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Earl Warren, the Court held that when a prosecutor calls a witness and then he stand right there in the courtroom, and hear the witness lie when the defense asked him a question, the prosecutor has the duty to speak up.  And this prosecutor stood right there while the defense lawyer from Napue asked him, asked his witness, "Don't you have a deal with his prosecutor that if you testify against my client and he's convicted, your sentence is gonna be reduced?"  And he said, no.  Twenty years later, the prosecutor represents the witness to get his sentence reduced.  Napue was released from custody as a result.
Speaker 1: Well, that was historic too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well, you know, that case still stands as a principle of law.  Lawyers all over the country know that if you call a witness--and by the way, in my lectures to my law students, I explain to them, it doesn't matter whether it's a criminal case or a civil case.  If a lawyer calls a witness and when the witness is cross examined, the lawyer hears the witness tell a lie, that lawyer can't simply say, well, you know, after all, life is what it is (laughter).  He can't do that.  He has to speak up.  Now, the question is, how does the lawyer speak up?  Well, that depends on the circumstances.  The good lawyer, the real professional can always find a way.  John Branion who was the public defender in Cook County for many years did it before me a number of times.  And whenever John Branion had a witness who lied, John Branion would stand up in all his dignity and say, "Your Honor, I would like to have the jury excused."  All right, excuse the jury.  Then when the jury has left the courtroom, John Branion would say, "Your Honor, I regret to inform the Court that my client has lied.  I wish to have him corrected.  Now, if you'll let me talk with him, I'll explain to him, and I'll ask him to retract the lie.  And that's taken care of, you see.  That's how it's done.
Speaker 1: So, now, what strikes me is that, who--well, I wanna ask this question.  Who was mentoring you along?  I mean it's--
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Yeah, who was mentoring you?  Was there mentoring, because you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But, you were, you were--this is, let's see.  This is, these cases that we're talking about--and I'm wondering, like the "Trumbull" case.  Did that come before--
Speaker 2: Which one?
Speaker 1: The "Trumbull" case.
Speaker 2: Oh, Trumbull Park.
Speaker 1: Trumbull Park, I'm sorry.  That was before, that was not very long after you had come here, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was not, it--the Trumbull case occurred--
Speaker 1: That was part of NAACP.
Story_ID: 49481
Speaker 1: That's right.  And by the way, that case and the Harvey Clark case, you see, we live today, and we really don't appreciate a lot of things.  When I arrived in Chicago in 1946, it wasn't uncommon for you to go to 63rd Street and the Sheriff of Cook County was moving out a black family from a house that the black man had paid for, only because in the title of the property, there was a race restrictive covenant.  And the Sheriff of Cook County, the law enforcer of Cook County was taking all the goods of this black man and his wife and his children, setting them out in the street.  I stood and watched that a number of times, and it galled me.  Also, something that has now drifted into--not that it doesn't happen, but it's drifted out of public attention, the policy and practices of the Chicago Housing Authority.  They maintained segregated housing.  Now, in "Donald"--in the "Trumbull Park" case, I forget the name of the, Donald Moore?
Speaker 2: Donald Howard.
Speaker 1: Donald Howard.   Donald Howard was a black man, but his wife was so fair that you couldn't tell that she was black.  She was part black, but she was fair-skinned, and she went to the Chicago Public Housing office, applied for an apartment, and they gave her the apartment and assigned her to Trumbull Park.  So that evening, when she went to move in, in comes her little kids and her husband.  All hell broke loose at Trumbull Park.  White people rioted.  They began setting fires to the place.  For weeks, it was a cause celebre I ended up filing a lawsuit against the Chicago Housing Authority about that incident concerning, because they then wanted to move the Trumbull, the whole Howard family out.  Well, that riot went on and on for months and months, and finally, it subsided.  Now, the other one, just before that was the "Harvey Clark" case in Cicero.  I was then president of the Chicago branch, NAACP.  And I was a member of the Legal Redress Committee.  And Harvey Clark came to me and told me that he and his wife had rented an apartment from a woman named Camille DiRose (ph.) in Cicero and Camille DiRose had accepted $50.00 for one month's rent of the apartment.  And he said he and his wife and his two little kids went to Cicero to move into the apartment, and the police officers of Cicero wouldn't let them move in.  And he wanted me to tell them whether that was right.  Did he have a right to move into the apartment?  Well, I said, well, the landlord accepted your $50.00.  It's your apartment for $50.00 (laughter), fifty dollars' worth of apartment (laughter).  And no police officer has any right to stop you.  Well, I filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court against the town of Cicero and the police officers and went before John Potts Barnes who was the U. S. District judge for an injunction against the Town of Cicero and its police, to restrain them from interfering with Harvey Clark moving into his apartment.  Judge Barnes agreed with me, granted the order and told the attorney from Cicero, he said, "I'm looking at my watch.  It's now 11:00 o'clock.  I'm gonna order this family escorted to that apartment by some Marshalls, and I want you to do as much to put 'em in that apartment as you've been doing to keep 'em out.
Story_ID: 49482
Speaker 1: So that afternoon (laughter), Harvey Clark and his two little kids and his wife and his goods were (laughter) escorted to Cicero.  This time, a mob assembled, and they set fire to the building.  Governor, oh,--
Speaker 2: Who was governor at the time?  I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Oh, a very famous governor whose son later was senator--
Speaker 2: Stevenson?
Speaker 1: Stevenson, yeah, Governor Stevenson called out the National Guard.  Harvey Clark never moved into the building.  Now, I tell you that to show you the climate in which black people lived in the period 1940 to 1964 when I became a judge, couldn't drive a cab in the Loop, couldn't eat a meal in the Loop, no matter how well you were off, and you could pay for it, couldn't rent a room in the Loop.  And also, no black person worked in any job in the Loop other than as a janitor or, or someone to wash the floors.
Story_ID: 49483
Speaker 1: Now, sir, I also want you to just touch a little bit about the importance of the NAACP during this period because they were active--you know, everyone knows about "Brown versus Board of Education", but there were a lot of moves they were involved in coordinating--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --around--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Let me tell you.  Every time something like this happened, NAACP and the churches--see, some people forget.  The Negro church, the African American churches in this country have played a very important part in this process we call Civil Rights.  You know, it's a vague term.  The whole community of Chicago and the South side of Chicago rose up about this, about Trumbull Park, about the treatment of Harvey Clark and his family.  Let me tell you an interesting thing that happened about Cicero.  As I told you, Harvey Clark and his wife never moved into that apartment.  So, about a year after that John Boyle convened a grand jury.  You know, there was a lot of talk about--convened a grand jury to find out how this riot started.  You know, now, of course, if they had asked me, I would have told them that these white folks just simply rioted and set the building on fire.  It's that simple.  They didn't want black folks in Cicero.  They still don't.  So (laughter), the grand jury was convened.  And I was subpoenaed to testify before that grand jury because I was the lawyer who had represented Harvey Clark.  So the grand jury foreman asked me the question.  He asked me, "Why did you tell this black man and this black woman that they had the right to move into Cicero?"  I said, well, sir, there's a very simple answer to your question because the Constitution and laws of the United States said so.  It was his apartment.  Now, he hadn't moved in, but he had paid for it.  And I told him, it'd be different if the landlady hadn't rented him the apartment, say he was a trespasser.  You know, I can understand a trespasser going to Cicero (laughter), black trespasser, he could cause a lot of riots, yeah.  But the man had paid for the apartment.  They returned an indictment.  You know who they indicted?  Me.  I was the chief defendant in the indictment.  Well, that indictment caused a stir in Chicago because all I had done, I was president of the local branch [NAACP].  I was a lawyer, I represented the family.  I advised them, and I had said the Constitution and laws of the United States said that man had a right to move into his apartment.

Speaker 1: Well, that indictment of me, charging me with a conspiracy with several people, with Camille DiRose and other people, some Communists I had never met, didn't know anything about, that indictment taught me a very important lesson.  It taught me firsthand, how it feels to be charged with a crime you know you didn't commit because I knew that I hadn't committed a crime.  And also, I spent many sleepless nights worrying about the possibility that even though I was innocent, even though I hadn't committed a crime, I would have spent some time in jail because I had represented a lot of people who had suffered that experience.  Well, to the credit of the Illinois Bar in Chicago, white and black, they rallied around me.  Even the "Tribune" wrote an editorial against that indictment.  Finally, came the day before Judge Wilbert Crowley, when Thurgood Marshall, Loren B. Moore, William R. Ming, Jr., Charles Bellows, George Bieber (ph.), any number of white and black lawyers in Chicago were in that courtroom, and Thurgood argued that motion to dismiss, and Judge Wilbert Crowley granted the motion and dismissed the indictment.  However, if you go to the records of the criminal division of the Circuit Court of Cook County, look at the history of all the people who have been indicted in Illinois, in Cook County, you'll find my name there.  It's still there, all because I told the black man that because (laughter) you had rented an apartment, you have a right to move into it. That's the climate in which we lived in Chicago, from 1946.  There was no FEPC [Fair Employment Practices Commission].  Race discrimination in employment was rampant.  Police brutality that you hear complained about today was running rampant in Chicago.  It was common for a black man to be arrested on his way home and no one hear from him for several days.  They'd look him up at 11th and State and wouldn't let anybody talk with him, very common brutality by police.  That was the rule of the time.  Also, when I got here in Chicago, black lawyers couldn't be members of the Chicago Bar Association.  And I think there was only one black face on the courts of Cook County, the only black--one.  His name was, I think his name was Brown--he was a Municipal Court judge.  Then next came Wendell Green, and he, for a long time was the only black face on the Circuit Court of Cook County.  Today, there're so many black persons serving, men and women, that I don't even know how many of 'em.
Speaker 2: Now, did you have occasion to come in contact with Robert Carter, Judge--he's now Judge Robert Carter, because he was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I knew Bob Carter.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: I knew Bob Carter when he was general counsel of the NAACP.  I knew Bob Carter when he was on the staff of Thurgood Marshall.  In fact, I think Bob was on Thurgood's staff at the time of the "Clark" case.  Yeah, I knew Bob.  I knew him after he became a judge.  Now, he's a senior judge now.  I don't know if he's active at all.  Do you know him?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, we interviewed him for this project.
Speaker 1: Oh, you did.
Speaker 2: That's why I'm asking 'cause I know that he--(simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 49485
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) Well, yeah, well, Bob Carter was a--you see, times have changed.  The NAACP was a moving force in African American society in this country.  And that organization did change things, the struggle against lynching, the struggle against race discrimination, in employment in the schools.  That's where it started, and also with the grandfather clauses, that in the Southern communities were used to disenfranchise black persons.  And Bob was in that.  The other person you might have interviewed is Constance Baker Motley.
Speaker 2: We're trying.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: We're trying.
Speaker 1: Trying?
Speaker 2: We haven't had luck yet (laughter).  We're--
Speaker 1: Well, I knew her.  You know, she was a protege of Thurgood Marshall.  I knew her when she was a NAACP lawyer in Mississippi.  And I had a case in Mississippi, "Goldsby versus Harpole".  I represented Goldsby.  And Goldsby was sentenced to death by a jury from which members of his race were systematically excluded.  And I set aside his conviction in the Fifth Circuit.  Yeah, argued that case in Oxford, Mississippi, and argued it in New Orleans and the opinion was issued, and I use that case in my law teaching, an example of the use of the law, setting aside what is a race discriminatory conviction.  Yeah.  Now, the interesting thing is that in Chicago, by the time I got here, the overt, the overt cases of discrimination like they had in the deep South had taken a different form, you see.  But it's just--you know, whether discrimination is overt or covert, it doesn't make any difference.  The person suffers just as much.
Story_ID: 49486
Speaker 1: But see, my question is, I mean you--you know, this, well, there were people out, you know, practicing.  I mean, you know, blacks practicing, but they weren't necessarily involved in seminal cases, like yourself.  You had precedent-setting cases.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, but, you know, since you said that, there's another respect in which things have changed in Chicago.  In the days that I practiced law, we had lawyers like Joe Clayton.  Joe Clayton was considered one of the outstanding criminal lawyers in this country.  The other one we had was Euclid Taylor.  He was famous.  Now, Euclid, unfortunately, was famous for a lot of other things too, but he was an expert in the defense of criminal cases, no question about it.  He was the showman.  See, if you look over the Bar today, you don't find people like a Euclid Taylor, a Skinny McDonald.  You don't see them.  Now, whether that's good or bad, I'm not sure.  But there's something to be said for the livelihood, the lively way the law was practiced by these fellows, like Skinny McDonald, Charlie Bellows, George Bieber, Brodkin (ph.).  They used to call them the "B" Boys, Bieber, Brodkin, Bossy, and some other name.  They were terrors in the courtroom when it came to criminal cases.  Today, the closest person to that kind of thing that I know of is James Montgomery.  I think Jim Montgomery, in my judgment, is the outstanding African American lawyer in Chicago today.  He's a good lawyer in civil or criminal cases.  It's a lesson to watch Jim handle a case in court.  I think what has brought this kind of demise among lawyers, among African American lawyers in Chicago, is this notion that they learn early in law school that the goal is to be in some big white firm.  Now, the trouble with that is, when you get into the big white firm, you don't get down to the nitty-gritty.  You don't get to practice, you don't get to represent the little guy who needs a lawyer and can't afford to pay one (laughter), you know.  And also, when you get into that gray flannel suit syndrome, you don't become members of NAACP or the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] or you're gonna--you don't go representing people in the UAW [United Auto Workers].  You don't do that because representing big corporations is a different kind of thing.  And, thus, you don't hear about them.  You get into t a big white firm, no one ever hears about you anymore.  There's no, there's no attention paid when you're handling multi-million dollar stock transactions (laughter) or bonds, you know.  There's nothing like that--it's just pushing paper around.
Story_ID: 49487
Speaker 1: But I--you had, you came here and within the, at least like the first really seven years, really start establishing a name for yourself.
Speaker 2: Well, you see what I did, I had an instinct for things that attracted attention.  Right away, as soon as I got to Chicago, I decided I had to do something that lawyers don't like to do, namely, write briefs, argue cases on appeal, represent someone who's charged with murdering his wife and three children.  That's always attracts attention (laughter).  By the way, in that Ciucci case, I learned something about human nature, that if you kill your wife and three children, and you get tried for killing your wife, they'll never sentence you to death (laughter) because killing a wife is not considered that heinous.  But if you kill your children, they'll sentence you to death for that, but not for killing your wife (laughter).  This is what happened to Ciucci.  See, they didn't get to give him the death sentence until he had been convicted of killing his son (laughter).
Speaker 1: That says something about society at that time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  So, now, you--let's take you to when you actually, you start--you came together with a firm, right?  You were working with, first you started with C. C. Wimbish.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then, you--what happened--and you were making decent money too--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, I--yes, so much so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Basically cash--(simultaneous)--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Now, let me--
Speaker 1: Okay, I could be (unclear)--
Story_ID: 49488
Speaker 1: Let me tell you something.  You asked me a question that brings me to tell you something that very few people know about.  I was very, very fortunate in meeting Christopher C. Wimbish.  He was the excellence of a politician.  He held political clout.  He was a colleague and close working operative with William L. Dawson.  That is something that has changed a great deal.  In those days, politics in Chicago was monolithic.  It was controlled on the top by a very few people.  One of them was William L. Dawson, and the other, of course, was William--Richard J. Daley, and then there were others.  Corneal Davis was another one, Fred Smith who was the husband of Margaret Smith who's now a state senator also in her own right, and, however, despite my good fortune of being in that circle, I never really appreciated what it was that I had achieved.  I knew Dawson, and then one day, without anybody explaining to me, I was called and told that I had a job as Assistant Illinois Attorney General.  Now, this was 1949.  I had been in Chicago only three years, and here I was, an Assistant Illinois Attorney General.  Now, the plain fact was, even though I didn't know it, that was a patronage job.  It's a political job.  It was given to me, not because I had any ability of any kind because I knew the political guys, Dawson, Wimbish, and, of course, it was approved by Mayor Daley.  So I went, took the job, was there about a year.  And I got tired of it.  I couldn't shake off my private clients.  So without talking with Mayor Daley, without talking to Mayor Daley, without talking with C. C. Wimbish, without talking with William L. Dawson, I resigned; went back to my office and C. C. Wimbish came to see me.  I cannot tell you the vulgarity that he heaped upon me.  He said, well, you are an ungrateful, no good, so and so.  He said, you were given this job.  This was one of our political patronage jobs, and you would resign without talking to us.  He said, you don't know, Dawson is down on you.  Dawson has said that you're just like every highfalutin, Harvard Law School graduate.  You're above everybody else, and he's not gonna talk with you again.  I said, well, Senator, I'm sorry to hear that.  I said, I really, and just to be frank with you, I just hadn't thought it through.  It was easy for me to go say, look, Congressman, I'd like to go back to my [practice]--he would have said, yes.  Well, do you know that that incident, of my resigning that job had an historical impact in the history of the federal judiciary because, in 1960, John Fitzgerald Kennedy was elected President of the United States, and just before he was elected, he had a meeting with leading lawyers, black lawyers in America, including Thurgood Marshall, Bob Carter, all these people.  They met in, both in New York and in Washington.  And John Fitzgerald Kennedy promised those lawyers, including, oh, the fellow from Chicago who was a bankruptcy judge, Ed--I can't think of his name now.  He was a bankruptcy judge here in Chicago.  He promised them that he was gonna do something about this failure of all presidents of the United States, until his time.
Story_ID: 49489
Speaker 1: John Kennedy promised the National Bar Association lawyers and this large group of lawyers who met with him that if he were elected president, he would correct this situation that had existed throughout American history.  Never had there been a black lawyer made a United States District judge or any Article III judge within the continental limits of the United States.  See, a lot of people miss this point.  It isn't true that James B. Parsons was the first black judge in the federal court.  William H. Hastie was the first one.  William H. Hastie, however, was a United States District judge in the Virgin Islands, and that is not the continental limits of the United States.  And furthermore, one or two other judges, black persons had been judges in the administrative agencies.  Now, now, because of this, when John Kennedy got to be president--and here is the connection, the question came up.  Who was gonna be the first African American to be made a judge of a United States District Court within the continental limits of the United States.  Well, by that time, and this was now 1960, I was well known in Chicago.  I handled cases in the Supreme Court of the United States.  I'd done this, that, you know.  I, for one thing, I'd been active.  By that time, things had changed.  Black lawyers were admitted to the Chicago Bar Association.  I became the first African American to sit on the Board of Managers of the Chicago Bar.  I became the librarian of the Chicago Bar.  I had had cases all over.  It came down to two persons, James Benton Parsons and George N. Leighton.  You know what happened?  William L. Dawson said, no, Leighton (laughter), Leighton is the kind of guy who would take a job from us and then resign without talking to us.  And they selected Jim.  And Jim became the first African American to be a judge in the United States District Court in the continental limits of the United States.  In other words, he became the first lifetime federal judge.  See, there are two kinds of federal judges.  There're the lifetime federal judges.  Those federal judges are provided for in Article III of the Constitution.  They're nominated by the president.  They're confirmed and they become lifetime judges.  Now, there're other judges like INS Administrative Law judges and so forth.  Those judges serve for terms that are fixed, some eight years, some 15 years and so forth.  They're not lifetime.  And Jim Benton Parson became the first African American to be an Article III judge in the United States.
Story_ID: 49490
Speaker 1: So, Judge Leighton, how did that make you feel, though, when you--because did you ever try to go back to Dawson--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Oh, let me tell you.  It was easy.  No, what I did, no, because, frankly, he was right.  I am mature enough to know.  He was right.  And, frankly, I wouldn't have done it for--I just--you know, the truth is, I didn't realize what an important thing had happened to me.  You know, I was president of the Third Ward Regular Democratic Organization.  Well, anybody will tell you from that, you could go a lot of places in Chicago [Illinois] at the time of Richard J. Daley [Mayor Richard J. Daley].  This is how Richard J. Daley got to know me.  See, I got to be a close friend of Richard J. Daley.  So I realized that I had done wrong, and I--so what I did, what I did, you know, this also has changed.  You know, in the days of Dawson, when Dawson was in Chicago on Saturdays, usually Saturday, there was a ritual.  Everybody went to the Second Ward on East 35th--35th and Indiana.  The Dawson building is still there.  It was a ritual.  It was a religious ritual.  Everybody went to see Dawson.  Lines would form all the way down to the street.  So I went, I stood in line and went to him.  And I told him, I said, Congressman, I want you to know, I talked with C. C. [Wimbish], and I wanna tell you that I, I made a mistake.  Ah, he said, ah, forget it Leighton.  So that when Daley called me to ask me if I would be a state court judge, when he called me, it was with Dawson's permission (laughter).  This is how I became a Circuit Court judge, you see.  But it was a mistake that I made.
Story_ID: 49491
Speaker 1: Did you like being a judge when you became a judge?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Did you find, though, that you were--but you were in the Circuit Court system at that point?
Speaker 2: I first started off, I was elected to a term of six years as a Circuit Court judge, and Richard J. Daley called me and asked me if I would accept the position.  I then accepted it.  I was in the Circuit Court a year and a half, and they transferred me from the Criminal Division.  See, I had the experience of sitting on the bench at 26th and California where I had practiced for eighteen years.  Then they transferred me to the Daley Center, then called the Civic Center, a building that had just been finished.  I was in the Law-Jury Division for a short time when I was put in the Chancery Division, prestigious assignment.  Then one day I got a phone call from the Chief Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court asking me if I'd be willing to serve as a Justice of the Illinois Appellate Court.  I accepted that, and that was the first time in the history of Illinois that a minority ever sat on the Appellate Court.  I served there for seven years.  Then Congressman Percy [Charles Percy] called me, invited me to his office.  So I went, and he asked me--now, mind you, he's a Republican.  I'm a Democrat, and he asked me if I would accept the nomination to be a lifetime district judge.  And I did.  I was confirmed by a Senate controlled by Republicans.  I was nominated by Gerald Ford, a Republican president.  And I served for twelve years.  Now, see this is quite a review.  Here, I came to Chicago, just looking for a chance to practice law.  And I served as president of the Chicago branch [NAACP] and did this and that, handled cases, became a Circuit Court judge, Illinois Appellate Court Justice, then a lifetime federal judge, all because of the people of Chicago [Illinois].  That's what that--that's the explanation.
Story_ID: 49492
Speaker 1: Now, you--before we go to you being, you know, becoming a federal judge, I wanna go back because you have some important cases.  You had one very well-known client, maybe I would say--
Speaker 2: What's that again?
Speaker 1: Your client, Sam Giancana.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: You have to talk about that because (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well, let me explain to you.  First and foremost, I didn't know Sam Giancana or anyone with a reputation like his.  However, it shows you.  One thing leads to another.  I had represented Harvey Clark against the Town of Cicero.  And that is because I also was active in the prosecution of the police chief of Cicero, who was convicted in the federal court.  A judge named Daniel Covelli, who, by the way was a judge in the Napue case, and was also the judge in the case of Earl Howard Pugh, who I got out of the Stateville Penitentiary after he had served seventeen years for a murder that he didn't commit.  Corvelli remembered that case.  So one day I had returned to Chicago from Western, Illinois where I represented Lloyd Alvin Miller, a white taxicab driver who was sentenced to death for murdering a white girl, a little eight-year old girl.  And he had been convicted on perjured testimony.  I came back to Chicago after doing this for the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] without compensation or anything.  And I had a phone call from Daniel Corvelli, telling me he wanted to see me in his chambers right away.  As I explained to the FBI agents, there is a tradition among lawyers that if a judge calls you and asks you to come to his chambers, you go.  So I went to Judge Corvelli's chambers, and there was a very handsome man, turned out to be Tony Teshee, Italian.  You know, how Italian men can--you know, he's typical actor.  Tony was a very attractive man, and Judge Corvelli said to me--now, mind you, here I am black lawyer.  And here's a white judge and a white man sitting right there, and he said to me, I have told Mr. Teeshee that you are the only lawyer I know of in Chicago who would represent a member of his family about a problem he has.  And I'm recommending that you take the case.  I said, well, thank you, Judge.  He said, take Mr. Teeshee to your office, talk with him.  He'll explain to you what it is.  I said, all right, thank you, Judge.  So we left.  When Tony Teeshee got to my office, he told me what the case was about.  He told me that his father-in-law, Sam Giancana, was being followed every day of the week, everywhere that he went, whether he went to church, went to a mall or went to play golf or went to the Mausoleum that his wife is in, there would be four FBI agents right after him.  He asked me if I would go meet Sam Giancana.  I said, sure.  He said, Sam and I would like to have you represent him.  We think you would be willing to file a lawsuit against J. Edgar Hoover and restrain them.  Like you got the injunction against the Cicero police, you can get one against the FBI.  I said, I'll go.  So he drove me to Oak Park [Illinois], and I went to this sumptuous mansion in Oak Park, and met Sam Giancana.
Story_ID: 49493
Speaker 1: All around this home were squad cars, unmarked, but you could hear them communicating with each other, you know.  I came to the conclusion that the government of the United States, the great democracy that we talk about was violating the rights of this Sam Giancana and his three daughters.  He had three, very beautiful, Italian daughters, you know.  So I told him--he said, would you represent me?  I said, sure I'd represent you.  So he turned to Tony Teeshee.  He said, you take care of everything.  Let Mr. Leighton represent me.  And he told me, he said, anything you want, any amount of money, any expenses, just tell Tony.  So I went.  I walked outside, and went to these agents who were all around this house, and told 'em, "Gentlemen, I now represent Mr. Sam Giancana.  And I'm ordering you to take all these cars, you see here, and remove from here immediately.  Hah, hah, hah, they began laughing at me.  One of them knew me and said, "Oh, boy, this is really funny.  George Leighton representing Sam Giancana.  What would Thurgood Marshall say?"  (Laughter)  So I went back to my office, and I sent them a telegram, including J. Edgar Hoover, to move those cars and those agents.  They didn't do it.  A few days later, I filed a lawsuit against J. Edgar Hoover, and Marlin Johnson to obtain an injunction to restrain them from interfering with Sam Giancana's personal liberty.  You see, they hadn't arrested him.  They hadn't charged him with a crime.  I concluded that they were restricting his personal liberty without his having done anything that they could say.  And that was unconstitutional.  That was my theory.  So as luck would have it, the case went before Judge Richard B. Austin.  Now, when I talked with Sam Giancana, I told him, I'd be able to represent you and willing to represent you but there're certain conditions.  He said, what are they?  I said, first and foremost, when you go to court with me, I don't want you to have a hat in front of your face.  He said, I won't do that.  That's fine.  I said, second, when I need you as a witness, I want you to testify.  He said, sure I'll do that.  Okay.  I said, of course, third, there will be expenses and fees.  No problem.  Fine.  The first thing I did, I employed a movie company here in Chicago, and I asked them, first thing in the morning, tomorrow morning, have a crew, camera crew to photograph and record everything these agents were doing so that when Sam Giancana walked out of his house to go to the shopping mall, there were four agents right behind him.  I had all that recorded.  And here's the other thing.  I asked him, I said, now, what do you do on Sundays?  He said, well, the first thing I do, I go to mass at the Cathedral.  And then he said, when I get through mass, I then go to the Mausoleum where my wife is.  And I say a prayer.  Then I come back.  I dress.  I go play golf.  So I had them photograph all of that.  Now, the other thing I told the agents of the United States who came to interview me when I was named to a federal judge, I said, I challenge you.  You find me another man, another man, another American male, who every Sunday goes to mass and then goes to the Mausoleum where his wife's remains are, you'll find--you tell me who he is.  You won't find one like that.  Now, this is the criminal that they tell the public about, you know.  Well, when I got through presenting the whole thing to Judge Austin, Judge Austin issued the injunction.  Then another thing happened.
Story_ID: 49494
Speaker 1: When I had the film showed to Judge Austin, showing how they followed Sam Giancana, had his home photographed twenty-four hours a day, one thing that I had to prove was that the agents in that photograph, or the men in that photograph, were FBI agents.  So I thought of the bright idea of calling Marvin Johnson--Marlin Johnson, who was the agent in charge in Chicago.  So I called him.  "All right, Mr. Johnson, take the stand," said Judge Austin.  So I asked him, "Mr. Johnson, were you in the courtroom when I showed Judge Austin Plaintiff's Exhibit," whatever it was, twenty-five, thirty.  "Yes, I was."  I asked him, "Did you notice the film?"  "Yes, I did."  "Did you see who was being shown in that film?"  "Yes, I did."  "Did you recognize any agents of the United States government in that film?"  He said, "I refuse to answer."  So Judge Austin says, "Why do you refuse to answer?"  He said, "Well, your Honor, I have a telegram from Robert F. Kennedy, Attorney General of the United States, telling me not to reveal the contents of any FBI files to anyone."  So Judge Austin said, "Well look, Mr. Leighton didn't ask you about any FBI files.  He only asked you did you recognize who was on the film."  "I refuse to answer," he says to Judge Austin.  Judge Austin said, "Wait a minute," he says, "wait a minute."  He said, "I'm not judge--I'm not Mr. Leighton.  I'm Judge Austin.  I'm telling you to answer that question."  He refused.  Judge Austin said, "All right, I find you in criminal contempt of court, and I fine you 500 dollars to be paid before you leave this courtroom."  Well, now, mind you, I walked in the courtroom with Sam Giancana, the world's greatest criminal.  I get an injunction against the FBI, and then the Chief of the FBI is found guilty of criminal contempt.  That's what happened.  Now, when I was nominated to be a federal judge, agents of the United States FBI came to my office to interview me.  You know, they have to, check my background.  And they asked me about this Giancana case.  I said, "Gentlemen, before I answer your question," they wanted me to tell them how did I happen to be the lawyer--see, they thought I was a mob lawyer.  That's what they thought, see.  So I told 'em, I said, "Before I answer your question, I wanna ask you to please write in your report this, I want you to tell your superiors that if ever a biography is written of me, of my career as a lawyer, I want it to be written that the grandest moment of my life as a lawyer is when I stood in that courtroom, representing a man that you, gentlemen, and your superiors say is the world's greatest criminal, but when I left that courtroom, he had an injunction against the FBI, and he had a finding of guilty against the special agent in charge."   So they all wrote it down.  Then they went back, investigated what I had told them and found out that it was true, just like I had said, that Judge Cavelli had called me, and that it wasn't a mob connection that I had.  And they reported favorably on my nomination.  You see, I never would have been a federal judge if that hadn't happened, you know.
Story_ID: 49495
Speaker 1: Very much so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Wasn't there also a connection--I don't know, you know, between Sam Giancana and Kennedy?  Isn't that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, well, look, look.  Let me tell you something.  Every time I hear, now, you know, today, you see on television, Camelot, the Kennedy's, but maybe you're too young.  John F. Kennedy was, all the sloppy sheets in the news media, had the story that John F. Kennedy was connected with Sam Giancana and that he also had an illicit relationship with the three girls, three sisters.  What were their last names?  There were three sisters.
Speaker 1: Not Marilyn Monroe, no, no, no.
Speaker 2: No, not--well, he was connected with Marilyn too, but the sisters, the--
Speaker 1: The one that, oh, they were performers--one was a, no, no.  I know who you're talking about, but she was connected with Sam Giancana too, right, right.
Speaker 2: And also she was connected with, she and her sisters--
Speaker 1: Performers, right?
Speaker 2: They were performers.  They were singers.  And the story was that the sleazy newspapers of America were printing about Jacqueline Kennedy and John Kennedy.  I invite you to read the newspapers stories of the time.  The story was that Jacqueline Kennedy and John Kennedy had turned the White House into a whorehouse.  These were the stories they published about John Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy.  And these sister--McGuire.
Speaker 1: McGuire Sisters, right, right.
Speaker 2: The McGuire Sisters, according to these stories, the McGuire Sisters slept in the White House every time Jacqueline Kennedy left town.  And the stories were that Jacqueline Kennedy left Washington, went to New York, and then Jack Kennedy called the McGuire Sisters to come over and sleep (laughter).  This was the story.  Now, this is the same Jacqueline Kennedy, and the same John Kennedy that they now extol as one of the greatest presidents this country's ever had.
Story_ID: 49496
Speaker 1: Sam Giancana was one of the finest persons I ever represented.  For one thing, he was as courteous as respectful.  I never had a client--took my advice about everything.  He respected my word, respected my advice, and when I was put on the ticket to be a Circuit Court judge, I had to withdraw from representing him and representing Tony Teeshee, who had me file a suit against "Chicago's American" for libel.  Sam Giancana sent me a contribution.  In 1964, there was no law that required reporting contributions.  So I received his contribution.  I can only tell you, it was a sizable amount of money.  Then he came to see me a few days later without appointment.  We visited.  And he gave me three watches, three gold watches, one of which I have in my home, beautiful gold watch.  And he gave me one for Ann, 'cause he had gotten to know Ann and Barbara, and one for Barbara.  Then as he went out of the elevator, he said to me, George, Tony brought you the contribution that I wanted you to have for your campaign?  I said, yes.  And he said to me, George, I want you to know, I sent you that contribution because I want you to be the best judge that you can be and don't have to pay--spend your own money to be elected.  That's why I sent it to you.  I thanked him.  And that's how we left.  Now, most people will say, cynics, would say he sent me the contribution 'cause he wanted me obligated to him.  The truth is, I never heard either from or about Sam Giancana after I became a judge.  Now, that's the man that they publish stories about.  That's not the man I met.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's fascinating.  Now, sir, okay, I want--when you became the federal, when you became Federal District Court judge--.
Story_ID: 49497
Speaker 1: What are you proud of in terms of, you know, your tenure on the Federal District?
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you, I just--there is a current issue of "Litigation Magazine of the ABA", and there's an article in that issue by a woman, U.S. District Judge who said that the job of a United States District judge is the most wonderful job a person can have, and I agree with her.  For one thing, see, being a lifetime judge, you don't have to worry about being reelected.  You don't have to worry about getting votes.  You're a judge for life.  And the Constitution provides for life during good behavior.  That's what the language is.  No one has been able to precisely determine what the founders meant by that expression, "during good behavior".  The most sensible construction of those words is that you have to live a just life, law-abiding.  You have to do your duties, and you have to perform the obligations you take when you take when you take the oath.  Other than that, no one can remove you.  No one can touch you.  They can write all kinds of nasty stories about you in the newspapers.  Nothing will ever happen.  I happen to know that nothing can be done about the actual performance of duty of a U. S. District judge.  So you're respected, tremendous power.   A District Judge can stop all the trains running in this community, in a given case that's put before him.  He enjoin the government of the United States as they're doing right now.  Right now in this war on terror, federal judges here and there are denying the United States government the right to hold a person incommunicado because they're fighting terrorism.  A federal judge has tremendous power.  And, of course, you're given everything you need, given chambers.  You have your own private library.  A district judge has two law clerks, paid for by the government, secretary, a marshal, a clerk of court, and if he needs more, all he has to do is call Washington [Washington, D.C.] .  He can hire four law clerks, if he needs them.  So it's--after you become adjusted to it, and you settle down, and you begin realizing that you're a judge for life, that no one can remove you, unless you do something wrong yourself, it is the greatest job you can have.  One thing I'm happy about.  There's been a tremendous increase of women.  Did you see the story that happened last week?  Well, oddly enough it's about Chicago [Illinois].  You know, they're having trouble getting judges confirmed--
Story_ID: 50275
Speaker 1: The Chicago newspapers reported that a young woman had her name submitted to the two United States Senators, Senator Fitzgerald and Durkin--or Durbin, rather.  And her name's been submitted to the Senate of the United States, and she was being interviewed.  She had a baby girl, little baby girl in her arms, and she's been interviewed by these gruff-speaking senators about her ability to be a federal judge.  And she gave them some rather quick answers.  And then newspaper reporters try to find out from her what party she belonged to.  She refused to tell them, said that's a matter she doesn't discuss with anybody, which tells me what party she belongs to (laughter).  Or she's probably a Democrat.  She doesn't wanna reveal it (laughter) because it may quid her nomination.  But she said her name was going smoothly through the committee, and they expect her to be confirmed, a lifetime judge.  You know how much that job pays now?  A hundred and thirty--I think it's a $132,000 a year.  When I retired, it paid $89,500 per year.  So, we have quite a lot of women in the District Court.  We have Blanche Manning.  Now, I was before Judge Manning recently, and defended a man before her in a very complicated federal criminal prosecution.  The trial before a jury lasted 10 weeks.  I was in that trial every day, beginning at 9:00 o'clock in the morning until 5:30 in the evening, every single phase of the case in the courtroom that I used to sit in.  And she, the judge, in 1965 was my law student at John Marshall Law School in criminal law.  Now, can you beat that?  To be in the same courtroom that you have sat in for 12 years, and be before a judge who was your law student in a 10-week jury trial.  And you want me to tell you something, I praised God when I finished that trial (laughter) because to stand it.  You know, a jury trial is a strenuous proposition.  I was able to do it, just about a couple of months ago (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's pretty amazing.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 50276
Speaker 1: Sir, let me ask you, when you first sat on the bench--not first sat on, but when you were--well, there's a difference between a lawyer and lawyering and being in front of the court--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --than, you know, being a judge.  And I know that I've had friends who've been Appellate Court judges talk about it being very iso--feeling very isolated or even when people become, you know, are sitting on any court, that's it's isolating because there're things that you used to be able to do, for things--you know, there's a freedom that's curtailed.  And I--
Speaker 2: You, curtailed, yes.  I was surprised when I retired how much liberty I had given up by being a judge.  First place, a judge has to be circumspect about everything he or she does in this kind of civilization we live in.  You don't know what is sought to be done.  You can't afford, for example, as a judge, to let anybody in to see you, any time.  You can't afford that.  You don't know why that person is coming, and you don't know who is looking behind 'em.  You can't talk with lawyers as openly.  I had the policy always, I would talk with a lawyer only if there was a court reporter present, and the other side was informed.  Never ex parte communications.  Also, a judge while serving cannot hold certain jobs.  He can't engage in business, can't be a director of a corporation, a lot of positions he can't hold, or she can't hold.  And the judge has to be careful about investment that is made.  It may affect the ability of the judge to hear a case.  So there's a lot of restrictions.  Now, the difference between Appellate Court and Trial Court, the trial court is more lively.  You have daily contact with the lawyers and the litigants.  In the Appellate Court, sometimes, you don't see lawyers for months.  You never see a client.  You never see witnesses.  You don't hear testimony.  All you have is a cold record to examine.  Now, I personally like appellate work.  I like the, I like the--even though it is drudgery, the drudgery of reading a cold record and to be able to reconstruct the case.  I like that.  See, but that's unusual because I like it.  But trial work is much better.  You establish a good rapport with lawyers, and one thing that happens, in the conduct of a judge at a trial, in a trial court, what that judge is gets to be known; it gets to be known.  And the word goes around.  If the judge is a judge who is always frank with the lawyers and honest in his demeanor and his ways, it gets to be known and stands in good stead.  I enjoyed the time that I was a judge, and I look back at it fondly, and that I spent 23 years in Circuit Court in three different divisions.  I handled a lot of cases, and I served seven years in the Illinois Appellate Court, wrote hundreds of opinions that are published.  Every once in a while, I run into a lawyer who tells me, you know, judge, I made use of an opinion in your case.  It was a wonderful case.  I thank 'em, you know.  That's good.
Story_ID: 50277
Speaker 1: What did you--did you find anything disappointing about the bench?  Was there anything that you did not like about that, you know, 'cause people, people fanaticize, I mean--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, tell me what I didn't--since you asked it that way, yes.  I'll tell you what I don't like.  I didn't' like it, don't like it now when I see it happen to other people.  See, too often, people think the judge should be the hatchet man of the community, particularly in criminal cases.  It's the judge who's supposed to sentence the defendant.  If the judge is merciful and wants to make allowance, because after all, let's face it.  It's the failings of human nature that bring a case to a judge for prosecution.  The prosecution is told to carry it on by the prosecuting attorney, but the judge has to listen.  Now, with these sentencing guidelines, they've removed all the humanity there is in connection with a criminal case.  They now have a formula where the judge adds up some points, and he--and the judge has to sentence like that or else the government can appeal.  They removed all--you know, the most wonderful thing about being a judge is to listen to the evidence, calmly, quietly, make the rulings, let both sides be heard, and then get all the information available and decide what is a just sentence, that fits him and what he did or her, or she did.  That's being a judge.  Today, the judge doesn't have to do anything but read a bunch of guidelines, add some total offense levels, and that's it.  And, or take right now, with all this discussion about zero tolerance, "three strikes, you're out".  Underneath that, is one of the worst traits of human nature, intolerance.  See, zero tolerance really means being intolerant of the fact that he's committed one crime.  "Three strikes you're out" is now before the Supreme Court of the United States, and I believe the Supreme Court is going to uphold a woman judge who ruled in California that when a person commits the third crime, and in this particular case, this defendant stole $150 of golf balls, but it was his third conviction.  He received life without patrol.  Yeah, it happened in California.  The case is in the Supreme Court of the United States, and I predict the Supreme Court is gonna declare that when that is the way the law operates, it's cruel and unusual punishment to send a person to the penitentiary for life because he committed a third offense, but the offense consisted of stealing $150 of golf balls.  Sure.
Story_ID: 50278
Speaker 1: Now, let me--what do you think made you such an effective lawyer?
Speaker 2: I think it's my attention to detail.  You see, a legal problem always requires analysis.  It's when you analyze the facts of every case, whether it's criminal or civil.  Then knowledge of the law and applying the law to those facts is what leads to the result.  And that's the part that I find intriguing.  I have a case I'm working on right now, which I'm going through process.  And it is intellectually satisfying to analyze some facts, apply the law and derive the conclusion.  That's the legal process, you see.  It requires time, requires attention, and it requires devotion.
Story_ID: 50279
Speaker 1: Now, speaking of--well, I wanna ask you what case--well, I wanna ask you what case as a lawyer, what case as a judge, but what case are you most proud of?
Speaker 2: As a lawyer?
Speaker 1: As a lawyer first.
Speaker 2: The case of Robert Lee Goldsby.  There was a man who was driving a car in Mississippi on a Labor Day Sunday.  His mother and his wife were in the car, and they needed to go to a washroom, so it was really morning hours.  They were on their way to Canton, Mississippi to visit kinfolk during the Labor Day weekend.  And he pulled the car into this filling station in rural Mississippi, a place called Vaiden, Mississippi.  And the owner of the filling station, a white man saw this car full of black people come into his filling station.  He then walked out of the filling station with a gun in his hand.  Goldsby, who was seated at the driver's seat saw Nelms coming toward his car with a gun.  He reached over in the glove compartment, took his gun out 'cause he thought Nelms was gonna shoot him, which was probably what was gonna happen 'cause after all, a white man in Mississippi, black people in the car, early Sunday morning, nobody else around, he could have--so Goldsby--Nelms and Goldsby began shooting at each other.  And Goldsby wounded Nelms.  Nelms fell to the ground.  His wife, Mrs. Nelms, came running out of the filling station, screaming, screaming, running over toward where he was.  And Nelms was shooting at Goldsby.  Goldsby was shooting at Nelms.  And the woman was killed.  Now, anybody would see there was a possibility that she was either killed by her husband or she was killed by Nelms.  But in Mississippi, they didn't bother to ask that.  They simply arrested Goldsby and prosecuted him for the murder of this woman.  They never did any bullet testing to determine whether the bullet that killed her came from her husband's gun or from Goldsby's gun.  Now, those of us who are lawyers know that if a man walks from a filling station with a gun in his hand, reasonable common sense would dictate that you should be on the alert at least (laughter), you know.  So that it wasn't a case in which Goldsby pulled a gun on Nelms.  It was a case that Nelms pulled a gun on Goldsby.  In other words, Nelms precipitated what happened.  Well, they prosecuted Goldsby, found him guilty, sentenced him to death.  Well, the family of Goldsby came to see me from Gary.  He had kinfolk in Gary.  They came to see me.  I went down to Vaiden, or Canton rather, to represent Goldsby.  When I got there--now, those of us who know the history of black people in American can understand this.  What happened was a family council was called.  And the family in Canton, Mississippi decided that they just couldn't afford to take the chance of a black lawyer from Chicago representing black Goldsby in white Mississippi.  And they said, we won't consent.  So I came back to Chicago.  Things happen.  Then Goldsby was convicted and sentenced to death, they came back to see me, asked me if I could do something to stop them from executing Goldsby.  And I went.  And the first thing I found out was that Carroll County, Mississippi, from time, man knoweth (ph.) not, had always been a county where there were more black folks in it than there were white ones.  However, no one had ever seen a black face on a jury in Carroll County.  Using that, I came to the conclusion that the jury that had convicted Goldsby had been formed so that black people had been systematically excluded.  It's no, it just couldn't be accident that never in the history of Carroll County had a black person ever sat on a jury.
Story_ID: 50280
Speaker 1: Using that, I filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus for Goldsby, argued it in Oxford [Mississippi].  The federal judge dismissed the petition.  Goldsby was about to be executed, I think on a Friday night, and I ran to, got a plane and went to New Orleans, Louisiana and I got a stay of execution there.  Stayed the execution, and then took an appeal to the Fifth Circuit.  When I proved that blacks had been excluded from the Grand and Petit jury, I did it by going to court in Oxford, but the Marshal, the United States Marshal called me from Vaiden, Mississippi and told me that the black people I had summoned by subpoena to come and testify about how black folks were kept from the jury, they weren't gonna serve the subpoena.  And he told me that he wouldn't serve the subpoena because if those black folks left Vaiden, Mississippi and went to Oxford to testify how they were excluded from the Grand and Petit jury, while they were on their way there and back, their homes would be burned down.
Speaker 2: So I told this Marshal, I said, look, I don't agree with you that you should not serve the subpoena.  But I do agree with you about why you would not want, in you conscious, that the homes of these people would all be burned down while they were up there testifying (laughter).  So when I got to court, I had no witnesses.  So how was I gonna prove that black folks had been systematically excluded from the Grand and Petit jury?  Well, it happened, when I walked into the courtroom, I was surprised to see the District Attorney from Carroll County, the Chancellor of Carroll County, the District judge, who was white, Carroll County, the Sheriff of Carroll County, the Clerk of Court of Carroll County, all sitting in the courtroom.  Now, there's a rule that lawyers learn early in studying law, that you never call a witness when you don't know what that witness is gonna say.  However, here I was.  Goldsby was set for execution, I think it was the day next.  And I had to conduct this hearing.  I had to prove that blacks were systematically excluded from the Grand and Petit juries.  Not knowing what they would say, I called all of these witnesses.  I started off with the Sheriff of Carroll County.  And I asked him, "Sir, how long have you been Sheriff of Carroll County?"  And he told me, oh, 30-some odd years.  Do you have anything to do with calling jurors in Carroll--[County]?  Oh, yeah.  What do you do?  I send out the subpoena.  And what else do you do?  I serve it.  I said, well, sir, have you ever served a subpoena for a juror on a black person in Carroll County?  Oh, nah, don't do that in Carroll County. (Laughter) Well, I asked those kinds of questions of all these witnesses.  The other one, when I came to the judge himself, Henry Lee Rogers was his name.  You know, a lot of people down South like to use the name "Lee" after Robert Lee (laughter).  His name was Henry Lee Rogers.  I had gotten to know Judge Rogers quite well.  We got to be quite friendly.  So I called him.  So I asked him, "Judge Rogers, how long have you been a judge in Carroll County?"  Oh, 35 years.  And you've presided over many jury trials?  "Oh, yes, I'm, oh, many times."  (Laughter) I said, well, and you also presided over and handled the matter of Grand juries?  "Oh, yeah, many times."  How many?  "Oh, thousands".  (Laughter)  So I asked him, "During that time, sir, did you ever see a black face on a jury?"  He said to me, I don't know what you mean.  I said, well, no, I said, now, Judge, I don't wanna make this complicated (laughter).  But I said, you see my client over here (laughter), and you see him.  Yeah, Robert Lee Goldsby.  He was a very, very black man.  I said, you see his color?  Said, yeah.  What I'm asking you, you ever see a man like him (laughter) on the jury?  He said, no, sir (laughter).  Well, you know, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Negroes had been systematically excluded from the Grand Jury.  It's one of the cases that I cite in my, in my--and they set aside the denial of habeas corpus and set aside his conviction.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 50281
Speaker 1: That's a fabulous story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, that is the case because you see--
Speaker 1: And you think, that they could have easily done the opposite too, and given the times.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I--
Speaker 1: They could have done the opposite given the--and why did you choose New Orleans?  Was there--
Speaker 2: Well, no, no.  That's because the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the chiefs in the Fifth Circuit at that time, you either had to go to Birmingham, Alabama--Birmingham, Alabama or--that's where we argued the case, or where the Court sits is in New Orleans, the Fifth Circuit.  And that's where I went to get the stay of execution.  You see in these death penalty cases, you have two problems.  If a man is under a death sentence, and he's about to be executed, the only way you can stop that is to get a stay.  I went to New Orleans and got a stay.  And, and it worked out.  But, you see, that's an example of analyzing the case.  And this little experience I had in the courtroom, see, I tell my law students about this experience.  It is true that a lawyer should not call a witness when he doesn't know what the witness is gonna say.  However, like every general rule, there's an exception (laughter).  When you have a client who's about to be executed (laughter), and you have no time (laughter), this general rule is a nice one to keep in mind (laughter), but it doesn't apply.  By the way, this ruling by Judge, his name is Rivons (ph.), who wrote the opinion, he took the transcript of my questioning of these witnesses, and he attaches it to the opinion.  So that in that opinion--I think it's 271 F2d.  You can read that and see the questions I asked these witnesses, like when I asked one of them, "You've been serving subpoenas for 30 years.  Have you served, ever went--ever served a black person?  Nah, I--you know, the nice thing about white folks in Mississippi, they don't, they don't hesitate to admit they're prejudice (laughter).  You know, why, the reason why?  They get away with it.  They didn't, he didn't hesitate to say, no, we, I've never--or like Judge Rogers when he finally--at first he didn't know what I was saying when I asked him, didn't know what a black folk was (laughter).
Story_ID: 50282
Speaker 1: Sir, let me ask you, with, what about on the bench?  Was there any case that you were most proud of or do you not really--
Speaker 2: Well, I had several cases.  One case that I was proud of.  I'll tell you about it.  There's a little twist to it.  I was once asked to hear a case that involved a Chicago hospital that sued the Secretary of Health and Human Welfare because the Health and Human Welfare Department refused to approve the payment of this hospital, reimburse it for telephones that the hospital put in the rooms of the patients.  And the particular case they brought to me was of a woman, a young mother who was at work in the kitchen of her home, with her three little kids, mopping the floor.  She stumbled over the mop, broke her leg, and they had to come and haul her to a hospital.  And in the meantime, while they're hauling her to the hospital, the three little kids were screaming.  Her father--her husband was at work, and they took her to the hospital.  And by that time, the pain in her leg, they had to sedate her, and she couldn't, she wouldn't respond.  She was worried about the kids back home.  So she used the telephone, talked with the kids.  Right away, she was perfect, responded to the drugs and she was well.  I ruled that the telephone in her room was part of therapy and that it wasn't recreational.  See, you can have a telephone in a hospital room to keep the patient happy, you know.  So you call somebody whenever you had the spare time.  I ruled that the hospital was entitled to reimbursement for that telephone.  Well, you know, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed me, saying that I made the wrong ruling.  I said to myself, those poor guys up in the Seventh Circuit, they don't know (laughter).  They don't know about a woman who breaks her leg in the kitchen floor, leaving three screaming kids at home (laughter), you know.  Well, the other case that I look back on as a judge was the Puerto Rican terrorist case.
Speaker 1: FALN [Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion Nacional], right?
Speaker 2: FALN.
Story_ID: 49506
Speaker 1: Okay, you were talking about (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Under the Safe Streets Crime Act of 1964, the federal government could wiretap the telephone.  The statute specifically provided for the intervention of communication of telephones.  See, that's an audio, audio interception, noise that can be heard.  However, in that FALN [Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion Nacional] case, the FBI agents and the United States Attorneys went to the chief judge and obtained permission to plant a camera in the safe house.  Now, the safe house was an apartment.  These Puerto Ricans rented the apartment.  And when you look at the apartment, it's just an apartment, bed, kitchen, living room and so forth.  The government conceded before me that a person who rents an apartment like that had an expectation of privacy.  So that when the government went and got permission to plant a camera and bug the telephone, that right of privacy was invaded.  I ruled after carefully studying the law that while the government had authority and could obtain a court order to intercept the telephone, the statute didn't give any authority to plant a camera.  And I wrote an opinion in which I discussed the difference between audio and visual.  And I pointed out that visual interception is a much more acute form of interception than audio.  And I ruled that while they could keep what they got by audio interception, the government couldn't use what they'd gotten by visual.  Well, I felt pretty good about that ruling, and I wrote it all out.  You know, the Court of Appeals reversed me in an opinion by Judge [Richard] Posner.  And Judge Posner said something that I never knew was the fact.  I still don't believe it.  He said that a person who rents an apartment does not have the right of privacy if he's gonna build a bomb in the apartment (laughter).  I didn't know that the Fourth Amendment depended on what you did in the apartment.  If you have the right of privacy, you have the right of privacy.  But nonetheless, they reversed it.
Story_ID: 49507
Speaker 1: When you looked at those defendants, did you think that they had done wrong?
Speaker 2: Oh, there's no question about it.  Let me tell you what they did.  I thought that was one of the best examples of FBI work I had ever seen.  What the FBI did, for several years, they followed these Puerto Ricans.  They followed them everywhere they went.  Everything they did, they recorded.  When they rented an apartment, the FBI had all the information.  They photographed them while they're making these bombs, and they get into evidence that the bombs were gonna be placed in, like an armory on July 4th, and the idea was if the bomb went off in an armory in Chicago, it was gonna lead to the freedom of Puerto Rico from the United States.  Well, the FBI followed those people the day they went to get the bomb.  They had 'em all made.  They had decided where they were gonna plant them.  On their way to put the bomb there, the FBI arrested them.  Now, that's good preventive law enforcement.  You know what would have happened.  Some woman or man with a little boy or little girl would be going into an armory to watch some, some display.  The bomb would have gone off, and they'd either be maimed or killed.  That's what they intended.  And there was testimony that it didn't make any difference.  It's like these suicide bombers in Israel now.  They don't care who they kill.
Story_ID: 49508
Speaker 1: I have, sir, I wanna ask you about several, just sort of legal issues.  Like cameras in the courtroom.  What are views about, you know, since we're talking about that.  Illinois does not allow cameras in the courtroom.
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you what I--that question's come up a number of times while I was a judge.  I learned from experience, both as a lawyer and as a judge, that presiding over a trial in a courtroom is a very difficult matter.  The judge has to see to it, the judge who performs the duties of a judge has to see to it first and foremost that the public's courtroom be used for the public purpose.  And that is the administration of justice in the courts.  In doing so, the judge has to preside in a fair and impartial manner.  He has to see to it that both sides has an opportunity to present its case.  He can't let a lot of theatrics go on in the courtroom.  He can't let people interfere with the presentation of evidence.  Anything that interferes with that process is detrimental to this administration of justice.  Thus, if you have a system that allows cameras to come in and take pictures, I happen to know that people who get in the courtroom do all manner of things if they know their picture is being taken, especially if they know they're gonna be on television tonight in the news media, news programs.  It affects the presentation of the case adversely.  And it gives the judge another dimension of administrative problems.  So I came to the conclusion that it is best not--until we have a method that eliminates all these factors.  And another thing, the judicial system doesn't control under the proposals they're making, what will be published and what will not be published.  And the publishing is gonna depend upon the news media people.  And they're doing it for money, doing it for publicity purposes, using it on primetime.  That's the time when Chrysler, Ford Motors, Toyota, they're paying, you know.  So you, so there's no control of it.
Story_ID: 49509
Speaker 1: Now, there're three other instances I would like to ask you about, and that--this is very similar to that, but events that have happened.  Well, one follows into what I'm talking, the question I asked, and that was the O. J. Simpson trial.  What do you, affect do you think that that trial sort of had on maybe society or the judiciary or the legal system?
Speaker 2: Well, to begin with, you see, the O. J. Simpson case was what it was because of O. J. Simpson.  You know, the case of a man killing his wife because she's having an affair with some other man happens almost every day in America (laughter), happens all over the country.  Nothing--the facts of the case itself is not unusual.  But because it was O. J. Simpson, the great football star.  And they picked up on that theme.  And, you know, the evidence against O. J. Simpson, the physical evidence was not exactly strong, which is why the jury acquitted him.  But they tried to make a case of it.  Why, again?  It's O. J. Simpson, and the other thing you wanna remember, racism is a very, very incisive thing.  It happens in all kinds of ways, and it's satisfied in a lot of different ways for a lot of different people.  They wanted to get O. J. Simpson because he O. J. Simpson, the black man who made so much money running up and down, chasing this for the Hertz Motor Company, you know.  And I've always thought the result of it was good.  There wasn't enough evidence to convict him, and the man is entitled to an acquittal under our system.

Speaker 1: What about the election of--I mean the, sorry, the appointment of Clarence Thomas [Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas] and the hearing.
Speaker 2: Since you asked me that, let me tell you, let me call your attention to something that happened.  I think it was day before yesterday.  Let me call your attention to it.  The United States Supreme Court decided a case in which a company filed a claim before the Federal Maritime Commission.  The Federal Maritime Commission is not a court.  It's an administrative body of the United States.  It's a part of the Executive Branch of the government.  It is not a part of the judiciary.  The United States Supreme Court decided a very important question of Constitutional law, the application of the Eleventh Amendment that prohibits persons to file suits in courts of the United States against a state.  This company claimed that one of the states--I think it was South Carolina, had refused it some docking privileges or something like that during, concerning with Maritime.  But the company didn't file the suit in a court.  It filed a claim before the Federal Maritime Commission.  Now, that's an important Constitutional law question, whether the Eleventh Amendment prohibits the filing of a claim before a Maritime commission, part of the Executive branch of the government, not a court.  Clarence Thomas wrote the opinion for a five to four minority--five to four majority.  When I saw the newspaper story that Clarence Thomas had written the opinion, I thought it was marvelous.  Here he's writing an opinion on a very profound and complicated Constitutional issue.  However, "The New York Times" wrote an editorial yesterday, which I have copied, kept in my office, pointing out that the Eleventh Amendment doesn't apply when the claim is filed before a Maritime Commission because the Maritime Commission is not a court.  Now, this is the Clarence Thomas that they--by the way, the Bushes have had a lot to do with the history of this country.  Future historians are gonna praise it.  When Clarence Thomas dissented, he didn't have to dissent.  There was no reason for him to dissent in the case of the prisoner whose face was bashed up while he was handcuffed.  And he got an 800 dollar judgment for his injuries.  The Fifth Circuit reversed.  The prisoner, with his court-appointed lawyer, went to the Supreme Court of the United States.  And the Supreme Court of the United States, the majority of them, eight out of, I think maybe seven out of nine justices decided that the man was handcuffed when he was beaten, his face mashed up.  And he was entitled to 800 dollars for cruel and unusual punishment.  Clarence Thomas dissented.  Why?  He could have kept his mouth shut.  He didn't have to say anything.  Can you imagine a man dissenting because a prisoner whose handcuffed, whose face is bashed in, who was given an 800 dollar judgment, the Fifth Circuit reversed?  Then when it went to the highest court of the land, the majority of the justices ruled in his favor.  Clarence Thomas dissented.  I don't believe that man deserves to carry the mantle of Thurgood Marshall.  He doesn't deserve it.  You know, I read all of his--I thought in this Maritime Commission case, that they were giving him an important case to write.  But low and behold, "The New York Times", which is not an expert in Constitutional Law, points out simply that the Eleventh Amendment prohibits the filing of a suit in court against a state.  It doesn't apply--it doesn't prohibit the filing of a claim before a commission which is part of the Executive branch of the government.  I'm waiting to see what--well, you see the law--the legal scholars are gonna read this.  The ordinary person doesn't read 'em.  Maybe the ordinary person doesn't understand what I'm talking about 'cause the Eleventh Amendment is a complicated amendment.  It's had a complicated history, but when it says a citizen cannot file a suit against a state in a court of the government, of the federal government, it's a court, not an administrative agency.

Speaker 1: My other question on it, sir, with the recent, I mean you talk about the Bushes and the election, and what was your feeling about the Supreme Court that overruled the Florida State Supreme Court?
Speaker 2: Well, you serve to make me tell you what I think.  You know what I think happened.  You know, they'd have some nationally-known scholars reflect on what happened that led the Supreme Court of the United States to grant certiorari in that case.  Everybody who knows anything about the history of the Supreme Court would have told you that the Supreme Court wouldn't grant it.  But you know what I think what happened?  Look, when George Bush filed that case in the Supreme Court of the United States for Certiorari, Clarence Thomas saw George W. Bush's name on there.  I believe he went to see his friend, Antonin Scalia and said to Antonin Scalia, "Look, I owe everything I am to Bush.  I can't grant certiorari, but you can help me.  You know Bill Rehnquist better than I do, and you stand a whole lot better with Sandra Day O'Conner and with Kennedy than I do.  You talk with them.  We should grant certiorari, not because jurisprudence requires it, but I like--I need this great favor from you.  And after all, it is true that Clarence Thomas owes a lot of George Bush, Sr. because it was George Bush who nominated him.  And George Bush nominated him because of his conservatism that they knew about.  And the conservatives wanted someone like Clarence Thomas.  Notice, whenever the chips are down, Clarence [Thomas] stands up with the conservatives.  In every single issue.  So I don't think you have--and then the worse thing I think is when Anita Hill raised that question about sexual harassment, it helped Clarence Thomas obtain confirmation.  See, it diverted public attention to the most important question has now become more evident from the things he writes, as witness, the one that I just told you about, about the Federal Maritime Commission case.  When the legal scholars finish looking at that, they're gonna laugh.  How can a justice of the Supreme Court of United States fail to notice that the Eleventh Amendment applies to courts, not to administrative agencies?  How can it fail to--what I find surprising is that none of his law clerks caught it.

Speaker 1: But one--I just have two more questions.  One is on DNA testing.
Speaker 2: Um?
Speaker 1: DNA testing, you know, because of your work with, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --it's become very important--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, it's gonna be more and more important in the future.  Now, and it's establishing itself, and I think it should be.  Look how many doors of prisons are opened.  There's an interesting article in the current issue of "Litigation Magazine" of the American Bar Association.  It's a current issue by Stephen Jones, who represented Tim [Timothy] McVeigh.  I had a rather adverse opinion of Jones because of the publicity and all of that, but that article is worth reading.  Apparently, he is a very, very experienced trial lawyer in complicated, criminal cases.  And he makes a statement in that article that the government of the United States is perhaps the biggest law breaker in the United States, and he gives examples of the different things they do.  Can you imagine a case, and there's been many of them, brought out by DNA testing, where a man is prosecuted by a prosecutor--and it's happened both in the federal courts and in the state courts, prosecuted by a prosecutor who suppresses evidence of innocence, obtains a man's conviction, has him sentenced to death and that man lives under a death sentence for years, 10 years, 18 years.  And then one day, the DNA shows that he couldn't have committed the crime and that the prosecutor knew it all the way.  Can you imagine the heinousness of that kind of prosecutorial misconduct, to compel a person--I had, I told you of my indictment that I spent sleepless nights worrying about the possibility that I would be convicted anyway, although I was innocent.  Can you imagine convicting a person, knowing, suppressing evidence of his innocence, obtaining his conviction, subjecting him to sleeping in a cell under a death sentence for years.  And the thing that gets me is, you don't hear of anything being done to these prosecutors.  You don't hear, and when attempts are made to do something about it, it never works.  Why?  The public wants prosecutors who suppress evidence of innocence.  They want that kind.  Why?  Because they want to kill somebody.  They want revenge, retaliation.  That's what the public wants.  You have the spectacle right now of this great country, rich, is the most powerful nation in the world, ever in the history of mankind.  We can safely say that about the United States.  Yet, we prosecute people and sentence people to death, even when they commit a crime while they're minors.  I think it's tonight, they're gonna execute somebody in Texas who committed a crime when he was 17.  Yeah, we do that, one of the few countries in the world to do that.  So the DNA testing is a great thing, and the thing I'd like to see, and it's happening, is being made available even to the poor because they're the ones who get found guilty when they are innocent.

Speaker 1: Sir, when you look back on your career, it's been a pretty good ride, hasn't it?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  Miss, let me tell you this.  I, it's been a good ride.  I'm very fortunate.  Well, I say I'm blessed.  I'm blessed with good health, a good career.  I served this community for twenty-three years as a judge.  No one, no one can say a single thing about a single thing I did that was in any way derogatory, unprofessional.  The only time the newspapers of Chicago [Illinois] climbed on me was when I acquitted [Jesse] Rodriguez and [Simon] Suarez of aggravated battery on a police officer.  That was because after I heard the evidence, including the testimony of the police officers and the testimony of the defendants, I came to the conclusion that none of them was telling the truth.  Something else, other than what they were saying, happened, and they weren't the telling the truth for their own reasons.  The defendants and the police officers.  But in any event, the police officers claimed that the two men slashed the face of one of them with a broken beer bottle.  I ruled that it didn't happen.  I ruled that the two defendants didn't commit aggravated battery.  I ruled that as a matter of fact, the two police officers used excessive force on the defendants, and I acquitted them.  The "Tribune", the "Sun-Times", the "American --"The Chicago American", and the "Daily News" all climbed on me.  The only newspaper that had a kind word about me was the "Chicago Defender".  They wanted me impeached.  They wanted me removed from the bench.  They took polls at State and Madison.  They made my life miserable, followed me all over Chicago wherever I went with cameras and they wanted me transferred from the criminal division.  They said that I was soft on crime, and that I hadn't forgotten that I was no longer a defense attorney.  And, of course, they said that I didn't know what the law was and that I was simply prejudiced against the police and so forth.  That's what they said.  But fortunately for me, I hadn't done anything wrong.  I had decided the case as I saw it.  And what helped me was that the defense lawyer was John Branion, a public defender.  If those two defendants were paying clients, they would have accused me of accepting a bribe.  Well, they couldn't do that because the men were indigent in Cook County Jail.  They harassed me for almost a year.  They wrote editorials about me. They did everything they could do.  J. Edgar Hoover wrote articles about me, but fortunately, it didn't work.

Speaker 1: Sir, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, like Martin Luther King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] answered that question, and I like the way he said it (laughter).  You know, he said, "Just say that I was a foot soldier for justice."  And that's it.  Now, how do you accomplish that?  On a day-to-day basis.  That's how you accomplish it.
Speaker 1: And your--one last question.  This can either relate to your mother who did not see, you know, she died way before you had any--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --any success.  But your parents, you know, I'm struck by the simplicity, but you talked about also that they were, you know, they knew civility--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in this whole thing (simultaneous)--.

Speaker 1: --That was the greatest thing about them.  You know, I think it does something to a person to grow up in a family where there's no vulgarity, no slovenness, no immoral conduct, gesture.  It does something.  You know, my mother and father never sat down with me.  I don't remember their ever sitting down with me, telling me, "Look, George, you shouldn't steal.  You shouldn't rape."  They never told me that.  But I knew it by their conduct, by their behavior.  The doing of right.  I learned it from their, their example.  It was the way they lived.  They never had any materials things.  As I told you, we never lived in a house that was owned by my family, never owned a car, never had things like radio or anything else.  I remember a time when my mother and father woke us in the morning, and told us in the middle of the winter that they had no money to pay for food.  But they told us we were not to leave the house.  We were to stay at home and that they were going out.  They were gonna see family, friends, borrow money or something, and they would come back.  But there was no food in the house.  I've heard cases where just the opposite is done, send the kids out in the community to find things to take.  My mother and father didn't do that.  We had to stay--I remember that day.  It was a cold, bitter day in New Bedford, Massachusetts.  That's how my family dealt with the problem of poverty.  And that taught a big lesson, sure.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's it.  Thank you so much.
