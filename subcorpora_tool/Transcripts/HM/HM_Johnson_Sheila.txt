Story_ID: 411749
Speaker 1: And I wanna start out by asking you about your father, can you give his name and what you know about his growing up?
Speaker 2: His name is George P. Crump [George P. Crump, Sr.], George Peter Crump and he was a neurosurgeon, he was one of eleven in the country at the time.  And he was one of four children, had a mother from Italy--from Sicily actually.  His father--I think he was of German descent, African American and I know very little about him, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, we find in these interviews that 50 percent know a lot and 50 percent don't know any, you know, anything at all.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What--can you talk about--did your father share any stories of his growing up?
Speaker 2: Very little, very little.  My father being the brain surgeon that he is, I mean, he was very intellectual and just was really I think a son that just wanted to strive to do something more than anybody else.  But it was interesting that all four kids--three of them ended up in the medical profession and one in real estate.
Speaker 1: Now where did he grow up?
Speaker 2: In Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And, do you know much about his grandparents?  I mean his parents on the, that side?
Speaker 2: Very little, and I've only seen the grandmother one time, my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay, why don't we go to your--well, first of all before I leave your father, how would you describe him?
Speaker 2: He was a scholar, he was a musician, he was a man that was very dedicated to his practice of medicine.  And he was very thorough, he always strived for excellence and wanted his children to do the same thing.  And he was just--I would say in many ways a loner.
Story_ID: 411750
Speaker 1: And let's have your mother and her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Marie Iris [Marie Iris Crump], I-R-I-S, Crump, C-R-U-M-P, and she's still alive and doing well.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about her background?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's a--she went to college and you know, I think she went to Tufts [Tufts College; Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts].  I am not sure, that's something I'd have to check.  But she ended up going into accounting and worked most of her life at a VA [Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] hospital doing accounting work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did she share any stories, was she a talker?
Speaker 2: No, my mother was actually a foster child.  She--the only thing that she really shared with me is that when she got married, she was very disappointed.  Thought she had been adopted by the family that brought her up but apparently they never did.  And it really I think affected her in many, many ways when she found out that they never did really adopt her.  So she knows nothing about her background other than she was just a foster child and has to grow up with that, you know.  And live her--the--I mean most all of her life with that haunting her, that I don't think it's, you know, she's still a lovely woman, terrific woman, and a strong woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: In church.
Speaker 1: In church, okay.  But was it in church in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] or--
Speaker 2: It was a church in Philadelphia and they got married in that church.  But I don't know the name of the church.
Story_ID: 411751
Speaker 1: What was your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory of growing up, I would believe is far back as kindergarten.  And I just remember (laughter) sitting in a table and some kid wet on me.  (Laughter) And I do remember that and other memories that I have, having to drink milk which I'm really allergic to, the graham crackers and the warm milk.  You know, when you're sitting in the, in classroom--I guess it was that period of time when they just forced it on you, and throwing up all over a teacher.  (Laughter) Those are some of my earliest memories, there're not great memories but my earliest memories.  And then I also remember we had to move a lot, because my father [George P. Crump, Sr.] being an African American really was unable to practice in white hospitals and so he was connected with the VA [Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs].  And so we had to move almost fourteen times all over the place.  And then he was drafted and went into the MASH [Mobile Army Surgical Hospital] unit during the Korean War, so I had to move in with some friends in Wheeling, West Virginia.  My mother [Marie Iris Crump], my brother [George P. Crump, Jr.] and I into Wheeling, West Virginia, and we lived on a penal farm.
Speaker 1: A penal farm?
Speaker 2: A penal farm, like a detention center, prison, and a man that we called Uncle Chief [ph.] was heading that up.  And he was really big in civil rights and, but I do remember living on that farm.
Speaker 1: Now, what age were you when you lived on the farm do you think?
Speaker 2: I was really young, I would have to say that maybe seven, eight.
Story_ID: 411752
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So when you say you moved fourteen times, it's almost like every year or so.
Speaker 2: Every ten months.
Speaker 1: Every ten--okay.
Speaker 2: Just about every--that's the way it averaged out.
Speaker 1: So where were you--were you moving different states or--
Speaker 2: Some different states, mostly different states.  I mean, we moved around Pennsylvania a lot, we moved to Wheeling, West Virginia I remember up Erie, Pennsylvania, and then also then down to Kentucky, lived in Louisville, Kentucky.  In fact, we lived behind the old Churchill Downs [Louisville, Kentucky], and I remember watching the horses being exercised every day.  And Louisville was really interesting because that was before, you know, segregation.  I mean, it was during the time of segregation before the desegregation.  And I remember because as fair as I am I was able to go to a white school, we pulled it off for ten months.  And everyone in the neighborhood kept it very, very quiet.  But we just wanted to see if we could get away with it and we did.  My father [George P. Crump, Sr.] really looks white and so he would take me to school and pick me up at the end of the day.  My mother [Marie Iris Crump] was not allowed to go to the school because she was a much darker complexion and they would have noticed that.  But we were able to pull it off the whole time I was in the second grade.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me how was that school comparable--was there a difference in that school compared to the other schools you went to?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, the equipment was better, the classrooms were really nice.  It was very clean and sanitary.  The education I guess was a lot better, that part I don't remember but I just remember the physical environment was of much better quality.
Story_ID: 411753
Speaker 1: With all that moving around, I'm, I'm wondering if you could take yourself, you know, really back to your childhood and tell me what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: I remember red bricks and I remember this in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  Oh, I have some wild stories, I can tell you a lot of things.  And I remember the red bricks 'cause I remember an overweight white woman coming out and calling me a nigger.  I remember that, and it's always stayed in my mind--and told me to get away from her house because she didn't want any niggas around her house.  So that I remember.  I remember having a wonderful babysitter who died inside the house, and I think it was really the beginning of my real growing up period because I had to take on the responsibility.  I had my little brother [George P. Crump, Jr.] with me, and she told me she wasn't feeling well and that she ran into the bathroom.  And I could hear some commotion in there and then I could smell odors, I mean, really foul odors.  And I remember calling my father [George P. Crump, Sr.] at the hospital, and he said, "I'll call an ambulance right away," he says, "but just stay put."  But it was just the responsibility that was heaped on me in the third grade of having to really take on a very adult responsibility of taking care of my brother.  And dealing with the ambulance because my father at the hospital was too far at the time for him to get there right away.  And just to see this poor woman that had passed away and, you know, her bowels had let loose and, I mean, it was just my first experience with death.  And it was very sad.
Speaker 1: And that was, that was in the third grade and you said that you were in Pittsburgh?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what other memories do you have?  You said you have a lot of them.
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  Yeah, I think a lot of 'em were really dealing with a lot of racial issues.  I mean, for me which complicated things me being as fair as I am, I wasn't accepted by African, darker African Americans and white people didn't accept me.  I was called high-yellow, I was called just different.  And the other thing that complicated matters is that I was also a musician, I mean, I played the piano well.  And I started playing the violin and that set me apart from a lot of other people, and it made my life a little bit complicated.  But, you know, I don't regret it 'cause it's really given me the strength of who I am now.
Speaker 1: When you--how old were you when you started the piano?
Speaker 2: Five.
Speaker 1: Five, okay.  Can you remember the--you know, who your piano teacher was and the--
Speaker 2: Yes, Mrs. Watson [ph.].  And I remember when Mrs. Watson had a stroke but she continued to teach me.  But the difference was she would have to take a pencil and follow the notes so every time I would bring home my piano music, there was pencil marks up under everything, you know, and I kept telling her that she didn't have to do that.  But she said that she had to do it for herself so that she could be able to see and follow what I was doing.  And I remember she had enormous bad breath (laughter).  I just remembered, like, I cannot go to another piano lesson and would just remember those things.  Then from Mrs. Watson, she passed away, and then by that time we ended up in Chicago [Illinois] and I started studying at the Chicago conservatory of music [Chicago Musical College; The Music Conservatory of Chicago College of Performing Arts, Chicago, Illinois] with an Alice Ungerman [ph.].  And her husband I think played with the Chicago Symphony [Chicago Symphony Orchestra].  And at the time, I also played with--I start taking violin and I started at the fine arts conservatory of music.
Story_ID: 411754
Speaker 1: What age were you when you moved to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I was in the fifth grade, so I was either eight or nine (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were ten--eight or nine.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and let me ask--now how many kids are in the--it's you--
Speaker 2: Just me and my brother.
Speaker 1: Your brother, and your brother's name?
Speaker 2: Is George Peter Crump [George P. Crump, Jr.].
Speaker 1: And he, and he is what age compared to you?
Speaker 2: He is two and a half years younger.
Speaker 1: Younger, okay.  So it was the two of you, did you get along as youngsters, you know how
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean we got along like most brothers and sisters do.  My, my brother is a wonderful young man, but to me operates in slow motion and he and I, that's where our conflicts have always come in, and even to this day.  And I remember we had to share tasks at home and it was either, it was either my night to wash the dishes and he had to dry, this was before dishwashers, you know, but it was our job to clean up after dinner.  But he was always so slow at getting to the tasks so I would end up usually washing the dishes and then he would eventually get around to drying them.  And I remember one time I got so frustrated with him I took him out in the backyard and started beating him up and the neighbor called the police (laughter).  And he police came in 'cause my parents [Marie Iris Crump and George P. Crump, Sr.] weren't at home.  But he was just taking forever to do anything.  And I remember always having to walk him to school and never got to school on time because he was always looking at a blade of grass or a flower, you know, he says, "The school will be there when I get there."  But it was getting me in a lot of trouble, and to this day we still fight over the same things but we love each other.
Story_ID: 411755
Speaker 1: So when you move to Chicago [Illinois], you stay there for a while, right?
Speaker 2: Oh stayed there, finish school, went to high school [Proviso East High School, Maywood, Illinois] there, went on to the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], yes.  So that's really what I consider home.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when--do you remember when your father [George P. Crump, Sr.] told you, you were moving to Chicago?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember moving to Chicago, the move to Chicago at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just remember following a moving truck all the way.  And we lived on St. Charles Road in Maywood, Illinois and it was in a, a, a three-story brick--it was like a--apartments.  There was a first floor where the, the owner of the apartment lived and then she rented out the other two floors.  But it was a really large building, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so what was life like there in Maywood?  You're in, you know--
Speaker 2: For the first time I felt like we were--and he promised that we weren't moving again.  I was able to start really making long-time friends.  It was the first time I was really able to start making a life for myself, you know.  I was in the fifth grade, that's when I started the violin and I was able to join the District 89 orchestra because they had a wonderful music program there where you could--everybody was required to take an instrument.  Now whether you stayed with it or not, but they gave everybody the opportunity.  Instruments were free, there was great federal funding to really promote the arts there.  And I have to say it was an incredible program, and I think it's still going on.  But I became a member very quickly in the District 89 orchestra and that's where I really discovered the violin, which has always been my love.
Speaker 1: Now, violin more than, than piano?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because it was an instrument that I could share with others.  I could either play in a quartet or--and I loved playing in the orchestra, I loved that more than anything.  And so I had decided quite early then that, that was gonna be my career, was to be a concert violinist.
Speaker 1: And now, who was your--you said you studied at the Chicago conservatory [Chicago Musical College; The Music Conservatory of Chicago College of Performing Arts, Chicago, Illinois] violin (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, and I cannot--his, his name has really slipped my mind right now but he has passed away.  But I remember studying at the fine arts conservatory for violin.  And it's right on Michigan Avenue, still exists and I love that building and I loved going to the lessons because you would go in there and there was either singing going on, there was music going on constantly.  I mean, it was a real conservatory.  And it's where the ballet practiced, and I would love seeing the dancers as I would go in there.  I just felt so grown up and important when I walked in there and I would go to take my lessons.
Speaker 1: Now were you taking the lessons on Saturday, was that the time would go?
Speaker 2: No, I actually took 'em on Monday nights that I remember.  And then piano was on Tuesday night at the Chicago conservatory.
Story_ID: 411756
Speaker 1: And what were you like as a young person at this point?  I mean, having moved around like that, were you a person--that is me, can you turn off?
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): And speed.
Speaker 2: As a person, young person, were you--did you sort of live inside your head or were you quiet, you know, were you an obedient child, you know, what?
Speaker 1: I was a, a child that always--I'm not gonna say I always got in trouble but I always challenged authority.  You know, I had great respect for everything but I always was able to, to just challenge it a little bit.  I'm--I've always been a young woman who liked to live life to the fullest, I get bored easily, I like to challenge everybody, I never accept anybody's word for anything especially if it doesn't make sense or if they tell me I can't do something.  And I say, no, you can do anything you wanna do.  I think it's a resiliency that I was born with, it got me in a lot of trouble with my parents [Marie Iris Crump and George P. Crump, Sr.].  And, when they would tell me to do something, and I'd have to say, why?  And, you know, back then you didn't tell your--you didn't question your parents.  So my head was rolling around the kitchen floor a lot, a whole lot.  I got spanked all the way until I was eleven years old, just for mouthing back and challenging them.  And just making them--I was, I was always trying to get them to think beyond convention and to this day I hate it when there's rules being made saying you can't do this or you shouldn't do that, or you shouldn't rattle paper in church, or you shouldn't do that?  You know, what's the point?  Why are we set inside this box and we just can't stretch our wings?  And I just have always felt that as African Americans we're always the, you know, we're always have to fit inside the box and we make these rules within our own culture.  And we never challenge those rules.  And, and I, I get very frustrated even to this day and I have to hold my tongue all the time when I'm--even when I'm around older people, who are very set in their ways and say no, you can't do, you cannot wear pants to church or you can't do this.  And I'm like, this is ridiculous.  You know, things shouldn't be like this because I just feel as though, if, if we're gonna grow as a culture, we have to be flexible enough to change our ways and to adapt to what's going on.  Because this--we're living in a global society now.
Speaker 2: Now, so that--so you're saying your parents were always reprimanding you?
Speaker 1: I was always in trouble; I was always in trouble.  I wasn't in the sense that I was going out doing really bad things, I got--my mouth got me in trouble a lot.  If they told me, you know, you need to stop practicing your violin at ten and I kept going until midnight I got in trouble, you know, people need to sleep.  And I'm like, well, the only way I'm gonna get better is I've gotta practice.  I was, I was very focused at what I wanted to do, very determined.  But I'm very impatient and I like to get things done, I like to get things done correctly and I just--I have very little tolerance for people who are--and I'm not gonna use the word dumb but people that don't wanna stretch their minds.  And it is a huge flaw that I have and I recognize that.  And as I get older, I've kept it more and more under control.  But I am really--I see myself as a visionary, I see myself as someone where I can see where problems can get solved immediately.  And people take forever to try and figure out how to get it solved, I just--I lose my patience.  Not in a bad way, I'm just saying okay, well, if you can't do it, I'll get someone else that can.
Speaker 2: So, you're saying you were like that even as a young person (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, my goodness yeah, that I do know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 411757
Speaker 1: Who in Maywood [Illinois], in this community can you describe your community, you know, in Maywood at the time you moved there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.  Maywood at the time was an interracial community.  Mostly white but we did have some prominent African Americans, you know, people that were involved in civil rights, we had people that were doctors, lawyers, business people.  It, it was a very nice community for an interracial community just outside of Chicago [Illinois].  And Chicago, believe me, was probably one of the most racist cities at the time.  And I still think it's just very segregated to this day.  But I do remember sort of like a class system that, if you were the daughter of a doctor, you were put here or if you were the daughter of a secretary then you were put there.  I remember that, I remember classmates that really--and 'til this day I still have a connection with--I was in an unusual class especially elementary school and high school, where we had--and I don't know why this class was so special--an enormous amount of African Americans who all are very well known and really do hold very high degrees and, you know, I mean--
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of their names?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Joyce Tucker [HistoryMaker Joyce E. Tucker], I think she ended up either being a judge or--and then there was Shelvin Hall [HistoryMaker Shelvin Louise Hall] who ended up being attorney general, we have some that were dentists.  And even our so-called kids, they called 'em greasers back then, who didn't go on to college but are some of our best business people, I mean, they own a chain of Italian restaurants.  We had a huge Italian population because Maywood was near Melrose Park [Illinois], which was a big Italian ethnic neighborhood, there were so many.  Well, Michael Finley, who came after me, is now on the NBA [National Basketball Association].  I don't know, I just got inducted in the hall of fame a few years ago but there were, there were a lot, you know.  Carol Lawrence went to the school, one of our astronauts, Eugene Cernan went there.  It was a wonderful high school.  I have to tell you; I think I got the best education in the world there.  I would never trade it and I think one of the shockers coming to the East Coast were, was the proliferation of private schools.  And I said, why do you have all these private schools, I mean public schools are wonderful.  My public schools were terrific.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there in Maywood you went where to, to elementary--where, where did--
Speaker 2: I was at Irving Elementary School [Irving Middle School, Maywood, Illinois] and then I went on to Proviso High School [Proviso East High School, Maywood, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yes, Proviso still has a good high school there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 411758
Speaker 1: So music is very, very predominant.  In fact, I, I read how you would go in the kitchen at night and practice your violin.  Did you have a favorite song or, you know, can you even remember how you felt, you know, when you would be practicing?
Speaker 2: Violin is probably one of the most difficult instruments to--I just felt as though my progress, being the impatient person that I am, was slow.  But I did understand that I had to practice a lot.  The more proficient I got, I had to practice a lot and Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach] was my favorite composer.  I was very competitive, I always wanted to be the concert mistress of the orchestra so I practiced a lot and it took me many years to get there.  But, one thing that did happen I think it was great, I tried out in an all-state competition and I won it which then put me in first chair of the all-state symphony [Illinois All-State Orchestra], which was a first, you know.  And, boy oh boy, because I was the first African American to hold that first chair, there were actually violinists behind me that kept challenging me for that chair so I had to keep practicing, because the conductor at any time could say, okay, I'm gonna have that guy challenge you.  You know, so they were coming after me, they were gunning for me and that's why I had to keep practicing to be the best.
Speaker 1: That's, that's true in the whole thing and people don't realize that.  In an orchestra that first chair spot is high, highly coveted.
Speaker 2: It's highly coveted, right.  And, you know, in professional orchestras that's the highest salary.  In my case, where I was, I just wanted to hold onto that chair because I knew what was behind, you know, they, they kept coming after me 'cause they didn't feel as though I deserved it, you know.  And I would sit there and hear other string teachers say, "Well, she's black and, you know, we've never had this before.  You know, why should she have it? Is this a racial thing?"  And, you know, and you can hear these things, you can feel it and, you know, and it's just something that just, you know, I just wanted to take care of.
Story_ID: 411759
Speaker 1: Now this is where, the period that we're in is the early '50s [1950s], right?  At this point are you--'cause wait, no, no, early '60s [1960s], I'm sorry (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, we're in the '60s [1960s], yeah.
Speaker 1: Early '60s [1960s], I'm sorry.  So how are you aware of anything around like, you know, with Revered King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?  I mean, are those things being discussed at home?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I, I, I can remember even the day Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was shot.  I was in orchestra rehearsal actually, and the principal came over the PA system and said that our president has been killed.  And they dismissed school, they closed the school down and everything, and they asked everybody to go home and to watch the news.  That part I remember, and I also do remember when Martin Luther King was shot.  But before that, I remember when Martin Luther King was, you know, rising up and really working on the Civil Rights Movement.  And I do remember not only my family but other black families, you know, what is this man out here.  He's stirring up things, you know, he shouldn't be doing--he's messing it up for everybody.  I mean, it's, it's really amazing how he was not popular during this whole period of time.  And it wasn't until he was killed that suddenly he was revered as our leader, as our savior, and the person that we really should have paid attention to was changing our lives.
Story_ID: 411760
Speaker 1: So in this time you are, you know, excelling at music (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --what year is it when you won the statewide competition?
Speaker 2: It was actually my senior year in high school [Proviso East High School, Maywood, Illinois], it was my senior year.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in high school who, who were you becoming?  Who is the person, you know, I know that you always said, you know, you had an opinion about everything but what subjects are you gravitating to? Who's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was definitely the arts; it was definitely the arts.  I was terrible in math, I was terrible in science, but I was good in English and the humanities so I knew where my strengths were and I knew where my weaknesses were.  Now when I look back then, I would say I shouldn't have been that bad in math or science.  I don't think I had great teachers there, you know, I just remember the teacher giving an assignment and leaving the classroom until the end of the period and then coming back in and then collecting things, but he wasn't teaching.  And I think what I was learning during that time was really who I really was.  I think I had a very early sense of who I was, what made me tick and where I wanted to go in life.  I was unusual in that sense I think more than any of the other students.  But I think some of the names that I had mentioned was Shelvin [HistoryMaker Shelvin Louise Hall] and Joyce Tucker [HistoryMaker Joyce E. Tucker] and some of the other people that were around me, they also had a keen sense of who they were and where they were going.  I mean, we had a really strong group of African Americans students that were disciplined and focused and we really fed off of each other.  We gave each other support, you know, when things weren't going well, we would sit and discuss 'em.  It was a healthy period for me and, you know, just preparing to go on to the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] and doing what we needed to do.

Speaker 1: Now, when you went to the university, I mean, when you were thinking about college, where was the--were you assuming that you were going on to the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] or did you apply there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a foregone conclusion because during that time the thing that made my music career so unique, and I think the great thing about the education system in Illinois, especially where I was, when we were on breaks for Thanksgiving or spring break or whatever they called it, the university stepped in and they would then take us--like I would go and do master classes with Marvin Rabin at Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois].  Or I was traveling and doing something with an orchestra or I was doing something with a quartet group.  And I actually played the mafia circuit, so I was
Speaker 1: What is that, what is the
Speaker 2: Well, I (laughter) played with a string quartet and the quartet was always asked to play for dinner parties.  And I remember being in Tony Accardo's house, and we were just to play we weren't supposed to look or ask questions.  And they paid well, so we did a--I earned a lot of money during high school [Proviso East High School, Maywood, Illinois] playing my violin.  And then I was also invited during the summer to go on a European trip with the Oak Park-River Forest Symphony [The Symphony of Oak Park and River Forest].  I went to Germany, I got behind the Iron Curtain at the time.  We traveled all over central Europe performing and that was my first taste of Europe.
Speaker 1: So how was that?
Speaker 2: It was remarkable, it really was.  I have to say though, coming back our plane crashed and we all survived.  Instruments were ruined and we--the plane went down in, in Iceland so it was on the wrong side of the island.  So we had to wait there for several days.  And it was during one of the biggest airline strikes, so they had to send a charter jet in to pick us up.
Speaker 1: What year was that?  Do you remember, you graduated in '66 [1966] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Six--it was probably the summer of '66 [1966], yeah.
Speaker 1: So, '66 [1966] okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 411762
Speaker 1: Now, the other thing I wanna ask because not only music was a part of your life, you also were a cheerleader, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you have both, you know.
Speaker 2: Right, well, being the cheerleader, I mean, that was before Title IX.  If Title IX were in place, I probably either would of played another sport.  The women did not have that opportunity, we took PE [physical education] classes but that was it.  We had to do everything from playing volleyball, one thing that the State of Illinois did require is that everyone had to learn to swim.  You could not graduate if you didn't know how to swim.  And I remember the first dealing with the hair issue, you know, that was a huge problem among African American women.  But they made us get in that pool anyway, and we had to learn to swim and we had to get a swimming certificate before we could graduate.  So I was a cheerleader and I'm trying to think.
Speaker 1: Do you remember when you first auditioned to--'cause cheerleaders are usually the popular ones in school.
Speaker 2: Are you trying to say I wasn't popular?  I was very popular (laughter).
Speaker 1: I know, I was gonna say you were popular.
Speaker 2: I do remember cheerleading tryouts being a huge issue and I remember my next door neighbor, Lavita [ph.], also tried out for the cheerleading squad.  And there was sort of this little competition between us.  I didn't feel it, she felt it more.  We almost looked alike and for some reason--I guess the boys liked us, okay.  And cheerleading was very, very coveted, and I went and tried out and got right on the squad.  I mean, I could do all those backflips and splits and everything, and that's just who I am.  And so I immediately made the squad and she didn't, and I just remember her being really, really upset.  And I felt really bad for her, I really did and--but I enjoyed it.  And not was I only a cheerleader in high school [Proviso East High School, Maywood, Illinois] but I was also a cheerleader at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Which was, you know, that's significant in and of itself, but when did you first become a cheerleader at, you know, in, in high school?  Was it your, you know--
Speaker 2: Sophomore year.
Story_ID: 411763
Speaker 1: Let's take it up to the point where you are getting ready to go to college.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you said that there was no question in your mind that's where you were going was the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  The reason why I know that is because, you know, as I was saying, you know, I was--during my down time I was either working with professors with the violin, but there was a wonderful man by the name of Paul Rolland who had come along.  And he was the man that brought Suzuki into this country.  Remember the Suzuki violin movement.  He was the one that was there at the foot of Pan Am airlines [Pan American World Airways].  As those little Japanese students were coming off the plane, but he had discovered Suzuki and brought the Suzuki students in.  And Paul Rolland was also a professor of my orchestra director in high school [Proviso East High School, Maywood, Illinois], and he would come up to the high school and watch every one of us playing.  And he took a liking to me and thought that I was very, very talented.  So he told me then that I was gonna come to the University of Illinois and be part of the school of music.  And he wanted to teach me personally.  So I knew I was already in college, I just had to go through the formalities of taking the SAT exams and, and getting in, which I did miserably on by the way.  I am not a test taker (laughter).  I can write essays; I can do everything else but I'm not good at multiple choice.
Speaker 1: Now, so he was really your mentor of sorts at that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I would say Susan Starrett was my mentor at the time and then Paul Rolland also then became a mentor, yeah.
Speaker 1: Your mentor, okay.  Now, was there violinists, a particular violinist that you had great admiration for at the time, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Yehudi Menuhin.  In fact, it's, it's really interesting because, as I was at the University of Illinois and I became a member of the Illinois String Research Project, Menuhin was also part of that.  So I actually ended up working with him eventually.
Story_ID: 411764
Speaker 1: Now what was the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]--so this is 1967 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seven [1967]. Sixty-six [1966] through '70 [1970] I graduated in '70 [1970], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So 1966 you enter in the fall of 1966.
Speaker 2: Right, and I entered very early by the way.  I entered at sixteen 'cause I skipped two grades.  All that moving around that I did going from the South to the North and doing that apparently the education in the North at the time was much better than that in the South so by the time I go down to Louisville [Kentucky] they would then skip me a grade, because I was testing out of that grade.  So I entered college at sixteen.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay, so really you were a kid when you were a cheerleader too?
Speaker 2: No kidding, yes.
Speaker 1: So when you--do you think you were rather--were you mature?
Speaker 2: I was very mature, yeah.
Speaker 1: For your age.
Speaker 2: Very mature for my age, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what was the campus 'cause you're living in the city though a suburb.  You go down to Champaign-Urbana [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Well, University of Illinois is one of the largest universities I think in the world.  And at the time there were about fifty-two thousand students there, and there were only four hundred--I thought there were only four hundred African Americans.  Now when I went back to give the commencement address this past spring, they told me there were only about a hundred eighty African Americans there.  And we were in a cluster of sororities or fraternities.  There was the Omega [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] and the AKA's [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority].  Now, I never joined a sorority or fraternity because that's me, I'm not a joiner of organizations.  I just have never felt as though I need that support system of sorority sisters or--and so forth and so on.  I was--I've always been my own person.  So when I entered the campus I was actually shocked that there were not more African Americans there.  But I have to say, being as close to Susan Starrett and Paul Rolland, there was another man that entered my life and that was Dan Perrino [Daniel J. Perrino], who really took me under his wing and protected me and guided me through the maze of the university.  I mean, it is a huge, huge university.  And the music school, even though it was located in, you know, six or seven blocks of the campus and it always--the fine arts always stayed in that area, that was really my world.  And it was a world that I enjoyed, it was a protected world of musicians and we had great musicians that came through there.  Cecil [Cecil Bridgewater] and [HistoryMaker] Dee Dee Bridgewater, I'd run into them all the time.  It was a very small group of people but it was great.
Speaker 1: You mean as part of the music department (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, as far as the music department.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your adjustment, you know, because you go from a relatively small, you know, community to this huge college campus, did it take any time to really sort of adjust?
Speaker 2: Not really, because the music school was small and so I was just entering another small world.  When you get outside the school of fine and applied arts [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, College of Fine and Applied Arts, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] then it's, it's a whole different ballgame.  But just being in the music school, it was, you know, we were protected there and it was great.
Story_ID: 411765
Speaker 1: Did you feel that the university was hospitable to blacks, 'cause, you know, '67 [1967] is very turbulent times around the country (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not at all.  It was a really bad time for not only University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] but all the campuses at that time.  That was when the whole Black Power movement was starting up.  And, again, as a light-skinned African American, that's when I really, really felt a place where I just didn't belong.  I was too fair for our African American students and they made it very clear that I was not gonna be accepted, and then I was not accepted by white students except a funny thing happened to me.  Chi Omega Sorority wanted to rush me and I'm like, why me, they said well, you know, "We like you, you know, we've seen you around campus," and I don't know where they've discovered me.  I don't know whether I was making a mark on somebody or, you know, I was very active in--god, I can't even remember the name of this organization--and maybe I was a cheerleader then.  That could've been it.  I, I had tried out for the cheerleading squad at the University of Illinois and was the first black to get on the cheerleading squad there.  And I think that garnered a lot of attention and Chi Omega wanted to rush me.  And I remember going to my mentor Dan Perino [Daniel J. Perrino] and I said, you know, a weird thing has just happened I've been asked to join a white sorority.  And I said do they know that I'm black?  So he went and met with them and they said, "Yes we do know but we would like her to be a member of our sorority."  And I remember then discussing it with my guy I was dating at the time.  And they said, "No, do not do that, you know, you're gonna upset everybody here."  You just can't do that.  So I, you know, finally--it was, it was a really, a very challenging moment because I would say, you know, maybe if I were to do this, maybe this would really take us two steps forward, you know, as far as trying to really make all of this work.  Of all the turmoil that we're going through, I could set a precedent that we can either blend in or we, we do belong anywhere we wanna belong.  So it was a turbulent moment but I did decide not to do it just for my own sanity (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So was that your freshman year?
Speaker 2: I think it was my sophomore year.
Speaker 1: Your sophomore.  And that, and, and you point to an issue that often during those times people would do things to be first (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. They would.
Speaker 1: You know, not consciously but it felt even an obligation to do them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and even it was against my nature belonging to anything like that, I was gonna do it just to be able to prove a point.  But ended up not being able--I just decided not to do it.  I thought there were bigger wars I could fight.
Speaker 1: Now when you were a cheerleader there, was it for the football games or the--
Speaker 2: It was for everything.
Speaker 1: So once you're a cheerleader you did all the games?
Speaker 2: You did football and basketball, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now the Illini, the Fighting Illini as they're known, were--they were very--it was a good team, right?  Were they good, how were they?
Speaker 2: We were terrible, we were terrible.  We went to the Rose Bowl in 1958 [sic.] and never did anything since then.  And it's not been just until recently that the basketball team went to the Final Four [NCAA Final Four], but the university is actually taking a conscious step now of working, really working on the athletic program.  Reason why I know it, I'm on the board so (laughter).
Speaker 1: I didn't know you were on the board.  You're on the board of the University of Illinois?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I did not know that.  You know, Joseph White [B. Joseph White] has been very good to us.
Speaker 2: He is phenomenal president, just great.
Speaker 1: He's phenomenal, I'll tell you more about that during the break (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 411766
Speaker 1: Tell me about your whole experience those four years?
Speaker 2: Again, I got the best education in the world, I believe it's prepared me for life forever.  It's a tough university, my freshman year was a nightmare.  Academically it was one of the toughest years I'd ever had, I put a lot of pressure on myself 'cause I was always used to getting straight A's.  So then when you go into a university like that then, you know, when you see those first Bs or a C, you know, you just feel like you're a failure.  I mean, 'cause I was putting a lot of pressure on myself.  There were some subjects that I was good at, there were a lot that I wasn't good at.  And I had to learn how to navigate the field of really going in to see professors and really work harder than I've ever worked in my entire life to get good grades.  And, and it was tough.  And I would say by my sophomore year it was a lot easier, by my junior year I knew the ropes.  Junior, senior year I was able to really pull my grades up to really be able to graduate with honors.  And it, it was really a four-year journey of preparing me for life is what that university did.  It was big enough and diverse enough that I had to learn to get along with everybody, but during that time, as I said, the Civil Rights Movement was going on.  We lost Robert Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy], it was just--the student union was being torn apart, the university was looking to me to be a mediator among blacks, between the black students and the white students.  I didn't feel as though that I had the intellectual equipment to do that or, nor did I really believe that strongly in the movement.  I didn't know where the movement was gonna go.  And I think it went nowhere actually.  It set up the affirmative action programs, we were able to get the, the development office and also the office of admissions to start opening up more and accepting more African Americans into the system.  There was a shortage of African American professors at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], I can't remember of one African American professor I--so I did do a lot of positive things by bringing light to the problem.  I think tearing up the student union and setting fires and everything didn't help us at all and I was not happy about it.  I mean, it, it was a scary time actually (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you're saying that the black students took over the student union and burned it up or is that what you said?
Speaker 2: They tore it up.
Speaker 1: Tore it up.
Speaker 2: They didn't burn it; they tore it up.  But there were, you know, little fires set around the campus.
Speaker 1: But do you--who, who was, who was leading the charge there, do you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know.  We really didn't know.  I also remember turning the TV set up on--and I remember seeing a very familiar face on there and it was Fred Hampton, who went to high school with me, elementary [Irving Elementary School; Irving Middle School, Maywood, Illinois] and high school [Proviso East High School, Maywood, Illinois].  And I remember he was part of the Chicago Nine that was murdered during that Chicago [Illinois] raid.  And I just didn't even--I didn't even know Fred was a part of this Black Panther movement [Black Panther Party].  And I'm like, oh, my goodness.  And I have to tell you, I mean, he and I go way back.  And not particularly a great student at all, I mean, always a little bit in trouble here and there.  And I remember him sort of terrorizing the girls.  I don't know whether it's appropriate on-camera but he always called himself the booty tickler.  (Laughter) So he always scared me a little bit, but he was a fun guy and he was always a good friend.  So I was shocked to see his death so public on television and I didn't even know that he was part of the Black Panthers.  It was really interesting, so that was a shocker (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So are you saying he was a student in Maywood [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In fact, if you go to Maywood, there's the Hampton Recreation Center [sic. Fred Hampton Family Aquatic Center, Maywood, Illinois], half the town's named after him.  That's all you had to do is be a part of the Black Panthers, he got half the town named after him, yeah.  And it's because of that, and I don't think his family has fared well since his death.  I mean, it was very upsetting.  It was upsetting to me.  So you know--and, you know, I look back on that period and I'm like, what did it get us, except the things I mentioned, you know, maybe some affirmative action programs.
Story_ID: 411767
Speaker 1: So your parents [Marie Iris Crump and George P. Crump, Sr.] were telling you really to sort of follow the straight and narrow, you know.  That's what they were advising.  Don't get caught up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Right.
Speaker 1: --don't', you know, just follow, get your education, don't get caught up.  Now, in the process you meet, while you're at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], you meet Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson].  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yes, when I entered the University of Illinois, they had what they--had was like a week-long orientation and they actually assigned upper classmen to freshmen and he was assigned to me by my dear friend Dan Perrino [Daniel J. Perrino].  So he was like my camp counselor or my guidance counselor for the week.  And I remember going to this camp, and I remember him always wanting me to make sure that I sat next to him around the campfire.  And I don't know how much advising he was doing except he was hitting on me the whole time and flirting.  And so then when we got back to campus we started dating, and that went on--it was a very off and on relationship.  And I really wanted to meet other guys, but he was very, very persistent that, that was not gonna happen.
Speaker 1: What was the young Bob Johnson like?
Speaker 2: He was very determined, very controlling, very suppressive, you had to play by his rules.  I remember him getting in, in trouble with, with the Kappa Fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] on hazing.
Speaker 1: When you say got in trouble, what does that mean?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess he was hitting some fraternity, I mean, he broke the rules as far as the hazing.  You know, when they go to apply for--to get into the fraternities.  Very jealous, like if I wanted to go somewhere with some other guy, I mean, he just couldn't deal with it, could not deal with it at all.  You know, he, he grew up in a very interesting household.  I mean, they were poor and he's number nine of ten kids, and really--I think all the brains went into his head, you know.  The others were not able to be as successful as him but he--I remember him telling me even when we got ready to get married that he was gonna be very wealthy.  That was his goal, that he was gonna be wealthy.  And things always had to be his way.  And at the time, you know, I was enamored by that, you know, to get around someone who really knew where they wanted to go and wanted to be.  And, you know, I fell in love with him.  I was really in love with him.  And so we went on and got married and--
Speaker 1: And you got married before you graduated, right? Okay what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  I got married in my junior year.  And my parents were furious, absolutely furious.  First of all, they, they couldn't quite figure him out at all.  My mother had--she has extraordinary sixth sense and instincts, and she just told me then it was not right.  And she was very worried about me.  And she asked me why was I marrying, I told her, you know, because he was a very determined young man and someone that really was gonna make a name for himself.  And I hadn't really been around a lot of other African American men that really--they had that kind of a clear vision of where they wanted to go.  And that's where I saw his strengths.  I was--I took a blind eye to the negatives of--and she says, "You're gonna lose who you are through this man," she says, "you really are."  I said, "But Mom, I love him, I love him, you know."  I say, well--anyway, we got married.
Speaker 1: Now what did your father think of him or was he just wanting you to finish?
Speaker 2: He wanted me to finish school, and he really didn't have much, much of an opinion about anything, that's just who he was.  It was my mother that was really the backbone of the family.
Story_ID: 411768
Speaker 1: It was really interesting because, when I was at Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] and I started actually going out with someone else and he was at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey]--
Speaker 2: 'Cause he had graduated?
Speaker 1: He had graduated (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was how many years ahead of you?
Speaker 1: He was one year ahead of me. No, two years I'm sorry, two years.  He was accepted into a program at the Woodrow Wilson School [Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs] at Princeton.  And it was really ironic because I had another--I always called her a cousin, she was also accepted.  Now this was when this whole affirmative action thing was starting to go on.  And there were a lot of young bright African American people accepted into programs, Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Princeton.  Those were the three.  So Bob [Johnson's ex-husband, Robert L. Johnson] was accepted into the Woodrow Wilson School and I stayed back at Illinois 'cause I told him I--this is before we were married, I was not leaving that school.  I was coming here, I was on full scholarship and I was gonna finish that school.  I don't care what anyone said.  That was the smartest thing I could have ever done.  And I did that and I think he was not happy with that, he wanted really me to really follow him.  And I said, I'm sorry I'm not gonna do that.  So, he left Princeton and came back and he worked in--it was called Project 500 at the University of Illinois.  And that's where they were gonna recruit five hundred African Americans into the University of Illinois.  So he worked in that program and I went on and finished school, we got married January 9th, 1969.  No, I got married first and then we finished school, but we got married January 9th, 1969.  And, at that time, the Vietnam War was going on.  He got drafted and he had to go to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, so at that point we had an apartment and I then set up housekeeping there and continued to go to class.  But we were poor as dirt.  Now, thank God my college tuition was taken care of and everything, but I had to hold down three jobs.  I worked at the Illinois String Research Project, I worked at night at JCPenney cleaning the kitchen, and I also did a little bit of counseling work at the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] to make ends meet.  So I--'cause I had to get the rent paid.  So I was going to school and working three jobs.  And I just remember being exhausted and I went all the way down to about 101 pounds, I just remember that.  It was tough and I didn't want my mother [Marie Iris Crump] to know any of this because I--it was important for me to keep it all together.  It was important to me to make everything look wonderful.  And that has been who I am.  Everything's gonna look wonderful no matter how bad it is.  So he was at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri and, you know, I didn't know whether he was gonna be shipped out or not.  And I happened to be watching TV at the time, and Lyndon B. Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] came on and said that they had to increase the number of minorities in the reserve units.  And I went, ah, ha, now I can get him out.  So I went down to the reserve unit and was able to get him transferred after basic training camp into the reserve unit so he never got shipped out.
Speaker 2: You got him to--
Speaker 1: I got him into the reserve unit so he wouldn't get shipped out.
Speaker 2: What did you tell them?
Speaker 1: I told 'em where he was and that he was a former student at the University of Illinois, and they, they listened to me.  And he got into the reserve unit.
Speaker 2: Well, he was appreciative of that.  Let's change tapes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't know.
Story_ID: 411769
Speaker 1: Are you based?  Where are you based at this point, are you based (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We're still in Champaign [Illinois].
Speaker 1: In Champaign, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But for that last year?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we stayed in Champaign 'til I graduated [from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, and then after graduation?
Speaker 2: Then we went to Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], and then he [Johnson's ex-husband, Robert L. Johnson] started over again and I taught in the Woodbridge Township public school system [Woodbridge Township School District] while he was taking classes.
Speaker 1: Now how was that?  That was your first time really in the Northeast.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was in charge of five junior high schools teaching music.  It was in a very rough area, it was tough.  I did it for only one year and then I was able to get a job at Princeton Day School, which was right there in Princeton [New Jersey], and that was great.  You know, it was like a country club (laughter).
Speaker 1: So that was--it was hard also for African Americans to be hired into a private school.
Speaker 2: I did not find that to be a problem at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not at all.  In fact, they welcomed me with opened arms and the headmaster there, Doug McClure [Douglas O. McClure, Sr.], I mean, they were, they were terrific.  I had absolutely no problems there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 411770
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So we were in Princeton [New Jersey] for two years and then Bob [Johnson's ex-husband, Robert L. Johnson] became a--oh, he wanted to be--he was thinking at the time to be a [U.S.] Foreign Service officer.  And we then moved to Europe, we were living in Brussels [Belgium] and he was interning at NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization].  So we spent a whole summer in Brussels which was great.  It was actually probably our best summer together.
Speaker 2: And what was good about that summer?
Speaker 1: Well, we were together and, you know, it was romantic.  It was, you know, we were in Europe, we got to learn about European customs.  I learned about wines, I took classes on how to set a table properly, and really being able to entertain.  Actually, could have been why I'm in hospitality now (laughter).  You know, that could have been the beginning of my whole hospitality career.
Speaker 2: Well, Brussels is supposed to have some wonderful restaurants and food (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, they have great restaurants and I--you know, we did, we did a fair amount of traveling, went to Spain, we did a lot.
Speaker 2: Okay, in that year you were--are we in 1972 or '73 [1973] at this point?
Speaker 1: I think it was '72 [1972],
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nineteen seventy-two [1972].
Story_ID: 411771
Speaker 1: So you leave the whole NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] thing and then do you come (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We come to Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Now, what, what precipitates the move to Washington?
Speaker 2: Because that's where everybody who's done [U.S.] Foreign Service work immediately comes to Washington.  Then he [Johnson's ex-husband, Robert L. Johnson] decided he didn't wanna go into Foreign Service and he then got in--a job with the Corporation of Public Broadcasting [sic. Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Washington, D.C.].  That was during the Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] administration.  And about ten months into that, that's when Nixon got elected.  And that's a government appointed position, so what happened is everyone was fired from CPB at the time.  And he started working for the Washington Urban League [Greater Washington Urban League, Washington, D.C.] with [HistoryMaker] Sterling Tucker.  Then from there--and I was teaching at Sidwell Friends School [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: So now, was Sidwell Friends different from the Princeton Day School [Princeton, New Jersey] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they're the same.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Private school is private school.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what, you were teaching music?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I taught the violin and, when I was at Sidwell, that was the time when I decided that--they actually hired me to play the guitar and just sing to kids.  I said, "But I'm a violinist."  He said, "We just need a music teacher."  So right then and there I knew number one, they weren't gonna take music seriously.  But being who I am, I decided to make them take music seriously and I started an orchestra there.  And it became one of the best well-known orchestras in the city.
Speaker 1: Can we talk about that 'cause I found that whole story--this is youth strings in action, right?
Speaker 2: Young Strings in Action.
Speaker 1: Young Strings, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about what, you know, how you got that started and what, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, what had, what had happened--and I'm gonna take you back into college again, because one of the greatest things that happened to me at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] is I was asked as an undergraduate to participate in the Illinois String Research Project.  The Illinois String Research Project was funded through the [U.S.] Department of Education.  And I told you that Paul Rolland brought Suzuki into the country.  Well, the Department of Education was a little bit upset by that and decided to give him a half million dollars to actually do a re- it was a research grant to try and get more string players--more young people to start playing strings in our country.  You know, why, if the Japanese could do that, why couldn't we do what we were doing.  Well, Paul Rolland, being the intellectual that he is--was, decided to incorporate movement and, and getting kids to play and it's really still based similarly on the Suzuki movement.  So I was asked to come into the String Research Project and I actually would teach.  So I have--I was ten steps ahead of a lot of people who were just breaking into the teaching profession 'cause I was able to do it during my college days.  And that--I was, I was able to make money and I taught lessons privately, and I also taught group lessons at the university.  And the other thing that happened with me is I also became very good in orchestra conducting.  I mean, I really, really enjoyed orchestra conducting.  So I was able to do all of that, and the name Young Strings in Action came from the book that Paul Rolland wrote, 'Young Strings in Action.'  Now, the other great thing about this, I then travelled to Europe with him to do a lot of teaching abroad.  And for eight summers in a row, I taught at Homerton College, Cambridge [University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England].  And I was teaching teachers how to teach children.
Speaker 1: So this was during the time you were at Sidwell?
Speaker 2: So I--yeah, I tell you, I did a lot of things.  I was a multitasker.  So during the summers I, I would, you know for about two to four weeks I would be with the Illinois String Research Project and we would be teaching.  And that's where I met Max Rostal and Yehudi Menuhin and a lot of the, the greats, Janos Starker.  They were all part of this so I was, I was--had entre into a very privileged group of, of musicians where I was really working with string pedagogy and really trying to teach teacher how to work with young people, how to communicate with them the steps in which to teach a young child.  Because a lot of great artists are very, very talented and they pick it up like that.  But they don't understand what it takes to really teach a young mind because they're naturally gifted.  They've never had to go through the steps that normal people go through.  Even though I was gifted, I had to work very hard at learning to play the instrument and I remember what I went through.  'Cause I had good teachers that taught me these things, and I was able to take Paul Rolland's knowledge plus the knowledge of what I had gone through myself and was able to combine the two.  So I had a great gift to be able to reach young minds, and teaching to me is still inside of me.  I still love doing it.  I love talking with young people, I love imparting knowledge to young people and I realized during that period that I was gonna be a great teacher.  And I was a very good teacher.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And I taught all the way to 1989.
Story_ID: 411772
Speaker 1: So at Sidwell [Sidwell Friends School, Washington, D.C.] at the time, what-who was the headmaster at the time, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Robert Smith [Robert L. Smith].
Speaker 1: Robert Smith, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bob Smith, yeah.
Speaker 1: And were there other black teachers at Sidwell at the time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, not at all.
Speaker 1: That's what I would think, okay.
Speaker 2: So anyway, I started this orchestra [Young Strings in Action] and it became very successful and of course, when something successful, there's jealousy within the departments.  And Sidwell at the time was going through a turbulent period from kind of in getting in that flower children era.  And, me, going back to where my parents [Marie Iris Crump and George P. Crump, Sr.] were and being a musician--we're gonna toe the line.  These kids are gonna learn something, this is not about fun and games.  So I started this orchestra, the parents loved it.  They loved the structure, they loved the focus that the kids were getting.  And I was at Sidwell from '72 [1972] to '75 [1975] and during that time I really felt the friction where I was not getting the support from the school for this orchestra.  I didn't have the financial backing in my department to get money, so I would raise money for this orchestra.  I mean, we would do fun things like I would have all the fathers come to the cafeteria, I would take the cafeteria and they, they cooked.  And we actually had a potluck dinner, and we would have people come in and they sit down and eat, and I had the orchestra in the center of the cafeteria.  And we performed.  And the parents gave us a standing ovation, I'm like I'm on to something here.  These kids were good.  Not only had I taught everyone of 'em privately, but I was able to put that orchestra together, conduct it, and make one of the finest young string orchestras that Washington's [Washington, D.C.] ever seen.
Speaker 1: So what you're saying to--I'm sorry--what I hear you saying is that Sidwell had a just okay music department when you came in?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, no it was not great at all, not at all.  They had a strong choral department in the high school, but like many schools and especially private school, the arts are not a priority.  And I really not only wanted to just teach there but I wanted to put the music department on a pedestal.  'Cause they had the capabilities of doing it, 'cause I still and have always believed that music should be--the arts should be a part of every young mind--person's life.  It's better--it helps 'em to learn a lot better, they're much more aware of their own feelings and the world around it.  It brings a consciousness level that is so important.  And I was able to do that.  I mean, these kids were good, they started winning competitions, solo competitions.
Story_ID: 411773
Speaker 1: And the greatest thing that happened during that time--no, it wasn't during Sidwell [Sidwell Friends School, Washington, D.C.], I'm sorry, it was in 1984.  I can tell you exactly when it happened, that orch- when I left Sidwell, the parents wanted me to take the orchestra [Young Strings in Action] with them.  So the orchestra kept growing and in fact it grew to a hundred forty string players, African American, Jewish, Indian, Asian (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So how did it grow?  Where did you have the orchestra at that point?
Speaker 1: In my house.  I did it in my house.  See, nobody can stop me from doing anything.  I went and bought a house.  We were living up on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] and I, I told Bob [Johnson's ex-husband, Robert L. Johnson], I said, "Look I wanna keep this orchestra going," so I sold the house--I was good at real estate too--and I had this house on Capitol Hill but I had bought with five thousand dollars down.  And I remember it cost thirty thousand dollars, and I was able to sell it for sixty-eight thousand dollars so I was able to then take that money and move up into an all-white area in upper Northwest Washington [D.C.].  Had a house big enough where I had the whole basement and I could put my orchestra in the basement.  Now, I didn't know that you didn't need--you needed zoning and everything but I got away with it, all those years.  And so, that orchestra, I taught violin there.
Speaker 2: So from '75 [1975] to--
Speaker 1: Nineteen, really 'til 1989.
Speaker 2: You, you, you had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I--that was my first business.  I set up a business in my home.  I went and got a good tax accountant, I found out I could write off one-third of my house, I could write one-third of all repairs, I could write off one-third of all utilities, one-third of the toilet paper, anything that dealt with the business I could write off.  'Cause I used and I could prove that I used that basement full-time seven days a week.  And so I was able to write off one-third of the repairs on the driveway 'cause people pulled up in there and brought their kids in for their lessons.  And I was--I have to say I was one darn good teacher and a good business person.
Story_ID: 411774
Speaker 1: And now, this gets very complicated and you have to follow this closely, 'cause during that time, if you can also remember, that was when the whole cable thing started, okay.
Speaker 2: So Bob [Johnson's ex-husband, Robert L. Johnson] (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The reason why I left Sidwell [Sidwell Friends School, Washington, D.C.], 'cause I knew--Bob came to me with the idea.  He says, you know all these people are taking these proposals up on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.] and starting these cable networks.  And I remember us sitting in the family room and we're watching TV and I'm like, why isn't there any positive stories about African Americans?  I said, if everybody else is starting a cable network--and we, we just started talking.  I says, why can't we start one?  So he took--he was taking, actually the next day he was taking--it was a guy who wanted to start a senior citizen channel, couldn't get the funding for it, and he went to throw the proposal away.  And, Bob says, "Look, let me have that."  He says, "Can I have it?"  And the guy said, "Yeah."  So he brings it home, we cross out senior citizen, put in black.  So the proposal was there, re-did the proposal, took it out to John Malone [John C. Malone] in Denver [Colorado], loved the idea.  And that's how we got the first funding for BET [Black Entertainment Television].
Speaker 2: But let's, let's go back because--how did Bob get from, you know, the [U.S.] Foreign Service to the (unclear) 'cause you say he was working--to a national cable television association (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right, remember we, we left off at the Corporation of Public Broadcasting [sic. Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Washington, D.C.].  Then from there it became a lobbyist with the National Cable Television Association [NCTA - The Internet and Television Association], and that's how he found out about all these cable channels starting up.  Because NCTA was behind all of it, so that was the time of the birth of cable.  So, I say, well, if you quit your job there, I better beef up on my end 'cause somebody's gotta get the bills paid here.  So I actually signed the first loan that was to get all of the rent together to open offices up for BET.  And we were in the American Trial Lawyers building [Association of Trial Lawyers of America; American Association for Justice] in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: So what year is this then that he--
Speaker 1: This is 1979.
Speaker 2: Okay, 1979.
Speaker 1: Is when we started doing this.
Speaker 2: Okay, and you--
Speaker 1: And that's why I was teaching in the home.
Speaker 2: Okay, in the home.  And you felt, you felt good about the idea?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah.  I, you know, was gonna be as supportive as possible and I was gonna knock my brains out to make this work.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yup, and I was right there.  I signed the first loan to get this thing started.  John Malone gave us a half million dollars.  You know, we went through that like liquid.
Speaker 2: Now the half million, John Malone first of all at this point is the, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, he is the--they called him the Darth Vader of the cable industry.  I mean, he controlled all cable outlets throughout the country.  And, I mean, if you had to get someone on your side, that's the man.  And he was enamored with Bob and he really like the concept.  And, you know, all the way to the end John Malone has been funding and helping BET from the very beginning.  So the criticism, you know, that we sold out to the white man, the white man was really behind the scenes paying for all this.  So that's what was really going on.
Speaker 2: Do you know what other places during that time you tried to get funding besides John Malone?
Speaker 1: No, he was our bingo man.  We just went right to him and he, he was the only one with the money (laughter).
Speaker 2: Were there others involved besides John Malone in the initial funding?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: There was just John Malone, okay.  Now what about--
Speaker 1: Now, that didn't happen 'til a little bit later on.  As we were I think in about our third year, and we just weren't making money.  We then sold off parts of the company to HBO and Taft Broadcasting [Taft Broadcasting Company].  So they were able to funnel more money into the company at the time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did Madison Square Garden [New York, New York] play a role in terms of distribution? No, okay.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: So, you have--so really it's, it's John Malone and it was TCI [Tele-Communications, Inc.].  Was it John Malone or TCI?
Speaker 1: It was John Malone really (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was John Malone, okay.
Story_ID: 411775
Speaker 1: Can you describe those early years of BET [Black Entertainment Television]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  They were tough because to get a network on the air, you gotta get advertising to keep it on there.  And nobody believed in us, even the African American community.  Ebony magazine, we would go to them to help.  We wanted to, you know, help with the advertising.  Nobody.  We couldn't even get the hair care companies behind us, so it was tough.  It--I, I cannot begin to tell you how tough it was.  And even when we were taking cameras around to, you know, try to film things.  I remember at one point I think Bob [Johnson's ex-husband, Robert L. Johnson] and a group of camera people were down in New Orleans [Louisiana] and they swore that--because he was always hiring a lot of women.  They thought he was running a prostitution ring, you know.  So then that got cleaned up and then--it, it was the usual stuff.  And it, it was just tough, just getting people to believe in our vision and in our--and in what we were doing.
Speaker 1: Well, let's, you know, set some of the whole thing.  First of all, the industry back in 1979, 1980 is still very new.  And you haven't entered--really there's been the urban markets haven't really come on.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, so for BET really to get, to get started it needed the urban areas.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that's where we were trying to get into, you know.  The programing as such was not what our African American community wanted to see.  You know, we, we had Petey Greene all the way up to his death.  And I don't know if you remember the Petey Greene show ['Petey Greene's Washington'] when he'd be sitting up there eating chitlins and watermelons, and this is how you eat a pork chop.  We got more phone calls, they called it garbage programming, and I have to say, that is not the programming I wanted.  I figured if were gonna start an African American network, we wanted something that we were gonna be proud of.  I didn't want it to be Ebony magazine, I wanted it to be more critical in the sense of let's bring the real stories in there.  Let's talk about, let's dialog, let's communicate on issues within the African American community.  The problem was, is the African American community were not supporting those programs.  So that's when the video market starting coming in.  We were able--BET could not turn a corner until videos came on.
Speaker 1: In what year do you remember that being (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I do not remember that; I would say it's within the fifth year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I remember that's when the books started to balance.  And suddenly we got this younger audience to watch BET, and then that's where the advertisers we had to start marketing too.  It's that eighteen and thirty-five-year old range.  And to this day, that is a critical part of the audience of BET.
Speaker 1: So that was a critical decision made in that, in that within that first five years that you were gonna change the focus to, to focus on the, the-
Speaker 2: We had to make money.  We weren't making money.  MTV [Music Television; MTV] would not--they started the video market, but they would not put on any African American videos, so then when Michael Jackson was our first guy that came and he says, "Play my videos."  And, and then the audience transferred from MTV to BET because we were, you know, a lot of white folks like Michael Jackson too.  So we were starting to get more of an audience base and that way we were able to the advertiser were then like okay, well, we'll support it or we'll, you know, buy time on the network.
Speaker 1: So this was good in that you didn't have to pay for the videos, so you got--you didn't have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, all the videos are free.  They're just looking for an outlet, and so that became a basic part of the programming and it still is to this day.  And we did try to put newsworthy programming on.  You know, if you look at all the African Americans out there, BET really gave African Americans that were going in the media their launch in life.  [HistoryMaker]  Tavis Smiley was on there, Ed Gordon [HistoryMaker Ed Gordon, III].  I mean I can name lots of people who got their start in television through BET.
Story_ID: 411776
Speaker 1: Now, the early days of BET [Black Entertainment Television], let's just take you back.  Where was it first--where was its first office?  Like, you're--
Speaker 2: Right in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] on it's called the American Trial Lawyers building [Association of Trial Lawyers of America; American Association for Justice].  And I can't remember--it's either 30th [Street] or 31st Street that was down near the canal.  And that's where I had to sign that loan to get office space.
Speaker 1: So you signed the loan, so Bob [Johnson's ex-husband, Robert L. Johnson] can open up the office?
Speaker 2: Right, 'cause I was employed at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was your function at the time?
Speaker 2: My function at the time was to keep the bills paid.  So I was teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're teaching and doing your music things?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I was also coming down to the office almost on daily basis, just helping out, doing whatever I had to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you working--a lot of times, you know, people end up, you know, were you working with the books, the records, things like that?
Speaker 2: No, just ideas, more ideas in everything and just, you know, it was just different things.  Whether it was running to do this to deliver packages or do--you know, you just do grunt work, just to make it--I didn't really come into BET full-time, and I was on the board of directors, because I helped him found the station.  I really didn't come on there full-time until about 1990.  And I worked in the office day-in and day-out.
Speaker 1: So, now, why was the decision made that you were coming in 1990?
Speaker 2: 'Cause that's when I decided to stop teaching.  Because during from '84 [1984] to '89 [1989] I was working with--I was actually given the job through King Hussein [King Hussein of Jordan] and Queen Noor [Queen Noor of Jordan] to start a music conservatory [National Music Conservatory] in Amman, Jordan and that conservatory still exists 'til this day.  So I was commuting through the state department [U.S. Department of State] back and forth to Amman, and our children were coming along at the time and I was actually running that program in Amman, Jordan for King Hussein and Queen Noor.
Speaker 1: Well that seems like you guys were two--you're doing this very sort of international, very music focus.  You know, you're at your home so there's always classical music playing any many ways, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, I was wondering because I think around that time, maybe a little earlier were you coming across the likes of [HistoryMaker] Peggy Cooper Cafritz (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, I knew her really well.  I was on the Arts Commission [D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Peggy and I were on the commission for the arts and she was head of the commission at the time.  So, yeah.  And it, it was during that time--I really, I have to say, I was able to work it where I was able to do the Amman, Jordan job and to roll in and out of BET and to keep the home life together.  I, I'm just good at multitasking, that's just my strength.  And I was able, you know, some people call me Superwoman a lot, you know, but that's, that's what I did.  And then once the music conservatory was set up and was going very well, in fact, I received the highest honor from King Hussein in education, the Medal Al Nahda [ph.] for the work that I'd done (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you talk about--
Story_ID: 411777
Speaker 1: --For the work that I'd done (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can you talk about your work, you know, with King Hussein [King Hussein of Jordan] a little bit more and the trip?  How that even came about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, that wonderful orchestra [Young Strings in Action] that I was talking about, we were giving--we, we gave concerts all over the place.  And we were in the Old Post Office Pavilion [Old Post Office Tower, Washington, D.C.] and we were performing.  And we were just--I mean the audience was packed and suddenly this delegation comes in and it's the Jordanian delegation and Her Majesty Queen Noor [Queen Noor of Jordan], and she just stopped and listened to the orchestra.  And then a man came up on the stage and I remember his name was Dr. Mazen Armouti, and he says, "Her Majesty wish to speak to you."  And I'm like, "Her Majesty?"  "Queen Noor of Jordan, may she approach the children."  And I said, "Oh, absolutely."  The kids were getting ready to get up and I had 'em all sit down.  She came up on the stage and she says, "They are wonderful."  I said, "Well, thank you."  She says, "They're so talented."  Now, I had kids in there from ages five up to eighteen, I mean, I had some talented five year olds.  You know, we're playing Vivaldi's [Antonio Vivaldi] 'Four Seasons.'  I mean, some very, very fine musicians.  And the great thing about the orchestra it was very diverse, so you saw a huge African American population, we had Asians, some Indian, it, it was just a great orchestra.  So she went through and talked to all of them.  And while she was speaking with them Dr. Armouti asked me to come off the stage which I did and he says, "Are you free this evening at eight o'clock?"  He says, "The Jordanian ambassador would like to speak with you."  And I said, "Sure."  So, eight o'clock rolls around that evening, you know, I dismissed the kids.  The phone rings right at 8:01 and the ambassador gets on the phone and there's other state department [U.S. Department of State] officials and they said, "Her Majesty thinks your orchestra is the best she's ever heard, and we would like to meet with you at the possibility of you bringing the orchestra to Jordan."  And I said, "You're kidding."  He says, "No, we're not kidding."  So the next night I go to the Jordanian ambassador's house over in McLean [Virginia] and I walk in, there's all men in there.  And then there's a chair, and I'm interrogated.  That's a very strong word but they're asking me all kind of questions from my political preferences to who I am and, you know, it just went on.  And when that was over, suddenly the doors opened and the women walk in with food, plates of food and the party began.  And they explained to me before they came in that she would like me to bring the orchestra over to represent--to be represented in the Jerash Festival [Jerash Festival for Culture and Arts], which is the oldest cultural festival in the Middle East and it's like the Olympics.  And, they, they choose only the finest organizations to come over and perform, and they said they've never chosen a children's group before but my group was asked.  So this was a little bit surreal, but the thing about this that was so interesting, I was so naive at the time on the politics between Israel and Jordan Palestinians.  So I was all excited and I called a meeting to all the parents and the kids in the orchestra and I told them.  I was so excited and everything, and some parents raised their hand and they said, "My kid's not going."  I said, "Why," so he says, "We have Israeli, we're, you know, we have Israeli stamps on the passport."  I said, "So?"  And this kind of went on, you know, so my joy went to real concern at that point.  I'm like what is going on here.  So I called the state department and they told me the issues.  And I said, "You know what, I'm not accepting this, because that's not what the arts are all about.  We're not about politics, we're about bridging gaps, and we're about healing."  And I stuck to that philosophy, and I just told them, "Then get new passports reissued if you would like to come and do this."  Well, it became a real political hotbed amongst some of the parents.  So some of those students did not go, but I was not gonna ruin that opportunity for all the rest of the students where it was not an issue.  I think in the end most of all of 'em went, and I'm telling you, they were so glad that they went.  They were so happy that they went.  And because it was not only a lesson in politics--'cause young people, they didn't get embroiled in all this.  So they were staying in the homes of a lot of the other students in Jordan, they were able to talk about their concerns.  I mean, we were really able to open dialogue.  And I said you know what, we, we could make this work.
Story_ID: 412012
Speaker 1: So this is 1985 that you do this, this must be a total delight that you've done this (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was unbelievable.  I'll tell you, I was on such an adrenaline high, I don't think I slept for two weeks.  And I just was pinching myself, I could not believe this was happening for me and for the students [in Young Strings in Action].  And the students were so excited.  We just became so newsworthy in Washington [D.C.], we even had a proclamation from [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry, they named it Young Strings in Action Day.  We were on the news.  When the buses pulled up to take the kids to New York [New York] to get on Royal Jordanian Airlines, the king [King Hussein of Jordan] sent his plane for us, the news cameras were there, all channels.  I mean this was a historical moment that we were representing the United States at this very important festival [Jerash Festival for Culture and Arts].  And these were students, they had become ambassadors and it was so exciting because an American university even sent a student reporter with us.
Story_ID: 412013
Speaker 1: So this is exciting to you?
Speaker 2: No, this is very exciting, and I have to say for two weeks that I, I couldn't even sleep.  You know, just in preparation of the trip and the children [in Young Strings in Action] really became celebrities.  And the city was so proud of us that we had a proclamation that was given to us in our honor by [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry, we had news coverage from all three stations, we were all over the newspaper.  American University, WAMU [WAMU Radio, Washington, D.C.], actually sent a student reporter with us who reported daily.  And we, we came online everyday so the parents could hear what we were doing.  And I have to say that evening the opening of the festival [Jerash Festival for Culture and Arts]--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: The opening of the festival. We were, we were at the tail end.  They had everybody there from the Bolshoi Ballet to the theater of the deaf out of Minnesota, they had all these incredible--the Russian ballet, opera singers, and so we were at the tail end.  And every performing group would come in carrying the flag of their nation so it was just like the Olympics.  And they would come into this el Greco [Greco-Roman] city that was just extraordinary.  It had been unearthed, you know, it was buried during an earthquake so it was really preserved well.  So we came in, I think it was the Dixieland Jazz Band was just ahead of us.  There were two other groups from the U.S. representatives, of course, they were adults and so when we came into the coliseum the crowd erupted.  And there you have King Hussein [King Hussein of Jordan] and Queen Noor [Queen Noor of Jordan] and they are sitting on their throne, and as my students came in and everyone's supposed to do something, you know, you know.  The Japanese group came in with the--all of their puppetry and everything.  Well, what can we do as violinists and cellists?  So we came in and were all dressed in cowboy outfits, you know, they were in red, white and blue, and I had the costumes all made.  And the kids just looked adorable, and they came in holding their instruments and we did a little dance coming in behind the Dixieland Jazz Band.  But as we came in there, people came up on their seats and flowers were thrown in, I mean, we were just really bombarded with flowers.  And then King Hussein stood up and when he stood up and he embraced the kids, rifles, we were just--I looked up it was just a sea of rifles.  I couldn't even see the sky, was surrounding us 'cause when the King comes in he is thoroughly protected.  But he embraced every one of the children and he told 'em how much he loved--he was the most charismatic, the warmest person I've ever met.  And then, of course Her Majesty, she welcomed us and she was wonderful too.  And, it, it was just a magical evening.  I mean, I, I couldn't hold back tears 'cause I was so proud of these kids that we had gotten this far.  And it was just, it was just terrific.
Story_ID: 412014
Speaker 1: So then that evening we gave our first concert at the foot of the Temple of Artemis [Temple of Artemis, Jerash, Jerash, Jordan], and we played all of this classical music.  And then the thing--the audience got a little restless and immediately I realized, oh, I gotta change something.  So if we were playing the Vivaldi [Antonio Vivaldi] 'Four Seasons,' I would have to--or the Pachelbel [Johann Pachelbel] 'Canon,' which is one of the--I would then have to address the audience because they weren't relating, 'cause they have oriental music and then this very high-profile classical music.  And I have to refer to every piece that we played to a movie, and then they go, oh, yeah!  Pachelbel 'Canon' from 'Ordinary People,' or the 'Four Seasons' from the movie 'The Four Seasons' and they were like--and they would sit still and listen to this.  It was the hardest first concert I have ever given in my life, 'cause I had to give them a point of reference of what they were listening to.  They knew the movies but they didn't remember the music.  So it was really interesting.  So we went on through that next two weeks and the kids [in Young Strings in Action] stayed healthy and some of 'em got a little sick on the food.  But we had the most wonderful time and that's when King Hussein [King Hussein of Jordan] and Queen Noor [Queen Noor of Jordan] came to me and says, "We would like you to start a music conservatory in our country."  And that was the beginning of that phase of my life, so I was doing that and I was coming every three months but I was also teaching, and then in the meantime I had Paige [Paige Johnson Payne] so I had to bring a nanny with me.  And then taking Paige as an infant to Jordan, so she kind of--her first couple of years were really spent at going back and forth on a plane in Amman, Jordan.  And I remember her ears being so sensitive in the plane, she would be screaming and hollering 'cause of the air pressure.  And it was tough, but I had the nanny with me and I remember Paige taking her first steps in the Intercontinental Hotel [InterContinental Amman, Amman, Jordan].  She was running up and down the hall 'cause she learned to walk very quickly, and I remember sticking her in the back of a timpani section with a mallet so that she could--you know, 'cause she got bored.  She was like her mom (laughter), I can't sit still.  And I remember having her in her little bassinet right up under the podium of where I was conducting and working with the kids, so she was by my side the whole time.
Story_ID: 412015
Speaker 1: What was it like setting up this conservatory [National Music Conservatory, Amman, Jordan]?  What did you actually do in those three months, you know, going--I mean, of going back every three months?
Speaker 2: Every three months, in between when I was back home I would be raising money through the state department [U.S. Department of State] to help support this, because Amman [Jordan] did not have the money for this orchestra.  The queen [Queen Noor of Jordan] then set up a committee of very wealthy Jordanians and Palestinians, very prominent citizens from the community and they also were raising money.  So I would go back and I would spend three weeks training the teachers, because that was the issue, who was gonna teach these kids.  I couldn't do it; I couldn't do everything.  So I was recruiting teachers and then during the summer months, those teachers came to the U.S. and I taught them at Shenandoah University [Winchester, Virginia] and at George Mason University [Fairfax, Virginia], so I was able to get all the string teachers trained.  And so once the conservatory got up, they were then able to teach the young students and I was able--I also had to try and get instruments into that country.  So I was doing deals with Boosey & Hawkes to get music in there, I was doing deals with all of the instrument manufacturers of donating violins.  I was then also doing--asking people if they have violins in their attic, could they get 'em to me and I'd have 'em refurbished, and we would send instruments over.  So there was a lot of off-site work where I had to do to get this conservatory started, by bringing instruments in there, by getting music, by getting music stands, also getting someone trained in Amman who could repair instruments for that climate which is important.  So, you know, you have to look at the whole thing, so I'm literally setting up a business there and also trying to keep my own business going.  And also trying to be very supportive with BET [Black Entertainment Television] going on at the same time.  So we had a lot of balls in the air at the time, we were very, very busy.
Story_ID: 412016
Speaker 1: You said this was the state department [U.S. Department of State].  I think I read that USAI was it Univer--
Speaker 2: United States Information Agency (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) United States Information--
Speaker 2: USIA.
Speaker 1: Because they do a lot of that in terms of exporting our culture.
Speaker 2: Exactly, that's, that's what we were doing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now was any of this non-profit like was the orchestra at all?
Speaker 2: It was all non-profit, yeah.  My orchestra was for-profit.  I mean, I had to pay bills.  I mean, you know, students paid me and, you know, that's how I made my living, it was a business.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your orchestra, how often would it perform, you know?
Speaker 2: Gosh, I would say in a month we sometimes would perform every week.  We became that popular, we played at the Corcoran [Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.], we, we just performed everywhere.
Speaker 1: That was a lot of kids to keep in, in--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I did it though (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, and the, and the parents were coming, they were bringing their kids from all over is that--
Speaker 2: All over the metropolitan area, I mean, we did a really fun concert for the Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company for a fundraiser.  It was--Alice in Wonderland was the theme, and I had a very talented parent--she died of breast cancer not too long ago, who literally made gigantic cards.  I mean, my kids became a deck of cards.  And we would be performing and we would shuffle.  I mean, we, we were incredible.  I mean, we did things that no other group of musicians would ever do.  I choreographed everything and they would continue to play, and because they were so good and so fluid and had such wonderful sound is because they moved.  You know, usually you'll see violinists and they're very strict in their move--we didn't we flowed, we danced, we were--they were able to do almost headstands playing the violin.  That's why they were called Young Strings in Action.
Speaker 1: Were any of the kids--did they ever--have any of them gone on and we know them now, you know, that started with you?
Speaker 2: Performing?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I forgot Rachel's [Rachel Young] last name, Rachel plays with the National Symphony [National Symphony Orchestra] and she's a, a great cellist.  She's really the only one that has really gone on professionally, the rest of 'em still play but for their own enjoyment.  But they've gone into other professions.  Some of 'em are doctors, Johns Hopkins [The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland], some are lawyers, they're spread out all over the place, some are business people.  But that music really gave them the foundation of their lives.
Speaker 1: So in many ways your business with the music was very profitable?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  No, I made money.  I made money, it kept us with a AAA rating on our, you know, credit.  I mean, I really--it was important to me, you know, and people don't realize it was important to me to not only help grow BET [Black Entertainment Television] but I had to keep the family together.  And I was gonna do all I could to do that, and I wanted him [Johnson's ex-husband, Robert L. Johnson] to shine.
Story_ID: 412017
Speaker 1: I really wanted to make him [Johnson's ex-husband, Robert L. Johnson] look good and to shine, I wanted that business to work and that's where I saw my job.  You know, I helped him get it started.  It was important that, if I couldn't keep things working behind the scenes, it was gonna fall apart in front of the scene.  And that's what people don't realize, it has to be a partnership in order to make things work.  'Cause if your home life is falling apart and you're trying to build a business, your business isn't gonna work.  So that's where I found the challenge was keeping home life together to make sure that the business kept growing and to step in whenever I was needed.  Now, when I came in to the company full-time--
Speaker 2: Which is 1989?
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-nine [1989], 1990 is when I started reporting to work (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, Paige [Paige Johnson Payne] is about what--how old at that point, she's?
Speaker 1: She was '85 [1985]--she was five years old, so she was entering kindergarten (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So that makes, that makes sense, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then Brett [Brett Johnson]--I had another child between Brett and Paige who died.  And that child I lost at childbirth, about six hours after he was born.
Speaker 2: So that was hard.
Speaker 1: That was very, very hard.  So, you deal with it and you just keep going.  And, and then Brett came along and he was in '89 [1989], and he's, he's, you know, they say the third child is that angel from heaven.  And there he is, great young man, great young man.  So, anyway, I, I started really coming in and out, and I had my dear Mary [ph.] at the time who stayed back with Brett and, you know, helped me.  And we'd bring Brett into the office.  And that's when I really worked at BET [Black Entertainment Television] full-time.
Speaker 2: So now, what was your position when you came in?
Speaker 1: I was executive vice president for corporate affairs.  And my job was to really keep the community linked between BET and the community.  Not only local community but the national community, I would--there was a BET Foundation I had set up and that foundation was to give money to where I thought that helped BET keeps its face, a positive face, out in the community both locally and nationally.  The other thing that really concerned me, however, and this is important was the video market.  And as you know, it started going down a big slippery slope.  And the moral compass of the network I became very concerned about, we were really getting hit with a lot of negative publicity especially with the videos that were being shown.  Even though our audience base had grown substantially, I didn't like the way the network was going. Now we did bring in some news programming and we did some other things to kind of counterbalance but I did not like the negativity in which these young people were absorbing the video market.  And that to me bothered me more than anything--
Story_ID: 412018
Speaker 1: So what I did is I started a show called 'Teen Summit' and 'Teen Summit' was a magazine format show [on Black Entertainment Television].  When I went to Jeff Lee [HistoryMaker Jefferi Lee] and other people within that department, I said I really think we should create this.  There is a teen market out there that is getting exposed to in a negative way that I need to get my hands wrapped around.  So what I was able to do was to start 'Teen Summit.'  And it was great, I mean, we, we had a little bit of a funny start.  It was trying to find someone who could really relate to inner city kids, could really talk their lingo, could get inside their heads and expose them to something that was better, and to really get them to communicate.  And talk about issues that they were uncomfortable talking about with their own parents, that we could really open dialogue and start talking with their peer group.  So that we were able to address the negativity on the video market, we were then able to take up other issues, the teen pregnancy prevention 'cause I was on the commission to prevent teen pregnancy.  Because pregnancy was going at an enormous increase at the time especially among the African American community.  We were seeing a huge influx of black teens getting pregnant, and that really bothered me.  The other thing is we would talk about everything from--we called it checkerboard dating, we'd talk about safe sex, we would talk to parents, we would talk about racism, we talked about everything on 'Teen Summit' that we needed to talk about.  And the way I was able to do that, I was able to select twenty-five really stellar young people that became my posse.  And I didn't use all twenty-five of 'em every week 'cause they had to go to school, but they would--we would meet on Friday evenings and we would put the show together on Friday evenings.  And we would go live on Saturdays.  And that show won every award in the book.  I mean, it is great.  Now, I'm still continuing that format now and we can talk about that as we move on.
Speaker 2: Okay, what I wanna understand can--can we just go back a little bit about 'Teen Summit'?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Who is--I wanna know who the staff is at the time, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Jeff Lee, Deborah Tang, Jackie Coleman [Jacqueline Coleman], I can't remember every--those are the three that I worked with constantly--
Speaker 2: And--
Story_ID: 412019
Speaker 1: At this point do you have--does BET [Black Entertainment Television] have production services at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they did.  Yeah, we had bought a building next to it, it was a big--a beef warehouse.  And we did buy that.  But production services, we had already when we, when we built the building out there in Northeast [Washington, D.C.], we built production in there.
Speaker 1: So when did the building get built in Northeast?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  It was in the early '90s [1990s].  I just--I can't remember specifically (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, this also I think another important thing has happened, and that is district cable television, you know.  And I just want to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't wanna skip over that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, I really was not involved in that.  That was a [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry, Bob Johnson [Johnson's ex-husband, Robert L. Johnson] and whoever else was bidding on cable at the time and--
Speaker 1: But really Bob Johnson ended up--
Speaker 2: He was awarded the franchise.
Speaker 1: So he owned BET and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that was very short lived and then I don't know what happened after that, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay, okay.
Story_ID: 412020
Speaker 1: That happened before we're talking about 'Teen Summit' coming on [Black Entertainment Television]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause 'Teen Summit' came on and this was an attempt by you if I, you know, (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: To really sort of change the course of programming.
Speaker 2: I really wanted to not so much change the course of programming but to be able to give an intelligent voice.  It's called smart media watching more than anything, I wanted those young people to be able to discuss issues that were pertinent to them in their lives.  They were being glossed over.  We, in a sense, were feeding them all this negative stuff through videos.  That was the only way we were reaching kids.  I wanted to do something broader than that, I wanted to educate young teenagers, I wanted to talk to them about subject matter that could change their lives.  I wanted to stop the teen pregnancy rate, I wanted to stop the HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] rate, I wanted to educate young minds, and that's what I wanted to do.  So I wanted to counterbalance what we were showing on the air, but also being able to bring smart programming to the network where all teens from across the country and their parents could sit down and watch and discuss subject matter that was uncomfortable in their households.
Speaker 1: And, so how long 'Teen Summit' was on the--
Speaker 2: Eleven years.
Speaker 1: Eleven years, okay.  And, now was there--did you get ad support beyond--behind that program?
Speaker 2: Not only did I get ad support, I also got grant money.  Pfizer Foundation gave me $1.6 million, yup.
Speaker 1: What would you say were the different sort of building blocks of that program 'Teen Summit'?  'Cause at one point you start taking it on the road.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And the reason why I took it on the road is I--it was asked by many jurisdictions and states.  They loved the program so much that they really wanted to be able to bring it in their location.  Houston [Texas] was a big deal because they had a huge teen pregnancy epidemic there.  And I have to tell you, that when I walked in an auditorium at University of Texas, those kids gave me a standing ovation and half of 'em were crying.  And I said, "Why?"  They said, "You're the only one that'll listen to us."  I mean, I did not realize the impact of that show and how it had such a huge impact on their lives.  And to this day I have young adults that come to me and they said, "You saved my life."
Story_ID: 412021
Speaker 1: What other things were you doing also during this time, you know, in your position as executive--?
Speaker 2: A lot of community outreach.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was doing everything I could to make BET [Black Entertainment Television] look good out there in that community both locally and nationally.
Speaker 1: Can you give some examples of what you did?
Speaker 2: Rebuilding of playgrounds, if there was a, a shooting over somewhere, I would go in there, sometimes with camera crew and talk to people about what they're going through.  I mean, you know, we did something with the news, but it was more than anything, I was sort of the goodwill ambassador for the network.  I did not participate in day-to-day operations, we had enough staff doing that.
Speaker 1: And who were the critical people on staff at that time?  There was you, who was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was myself, [HistoryMaker] Curtis Symonds, Jeff Lee [HistoryMaker Jefferi Lee], Janis Thomas, then there was some people in Chicago [Illinois].  See, 'cause we had other offices, you know, all our advertising team.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Louis Carr.
Speaker 2: Louis Carr, who's still around, James Ebron, those are the ones that really stuck out in my mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, what other things do you think were critical during this time period, you know, with, with BET?  Because it, it had phenomenal growth.
Speaker 2: Yeah, phenomenal growth as far as brand awareness, the BET Awards became huge.  I remember starting those in that building.
Speaker 1: Can we talk about that a little bit, the BET Awards and how that happened?
Speaker 2: It was a case where we saw MTV [Music Television; MTV] doing their MTV Awards and we thought it would be great to have our own awards program.  And so that started out really during the Black Caucus [Congressional Black Caucus], we would always hold it during Black Caucus weekend because it was local and it gave people a venue to come and see a Michael Jackson or to see a Babyface.  And we would hold a--we call it the black building, which was the big building that we fixed up.  We also used that building where we were able to lease it out, where movies were coming in we were able to--the building was great 'cause we built another building on the inside that floated so it was very--the soundproofing was fabulous.  So we were able to actually hold concerts and, and I also shot 'Teen Summit' in there, 'cause I was able to do it with a much larger audience of five hundred kids.  So we were able to do a lot in that building.  So the BET Awards became really pretty well-known, it became the coveted ticket in town during Black Caucus.  And then from there it grew into more of a national.
Story_ID: 412022
Speaker 1: So you have, at this point in time, you have Paige [Paige Johnson Payne] and you have Brett [Brett Johnson]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And where are they going to school and--
Speaker 2: Sidwell [Sidwell Friends School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Oh, they're, oh, so they're going where you, you--
Speaker 2: Where I used to teach, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And are you happy with the education that they're getting at Sidwell at that point?
Speaker 2: With Paige it was different, I was very--she was very unhappy in that school because she at the time had discovered horses.  And Sidwell, being the school that it is, it's either their way or no way.  And because she would leave school to do competitions, and I thought it'd be something that they would be proud of, they weren't.  So she had a very, very hard time at Sidwell.  I think it really in a way, you know, and I can kick myself--it really turned her off.  I should've pulled her out of there at a much earlier time, so she ended up being homeschooled all the way through high school so that she can continue to compete and become professional.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me how you did the homeschooling?
Speaker 2: Find a really good homeschool.  There're a lot of--there's a lot of homeschooling going on now, so it was very easy.  I was able to go to the homeschooling association, they identified a teacher that was in the area.  We actually had classrooms set right up here on the farm and it was not only her but there were two other riders, and they've become very close.  In fact, they still ride together.
Story_ID: 412023
Speaker 1: When did the farm come into existence then?
Speaker 2: The farm was in existence since 1996, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me about how you identified the farm?
Speaker 2: I--because Paige [Paige Johnson Payne] was--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Paige was competing a lot professionally, well not professionally then but she was competing a lot in Virginia, Kentucky, those were the main areas.  And I had been driving her out every single day.  I would leave BET [Black Entertainment Television] at two in the afternoon, run home, change my clothes, get her from school at three o'clock, pull her out of school at three o'clock and drive all the way down here every single day so that she could practice and get trained.  And it was wearing on me.  And so after a while--and she was collecting so many ponies at the time, and I was paying this guy so much money in stall rent I said, I can buy my own place with what I'm doing.  And we weren't making a lot of money at the time, we were making--we were having a--made a good living but I just said, you know, I've gotta do something.  So I started looking for property out here.  So I said at least what I can do is get her a trainer and he can base himself at the farm, and I could keep the ponies there.  And then we would come out, we would work something out.  And at that time, I just knew I couldn't keep her at Sidwell [Sidwell Friends School, Washington, D.C.] under the conditions that she was--that we were working under.  And I just happened to be driving by and I noticed the mountains in the background and I said there's the farm.  So I told the real estate agent, "I want that place."  She says, "It's not for sale."  I said, "Anything's for sale, anything's for sale."  And sure enough the guy within twenty-four hours, he says, "Yeah, I'll sell it to you.  Here's my price."
Speaker 1: That is--now, tell me how did she first get introduced to horses?
Speaker 2: You know, for the life of me I don't know where it came from.  She used to watch the 'My Little Pony' cartoons on TV and that's the only thing I can see.  She's always from the age of three says, "I wanna ride, I wanna ride mom."  I said, "Ride what?"  "A horsey.  I wanna horsey."  And she just kept nailing me with this, and she just kept saying, "When is my pony coming?"  I said, "Paige, you know this isn't gonna happen."  So at six years old I was taking her to a park, it's called Candy Cane City [Candy Cane City Playground, Chevy Chase, Maryland], and you had to go through an equestrian facility.  And as I went through the equestrian facility I thought she was gonna open the door and jump out of the car.  She says, "Mommy, there's my pony, there's my pony."  And so we parked over there and I went in there and I said, "Can I sign my daughter up for lessons?"  And they just ignored me, and then I got mad.  And I said, "You gone ride a pony because they're gone pay attention to me."  And, you know, that's when the mama thing comes out and, you know, that they're not paying attention to this black woman.  And I sat there and they still--I sat there for two hours with her.  They would not approach me, the woman couldn't have been ruder.  The next day, without her, I came back in there because at this point it was gone be me and Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] going in there.  So I went in there and I said, "Look, I sat here for two hours yesterday to get my daughter signed up for lessons and I know, I have done my homework, you all do give lessons here.  And why won't you pay attention to me?"  So at that point, the head trainer comes in, and his name was Art Kooms [ph.], and he said, "You all answer that question.  Why didn't you pay attention to her?"  And he says, "I personally will sign you up." So he says, "Where is your daughter?"  I said, "I will go get her."  And I brought my daughter back there and Paige started her lessons.  And three weeks later he came to me, he says, "Your daughter is talented."  And he says, "I'm not just saying that," he says, "I don't know who you are but your daughter is talented."  And from that moment on, he then became our personal trainer.  And two years later Paige got so good we now had the present trainer that's here now and Paige has won every competition in the book.  I mean she's good.
Speaker 1: That's amazing.
Story_ID: 411790
Speaker 1: So she [Johnson's daughter, Paige Johnson Payne] started riding in 1991.
Speaker 2: Okay, and you bought Salamander [Salamander Farm, Virginia] in what year?
Speaker 1: In 1996.
Speaker 2: In 1996, okay.  And that's--you, you have been carting her back and forth up 'til that point in time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, that's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So, she--so her getting into horses opened up a new world to you in many ways (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Completely, completely.
Speaker 2: Can you talk about that a little bit?
Speaker 1: It was something that I really saw that she had a passion for, and as a good mother it was important that I support her.  So what I did--then I had to wear three hats, I was teaching music.  Actually, I stopped teaching at that point, I was, I was at BET [Black Entertainment Television].  I would do that until two [o'clock] and then I would go and get her and cart her back and forth to lessons.  On weekends I literally drove her ponies myself in a horse trailer, so I went through the whole thing of buying a horse trailer, I bought a, a SUV.  I learned to hook the horse trailer up and she and I would go off and I would have the baby [Johnson's son, Brett Johnson] in the backseat with Miss Mary [ph.] and we would just keep going.  And I took her to every horse show, we lived in Hojos [Howard Johnson's], and Hiltons and everything else, Quality Inns all over Virginia and Kentucky so that she could compete and build points and I learned the horse show business.
Speaker 2: So can you tell me what you learned about the horse show business?
Speaker 1: I learned that it was very competitive, I learned that there are a lot of very wealthy people and some poor people that are in the business.  The parents are very competitive, it's like any parent if you have a--if you're a, a tennis parent or a soccer parent, and it's learning how to deal with that.  It's also learning how to find the most honest employer or trainers that you can.  It's an unregulated business.  I can see people either make or break even the most talented of riders that, if they don't know the business, they literally can be financially taken to the cleaners.  You have to make sure that you have someone that's working for you that is honest.  That's the bottom line.  I think more than anything in this business is honesty.  It's also a business where the student has to really work very, very hard at the skills.  It's a dangerous business for your child.  I've seen my daughter fall off a horse many times, it scared me.  We were at Culpeper [Virginia] during the Christopher Reeve accident, which was very terrifying.  It, it's just a business that, as a parent, you have to be there every step of the way.  Now I don't do it as much now but she's grown, but you have to be there.  It's a, it's a business of privilege, it's an environment of privilege.  There are children there that, if their parents aren't around can really pick up some bad habits, and I'm talking about sex and drugs because you're in an atmosphere of privilege.  And there's a lot of money there.  And they don't feel as though rules apply to 'em, and you've got to be able to navigate the waters of all that and be able to instill good moral judgment.

Speaker 1: So you are taking her [Johnson's daughter, Paige Johnson Payne]--you're homeschooling her at this point, you're going to shows on the weekend, you, you find Salamander [Salamander Farm, Virginia] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, uh-huh, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, talk about what you've done on this property here?
Speaker 2: I've literally rebuilt this farm.  From halfway through the property to the back, there were polo ponies that were kept here.  And they literally roamed freely all over the back areas, so the grass was gone, there was a lot of muddy areas, there was no topiary to speak of, the topography was different.  I've literally brought in over a hundred eighty trees here, I've built hills, I've built the stables.  The indoor arena, I built all the mechanical rooms, I built the--or the mechanical building, I've also built another building where we hold meetings.  I have redone houses that were on the property so the staff can live here.  I've bought additional property adjacent to this property so that I could buy more homes, so that I could keep staff here.  I have renovated 106-year old farm house completely; it was a four-year project which actually appeared in Architectural Digest.  I have built garages for the cars, I have a staff of twenty-five people that literally work this property day-in and day-out.
Speaker 1: How many acres on the property?
Speaker 2: We're about 178 acres.
Story_ID: 411792
Speaker 1: Okay, and your daughter Paige [Paige Johnson Payne] has continued to compete and practice (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, she still does.  And she's still traveling, she does a lot more of it on her own now.  She's been to Europe, she won the gold medal in Valkenburg, Holland [Valkenburg, the Netherlands] over a field of a hundred twenty riders.  She has won some major Grand Prix events; she's finished second with the--some Olympic riders in some Grand Prix events.  She's really accomplished a lot.  She's the youngest on record for the State of Virginia to win the equitation finals at eleven years old, so she's really--I'm, I'm very proud of her.  She's really accomplished a lot, yes.
Speaker 1: And then Brett [Brett Johnson], does he have a similar interest in horses?
Speaker 2: No he does not.  He is not interested in horses.  He is an all-American boy, he is captain of his varsity team at Episcopal High School [Alexandria, Virginia] and he's also captain of the baseball team.  He is my--the son that I think every mother would love.  He also does a lot of work with me, with CARE [Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere; CARE, Atlanta, Georgia].  He is gonna head up my foundation someday, he has got a heart that is huge.  He is really interested in humanitarian efforts but he also wants to be a businessman.
Speaker 1: So he's following in your, your footsteps sort of (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now--
Story_ID: 411793
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, you get divorced [from Robert L. Johnson] in 2002, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that is almost sort of the beginning of Sheila Johnson [HistoryMaker Sheila C. Johnson] to the outside world in many ways.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, can we talk about, you know, what you have engaged in or what you--'cause it was as if you were sort of coming on the stage, you know.  You had been sort of--you had been active with BET [Black Entertainment Television], you had been active in your music, but you have since that time and I'm talking 2002 to 2007 this five-year period, you've done some very significant things.  Can we talk about, you know, you know, there's the International Horse Race Show [Washington International Horse Show] that you became head of, right in 2000--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, what did you say?
Speaker 1: I had read that you took over as head of the Washington International Horse (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Horse Show, oh yeah.  I became president of Washington International Horse Show.  That, that horse show has never been able to turn a profit.  And when I took it over, and it's right here at the Verizon Center in Washington [D.C.], I was able to take that over and form a business plan.  They had to start running it as a business.  And we have been able to really turn that horse show around, you know, it makes about a half a million [dollars] every year.  But it was important to be able to educate the, the board of trustees and to teach them, you know, how to, you know, really run the show here, literally, and make it work and make it an exciting show.  And to really get the city involved and, you know, the Chamber of Commerce [District of Columbia Chamber of Commerce], all those people.
Story_ID: 411794
Speaker 1: And then there was the same year I think in 2002 that you took Salamander [Salamander Farm, Virginia] and turned it into an inn and spa [Salamander Resort and Spa, Middleburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: No.  No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: No--what was, you were hoping--
Speaker 2: I was--
Speaker 1: --hoping?
Speaker 2: I bought all of Pamela Harriman's property.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: All right, this is a little complicated.  I bought this property it's a little under four hundred acres, and when I bought it, it was with the idea of building an inn and spa there.  And being naive and going into another direction's something that I did not know what I was doing, I made a lot of mistakes in the beginning.  Hired the wrong people to help me do this, they were learning on my dollar.  But putting the whole concept together and also not understand the political environment of this area, you know.  We're into this is--we've crossed the Mason-Dixon Line here.  I was being a little bit naive about all this, and when I went to do a fake groundbreaking, all hell broke loose.  And that's when I woke up and saw bumper stickers being handed out saying, don't BET [Black Entertainment Television] Middleburg [Virginia], we do not want you here and all this.  I'm getting death threats, my kids' [Paige Johnson Payne and Brett Johnson] lives were being threatened, it was a mess.  And it was a scary mess.  It was like, where was Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] when I needed him, you know.  We had gone back in time to the real early days, you know, '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s].  I'm like I could not believe this still existed, so this was a whole new fight on my hands and a whole new journey that I was stepping into.  And, again, because of who I am, I wasn't gonna back down I was gonna make this work.  And so, you know, I'm still fighting it.  We go to a vote very soon and then it will be over with, but for four and a half years I have been working on this resort and spa.  It's now a resort and spa not an inn and spa.  I have now got a hundred sixty rooms, I went from forty rooms now a one hundred sixty-eight and if they kept making me mad I'd be at two hundred rooms (laughter).  But anyway, we're at a hundred sixty-eight rooms and it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen, but in the meantime while I was doing that I started a market here.  And that's a whole another story, this was a gun shop with a Confederate flag in the window.  And every time I would come into Middleburg I said, this is the most offensive thing I could ever--could imagine.  And I kept saying, I'm gone buy that building, I'm gonna buy that building, I'm gone tear that flag down.  And I bought the building, tore the flag out of it, razed the building and decided I was going to--well, before I razed it I decided I was gonna build a food market [Market Salamander, Middleburg, Virginia], put a food market in there, gourmet food market.  I said there is no place around here to get really good take-home food.  So--'cause I didn't feel like cooking all the time.  Put prep kitchens in, lowered it, and built really the most beautiful markets.  We won a, a design award for the county.  But (unclear) is called a chef's working kitchen and I have chefs that cook all day long. We have everything from rotisserie chickens that have been marinated in buttermilk and herbs, we have the best crab cakes, we have ribs, we have mac and cheese.  You name it.  And we change the menu, we cater, we do cooking classes, we have all the top chefs from Rochelle Rochard [ph.].  They come in on their bikes, they eat there.  I do the James Beard award [James Beard Foundation Awards] dinners there where I just tent over the whole parking lot.  I like to think big.
Story_ID: 411795
Speaker 1: And in the meantime, another market [Market Salamander] has opened in Palm Beach [Florida] that's four times the size of this one [Market Salamander, Middleburg, Virginia] so I've done that.  And then in the meantime, I've also bought a resort that was owned by a grocery magnet, Sainsbury, out of England, out of London who owned all the grocery markets there, the chain.  I bought the Woodlands Resort [Woodlands Resort and Inn, Summerville, South Carolina] and since then we have made it a five-star, multiple five star, five-diamond resort.  We're Relais Chateaux property [Relais and Chateaux] and we just named by Travel + Leisure as number two in the country on service and also as one of the best destination resorts in the country.  And just a few weeks ago I bought the largest golf resort in the country, Innisbrook [Palm Harbor, Florida], it has four golf courses.  I'm the first African American woman to own a PGA Tour [Professional Golfers' Association], so we have the PGA Tour that comes there.  It's four golf courses, we have sixty-five thousand square feet of ballroom space, there're eleven hundred condominiums there, three golf houses, we got pools, we do everything.  And I am going to completely--I'm putting millions of dollars into an upgrade on it, we've already started on the island course 'cause I wanna attract another PGA and an LPA [sic. Ladies Professional Golf Association], PGA tournament there.  I am building a spa there, I'm upgrading all the club houses and I'm wanna turn all the restaurants around.  So I'm very excited about that project.  And then soon we will break ground for Salamander Resort and Spa [Middleburg, Virginia], which has been--which will be the jewel and my crowning achievement.
Speaker 2: So this is what you had started before was--and, and you're gonna make happen (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: But in the meantime you've smoothed feathers with a lot of your, your neighbors.  They, they, they value you now.
Speaker 1: They really do and I think in the end when they see that resort go up there and the economic boom, that it's gonna help the town.  You know, there's been criticism--you know, I been criticized saying that I'm gonna change the complexion of the town, every town goes through change but this is gonna be so positive.  We have retailers that are literally hanging on by the end of their teeth, you know, hanging on by the edge of their teeth but, you know, like am I gonna be able to make payroll, am I gonna stay open.  This will bring tourists into the town, this is gonna bring people that can walk through the town and spend money.  You know, and we're gonna encourage them to spend money at these retail shops.  I've really gotta help all the retailers here, I really see myself that, that is my job to really help this town.  It's a beautiful town and it's a great town.
Story_ID: 411796
Speaker 1: How did the Mystics [Washington Mystics] come into being?  You know, because I hear you're really big on the hospitality industry in many ways and horsing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I am. Yeah, and this is one of those sidebar surprises.  I was asked by Abe Pollin to show up in his office one day and I thought he was gonna want me to help him do some charity work.  And he says, "I wanna offer you the Washington Mystics."  And I said, "Offer to you?"  And he says, "No, I want you to buy the Washington Mystics."  And I said, "Why me?"  And he says, "Why not you?"  And he talked to me about it, he says, "I'm getting old," he says, "I can't do all this anymore."  He says, "I'm gonna keep the Wizards [Washington Wizards]," he says, "but I just can't do all of this."  So I said, "Well, let me think about it."  And he says, "Well, you think about it."  And the more--it couldn't have been fifteen minutes before I left his office and I realized the magnitude of what he was offering me.  I was being let into an old boys' network, where women first of all, don't ever get into.  Secondly, an African American woman, forget it.  So I got in the car and I called my attorney, he says, "You don't wanna buy a team they lose money and everything."  And I'm like, "But Sandy [ph.], if you were offered a team, would you buy?"  He says, "Well, I don't know maybe, maybe not."  I said, "Do you realize what this means?  I'm a woman, I'm an African American woman.  I'm getting let into something that nobody would ever get into."  He says, "Well, let's talk."  And so I went straight over to his office and I talked to him about it.  And then I realized there is this company called Lincoln Holdings [Monumental Sports and Entertainment, Washington, D.C.], and that's the holding company for the Washington Capitals and 45 percent of the Wizards.  And I said, "Do you think that they would let me into that holding company?"  He says, "Well, let's give it a shot."  He calls Ted Leonsis and Ted talks about it.  And I said, "Look, I'll not only buy the Mystics but I wanna buy into the company just like the rest of them."  And Ted thinks about it, and I get let into this company.  Well, there's ten other men and we're talking like a Richard Fairbanks [Richard D. Fairbank], we're talking Ted Leonsis, we're talking Dick Patrick, we're talking about some very financially well-off, powerful men.  And they let me in.  So that not only gives me access to the Mystics, I'm also with the Capitals and 45 percent owner of the Wizards.  So that puts me in a unique category and the first woman to be ownership into three sports teams.  Now the way this works is when Abe Pollin passes, we get first right of refusal to everything which means we will take over the Wizards, we already have control of two of the other two teams.  We take the building, we take the Patriots Center [Patriot Center; EagleBank Arena, Fairfax, Virginia], Ticketmaster.  That, that puts this group of Lincoln Holdings as one of the wealthiest sports franchises in the country and I'll be part of it.
Speaker 1: That's pretty amazing and so how had you come to meet Mr. Pollin?
Speaker 2: Pollin?  I've known Abe Pollin for years.  Yeah, in fact, he's a neighbor.
Story_ID: 411797
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so what are your--what do you want to accomplish with, with this--with the sports--with the Mystics [Washington Mystics] first and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, especially with the Mystics, the WNBA [Women's National Basketball Association] is in its eleventh infancy.  And I say infancy because people have to realize that the NBA [National Basketball Association] at the time in its infancy was struggling even more so than the WNBA.  I wanna be able to put together a business plan and a strategic model of how a women's team should be run.  You have to understand WNBA teams have really been the dirty rag at the end of the NBA season.  And we just use the leftovers staff from the NBA and they kind of flopped through and try and make it all work. I wanna get rid of that.  I have set up myself as being a pioneer as one of the first separately owned WNBA teams.  The Sparks [Los Angeles Sparks] now are separately owned, Houston's [Houston Comets] separately owned.  If I can crack the code, instead of losing a million and five to two million [dollars] a season, if I can start breaking even and making a little bit in the end, I will be happy.  And the two things that really guarantee that is I gotta get more fans in the seat, we just can't keep running at 7,200 and 8,000 in there.  And I need corporate sponsorship.  The parallels of when we started, BET [Black Entertainment Television] and WNBA are all the same.  It's getting people to believe in the product, there are still a group out there that doesn't believe that women should play sports, that they shouldn't, that they shouldn't be valued as athletes, they should not have the same abilities to get out there to get corporate sponsorship, that they don't--that they just shouldn't exist.  I gotta beat down that wall.  They are valuable, they are worth watching, we are a great brand.  In fact, our viewership on TV is much higher than any of the NBA or hockey.  ESPN has just signed an eight-year deal with the WNBA that start putting our games on television, because when we are put on there, people do watch us.  We have some of the greatest athletes in the world, we have 100 percent graduation rate, our women speak more than one language.  And even the one language they do speak, they speak it well.  They stay out of trouble, they are role models both on and off the court, they are mothers, they are teachers, they are athletes.  They have to do everything they can and they believe in the WNBA, and those girls go out, they promote the WNBA, they do a lot of things.  We don't have to pay them to do that, we don't give them extra money to do that, they do it because they believe in it.  That is their job, they do not make money here in the U.S., their average salary is a little over thirty thousand [dollars].  They go to Europe to make their money.  They can make anywhere from one hundred thousand to one million [dollars] in Europe.  But they can't make money here because we don't have the corporate sponsorship and we're not getting the people in the seats.
Speaker 1: Now is the NBA--do you get any static from them as an organization?  Are they supportive or not supportive?
Speaker 2: They're very supportive.  I have to tell you David Stern is awesome.  He's the one that started the WNBA, he believes in the product but I really think the only way the WNBA is really gonna be able to really survive is we gotta go into separate ownership.  Because we need to get people that believe in the WNBA brand, take it on as an owner to build the brand.
Story_ID: 411798
Speaker 1: Mrs. Johnson [HistoryMaker Sheila C. Johnson], where are you at this point in your life?  And I say this because, you know, once again you have the horsing, hospitality's strong, you just, you know, LP- golf course now which is significant in and of itself, and, and you also are recently married [to William T. Newman], you know, remarried.
Speaker 2: Where am I in my life, I'm happy.  I am happier than I have ever been.  I feel safe for the first time in my life with a man who really loves me and who really believes in me, and lets me be me.  He's proud of my accomplishments, he lets me spread my wings.  I really feel like a butterfly and I feel as though I can look down on everything and look at everything and swoop around, and make things worth.  I can see the big picture, I'm visionary, I'm more creative than I've ever been and I'm--I have to tell you in a nutshell, I'm happy.
Speaker 1: What, what things haven't you done that you would like to do, can you tell me those things?  'Cause you have the ability unlike a lot of people to pick and choose among a lot of things.
Speaker 2: I think the one thing that I haven't been able to do is, and I am doing it now, is empowering women.  I think that I've learned so much in my life and I've been through so many ups and downs.  I've been betrayed by both men and women.  I would like to be able to nurture and bring along and mentor young women and make them strong so that they don't go through some of the pitfalls that I've been going--that I had, had to go through.  I want them to start challenging themselves more, I want them to start respecting themselves more, I want them to be able to live a life with a good moral compass.  I want them to understand that they can believe in themselves and climb the career map, ladder without having to sleep with someone to get up there or to do whatever they need to do to, you know, to really diminish themselves.  I want them--I--they need to feel their power, they need to be able to negotiate their own lives, they need to not have to be dependent on a man.  They should be able to really have total and full control of who they are, to feel good about themselves and to know who they are.  And I've been given the opportunity of being a global ambassador for CARE [Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere; CARE, Atlanta, Georgia], and I'm starting a movement.  It's called I Am Powerful [Sheila's I Am Powerful Challenge].  It's an I am powerful campaign.  Those three words are so extraordinary, and when I say this to young women I say I want you to repeat after me, I am powerful.  And they go, I am power.  I say, no, you enunciate and say those three words.  And the more they say 'em, they start to feel it.  We do a trick where I have these little mirrors and I give to 'em.  I said, look in that mirror, who do you see?  And they go, I see me, I see this, you know, and it's just kind of vague.  I say, now who do you really see?  And they have to think about it.  And I tell 'em I want you to think about it and write down who do they really see in that mirror.  And it's interesting 'cause I've done it with grown people and I have seen more grown women fall apart when they look in that--I say, what do you see?  They first joke around, oh, I see a wrinkle.  I say, no, what do you really see.  Some of 'em start crying, some of 'em drop the mirror and just run off.  It's a very powerful exercise.  I did it in Guatemala and I've done it in Africa.  I said, you all--when we first--when I first started working with these women I said, what do you see?  They said, I see nothing.  At the end, we come back, and what do you see?  They say I see a mother, I see a spouse, I see a woman who can change a community.  I mean, they really talk about it.  And this is where we need to get the head of every woman in the world, because without women, this world's gonna fall apart.  If women don't take on their own lives and start having control over their own lives, that way they can help their children, and that way they help the community at large.  Men don't do that.  Men have control in other ways but women are the backbone of this earth.
Story_ID: 411799
Speaker 1: I have two last questions.  (Cough) Excuse me. One is what are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: That just like with these women, we have gotta get a hold of our young people.  We need to get a hold of ourselves.  We let too many people tell us what to do and negotiate our lives.  We have to start thinking on our own, we have to start thinking what's best for us.  Don't let someone on the outside, some politician come along and say, well, you all need to do this and that.  We have to learn to become entrepreneurs, we have to learn to stop being dependent on the government and on everybody else.  Because if you look around and you see what's going on, the Asian community, the Hispanic community, every other culture they're becoming entrepreneurs.  They are getting an economic base in this country in this country like you wouldn't believe.  They are thinking globally; they are business people.  We are missing the boat and we are dying, we are dying as a race.
Speaker 1: So that's your concern?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But do you think that if we get a hold of things, things will turn around?
Speaker 2: Of course they can turn around, of course.  But that's what we have to get hold of.  We gotta find out who we are, we're still living in the rearview mirror.  We gotta stop it.  I am tired, you know, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]--everybody was wonderful, hold that, keep it inside you, but start looking ahead now.
Story_ID: 411800
Speaker 1: And your legacy, what do you want it to be?
Speaker 2: That I was a woman of vision.  That I was brought into this world by God to change things to make lives better for everyone.  And that's my legacy.
Speaker 1: And what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: That I probably--who do I wanna be remembered for?  That, that's a hard one.  That I was a woman of perfection, a woman that, that could see the big picture, a woman that could change lives more than anything.
