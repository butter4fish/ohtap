Speaker 2: Adrienne Yvonne Bailey [HistoryMaker Adrienne Bailey]; A-D-R-I-E-N-N-E; Yvonne, Y-V-O-N-N-E; and Bailey, B-A-I-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Is Bailey your birthname?
Speaker 2: Bailey is my birthname, yes.  I've never been married, so that remains my name, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 24th, 1944.  I was born in Chicago, Illinois at Provident Hospital [Provident Hospital of Cook County].
Speaker 1: Okay. And, ma'am, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Currently, I'm working as an education consultant with two major clients, Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts], where I'm a coach for the executive educators program [Executive Leadership Program for Educators], and also I have a client entitled Strategic Philanthropy [Strategic Philanthropy, Ltd., Chicago, Illinois], which I advise their philanthropic clients on how to spend their money in the areas of academic education.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is November 4th, 2008.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: In Chicago.
Story_ID: 436257
Speaker 1: Before we can go into depth there are five lightweight questions we ask as kind of a warmup.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  I would say that I like, most of all, some kind of fish; salmon, or sea bass.  I think that, that's my favorite food.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is purple.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: South Africa.
Speaker 1: And, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think it's from my educational experiences: that would be: it's what you get to know, that's where it's at.
Story_ID: 436258
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Leroy Bailey] side. But we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Julia, J-U-L-I-A; Mary, M-A-R-Y; Bailey, B-A-I-L-E-Y [Julia Spalding Bailey].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: June 15th, 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now what do you know about your--oh, where was she born?
Speaker 2: Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace her side of the family?
Speaker 2: Oh, I can trace her side of the family to probably my great-great-grandmother.  I'm less familiar with my great-great-grandmother, but a little bit more knowledge about my great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where was your great-great-grandmother living?
Speaker 2: Well, you see this is an interesting question, particularly for those of us in an African American community.  You know, typically when an acquaintance first comes about, it's well where are you from?  And I say, "Well, I'm from Chicago."  And they say, "No, well, where are you really from?  Where's your mama from?"  I say, "Well, my mama's from Chicago and her mama's [Christine Yarber Spalding] from Chicago," so that's quite an unusual lineage for African Americans, because I think as, in the late 1800s that the black population made up only about 2 percent of the city's population there, so my mom and my grandmother were born in Chicago.  My grandmother's mother came over to the United States as a young immigrant from Austria and her name was Dora Pittman [Dora Pittman Yarber].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we know from family photos that my great-grandmother's parents resided, because we have pictures of them in their home country, still in Austria.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's unusual. So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now my maternal grand- my maternal father's side, he was born in Henderson, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: So, this is your grandfather [Alonzo Spalding]?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was born in Henderson, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Can, can--
Speaker 2: And beyond him, I don't know very much about his parents.  He obviously migrated to the North from Henderson, where he met my grandmother, who was a Chicago native. Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultanaeous) Okay, all right.  So, your great-grandmother, then, so did she marry an African American?
Speaker 2: Yes, my great-grandmother was Caucasian and she married a black, African American man [James Yarber] which, as you might imagine, was very unusual at that time in history.  I don't really know how that came about, per se, but yes, so they were, my grandmother was the daughter of an interracial couple and they lived for a long time on the North Side of Chicago, and I think because at that time of the fair color of their skin that people weren't really sure about whether they were African American or white, and then in the 1930s, they moved from the North Side to West Woodlawn on the South Side of Chicago at about the 1930s, at 6621 South Eberhart [Avenue], which is where my mother was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Yeah, there should be an interesting story there about how that worked in those days, you know, how people (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I've heard that Chicago was a lot more liberal in the 1860s than it became in the 1960s (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's probably true, given even some of my own encounters of integrating neighborhoods from the Woodlawn area to the farther South Side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories passed down on that side of the family about what life was like in Chicago way, way back?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, I just don't have those personally.  I'm sure my mom does, but I don't really know.  I do know that my mother has collected history in the sense of letters from, it would have been my great-grandmother's brothers and relatives from overseas so they would write long letters to their sister, who was then my great-grandmother.
Story_ID: 436259
Speaker 1: What did your grandparents do for a living?
Speaker 2: My grandmother [Christine Yarber Spalding] was a housewife, homemaker, and my grandfather was a policeman, which is also very interesting because I was just looking at some information last night and I think that it reported that in 1886, there were about four black police officers, and then later in the 1890s, there were probably about fifty, and then in the '20s [1920s], that number was increasing slightly; so, just thinking of when he was born in the late 1800s, when he was working as a policeman, he was probably one of the few African Americans that had such a job and I would just imagine at that time to get those jobs was tied into Chicago's [Chicago, Illinois] political process and so that there were, in addition to his regular work, many other responsibilities that on days like today [November 4, 2008], an election day, that he would have to do some special kinds of services.
Speaker 1: OKay.  What was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: My grandfather's name, my maternal grandfather's name, was Alonzo, A-L-O-N-Z-O; Spalding, S-P-A-L-D-I-N-G [Alonzo Spalding].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories that are passed down about his experiences as a, as a black police officer in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, just, what I remember I spent a lot of time with my grandparents.  They were very close to me as a young person.  I later lived with them for a period of my life, so there were always stories of family connections, all of his brothers and sisters had migrated from Kentucky to the City of Chicago, so I just remember that, you know, part of growing up included many family get-togethers, gatherings, brothers and sisters, both on my grandmother's side and my grandfather's side.  We took in many cousins, so that our house, my mother's [Julia Spalding Bailey] house, when she was growing up was always filled with lots of people, cousins and children from other relatives who may not have had two sets of parents.  So, my mother was very close--although she had three siblings--she was very close to all of her first cousins and even today they remain as very close relatives.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did your mother grow up on Eberhart [Avenue]?
Speaker 2: My mother grew up as a young girl, probably in elementary school because she attended McCosh Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois], where she graduated, and then Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois], and then later Wilson Junior College [Woodrow Wilson Junior College; Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] and she received Bachelor's of Philosophy from Loyola University [Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 436260
Speaker 1: Well, did your mother [Julia Spalding Bailey] have any interesting stories of growing up?  Now, she grew up during the Depression [Great Depression], you know, she was born in 1919.  She was a teenager (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.  So, most of the stories I know from her are more as an adult.  It's interesting and my memory is such that I kind of remember mostly from about late elementary school through high school on.  I don't have very visual memories of that earlier period.  But, as I said, I can remember her telling stories about the ice man coming down the alleys because, at that time there was not refrigeration as we have today and so that would be how they would refrigerate food, and I also remember her telling stories, as I said, of my grandfather [Alonzo Spalding] being able to secure a variety of goods and services from his extra job, so he would come home with gifts at Thanksgiving.  I suppose one of the funniest stories is that Halloween on our block was quite a tradition and there were two or three of the younger men that lived across the street and we would always wait to see what they would have as costumes; of course, in those days, people didn't go out and buy costumes so these were creatively made costumes and they would typically dress up as women, with just the most outrageous getups that you could imagine and so we would get just a great kick of eagerly waiting to look out of the door and see what were those people coming in this year?  There were many, there was a neighborhood there at that point that was mostly African American, so it was a very close-knit neighborhood.  I do remember that this was a particular culture of my family growing up and that you couldn't go outside on the front.  We lived on Eberhart [Avenue], which is a boulevard, and so you could not go outside in the afternoon until you had taken your bath and you dressed up and then you could go sit and play out in front, so our main play area was in the alley where we drew hopscotch and other things, you know, jumped rope.  That was our play area.  We didn't have a very huge backyard.  It was very small with a garage attached to it, so that was our playground.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wondered, since your mother was born in 1919, I was wondering if her father was a policeman then, and if he was, if you had any stories about the Chicago [Illinois] riot in 1919.
Speaker 2: I just don't remember that.  We should have taken more oral history.  I would have to ask her.  I don't, I just don't-that year, that would have been what year?
Speaker 1: Nineteen nineteen [1919].
Speaker 2: Nineteen nineteen [1919].
Speaker 1: That was the Chicago race riot on the South Side (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.  Well, you see the other thing is because at that time they were living on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois] because she was born on Christiana Avenue.  It wasn't until the '30s [1930s] or so that they moved to the South Side, but no, that would interesting to sort of know, because he would have had to be in the mix of that but, as I said, both of my grandparents, they were fair skinned and so it could have been that he was escaping that you know, relationship, just because of his color.
Story_ID: 436261
Speaker 1: Give me your father's full name and spell it for us (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  My father's full name is Leroy David Bailey [Leroy Bailey], L-E-R-O-Y; David, D-A-V-I-D; Bailey, B-A-I-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is January 18, 1917, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To Pricilla Smith, P-R-I-C-I-S-I-L-L-A; Smith, S-M-I-T-H [sic. Pricilla Smith Bailey], and Floyd Bailey, F-L-O-Y-D, B-A-I-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now how far back can you trace his side of the family?
Speaker 2: Probably just the prior generation.  Those parents came, respectively, Pricilla from Clarksville, Tennessee I understand, and Henderson, Kentucky.  It's interesting because my father's father and my mother's father [Alonzo Spalding] both came from Henderson, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But didn't know each other.  And, my father's parents, his mother was a homemaker, and he grew up at 6712 South State Street, and his dad was a janitor that worked in what were at that time, largely Jewish-owned stores in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay, hm.
Speaker 2: I can't trace very much back about that side of the family.  My grandparents became deceased, I guess, in about 1948, 1951, respectively.  They were probably in their late sixties, as opposed to my maternal grandparents.  They lived until their mid-eighties, so they were around, you know, a lot longer than my paternal grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 436262
Speaker 1: Did your father [Leroy Bailey] get a chance to pursue a higher education, too (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father attended Wilson Junior College [Woodrow Wilson Junior College; Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois].  He did not graduate.  He was in the [U.S.] Army, which is where he sent my name from, Adrienne [HistoryMaker Adrienne Bailey], in 1944, and following that, he returned to Chicago [Illinois] so my mother [Julia Spalding Bailey] had me while he was overseas, and he returned to Chicago and worked initially as a conductor for the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] streetcar; if you remember in those days, the streetcars were running on rails on top of the ground, and then later he also joined the police force [Chicago Police Department].  I have a very strong family presence in the police force with cousins and uncles and a dad and a grandfather, who were all police officers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when did he join a police force?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't really know the dates.  I mean, I can give some reasonable time that if he returned from the Army in the late '40s [1940s] that maybe he was a conductor four, five, or six years.  My sister [Barbara Bailey], my only sister, was born in 1950, and I certainly know that he was a police officer by that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Around that time.
Speaker 1: Did he patrol the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] basically, or did he have a --
Speaker 2: He patrolled the South Side initially, and then after that he was a private duty officer in plainclothes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Like a detective or something (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, did he have any stories?  Now that's, being a police officer from Chicago, it's gotta be story generating, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I don't really know very many stories about that.  My mother and father divorced in the early, the late '50s [1950s] or the early '60s [1960s], and so they were separated and after that, he continued to be on the police force, and so I don't have a lot of memories of what his experience was.  I can just remember that often on holidays that police officers used to come and, he was a great barbecue cook, and so on holidays he would ocome and there would be many officers who would stop by, but I don't know many stories about actually experiencing situations as an officer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you really didn't discuss--I know the African American police league [Afro-American Patrolmen's League] was founded in the late '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and they had a lot of complaints about how they were treated and the riots take place, I guess in the mid-'60s [1960s] and you know, late '60s [1960s].  I don't know, there was no information (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  I don't have very much information about my father's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay. And I take it you lived with your mother when they split?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I lived with my, we moved to my grandparents' [Christine Yarber Spalding and Alonzo Spalding] house on 8214 South Michigan [Avenue], and then after a while my mother moved out with my sister, but I stayed with my grandparents.
Story_ID: 436263
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' [Julia Spalding Bailey and Leroy Bailey] personalities, their talents, and their dispositions, what were they like and who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I think people would say I look like my dad.  He's a very tall person.  My mom's probably only about 5'7".  I think I take after my mom.  In some senses I see my father as having a lot of culture of a police officer; even at home, he's a very strict disciplinarian, social, in some sense, but certainly not as outgoing as my mother and he didn't come from that kind of background.  I don't remember hardly any family activities with his parents [Pricilla Smith Bailey and Floyd Bailey] growing up, but my mom came from a very large family, a very close-knit family, a very sharing family, so there were family reunions; always, I can remember family gatherings for Thanksgivings, for cookouts.  My grandmother's [Christine Yarber Spalding] house served as grand central for all the family coming together on frequent occasions, whether it was for illness or death or birthdays or holidays.  So, she or either her brothers or sisters would often gather the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well, in terms of their personalities, you were talking about your father being a strict disciplinarian (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  So my mother was a very, sort of a kind, outgoing person.  I mean, she sort of lives the theme of the song, "If I can help somebody, my living will not be in vain."  So she's always even, in her aging years, taken up some caring responsibility for a relative or a friend, a very devout Catholic.  Her faith and her religion is very important to her.  Even though she is unable to do a lot of ministry work, she is part of the Prayer Warriors ministry at St. Dorothy's [St. Dorothy Catholic Church, Chicago, Illinois], which is our church, and so she's a frequent reader of the Bible and prays often.  She loves to cook.  I love to cook.  She's a great baker.  I can cook, but I'm not a baker, so I didn't learn that naturally with her.  I regret that oftentimes when I just wonder how I could throw together that peach cobbler that she can do just in a second, or bake that cake without a recipe, she worked until she was seventy, both in the fields of social work initially, having worked at the Red Cross [American Red Cross], and then later as a truant officer for the Chicago Board of Education.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, she went to, you say she went to college.  She went to--
Speaker 2: Loyola University [Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and received a Bachelor's of Philosophy (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Loyola, okay.
Story_ID: 436264
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Early childhood memory, so, yes.  How early?  Fifth grade okay, or earlier?
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory.
Speaker 2: Oh, earliest.  Okay.  I would say that my earliest childhood memory was when my family moved from our Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois] address to Park Manor [Chicago, Illinois], and my mom [Julia Spalding Bailey] enrolled me in the fourth grade.  I was one of probably about five black students enrolled in the class, and the teacher assigned us all to sit in the front, in the same row, so I think even though it was sort of a mild encounter with racism, it was sort of my first encounter with being different, and my mother tells the story, 'cause, and I do remember this, is that I then, before I knew it, I was sent back to Holy Cross [Holy Cross School, Chicago, Illinois], which had been my original elementary school, and oh, I can remember the applause and the welcome I got because I returned from my prior teachers and friends, and my mom tells the story is that she pulled me out because she was just so irritated by the words and the treatment that the priest was using in speaking to her about, "Those people, and you people," and she just was very annoyed by that.  It's interesting because the South Side's diversity emerged quite rapidly and, in fact, it was quite fascinating because just last month I went to my fiftieth elementary school reunion at St. Dorothy's [St. Dorothy School, Chicago, Illinois] where in the hallway they had depicted all the class photos, so if you go to the early '50s [1950s], you will see hardly any African American black presence, maybe one or two, so as I said, in my fifth grade class--fourth grade class there were about four--and by the time three years rolled around and I was graduating from eighth grade, the class was almost tilted to the proportion of almost 80 percent; 75 to 80 percent African American, so my mother tells the story about what changed their attitude, and even though there might have been some residue of that, they clearly had to address the diversity that was now, you know, coming into their schools, into their church and to their community, so I do sort of remember that and if I get another one, I remember that as a young child, my mom would have us enrolled in some sort of creative extracurricular activities.  For me, it was piano, so there were then the regular monthly recitals from Miss Mallette's [Jean Fletcher Mallette] school of piano, that I regularly participated in.
Speaker 1: Okay. Were there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As did a number of people, you know, who lived in Woodlawn and whose parents were part of the Woodlawn culture.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, where is St. Dorothy's?
Speaker 2: St. Dorothy's is at 78th [Street] and Eberhart [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay.  So, Miss Mallette's school of piano, was it popular?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, was she black? (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes.  You know, and there was nothing to do--so if you look back at the music recitals you will see, you know, a number of childhood friends and acquaintances who were all getting proper training and graces and some creative means of expressing themselves, whether it was playing the piano or, I don't she really had acting, maybe and I'm not sure that she really had singing.  I think it was primarily piano.  So, there was a discipline that went along with that, you know, having to practice, be prepared, and I think this must have been from the age of, say, you know, eight or nine, so to play a piece by memory was, you know, quite a feat to accomplish.
Story_ID: 436265
Speaker 1: I have some, -a few friends that grew up on Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois] and I know that they, one of them drove me through once and just started crying looking at the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Looking at the devastation, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the way things had changed since he grew up.  Things have changed since he grew up.  I mean, he's a community activist.  I mean, you know, I didn't expect that but he's showing me this and showing me that, and he just started, he just broke down.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, if you look at one of the most impactful things for me is, as I told you, we lived on the boulevard [Eberhart Avenue], you could certainly not park your car there and, you know, you could only go on the front porch at certain parts during the day, so that boulevard nature of the street has changed so people now have their cars parked and, you know, the street is quite a different presentation of homes and upkeep than what we knew it as very cleanly kept, immaculate lawns and fronts and, so, yes it's different.
Speaker 1: So, you say your family moved to Park Manor [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Moved to Park Manor, 7544 South Wabash [Avenue] in the mid 1950s.  At that time, once again, we probably were one of, oh, three or four first people on the block and as typical to white flight, then you begin to see the for sale signs go up and the neighborhood then consequently changed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, this is the era when black people are moving like further south and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, and you know it's quite interesting for me, you know, in terms of sort of your cultural competence in that there was the what's now called Martin Luther King boulevard [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] was then called South Park [South Parkway], and there used to be a bus that would come from downtown to the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], and it would always have, at that time, 81st Street, end of the line, and for years growing up I thought that was the end of the city.  I had never had any reason or any experience in venturing out to that part of the community.  I didn't have friends.  I, at that point, wasn't going to school there and I didn't know anybody.  If we were passing through that area, we would basically be on the highway on our way in a car to Michigan, where you'd have to pass, you know, through the Skyway [Chicago Skyway], but I did for the longest think that the city ended at 81st Street.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  Where the world that you knew ended.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And the Woodlawn community was an exceptionally strong knit community.  Even now, there are Woodlawn reunions.  There's just been a book recently written on Woodlawn by one of the former residents, so I just think that over time even though people have moved out of the area if not out of the city.  They always welcome the chance to reconnect with Woodlawn.
Story_ID: 436266
Speaker 1: You were describing well, sev-, several historical black neigh-, well, they're now black neighborhoods like Park Manor [Chicago, Illinois], Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois], so your family was one of the early families in West Woodlawn and in--
Speaker 2: Park Manor.
Speaker 1: Park Manor.
Speaker 2: Yes, and then my [maternal] grandparents [Christine Yarber Spalding and Alonzo Spalding] right about that time were also moving to, I guess that would be Chatham [Chicago, Illinois], because they moved to 8214 South Michigan [Avenue], and I can just remember that even though that seems like a long way away, that on several evenings my grandmother, of course she must have been in her sixties or seventies, would walk over to our house.  You know, that was something to do if you think about it.  Certainly my grandmother wasn't working, I mean wasn't driving, and I don't think my mom [Julia Spalding Bailey] was driving at that time so, you know, issues of transportation, as they work today so they would, in the evenings, often walk and I know we used to always watch the clock because we had to say, "Now you have to make sure because you've gotta walk back before dark."  But it was a safe, and, so that was just about, you know, a twelve block walk but still, it was a little distance and they used to take their time and saunter around, she and my aunt, to come and visit us on Wabash [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's about five blocks, and Chicago [Illinois] blocks are about twice as long as New York [New York] blocks (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, yeah.
Story_ID: 436267
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh, my dad's [Leroy Bailey] barbecue in the backyard, the rhubarb that came out of our garden, the tomatoes that went into pies or cooking.  Sounds?  I can't remember very many sounds and I say that compared to where I live right now because the sound of the fire ambulance and sirens are a constant sound that I kind of hear in the background.  They become a little bit like white noise, but other than that I don't remember any pronounced sounds in the community.  I guess there was a sound I do remember as we lived next door to a gentleman who loved to play his music loud, and he was a favorite of Sam Cooke, so Sam Cooke would be crooning; you know, at that time the houses were very close to each other in the walkways, and so you'd often come home and that's what you hear, Sam Cooke blasting out of his record player.  I do remember that kind of sound.  Maybe the sound of the grass-cutter because at that time people would cut their own lawns and clean up and the smell of the grass, the freshly cut grass, so I guess the other sound I would remember is my parents had a friend and she would come from about 45th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue] often on Sunday mornings at about eight o'clock, and she would put her, press down that horn from the time that she would enter the block and you could hear her, you knew it was Ida Mae [ph.] coming to visit.  That was sort of, you know, her tradition and so when you heard that you knew it was only her and I don't know why she would start at the end of the block and just blow that horn until she stopped in front of our house.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 436268
Speaker 1: Tell us about school now.  You started at-was itSt. Dorothy's [St. Dorothy School, Chicago, Illinois], you said?
Speaker 2: I started at Holy Cross [Holy Cross School, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Holy Cross--
Speaker 2: --well, I started at Cosmopolitan Nursery School [Chicago, Illinois], of course, when I was about two or three years old, and I, it was interesting.  I was discussing with my mother [Julia Spalding Bailey] whether I went to kindergarten.  She was commenting she didn't think they had kindergarten at that time, but lo and behold, I said well, mom, but you have my kindergarten report card, so I did go to kindergarten at Holy Cross, and, as I said I stayed there until mid-year of the fourth grade, and then I transferred to St. Dorothy supposedly, because we had moved during the mid-point of that year, and that's when my mother, who was so turned off by the receptivity of St. Dorothy's faculty, sent me back to Holy Cross.  But then, as I said, more things had changed just in that short six-month period, so that the following year I went back to St. Dorothy's and I graduated from there in 1958.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, grade school and high school there? Or--
Speaker 2: No.  Yes. Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's just grade school. Okay.
Speaker 2: But I've had Catholic education for the majority of my life and so after that, my grandparents [Christine Yarber Spalding and Alonzo Spalding], then as you know, moved to 8214 South Michigan [Avenue] and so I then attended Mercy High School [Unity Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A number of the people in my St. Dorothy's graduating class, you know, then went on to public high schools, but I guess it was in my family tradition that I would attend a Catholic high school and the closest one at that time was Mercy which was at 8214 South Michigan, and is no longer, and so that's kind of a disappointment because I have no high school relationship any longer.  It was demolished and now replaced by a group of beautiful town homes.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  I know that area (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  So, once again, that was a school that was just becoming integrated in the 19--well, I was there from '58 [1958], '59 [1959], until '62 [1962] when I graduated, and there had been several classes which enrolled black students prior to my arrival, but very few in numbers, so perhaps there were ten or so--
Speaker 1: At Mercy (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At Mercy, yes.  I was active at Mercy in a traditional college preparatory curriculum.  I also was a member of the thespian society, which is the dramatic club, and I took four years of French in high school and was president of the French club.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's where I developed my interest in French and went on to major in French as my undergraduate degree.
Story_ID: 436269
Speaker 1: Now was Mercy [Mercy High School; Unity Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois] a mixed high school with boys, okay, all girls, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, all girls.  Yeah.  And as you know, over time it emerged to be less and less white, even though for a period of time, they did do some consolidation of schools and then attempted to bus some of the students from other parts of the city in order to maintain the school's enrollment.  It's very interesting, because I recently purchased a video of Mercy High School and just to see that school, I don't remember what its earliest date was, but it was at a point where there were no roads.  I mean, it's hard for me to even think at a time where there was no housing construction, no streets, you know, not having the current housing or apartment buildings, but looking at that historical video of Mercy, there was a time that there really was nothing there, just fields.
Speaker 1: But that was the fringe of Chicago [Illinois] then, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, just fields.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what were you like in school?  What kind of, did you like school?
Speaker 2: I liked school.  I disliked biology, as I was always trying to get out of the dissections in biology.  I was a very dedicated student, hard not to be at Mercy with all the nuns looking around you, and I had friends that were at both that school, but other Catholic schools as well as in the public schools, so, you know, once again there was a situation where there were many family ties, meaning that parents of my friends knew each other and so that there was a very close-knit collegial relationship between my eighth generation; in fact, it's very interesting, a number of my mother's [Julia Spalding Bailey] friends had children exactly my same age who lived, you know, down the block or in the neighborhood three or four blocks away and even till today, that I you know, still see.  In fact, I was in New York [New York] last weekend.  I was at an event and I keep looking and said that looks like a familiar face, and it was my neighbor, who had grown up a block down the street from me in New York. He was, he's now living in California.  So, those ties always bring back renewal or remember when, and we had boyfriend and girlfriend circles and basically hung out in people's basements.  There were a lot of those kinds of parties for various occasions as we were growing up.
Story_ID: 436270
Speaker 1: Were you a big fan of music in those days?  That was the era when rock-n-roll was emerging, so.
Speaker 2: Yes, but not overly so.  I mean, I can remember we had an old fashioned record player and I would listen to some of the songs on the radio, but not, I mean I think the other thing is that in my house we lived in a small bungalow, which was a traditional kind of housing on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  We didn't have a lot of room, so that the rooms were, to a large extent, reserved for a further purpose, meaning that I shared a bedroom with my sister [Barbara Bailey], my parents had a bedroom.  I think there were only two bedrooms, and then a you know, kitchen, a living room, and a dining room, so there wasn't a lot of places to go and listen to music or listen to your radio, which was, you were just free to do that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, like transistor radios were coming out (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yes. Right, right.  No iPods, no CD players or any of those things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well what about television and movies and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, you know what?  Instead of, growing up I've never, even until today been a big TV fan.  My television is very old and guess I'm not replacing it until it breaks, because I typically don't look at television.  I'm usually occupied in so many other things, whether it's community service or whether its studies or, you know, things I did after school that, you know, that was, TV wasn't a big issue, and I'd say the other thing is that we had one TV.  I don't really remember when we got our first TV, but we had one TV and that was often dominated by my father [Leroy Bailey], so whatever he was watching, he was watching, so I didn't spend a lot of time in front of the television.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you're referring to your stepfather at this point, I mean basically? Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, my dad who is living in the house before my parents divorced.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they split, okay, all right, okay so they were together in '58 [1958], when you were still in grade school. Okay, I got you.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  And my mother [Julia Spalding Bailey] never remarried.  My father did remarry later.  He stayed in our house on Wabash [Avenue] and then my mother moved to other, another location.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 436271
Speaker 1: So did, did you--because a lot of what you do now requires a lot of writing.  Did you, did you write for very much--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, not only as part of my you know, school assignments, and I made very good grades at Mercy [Mercy High School; Unity Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois], but, I mean so I would write to friends because at that time, the telephone wasn't an option.  I could remember--you said one of your memories--well, I don't know if you remember when you used to call and call collect, so you know that you were there.  You know, you take a trip or go somewhere and you call your parents collect just so they'd hear your voice because you didn't wanna pay the charges for the phone call.  But, so there was, I had cousins that lived in Ohio and Columbus [Ohio] and so there were letters I would write to them, but once again, I didn't have a very extended family living.  They were the only families not living in Chicago [Illinois], so there wasn't a great letter writing going on there, but to them, and I spent a number of my summers in Columbus with my aunt and uncle.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you all drive or did you take the--
Speaker 2: Drive?  Largely.  Sometimes take the train.  I can remember, one of my memories was going to Columbus on the train by myself, you know, for the first time.  I must have been maybe in high school, because then later when I graduated from Mercy, the first college I attended was Central State University [Central State College; Central State University] in Wilberforce, Ohio, and so that was very near where my aunt and uncle lived, and I think that was part of the interest that it was someplace that I could have access and could have visitors or go and visit.  So, yes, I remember vividly my summers in Columbus because sort of just hanging out as a teenager, meeting other teenagers, and just having, you know, just a very good time.
Story_ID: 436272
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers or mentors, you know, when you were in your school days?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm trying to place this particular nun in perspective, because she'd flow throughout my life but from different locations. But--so I went to two Catholic run schools.  St. Dorothy's [St. Dorothy School, Chicago, Illinois] was run by the BVMS, Blessed Virgin Mary Sisters [Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary], and Mercy [Mercy High School; Unity Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois] was run by the Sisters of Mercy, so there was a particular nun and sister who were just constantly present in my life.  I think she was the music teacher at St. Dorothy's and we were very close, such that she would even have me playing at Mass.  I can remember this, at the midnight Masses at church, and then oftentimes on Christmas morning there would be two Masses, and so I remember that she would always make sure that in between Masses that we got over to the convent and we had a nice breakfast, and she remained in my life all the way through Mundelein College [Mundelein College, Chicago, Illinois].  I can remember even, well, in fact she was the one that had suggested at that point that I come to Mundelein.  She may have been retired by that time or assigned up there, because it was an order that was similar to hers, and she was very close to me.  We wrote and exchanged letters no matter where I was in the world, Sister Mary Leonette [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you spell her last name?
Speaker 2: L-E-O-N-E-T-T-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was always the person that I remember, not just because I had this encounter related to a school situation but, you know, very much part of my life as I grew and matured, a very close confidante and I will always, always remember her.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: She would ask us sometimes to do some sort of ridiculous things like play for a wedding when (laughter) my friend and I once had a responsibility to take over an assignment for a wedding, which included both playing and singing, in which I declined to sing, but I played, but Sister was behind that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, you did quite a bit of piano playing, I guess.
Speaker 2: Well, I think so, but you know some of this, in referencing it back, I don't play the piano right now, but at that time I must have had at least some skills.  I was reading music clearly and she would guide us, but that I was able to get through, you know, a number of psalms and hymns appropriate, at least, for church and for these Miss Mallette [Jean Fletcher Mallette] piano recitals.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I just stopped taking the lessons and as anything that requires a certain skill, practice and discipline, you just kind of lose the talent, unfortunately.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you stop after high school, or did you play in college (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, and I--no, no. And I don't really remember that I actually played in high school.  It was sort of like probably right, 'cause I had moved away from Miss Mallette's, Sister Mary Leonette would have been my elementary school music teacher, and then I did some things and went back to church, but I don't recall that in high school I pursued my music talents.
Story_ID: 436273
Speaker 1: You said you were engaged in some high school activities [at Mercy High School; Unity Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois]. But, did you run for class officer or anything like that, or did you--
Speaker 2: I don't remember running for, the only recollection I have on that is the president, I was president of the French club, which I guess was quite something in those days, and I was a member of the thespian society and I participated in several plays.  I can't remember what characters I played but, French was my particular focus.  I loved it, I did very well, did very good with you know, grades and that became my career, you know, further study of French and spending time in Paris [France] and advanced study in French.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, were you inspired by your name?  Your father [Leroy Bailey] having gone--
Speaker 2: I don't know, you know, I think at that kind of high school age, often people think of something more intriguing and of course, they always say in the African American community, it's a lot about role models, you know, who you see and who you have an association with, which was largely an educator and a social work, police officer domination, so I had done so well in French that, that gave me, I think that stimulated my interest to want to do college study in French, and so the other thing is I had now largely gone to schools with large white enrollments as opposed to African American.  I think my parents were concerned that now as I moved on through my undergraduate work that I needed to have more of an environment in a culture that I would like to grow up and live in.  So, we chose Central State [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  I think at that time, I did get some scholarship money, but that was a very interesting encounter, because what I learned there is what one often learns about what you get to know, which is my earlier phrase, and fortunately, have mercy, I got to know a lot about French, but compared to where the other students entered at Central State, I just, the academic curriculum just wasn't up to my skill level, and the sophistication of the offerings and language was not as much as I would have liked, so after my first year and having a wonderful time, I began to pledge a sorority.  I decided to return to Chicago [Illinois] and this is where I was mentioning to you earlier one of my favorite teachers, Sister Mary Leonette [ph.] was at Mundelein [Mundelein College, Chicago, Illinois], and she invited me up for an interview saying, "Consider Mundelein," because at that time I would be going now from a co-ed and gone to an all-girls high school.  I then went to a co-ed college, and I was now moving into another all-white situation in a, you know, a woman's college.  But I must say that Mundelein was, I really have a special appreciation and passion for single-sex institutions in terms of what they do for developing women, and so I commuted.  While they did have a small dorm up in Mundelein, which at that time was right next to Loyola [Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], 6300 North Sheridan Road, right along the bend, a couple of skyscrapers up there, but it was a college with a student enrollment of about maybe a thousand students, but it was a very warm and nurturing environment and from there I met, I guess my second favorite teacher, Sister Mary Elsa [ph.], who was the French teacher, and it would be the practice of junior students to spend a good six, seven months abroad.  And so, I went with, I think I was the only African American student who was part of that group, who travelled to France and throughout France during that period.
Story_ID: 436274
Speaker 1: So you were, you said you were a junior [at Mundelein College, Chicago, Illinois] when you travelled?
Speaker 2: I was, yes, and a French major, so that was like a semester abroad, studying at the University of Paris [Paris, France], the Sorbonne, in a French immersion class, but also being able to travel to the South of France and even to some other European cities.  It's interesting because as part of collecting materials for this interview, my mother [Julia Spalding Bailey] has just saved an unbelievable archive of everything I've ever done in my life, all newspaper clippings, all my letters from Paris [France]; I mean, it was just unbelievable.
Speaker 1: Did you meet any of the American ex-patriots in France in those days?  I know Baldwin [James Baldwin] was there, one time Langston Hughes was there in France.
Speaker 2: I didn't meet those people but I met a number of people who were stationed there because, at that time, I had a cousin who had been assigned to France and he had married a French woman and, so, they befriended me, of course, during my time there and introduced me to other people.  I went to army picnic where I interestingly enough met Arnetta [Arnetta Newton (ph.)] and Duke Newton [ph.], who were Chicagoans, and this is, again, where you're from kind of connection: "Oh, you're from Chicago [Illinois]," so they immediately embrace me and I became part of their family, being allowed to stay, you know, in their home and really partake of some of their experience of American aspects while still enjoying the French culture.
Speaker 1: There was a group of French-speaking Africans and Caribbean people who founded this magazine called Presence Africaine, I guess in the '50s [1950s], yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, I never heard of that, okay.  So this would have been 1965 that I was spending this time in Paris and, as I said, it's often easy that whenever you go over to a country and not only the discovery that you're American, but then when you're a black American, there just is this, you know, very quick coming together.  If anybody's in the area who is black and an American, there's, someone finds a way for an introduction.  So, that was very good for me and often, I can remember, I was reading one of my letters to my mom saying that I had found a friend.  I was going to cook the fried chicken over there.  (Laughter) Now, that was quite a distinction between what the kind of French cuisine would be then and what American interests would be in that regard.
Speaker 1: Now I just wondered, you've heard of the Negritude movement, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wondered if you encountered any of those people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Because the movement started at the Sorbonne, you know.  It would have been, most of the principals would not be there when you were there.  They would have already moved on.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, then you have to remember, too, there was really no encouragement to advance out to any black culture because I was the only one in the group.  The other thing I remember though, was very fascinating, this was just amazing was Sister Elsa [Sister Mary Elsa (ph.)] had travelled to France on many occasions and obviously her purpose was to fully engage in the French culture to understand and to be able to teach it, and there was a question because there were about four or five nuns going, about whether, and I assume they have permission from their orders, they would take off their habits so that they wouldn't be bounded by the religious characterization of who they were so that wouldn't serve as a barrier for them understanding and learning.  I don't think, as I recall, anybody really did at that time.  There were a group of young nuns with us who travelled in our group.
Story_ID: 436275
Speaker 1: Yes, I took ill, I had hepatitis and, in fact, I was looking up something recently.  I don't know if you're in the old Jet, there used to be a guy that wrote from Paris [France], the Paris page.  There used to be a Paris page because there were a number of, as you said, African American, black African Americans living in Paris and he cites that, "[HistoryMaker] Adrienne Bailey from Chicago [Illinois] is recuperating well in the American Hospital in Paris [American Hospital of Paris, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France]."  That was a little bit of a scare but, once again, I guess Sister Elsa [Sister Mary Elsa (ph.)] became closer to me because she was my closest contact at the time.  She had to sort of see me through that.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  But you recovered then?
Speaker 1: Oh yes.  I recovered and got out just in time before the group left for Marseille [France] and Aix-en-Provence [France], which I desperately wanted to do, and then spend some time, you know, in the South of France to just expand my reach there.   And I want to think, though I can't remember this because I travelled to Italy subsequently, but I see in one of my letters I'm asking my mom [Julia Spalding Bailey] for money to go and visit Italy and enquire about whether we have the money because, as you can imagine at that time, you know, money wasn't just you know, falling off of the trees to make it possible to do all these things, so it was an extreme sacrifice for my parents, my mom basically, to allow me to have that experience.
Speaker 2: Now, did, I'm gonna ask anyway, probably (unclear) did you encounter Josephine Baker or, no, she was such a big presence in those days.
Speaker 1: Yes, and as I recall, I think there was a restaurant in Montmartre [Paris, France] or somewhere in that area, which was Josephine Baker's.  I do remember encountering that name and going to that restaurant.  That was one of the familiar names I remember at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's probably about all in terms of black presence that I would have recalled.
Speaker 2: I think she was living in a castle or something, maybe by that time.  I'm not sure if it happened later in the '60s [1960s], or what, but she had a castle at one point.
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, I didn't get a chance to visit that--
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: But she had a restaurant and I remember going to that and getting some good soul food-
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --right in the middle of Paris.
Story_ID: 436276
Speaker 1: This is 1965.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And now, had you, well what happened when you came back? You came back and graduated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I came back and I graduated from Mundelein [Mundelein College, Chicago, Illinois] with a degree in French and then immediately that summer I went, I was awarded an NDEA [National Defense Education Act of 1958] institute fellowship, which was a special summer institute for various topics of which this was French, so I travelled to the University of Maine in Orono [Maine], and spent time preparing for what I thought was going to be a teaching job that I would have in French when I return.  I had signed up for a high school teaching French job, my first plunge into actually a professional role, not clearly understanding about how class determinations at that time get decided.  I mean, later subsequently, I know that very well, meaning that what students sign up for in the spring may or may not be what the enrollment is in the fall, so unfortunately, as much as I was prepared now with after this emergent experience and travelling, came back, and speaking French all summer, I had lost my high school French assignment.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: So, I became very discouraged about now that I had spent my undergraduate years with this as a major, about what really would be future employment opportunities that were productive and substantive.  So, I was back.  I knew nothing about any other career options except to teach, and so when you're in that point, as long as you have the credentials to be a teacher, you were simply asked, "What other option would you consider?"  So, I thought it and I said, "Well one thing is to let me take an option close to home."  There were no more French openings.  So, I then worked as a first year teacher.  I would be what they called today a teacher teaching on the field, because I was teaching social studies to a group of seventh graders; however, I did, I had a very supportive principal, and he knew of my French interests and he allowed me to teach French to third graders.  It's there that I ran into the twins of Alonzo Crim [Alonzo A. Crim] who, at that time, lived very nearby the school and Lonnie Crim then was a senior administrator in the central office of the Board of Education [Atlanta Board of Education], and later went on to the superintendent of schools.  He is deceased now in Atlanta [Georgia].  So, I taught his twins in the third grade, and, you know, for the year made it through the best I could preparing my lessons every night for a subject which I had not really been trained in but wanted to do as best job as I could.
Story_ID: 436277
Speaker 1: Let me just backtrack a little bit and ask you about your experiences in France.  This is the first time you were out of the United States, I take it, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And what were you, I mean, how, what did you think about French culture, French life, and how was it different from American life and did you feel any different in France than you did here in the United States?
Speaker 2: Well, obviously it was very exciting to be just in, you know, in Europe as a young, black woman and, of course it was more exciting because I did know the language, so that part of the excitement was about being able to practice it.  We didn't live in very fancy hotels; in fact, we were almost living in a youth hostel type of accommodations when we first went there, but I suppose the other thing that made it very accommodating for me, as I said, I was one of the, I think, few people on the trip that had these other connections, so one thing I guess I know about myself is that whenever I'm going someplace, I'm gonna make a connection, find an inroad, so that it wasn't totally so foreign.  So, I think we were able to combine a combination of what was truly French culture but then, you know, having a little American experience mixed into that of Americans who also knew, you know, the black side of the French culture.  But, the food was just wonderful.  The people, I found by and large, welcoming although many times it's said by Americans born in France that the French aren't very open and very welcoming.  I can't say that I experienced you know, that at all but, you know, once again perhaps it was my culture and color that gave me a leg up to the viewpoint of the traditional ugly Americans that often go over as tourists.  But, in terms of like the university attendance [at the University of Paris, Paris, France], I didn't experience anything but good things; shopping, we would often go on the streets and buy our little haricot verts or green beans or veggies or fruit, have a glass of wine. I no, I wouldn't say that there was anything that was different.  It was exciting.  You learned how to get around using public transportation and so, once again, for my first venture out of the country it was just unbelievable.
Story_ID: 436278
Speaker 1: Back to 1966, fast forward.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You're teaching social studies in the Chicago Public Schools (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.  And the third grade French, and so I do that for one year and so when I'm leaving, then, in '67 [1967] the question is what am I now going to do with my life because the French career route didn't seem to be panning out.  There weren't French teaching places.  I really didn't feel that I was prepared to do any other kind of career in French, so I got a job that summer at the South Shore YMCA [Chicago, Illinois] just as a youth supervisor, and I enjoyed the youth involved in that program very much and while I was there, I mean, this was just quite a coincidence, there became an opening at what was then the Circle Maxwell YMCA [Chicago, Illinois].  Now, the thing about this YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] is very unusual, because it wasn't the YMCA as we traditionally know it with a swimming pool and, you know, lots of sports activities.  It was just a little old building sitting on the corner, but the reason that this was attractive is because now this was a time that the University of Illinois was making its way into the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] with its Chicago campus [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], and so they were very concerned about community relations with people they were displacing, with residents who remained there, and what it would be like to actually have to live in that environment, so they were trying to develop a model, somewhat after the Urbana YMCA [University of Illinois YMCA, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], which is a much more intellectual model involving faculty and student exchanges with his grassroots community base, but for me I suppose that was an eye-opener for me because it really introduced me to the Civil Rights Movement.  I can remember I met the African American guy, Jake Jennings [ph.], who was then the, I think, assistant or associate chancellor or vice chancellor for external affairs, and once again, I think often African Americans befriend each other, so he said to me one day, I'm taking you to lunch, so he took me to a lunch not in a fancy kind of restaurant, but it was a gas station that had been reconverted.  Didn't even have any tables.  You sort of stand up and just eat your sandwich, you know, on this kind of bar and he gave me 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' [Malcolm X and Alex Haley] and he said, "Here, read this.  This will be your introduction to what you need to know to be able to work in this community."  And so, after that he really did embrace me in terms of, kind of, almost tutoring me on what it meant to work in a grass root community, which I had no experience.  It expanded my horizons with organizations such as the West Side organization, who are often involved in sometimes peaceful, sometimes violent confrontations with the powers that be at the university of other institutions, which were essentially taking over their community.
Story_ID: 436279
Speaker 1: I can remember, I'm just thinking about well what would have been the event that I travelled to Washington [D.C.], some major civil rights event that I travelled to Washington to in the six--it must have been 1967.  Would that have been--
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967] I don't know.
Speaker 1: Would that have been a major march or demonstration?
Speaker 2: Hm, '67 [1967], you've got me now, 'cause '63 [1963] was the March on Washington, '68 [1968] was the Poor People's Campaign, '67 [1967], I don't know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So let me see, '67 [1967], maybe it was '67 [1967], '68 [1968].  What was it, the Poor People's Campaign?
Speaker 2: Poor People's Campaign was '68 [1968], yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, yes, that probably was it, that probably was it because I had gone to that job in '67 [1967], September at the YMCA [Circle Maxwell YMCA, Chicago, Illinois], and so it would have been probably that spring, because by the following year I was gone.  That's when I went off to Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] to do my master's [degree], so it was during that period where, you know, I was just befriended by the community, a lot of activity in terms of church, govern- kind of community-based organizations, very small, grass roots initiative among the residents that still remain there.
Speaker 2: Tell me, who were some of the, Nancy Jefferson, I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nancy Jefferson, yes.
Speaker 2: On the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] in those days.
Speaker 1: Nancy Jefferson was someone that I befriended and, you know, worked with in that role over there.  There was a guy named Chester [ph.], the West Side organization, and even today there's a guy named Robert Strom [Robert C. Strom], who I think, he was a minister who was very active in the Civil Rights Movement there, a white minister, and even today has been still active over there in, you know, a number of the West Side initiatives.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bethel New Life [Chicago, Illinois], (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: But--you were at Chicago, near University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], Maxwell Street, which is what people used to call Jew town, Maxwell Street Market [Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right. Yes, exactly, right. But it really was as I think back over my life and growing up, which was in a very kind of more contained secluded environment of, you know, Park Manor [Chicago, Illinois]; not much exposure to more grass roots community organizations, so that was my exposure on the West Side that really just introduced me and opened the door to a whole different set of, you know, people, considerations and I think I then pledged myself that I wanted to do something more on the issue of community and education and social policy, and so that's when I went on to pursue advanced degrees, I was looking for more of a place in educational sociology.  That's what I received my master's degree in at Wayne State.

Speaker 1: How was the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] different, I mean that part of the West Side different from where you grew up?  I mean they're both black community (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yes I think the income levels, first of all, were very different.  There were projects, the ABLA [ABLA Homes, Chicago, Illinois] projects on the West Side, and even more projects.  I don't know exactly the name of them, but the university [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], when it moved there, had displaced some of those and that was the remaining population that they were now trying to figure out how did they partner, how did they live, you know, and common use of that land and that community, making it jointly their own.  So, there were many overtures of allowing community people to come and use facilities at the university, outreach of the leadership, who at the time was James Holderman.  He was the chancellor of that institution [sic.] and, as I said, his assistant chancellor for external affairs was Jake Jennings [ph.], and Jake was like a grassroots person.  He was not, you know, although he was an educated person, he was not trying to make a relationship like the Urbana [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] model of seminars and high intellectual things, but something that was really of service that would give people opportunities to get something out of the relationship, jobs, you know, opportunities to feel that the campus wasn't so isolated from them being on one side and the university being on the other.  As you may recall, there aren't really any walls or gates around that university.  That's always been the sort of presence in the city, and that was an attempt to not try to block them, you know, in terms of being a we-they situation in terms of we the university, and they the community.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: But, the people there were marginalized largely with respect to what they had, the kind of schools they were attending, the cultural poverty, and all that, that that breeds when you have just an enormous of presence of projects and low income environment.  But these were all people who, I think, were looking for opportunities to better themselves and that they were fortunate to have a person like this assistant vice chancellor who really wanted to work in an outreach way with them, but I would just say for myself personally, it was just really an encounter with a part of the world and experience that was different than what I had grown up in, but was very much a part of what Chicago [Illinois] represented.  And for a people that I wanted to be able to help or serve or, you know, educate in some way.
Story_ID: 436281
Speaker 1: Were you there for the riot of '68 [1968], after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed?  I think that was one of the worst riots in U.S. history.  The West Side [Chicago, Illinois], a lot of it was burnt up.
Speaker 2: Right, now I may have been gone.  Do you remember what--
Speaker 1: It was April 4th, you (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of 1968?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the day he was killed, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, I must have been there, as I said, because then I left the following September for, I left the following summer, so yes, I think I must have been around, around then.
Speaker 1: But you don't have any memories of that?
Speaker 2: I don't have any personal memories of that myself, except that I think what I remembered is the community was really enraged and enflamed and a lot of the university's [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] efforts were to calm the community, you know, to keep them in a calm relationship and experience in terms of their behavior and the fact that they were living in this, you know, sort of same geographic space together, and so the university would spend its resources, both human and others, to try to make sure that there was presence there, that, once again, that there was a collaborative sense of together we've gotta overcome these difficulties.
Story_ID: 436282
Speaker 1: So you left in September to go to Wayne State [Wayne State University] in Detroit [Michigan] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I really left in the summer because very interesting enough but the first semester, which I think is probably why I also chose education sociology, was to cruise around some of the parts of the world, Greece and Rome and, I'm trying to think, Greece and Rome I remember, and the Greek islands, and I remember that I had met a guy at the University of Maine [Orono, Maine].  He was in the [U.S.] Air Force, and so by the time I had gone to Greece, he was there and so I was able to visit with him, befriended some of his friends who were both Greek and later came to the United States so, I mean, this is once again my weaving the connections, you know, around the globe and having these social networks that are really almost international in their reach.  So, that, but it was the study course and as I can remember, as I think back, there were four of us that stayed in the small cabin and there were, I don't know how this happened, four black women who, most of the others were from Detroit and we roomed together and, you know, took this educational tour, which was integrated with some educational seminars by the ed-social professor, but I think now recollection that that must have been a pretty great life as a professor to have one of your main semesters, you know, travelling abroad, but I then, as I said lived in downtown Detroit and then I finished my master's [degree] in 1969, by the following spring of that year.  It was just a one-year program.
Story_ID: 436283
Speaker 1: Did you work in Detroit [Michigan] too when you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I substituted occasionally in the Detroit Public Schools [Detroit Public Schools Community District] as a way to support myself.
Speaker 1: How'd you find Detroit after coming from Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I didn't think it was that much different; once again, I knew people there so I wasn't really all alone and having to make my way around.  I had met a guy in Paris [France] who was from Detroit and I then reconnected with his family, who kind of took me in as a family member, but for my purpose of being there, I mean, I was there for a school, a few friends, and because it was so close I would come home a lot so it wasn't as if I was in some far distant place where I sort of stuck there, but, and I was just there for a year.  I originally moved in with a roommate who had a cat, because that was the only thing I could find at the time and cats just give me the heebie-jeebies, so I was just so grateful because a little teeny, teeny apartment came up within a month or so that I quickly moved into and it wasn't about space but just having the privacy whether or not I could go to class, walk to class, and then, you know, do my studies.
Story_ID: 436284
Speaker 1: In 1969, now you're moving pretty fast now.  You come back to Chicago [Illinois], right, and you're the--
Speaker 2: I come back to Chicago, so now I'm just very interested in this black cultural you know, arena, so I go up to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], which is very interesting, and I meet [HistoryMaker] Iva Carruthers.  I'm looking for a class in Swahili, because I wanted to just take some African language, so at that time, Iva, whom I had not met before but had heard of his being really a great person, interested in African American culture and the culture of Africa, she just was very welcoming to me and at the time then she said, "Do you know about this Ph.D. program, TTT [ph.]?" Which was a government-funded program to provide Ph.D.'s, particularly to students of color, full financial ride but tied to a community base, and its tie was to the West Side of Chicago.  So, I was very interested in that and got an offer for a scholarship really, right after the first interview.  But, the more I thought about it I was concerned that I didn't want to go right on to school, you know, another three years straight after my master's [degree].  And, at the time there was a governor's office of human resources, which was an establishment of the Ogilvie [Richard B. Ogilvie] administration that had a number of employment opportunities, so I determined that I thought I could better pursue an advanced degree with a little bit more work experience under my belt so I turned down the scholarship at that time, didn't take the Swahili, and then got on the staff of the governor's office of human resources, where I worked for two years, only subsequently then to go back to find out that that Northwestern program was still available and I reapplied and then I moved to Evanston [Illinois] in graduate housing and then pursued my degree in this area of ed administration [education administration], but with this urban context on the West Side, so in some ways it was taking me back home to people like Nancy; in fact, Nancy Jefferson was on the advisory council and I reconnected with a number of people that I had learned from my earlier days of working at the YMCA [Circle Maxwell YMCA, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 436285
Speaker 1: What was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: My dissertation was about community college and its role in the higher education sector.  I wrote on that, and it was very interesting because I wanted to pursue an area of ed admin [education administration] with a higher education policy focus at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], but they didn't have such, so I was able to create an independent program of my own, so to speak, where I participated in several internships like at the Board of Higher Education [Illinois Board of Higher Education], but my specialty was educational administration.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. You got your Ph.D. in 1973.  Now, were there any special professors or mentors there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes.  I remember a very special professor who is now deceased and, in fact, as I think about our campus experience at that time, Northwestern hadn't had as much development and the school of ed was an old framed rickety building, kind of three floors, and B.J. Chandler was the dean there, but Professor William Hazard [William R. Hazard] was my chief advisor and Dr. Hazard was, I guess in view of all things, he got it.  He understood the intellectual considerations you know, that are appropriate to higher education, but he also understood grass roots community, so he was very able to connect sort of the West--because he was the director of the program, obviously, so that it would make sense that he had to bridge these gaps between the work in the community as well as, you know, with the university.  So he was my advisor, so obviously he was instructor for a number of my courses and he shepherded me most importantly through my dissertation which is, if anybody's been through the dissertation, it's got to be just the most emotionally traumatic experience regardless of the outcome, that one ever goes through.  Even if they say it's gonna be all right, don't worry, there's nothing like having to present your proposal you know, and defend it with a group of university professors sitting around just waiting to poke holes in it, so, as I said he was very supportive you know, in getting me through that in terms of my topic and directing me and helping me to do the proper research and then finally you know, in organizing my dissertation review.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was very young then, when in 1973, when I got a doctorate. And--
Speaker 1: Now your dissertation, did it involve any, was Malcolm X College [Chicago, Illinois] involved at all in that, since that's the West Side community college, I just wondered if--
Speaker 2: Not, not per se, I mean it was among the institutions I looked at because I looked at the whole Illinois community college system and its role in providing access and opportunity.  So, that was, you know, including the City Colleges of Chicago, but not restricted to any particular campus.
Story_ID: 436286
Speaker 1: Go ahead, your (laughter)--your next step is--
Speaker 2: So French is behind me, education, you know, is now more present with this context of, you know, education and community context, and what it means to provide equal opportunity and equal educational access to more and more students.  So, when I got my Ph.D., of course at that time I thought there was nothing better that I would want to do than be a professor, but at some more innovative institution, so at that time, they were just beginning to develop what they call upper level institutions, and at that time Governor State [Governors State University, University Park, Illinois] far on the South Side was an emerging institution, so I was working my network trying to get a place as a professor, because that's sort of like all I knew and it's interesting how careers have developed over time because there really weren't very many options presented to me, now that I had a Ph.D.  So, as it turned out there was a gentleman who ran an urban institution out of Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], John McKnight [John L. McKnight], and he referred me to the Chicago Community Trust [Chicago, Illinois], of which I knew nothing about in terms of background, you know, the role of philanthropy and its presence in our society or considering opportunities in philanthropy as a career option, so I can remember there had been a gentleman, Bruce Newman [Bruce L. Newman], who had just been recruited from The Cleveland Foundation [Cleveland, Ohio], Chicago Community Trust, which I eventually became employed at, is among the top three oldest and largest community foundation, and Cleveland Foundation was similarly, if not the oldest and the largest, also in the top three.  So Mr. Newman was being recruited to put a new face on the Chicago Community Trust and to define a sort of new mission around what a community foundation should really be, and obviously he was interested in attracting, you know, a diverse staff and so I came to his attention by Professor Knight, to which I went to the interview a little bit curious to say, "Well, why?  I have a Ph.D.  Why would I be going for a job that has a title of program associate?"  But little did I know that there was this, just, marvelous career opportunity in philanthropy and so I was hired as the first African American in private philanthropy in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was in 1990--'73 [1973], and as I said, it just opened up an unbelievable door of career learning for me and so, basically, at the community trust, I then began to develop my own model of a career based on my philanthropic interests and my education, obviously, background.  So, at the trust I handled the foundation's portfolio on education from pre-collegiate to higher education, which means that I managed all the you know, grant initiatives in terms of program development, the grant evaluations in terms of proposals coming in, the awards and internship programs and I became, at that time, a member of the pre-collegiate group of foundation executives, which was a national organization of other foundations that were funding in the area of pre, pre-collegiate education.
Story_ID: 436287
Speaker 1: The other thing that came to me during that time is that we were moving away from, in Illinois from an elected constitutional officer and state superintendent.  There had been a constitutional convention, none of like what's on the ballet today, to get away from that elected position and there was, at that time, Governor Dan Walker was creating the first appointed Illinois State Board of Education.  It's interesting enough because it was the private sector and the legislation assigned the state board responsibilities over both public and private education.  So, unbeknownst to me there was a group that had promoted my name, primarily because of my experience in private education, as a representative they wanted to advance to the government for appointment.  Now part of the appointment criteria is you cannot be, you see, an employed educator, so you can't work for a school system, so I had a unique background in that I was trained as an educator, had a strong educational set of experiences, but I was, I fit the criteria so I was appointed then as one of, let's see, two or three African Americans to the first appointed Illinois Board of Education in about 1973 or 1974.  I served on that board for eight years, leaving it in 1980 as its vice president.  During that time my career also jettisoned.  I would say that was probably the time that I was just on the move, thanks to many great advocates and supporters of me, but my career just kind of took off.  I then became the president of the National Association of State Boards of Education, and became well acquainted, therefore, with state board members and chief state school officers in all fifty states and at the same time I was invited by the governor to be a commissioner, a member of the Education Commission of the States, which involves the fifty states but in each state it involves the governor, the heads of the two legislative parties, usually someone from the state board and someone from the state education leader side.
Speaker 2: Let us go back and get some dates.  I don't want to mess up here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you were appointed to the Illinois State Board of Education?
Speaker 1: Right, and probably in about 1973 or 1974.
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974], okay.  And then you became president of the national state board of education.
Speaker 1: Probably about '78 [1978] or '79 [1979], because I'm just back from the fiftieth year anniversary of that organization in Washington [D.C.] two weeks ago.
Story_ID: 436288
Speaker 1: --Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I just want to make sure we have dates (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then in that same era, so it had to be between '73 [1973] and '74 [1974], and 1980, I also served as a commissioner of the Education Commission of the States, and as I indicated, through that networking and representation of Illinois, I encountered governors and legislators from all the fifty states, so I was on the executive committee of organization of the priority committee, so that I was becoming a pretty well-known name, you know, around the country at that time.  I travelled with a state delegation to visit China before normalization, and I have to look at exactly what date that was, but once again, it happened to be between '74 [1974] and '80 [1980], because I was the president-elect or president of the state boards group [National Association of State Boards of Education], and then two years later, I led the delegation to Japan of state leaders and other educators and that was, you spoke earlier about what, how, what did that mean to encounter, you know, different cultures, so, as you can imagine, a very tall African American woman leading a delegation to Japan was just, you know, met with many kinds of stares and queries to say what's this all about, why aren't the men speaking first, but it was our turn because of the former situation the chief administrators had led the group and so it was now our turn for the state boards to, you know, serve in the leader role and that would fall to me, then, as the president.  So, I have managed, I guess I would say, that over the years to get around the world basically through the sponsorship of many organizations, including travel to Italy, to Japan, to China, to South Africa, to Brazil.
Story_ID: 436289
Speaker 1: All right, so we're in 1979, I guess.  You're president of the national state boards of ed [National Association of State Boards of Education] now.  You're taking junkets to different countries we were talking about that at the end, going to Japan, going to Italy, and the purpose of these junkets is to--
Speaker 2: Well, in the case of China and Japan, it was to look at their educational institutions or schools, their administrative setups and see what there is to compared to America.  It is very interesting because I asked that question of Italy exchange about well, what do we have to do?  And it was the most unusual experience.  It was just go, absorb the culture and enjoy yourself.  Paid for.  So, in that experience, I went with a group of other educators, you know, around the country.  This was based on the University of Alaska as a cultural exchange program, and we went initially to Lake Cuomo as a group, and after that you had a home family that you were assigned to, and then the way that it would work is that the following year, the Italian family would come to visit you, but it was mostly more enjoying the culture, you know, the opportunities to get to know other people, do different things.  You kind of were on your own after some initial joint activities that we did as a group.
Speaker 1: Hm.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I travelled subsequently to South Africa on several initial foundation trips.  It was interesting because on one occasion we reflect now on the president of Zimbabwe, President Mugabe [Robert Mugabe].  The day before Nelson Mandela was released, we were in South Africa and we were, no, the announcement, and he was quietly talking up to us about how South Africa needs a new social order, and now to see this kind of come full circle in terms of the situation, the contention that is in Zimbabwe, is just very interesting when you think at one time, and I think at one time we were sitting very peacefully, you know, having a discussion with us.
Speaker 1: So these advisors would all be down in South Africa, now he's in turmoil in Zimbabwe(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right, exactly.
Story_ID: 436290
Speaker 1: From time to time, you know, you see articles in the news and, you know, people will, journals will have articles about U.S. education being behind these other countries.  Japan, at one time, has always been compared to the U.S. as being far ahead, you know, in math and science and that sort of thing.  The Russians are beating us.  The Chinese are beating us.  Everybody's beating us.  What was your experience when you check out--
Speaker 2: I mean, well once you look at their systems you, you know, and the real measurement is there is an international assessment that a number of countries have, you know, agreed to participate in so when they're speaking about that, they're speaking about it with evidence of what our kids are scoring versus their kids, but, I mean what you have to understand is there are very different cultural norms in more ways in terms of who they're educating to a large extent and, you know, at the time I was in China, of course, it was before normalization, but I would say that a large, largely s situation that, you know, exists right now in China in terms of being very controlled and disciplined in their education and what's expected exists even today in terms of what's required and, I mean, I think that often one of the main criticisms is that our American curriculum is a mile high and an inch deep.  We've just got too much in the curriculum, trying to take care of everything, everybody, you know, and the schools itself trying to be not only educational institutions but social services and providers as well, that it restricts our ability to focus on the critical content core, namely the teacher, the student and the content in ways that produce achievement results.  So both topics, how much time people spend on it, the fact that many of those cultures go to school more than, longer hours and additional days, I mean I think all brings a focus on education which is not as strong here in America in our social context.
Speaker 1: Hm, okay.  So, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So we are behind, I mean basically, but we are behind in some of those course studies that they test, but then you have to ask yourself but what about the other aspects of education, about culture, environment, extracurricular, I mean things that we feel is important for a well-rounded education, positive youth culture and, you know, things like that.  If, when you talk about an educated person, you know, who has the best product?  A very fine-tuned academically talented Japanese or Chinese student, you know, or somebody in the United States who may care more about community or well-being, and has developed mental experiences like more of a whole person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what do you think about it?  What do you think?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that a large extent in the U.S., well and I would just say that in those other locations, there clearly are examples of national standards, which is a big issue in the United States.  There's a lot of conversation now about having national standards, so the rigor is a huge issue in the United States, so rigor in one particular state is not the same rigor in another state, so, since they're going through the motion of getting an education by largely seat time, but the quality is not the same because nobody is willing to agree on the quality, and that's not true in most of those other countries.  There's a central ministry of education, or in the cases of China and Japan, who controls their curriculum and the standards, so there's little variation if you'll go around to various classrooms.
Story_ID: 436291
Speaker 1: Now, were you with, were you with the first group?  There's a group I know, an earlier group of teachers that went over in 1977.  Were you a part of that group?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't go in '77 [1977] to China (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) To China.
Speaker 2: No, I have to look up the date.  I didn't go with the teachers.  I went with a group of state, a state delegation, chief state school officers, so that must have been, I'm trying to think of the dates because it was before normalization.
Speaker 1: Yes, because I know of some Chicago [Illinois] teachers that went over when they had the Gang of Four crisis in China (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right.  No, I wasn't part of that group.
Speaker 1: I know they were from Chicago. Okay. I just thought--
Speaker 2: This was supported by an international fund out of the U.S. Department of Education that was promoting cultural exchange and paying for the opportunity for these cultural awareness trips.
Story_ID: 436292
Speaker 1: So you were with the, you were president of the national and state boards of ed [National Association of State Boards of Education], now there were in the, I know in the black community there's a lot of discussion about curriculum content and in those days there was no black history taught in the classroom.  Were you part of any of those discussions of about how to--
Speaker 2: Not at the state board group, but where I encountered that probably more specifically, was at that time Jake Carruthers [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.], and Conrad [HistoryMaker Conrad Walter Worrill], around African centered curriculum in the Chicago Public Schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, at that time I think I could remember I developed one of the first multicultural education policies for the school and there was a series of deliberations about whether that required African-centered you know, curriculum and as I recall the way we left it was is that if schools wanted to take that as a choice.  I mean, they were required to teach multiculturalism by and large but if schools decided that they wanted to pursue African-centered curriculum in particular, you know, that was an option that they could pursue.  And at that time, I think Dr. Carruthers was involved in a funded project where that was part of their task, to develop a set of materials for schools.
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah I think that's something that--something that somebody with the Annenberg Foundation [Los Angeles, California] or something?
Speaker 2: Could have been.
Story_ID: 436293
Speaker 1: You were with, you were the president of the national state boards of ed [National Association of State Boards of Education] through 1979?
Speaker 2: Probably about that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so what did you do next?  I have here you were the vice president of the academic affairs of the College Board of New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I, I mean a lot of times my career seems so meandering because I just didn't do a straight trajectory; you know, from here through a pipeline up.  I've kind of have gone through some different doorways, but you know, I often say to people that while it may appear that I bounced around, that there's a fundamental called a theory behind my work and it has to do with making equity a academic matter, so, I mean so, so the context for that is so up until about 1954, we worried about kids getting into school.  That was the Little Rick Nine, the desegregation, but what we didn't attend to was what happens once they get inside these doors, and so when I left the Chicago Community Trust [Chicago, Illinois], I was leaving the Community Trust, state board at that time in the '80s [1980s], to then become the first African American vice president at the headquarters office of the College Board.
Speaker 1: Now what does the College Board really mean?
Speaker 2: The College Board, a lot of people get confused with Educational Testing Service [ETS], which is based in Princeton [New Jersey]; so, the College Board is the parent company for the college tests that are sort of publicly well known, the Scholastic Aptitude Tests, the SAT, the achievement tests in various subjects, the Advanced Placement [AP] program, and a variety of other tests.  Now, what you have to think of is that Educational Testing Service or ETS is like their major contractor.  They actually do the product development, so the College Board is more the policy leader.  They contract with ETS, and historically then the College Board is the primary contractor to ETS.  I mean, they're probably some 40 or 50 percent of this business goes to the College Board and then they diversify in terms of other contractor relationships, so I was at the College Board, not at ETS in Princeton and I was, as you mentioned, the vice president of academic affairs, their first vice president of academic affairs and I also had responsibility for leading a major high school reform project for a ten-year, nine-year period called the Educational Equality Project, which had as its premise at that time that probably the reason for declining SAT scores was because the very nature of the curriculum had been watered down and there's always this tension between the need for the curriculum to match the test; also, the tests weren't supposed to be driving the curriculum, but if you didn't have that reinforced then, you know, students are not essentially learning what they should know to be able to pass the test, so, it was a, I mean you could imagine as a parent company who has got its primary product showing downturn in scores, that it would be important for them to try to understand what to do about this, and so they had launched this initiative entitled the Educational Equality Project to prove the twin goals that you could raise standards and at the same time, maintain access.

Speaker 1: The particular, I guess, role that that nine-year effort played was it moved the country.  A lot of people don't know about this but they moved the country away largely because of my leadership there from the notion of seat time to actually what students can know and be able to do, defined as competencies, not so much as just adding credits or naming courses but, you know, actually what they could demonstrate, what evidence there was of this knowledge and skill, and so we developed at that time a small green book called 'Academic Preparation for College,' ['Academic Preparation For College: What Students Need to Know and Be Able to Do'] which was then spread widely around the country and I must say that other unique opportunity at the college that I had was to put the talk into print, so during my tenure there [College Board], there were probably fifteen to twenty publications developed around issues of access and equity, and I noticed earlier that you had picked up a particular one, which is quite interesting to connect to today, because the 'Educational Opportunities For Black Americans' [ph.] was written by a young researcher at that time, Linda Darling-Hammond, and today Linda Darling-Hammond is a full professor at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and is serving as Senator Barack Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] chief education advisor.  So when I pulled that out today, it was sort of like, oh, this is a bit of deja-vu, you know, to go back to a very early connection just to see her skills and talents so, you know, represented in advising the person who could be, we hope, will be the next president of the United States, and I'm sure if that does come to pass, that I'm sure her wisdom and talents will be advising even a more significant role what we're going to see about the president's education agenda.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  That's significant for today.  I guess, I don't know if we mentioned it up front, but this is Election Day (laughter) 2008 [November 4, 2008].
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: So, we'll see later on today what happens.  And Linda Darling-Hammond is probably somebody we'll interview in the future, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, definitely.
Story_ID: 436295
Speaker 1: In '82 [1982], you were on the education and career development advisory committee of the Urban League.
Speaker 2: Right here in Chicago [Illinois].  So I was, my experience covers a lot of education, advisory boards, boards of trustees, I served as a visiting committee member of the Harvard Graduate School of Education [Cambridge, Massachusetts], the advisory committee of the Urban League, board of trustees of Marymount Manhattan College [New York, New York], just trying to think of what else (pause), the Quality Education for Minorities initiative [Quality Education for Minorities Network], which is based out of Washington, D.C., the Chapin Hall center for research related to children at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  I'm also on the multicultural education training board that addresses issues of immigrant language students and their rights to educational access.  So, I've been involved at a variety of levels at the national, the state, or the local, depending on, you know, how my career has progressed.  On the philanthropy side, in addition to what I mentioned in terms of my early employment at the Chicago Community Trust [Chicago, Illinois], I then proceeded to play a role on the policy side, so I served as a trustee of the Edward Hazen Foundation [Edward W. Hazen Foundation], based in New Haven, Connecticut, for ten years, and then I had a twenty-three year tenure as a trustee of the Southern Education Foundation [Atlanta, Georgia].  I rotated off that assignment just about two years ago, in 2006.
Story_ID: 436296
Speaker 1: From '83 [1983] to '87 [1987], it says you were on the governmental educational, educational advancement committee, right?  That's the government education advancement committee?
Speaker 2: I'm just trying to think--
Speaker 1: That's '83 [1983] to '87 [1987].  Maybe they might have it wrong.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: So, these are like boards and task forces, not employment, right?
Speaker 1: Oh okay, okay, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--
Speaker 1: That's what they are.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because then, to sort of go back where I stayed at the College Board for nine years, I left kicking and screaming to move to New York [New York].  I had never lived anywhere else in my life.  Didn't think I was planning to stay there more than a couple of years.  I never gave up my legal residence to Chicago [Illinois].  I did a lot of commuting because I was on the road a lot for the College Board, but then by the time I was leaving the College Board had hired its first African American president, Donald Stewart [Donald M. Stewart], who then subsequently came back to Chicago to be president of the Chicago Community Trust [Chicago, Illinois], but, so I was looking for an opportunity to come back home and just coincidentally there was a new superintendent being hired, Ted Kimbrough [Ted D. Kimbrough], in the 1990s, and Ted had known my work just over the years, my national work, and I think a colleague had said, "Why don't you think about [HistoryMaker] Adrienne Bailey?"  So I took a leap of faith of coming back home to be the deputy superintendent for instructional services for the Chicago Public Schools, which was a quite substantial challenge because I had not come up, you know, through the traditional pipeline of teacher, principal, district superintendent, central office administrator.  But personally, I was interested in actually seeing whether there was a possibility to apply the policy work I had done at the College Board, you know, to a real live urban situation in the area of competency based standards, aligned assessments, reorganized visions around support for teaching and learning.  So, I joined the Kimbrough administrative team in 1990, and his contract was not renewed at its termination, so I departed shortly after he left in 1994.
Story_ID: 436297
Speaker 1: What was the state of education?  I mean, I remember in 1990, the city took control, was it 1994 or '94 [1994]--'90 [1990] or '94 [1994] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it was right about '90 [sic. 1988], because then we had the Illinois school reform law [Chicago School Reform Act of 1988] where you may recall was where the legislator had given decentralized power to the schools, created the local school councils, but interesting enough, while that was a magnificent experience, there had been no strategic plan to actually address how would this be carried out, so yes, I fell victim to what was a three-year experience of discovery about what it meant to have decentralization of resources and staff and local decision-making processes, and that was really kind of a difficult, you know, tug and flow of effort because people, we were basically feeling our way in terms of this experiment, which is largely an experiment of, which remains today of differentiation and integration, you know, how do you allow some bounded autonomy or differentiation of the way schools operate but at the same time hold them constant to some criteria of high quality rigor and core.  So, that's been a very strong culture in Chicago [Illinois], even as we sit here today with the Mayor's [Richard M. Daley] (unclear) the number of charter schools in Renaissance 2010, which has a 2010 projection of 100 charters as a diverse service way of providing education in the city.
Speaker 1: Hm, okay.  So, the city took over the schools, I guess it's in '94 [1994] or '95 [1995]. And the school council concept was scrapped (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it was more in '90s [1990s], where the school council concept was crafted.  As I recall, that legislation was on the table when I entered the system, just about the '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: And so it lasted until about when? Since I'm (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, it still lasts, in terms of local school councils, although the legislation has been amended to, I think, return some central powers, but it still--
Speaker 1: Still, okay, all right. I thought for some reason it had been scrapped--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Powers have been somewhat amended in terms of control and authority, but the basic concept of local school processes were budgeting and local school council governances still very much part of the education system.
Story_ID: 436298
Speaker 1: So, in 1994 what, what did you do? What--
Speaker 2: So at that time, I was searching around for what I would do, what I wanted to do, obviously, as the top deputy for the superintendent, the next possibly would be to consider becoming a superintendent.  I guess my, sort of personal side, is a bit of timidity around that, although I look around the country and I think, oh, some of my best friends are, I could certainly do that.  So, I went after a couple of superintendencies and was not chosen, so I thought to myself, well, I had certainly built up a repertoire of knowledge and skill and practice that, you know, I would pursue a variety of consultant clients, so that's what I did for a period of about nine years, working with clients such as the Rockefeller Foundation, the Council of the Great City Schools [Washington, D.C.], whose organization is comprised of the sixty largest urban school districts.
Story_ID: 436299
Speaker 1: I worked in Mississippi for a period of two or three years around the grassroots community initiative for, you know, focusing on academic rigor and training parents about you know, about what it meant to be able to look at quality and, as I recall, that was just so touching because we actually trained people who had never spoken in front of groups.  They developed you know, preparations and note cards and they would begin their opening about, so we had decided that because we are doing this as a collaboration between this community organization [Mississippi Action for Community Education, Inc., Greenville, Mississippi] and parents and the state education department, that we didn't want the participants to listen to a group of talking heads about the state.  Education people couldn't get up first, and so it was parents getting up to greet people in which they, opening comments were, "I want to tell you why quality education is important for your children in Mississippi," and they would use examples that were in their own life about how you judge quality, what is going to a grocery store, and had come to understand, therefore, about how having discernment around quality in their own children's education was an important attribute that they needed to acquire, so we did that in probably about twenty-two communities in preparation for Mississippi's subsequent accountability law, which was going to put pretty strict constraints on testing and eventually graduation requirements.  So, I can remember that even though that was several years ago, that adage to the parents was don't worry, that's not going to catch up with you right now but guess what?  Today, Mississippi has graduation tests that you must pass, so the whole ideal to parents was that you don't start at the ninth or the tenth grade to figure out that you've got to get over this hurdle, that it really begins back in your early elementary and middle school, to know whether or not there is this high quality instruction in the teaching and the learning that your student is getting, but not only from letting the schools define it for you, but you being able to capture this in terms of your own understanding of the kind of education your child is receiving.
Story_ID: 436300
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So once again, this sort of returns me, you know, back to my community interest of bridging the gap between the, you know, the community and the education with the organization that I worked with, which was Mississippi Action for Community Education [Mississippi Action for Community Education, Inc.] out of Greenville, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Mississippi Action for Community Education.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  MACE, Mississippi Action for Community Education.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, is there any kind of a civil rights carryover in that organization in terms of the organizing the parents and that sort of thing, where people--
Speaker 1: Well it emerged out of the civil rights initiative, which had been instituted in the organization by Charles Bannerman [Charles D. Bannerman], who was an attorney trained in New York [New York], and who had gone to Mississippi to organize and advance civil rights issues through the MACE organization, so part of what we were doing is just that you have learned and developed these talents to advocate on behalf of water and sewage, you know, community issues.  Let's try to use that mile to build a grass roots community organization focused on education.  So, there was a handbook for community organizing that was developed with funds from Beverly White [Beverly Divers-White], at the Foundation for the Mid South, and then after about five years, they had received some money from the Hazen Foundation [Edward W. Hazen Foundation], which has a commitment to funding community organizing along with youth development that had provided some foundation money, but as often is the case without money, ideas die and disintegrate, so that right now I don't know that there is anything that's going on MACE's initiative.  There are other organizations like Southern Echo [Jackson, Mississippi] very active in Mississippi, addressing the issue of education and equity.
Speaker 2: You work with them?
Speaker 1: I don't.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I just know of them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it's interesting that the organizing organizations are still around Mississippi from the days of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] all the way to now.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Now, Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses], I think, is there now (simultaneous). The Algebra Project.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.  I know about the Algebra Project. You know, it's a good example of translating curriculum content into a community organizing education strategy which, you know, once again, bridges this notion of education and social policy, you know, in a very powerful way.
Story_ID: 436301
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-three [1993].  Now, you left Mississippi.  You were down there until about '93 [1993]? Is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I was commuting as a consultant there, yes.
Speaker 1: Commuting? Okay. So that sounds like really exciting work.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  It really was.  I'd get my catfish sandwiches as I came off the airplane, because it's just really great being able to inform and educate people about something that they just never had the opportunity to understand or know about, and develop, you know, talent, speaking talents and skills that they could possess and present the issue to their own people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did you do when you came back?  You worked for the U.S. Office of Education [sic. U.S. Department of Education]?  I mean, you consulted with them?  You still consult with them (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I have--I've had a consultant relationship with the U.S. Office of Education since 1993, the first passage of the Elementary and Secondary Act [Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965], which then subsequently became the No Child Left Behind Act [No Child Left Behind Act of 2001], and over the time, I've served as a reviewer of state plans that respond to the legislation around standards and assessment.
Story_ID: 436302
Speaker 1: Two thousand four [2004] to 2005, you worked with USAID [United States Agency for International Development], for--yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I was assigned to, this is a very interesting consultancy, but I got a call for a consultant response to go to Namibia and to develop a fourth grade assessment for students over there.  That was one of the conditions that was being put on their grant by the U.S. government, which had funded for a long time a series of ed [education] reform initiative over in Namibia, so I think that part of the interest was to see as a result of our efforts and our investment, were students learning and could they do anything.
Speaker 1: Hm.  Okay.  That, so how often would you go to Namibia and would you go only one time, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, initially it was a nine-month project and the idea was that there would have been two trips; one an initial discovery learning trip about setting the parameters, the blueprints for the test, to be followed by several weeks of writing back home, and then a return to Namibia in about four or five months to actually administer the pilot and then score the test.  What happened is the interim, though, is I got an offer from the Stupski Foundation [San Francisco, California] to become a full time employee, so just given the circumstance of, at the moment of sort of balancing a myriad of smaller, client-based consultants, then I decided to leave the USAID project and to become a full-time employee at the Stupski Foundation.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, this is by, what is the Stupski Foundation?
Speaker 2: Two '05 [2005], May.  I was hired on the spot in late May 2005.  I had learned about the Stupski Foundation a couple years earlier and at that time, they required a residency in California, to which I was not interested in.  And then, subsequent to that, they removed the residency requirement and I had learned about the position and I interviewed and applied, and was hired.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you worked there from 2005 to 2007. Or what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 436303
Speaker 1: Also in 2007, you were a consultant to Harvard University's Graduate School of Education [Harvard University Graduate School of Education, Cambridge, Massachusetts] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, and that's where I fast forward to where I am currently today.  I am engaged as an executive leadership coach for Harvard University, working with the Worcester Public Schools, which is right outside of Boston [Massachusetts], and that assignment has to do with a variety of customized support for the district level leadership team to improve teaching and learning, and then my second client right now is Strategic Philanthropy [Strategic Philanthropy, Ltd., Chicago, Illinois], where I am advising a client of means that is associated with Strategic Philanthropy entity, about how to use some of his philanthropic wealth to close the achievement gap.  So, I had a first round of considerations about what those possibilities might be, based on development of a paper route, what is the gap, why does it exist, what can be done about it, and in the immediate future, I'm sure that the individual will be preparing for further investigation of the areas he's identified and preparing for a round of grants that would likely be made in the fall of 2009.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So once again, that sort of bridges back my practice work in education that I'm doing for Harvard, my strategic coaching work because while I worked for the Stupski Foundation [San Francisco, California], it was not a grant making foundation.  It was an operating foundation with a district focus and so I was assigned to the districts of Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and Cleveland [Ohio], around the transformation of leadership reform to once again support teaching and learning.  So I've always found a way to keep these two areas connected; that is, the philanthropy role and the direct education service role in terms of my career, you know, options.  I mean, that, it sums where my passion is about, you know, the whole area of education and that's seen as a social justice issue, that's not confined only to one sector in terms of its influence and control, but that you know, operates in a larger environment of community and family and other social service segments, which collaborate, you know, to make a holistic set of service delivery models, you know, for, for education.
Story_ID: 436304
Speaker 1: --Do you work at all, or have you ever consulted with the Comer project?
Speaker 2: I know James Comer [HistoryMaker Dr. James Comer]; in fact, Jim Comer was on the Hazen [Edward W. Hazen Foundation] board with me for a number of years, so I haven't consulted with him directly, but I'm very familiar with his initiative, one of the best models for intervention that we've seen, and I have followed his work very closely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We mentioned the Algebra Project, Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Algebra Project, the efficacy work that is being done by Jeff Howard, you know, out of Massachusetts.  These are all great.  I mean, the late Asa Hilliard [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III], boy what a loss to have his vision and his presence in terms of his contribution.  So, there are many great people that, you know, whose work should not die because they passed on in the physical sense, but whose work should live. The thought is very interesting, because recently this summer I had a chance to meet Asa's daughter, who is just a remarkable replication of her father's work and it's really gratifying to see that, you know, through his offspring that his message will be carried in you know, in our community.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had, a month ago in Detroit [Michigan] they had about five hundred teachers, got together to honor Asa Hilliard.  His wife [HistoryMaker Pasty Jo Hilliard] from Atlanta [Georgia] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah.  He was, he was a very good friend of mine; in fact, the last time I saw Asa in New York [New York], he was speaking about a number of locations in South Africa, and I approached him to say, "Asa, what do you know about Limpopo northern province?"   He says, "I've never been."  I said, "Oh, you've never been to South Africa?"  He says, "No."  I said, "You must come," because, of course, my passion for education is combined with my personal contribution to developing positive youth culture by mentoring a number of young men and women through high school and through their college careers so that many of those young people are now working as engineers, administrators.  My latest student is now studying for a master's [degree] in human rights at the University of Oxford [Oxford, England], and my commitments to South Africa where, through my Links [The Links, Incorporated] chapter, we have a school near Durban [South Africa], and I spent a lot of time both personally as well as for my organization in arranging for cross cultural experiences with Mpofu Primary School [Limpopo, South Africa] and a variety of Chicago [Illinois] area students.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you've been able to send some Chicago area students to South Africa, or?
Speaker 2: This was just last summer, we brought two students and a principal and another organizational administrator over to visit the United States, but no, these are elementary school so they wouldn't be travelling, but what's next best to being able to actually get on the airplane?  Skype.  So next month, we're going to be initiating the pen pal project with some of the students from Beethoven School [Ludwig Van Beethoven Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], and then by the time spring rolls around, they're gonna actually be seeing each other through video conference over Skype.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's exciting (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, it merges my international interests and I'm usually in South Africa probably twice a year.
Story_ID: 436305
Speaker 1: Do you have a big plan, I mean something big planned like a book or something, or, or, or what's your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Personally?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: No, I mean right now, particularly with the economic slump I'm gonna be out here working for, you know, a number of years into the future, and so I haven't decided what my next big project would be.  Sometimes it has to do with how opportunity, you know, presents itself, but I don't have a major plan you know, that I'm working on right now, but in each of consultancies, it's about once again, this issue of intertwining equity and standards and assessment and access and opportunity, and I'll keep on working on that.
Story_ID: 436306
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for education in the black community?  I know we, over the past few years we've talked a lot about standards that people are reaching, standards, the No Child Left Behind Act [No Child Left Behind Act of 2001], I think mandated a set of standards, but some people say there's no funding for the project.  Have you got any feelings about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm a strong proponent of that No Child Left Behind Act, and what my greatest fear is, is that the philosophy will be thrown out with the parts of the law that people don't like, because, I have aligned myself professionally with it because I think it's one of the great federal levers that we have around equity because it's addressing how the achievement gap will be narrowed, in ways that are very evident by particular sub roots, et cetera.  Now, that's not to say there aren't very, a lot of flaws in the law which I think they should be addressed, but I'm concerned that people are going to be off on a tangent of killing it and with it we'll lose, well just lose what have been some of the great successes, where now because of it, you're having higher quality teachers.  You don't have people teaching out of field like I did to those seventh graders in 1966, because I wouldn't be able to do that.  You have people paying attention to standards and looking at the difference between white and black gaps in terms of achievement, and trying to do something about it.  So, I think that we have not yet reached a culture of accountability for results in this educational community and so until we do so as a professional responsibility, perhaps we need to have some levers to keep the pressure on, you know, what's happening.  I guess the other concern I have is for teacher quality because, you know, in the past that was very much a tradition in the black community.  People have many stories to tell about their teacher, who was African American, who was a neighbor down the street who cared about them.  If you read some of the educational research, what makes a student learn?  Finding a teacher who cares about them, presses them to learn, doesn't take the pressure off, believes that they can learn, and sets high expectations, and so what I fear if you look at the research, it shows that often where poor and minority students are, they have the least opportunities in terms of the way teachers are distributed, you know, access to physical and other resources, and unless we find ways to, I think, long term deal with making sure that adequate access is to provide, is provided to all students, then I'm not sure how we'll be able to get ahead.
Story_ID: 436307
Speaker 1: Now, just looking around the country, Chicago [Illinois] has a model of magnet schools, where if you really have a student that has a lot of potential for achievement, and you know the right people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you can get them in a magnet school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that's the thing, yes.
Speaker 1: If you have a smart student and don't know them, you might not be able to get them in one, or they may languish in a situation where they're frustrated in a regular public school.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, I think that's one of the great stories about public education.  The smart people are using it to get the best out of it they can, because there are always these best exemplary models that are available to certain people.  The real question is how can you bring that to scale so that everybody has access to that, not because of the personal networks but because of the right and entitlement to have that kind of exposure.  So, that's what our challenge is bringing what we know works in individual situations to make it massive scale for all situations.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Another city example model is where you send your kid to a parochial school, I mean, if you can afford it, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or vouchers, you know, such as NDC [ph.].  There, there are a variety of good things that are working.  It's not that we're out of possibilities.  It's like Ron Edmonds [Ronald Edmonds], you know, says, "We know everything we need to know to make education a priority in our country.  The question is do we have a will to do it?"
Story_ID: 436308
Speaker 1: What do you see as the future of the neighborhood public school in the black community, which often has lower, you know, smaller, smaller resources to operate with?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, in some ways that's sort of being broken up, particularly in a place like Chicago [Illinois].  There's not much neighborhood place anymore with the development of charters, the magnet schools, voluntary desegregation, so I think the concept of neighborhood, at least in this city, is not the same as it used to be; and particularly, with the disappearance of a lot of the housing enclaves, which would create certain--but I still would say it's just like, I think Reverend Meeks [James Meeks] was trying to prove in his recent protest of where he took the students from Chicago to a northern suburb, was to prove that there remained inequities largely because even the funding arrangements that deny students just in the inner city in general, you know, the opportunities for the same resources that suburban schools are, you know, providing just as a normal course.
Story_ID: 436309
Speaker 1: Now your educational philosophy has to do with education equity, right in terms of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, and holistic community involvement.  So, for example, I was just delighted because one of the boards I serve on is Chapin Hall center for research at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and historically they were essentially conducting research on children in you know, in foster care or other kinds of adjudicated situations and so now, what has come from the past is that thankfully people are now thinking about well how do these relationships intercept each other?  What happens with mobility when foster kids are moving around?  Is there another way to have policy so that can protect them or have records follow them, you know, so what about these other intersecting variables of education that need to be considered holistically, not only for data collection but in terms of service provision.  So, you know, I'm seeing some emergence of those kinds of you know, collaborations, integration of services, which I think in the long run is going to provide a better set of models and innovations that will serve the kind of kids, many of them who will continue to be poor kids, kids of color, and kids in need of more than just going through the academic experience.
Story_ID: 436310
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you'd do differently now?
Speaker 2: You know, I can't say that there is, I think, perhaps I would have preferred to write more, taken more time for personal writing to leave some of these ideas as a legacy and that's why I guess I'm so grateful for this opportunity that The HistoryMakers has provided to leave a legacy through this dialogue and this experience, you know, based on my knowledge.  I didn't really have a plan for my life, so I--it's hard for me to reflect back and say well, I should have planned differently.  I've basically been in situations that have always come to my doorsteps; opportunities that I never would have predicted, you know, starting back from the Ph.D. financial, you know, support that I got through scholarships, through the opening up the philanthropy door to the state board [National Association of State Boards of Education].  I mean, these were all situations where maybe I just happened to be in the right place at the right time, but I was able to take significant advantage of them and they always led me to the next step, and I would just say that I've been very blessed that through these experiences that are international, that I have an international group of friends and networks that I cherish dearly and have been able to maintain across the globe, you know, throughout my life.
Story_ID: 436311
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back at everything you've done at this point, what do you think is today, as we sit here, is your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think that it will relate around this issue of what it really means to bring educational opportunity to a significant position in terms of the integration of the two concepts around what happens around the academic curriculum, the academic core, and making that, as I said, as, you know, an academic equity and social justice issue, integrated with a notion of community supports.  I mean, that's what I worked on all my life, even in these various spokes and you know, movements and in and out of jobs, it sort of always comes back to that central core, that I'm proving in each relationship, in each engagement, in each client; yet, another place to take that issue.  That may not be on a path that I've planned it per se, but as I said, peels away at this in a way that I can say, and as a result of this, I've made a contribution.
Story_ID: 436312
Speaker 1: Well, tell us a little bit about your family, now. You, you've never been married, I take it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: But who do you consider your family and what--
Speaker 2: I consider my family my, my, my mother [Julia Spalding Bailey] who, in my immediate family aside from my sister is the only living relative.  My father [Leroy Bailey] is deceased.  All his siblings are deceased.  My mother is the only one of her siblings who remains and then, as I said, my sister who lives in Washington [D.C.] and works for the D.C. Public Schools [District of Columbia Public Schools], Barbara Bailey.  But other than that I have a bevy of cousins and extended family, with a very large cadre of godchildren and other mentees, so I feel very blessed that I, you know, as I think about my years ahead, which may not involve having a husband and certainly won't involve having children, that I really feel enriched by this larger notion of friendship and family.

Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't covered that I need to ask before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I would like to be remembered of as a person who was there for people, who was able to make a commitment to service to move beyond, sort of personal gains and goals, to help other people. I mean, to make a contribution so that each person or each situation in my life would have been enhanced in some way that allows that person or situation to be seen differently, so whether it's the students I mentored, the godchildren I have and encourage, my family relationships of caring and spending time, I just would like them to remember me as you know, giving something back to the community that supported me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well thank you very much for sharing with us.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Thank you.
