Speaker 1: We wanna start talking to you about your family background.  Tell me a little bit about your mother.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right, family brac- background; my mother, who's still living I might add.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Her name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Her name is Shirley Coney [Shirley White Coney], and, yeah, my mother was, my mother's family is originally from Alabama.
Speaker 1: What part of Alabama?
Speaker 2: Good question.  I don't know exact part--let's just say throughout Alabama she has relatives.  But, she lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] all her life.  So, I don't have as much history there because her whole live was in Philadelphia.  And, she's a, she's a only child.
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about her background when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: The main thing I know about my mama, a couple things; number one, when I was a youngster, a real youngster, she was a seamstress.  She worked in a factory and back in the day, she, you know, she was on assembly line, if you will, and she would sew.  So, she was a great sewer.  As a matter of fact, my, my brother [Homer Coney, Jr.] and sisters [Celestine Ray and Nicole Coney] and I, most of our clothes as a youngster a lot of it was made by my mother.  So, I always think back to one of our, one of our class trips in elementary school [Grover Cleveland Elementary School; Grover Cleveland Mastery Charter School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and both my, my brother and I went, went on a trip in white bellbottoms.  He was really into fashion, he enjoyed it.  I hated it.  It was one of the worst days of my life (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: It was quite a few years ago.  I don't know if it was back in--it would've been young.  So, elementary school, so that had to been--I'm born in 1958 so, sometime in six--in the '60s [1960s], mid to late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mom?
Speaker 2: I would describe her as a very caring woman with a great smile.  I always say the gift my mother given me was, was the, the gift, the gift of a smile.  I would also say, my mother is sort of a--my dad [Homer Coney, Sr.] was always the roll up your sleeves, work hard, sort of person.  And, my mom I would say was more of the dealmaker, you know, always, you know, making a deal.
Speaker 1: Do you feel that you've got any of her attributes (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I would say just one or two.  I'd one or two.
Speaker 1: What would they be (laughter)?
Speaker 2: She, she--probably, you know, smile, and making it happen; getting a deal done.  And, you know, my mother was also typ- you know, I hate to use the word typical.  But, she's probably typical as most moms.  You could never, you could never do, you know, their kids--her kids could never do wrong.  I'm embarrassed to say back when I was, I was just a freshman or sophomore in high school [Frankford High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and you know, we played on the basketball team, we're the number one team in the city at the time.  So, we were, really everyone on the team felt like we ran everything.  And, we were going, you know, down for lunch, back, back then you just had the cafeteria line.  And, you just walked through the line, you know, you had to wait in line to walk through it.  And, some days it could be very crowded and you might wait in line ten or fifteen minutes before you was able to purchase whatever it was that you wanna purchase.  And so, me and a couple of buddies who were on the team, we just burst in the line, jumped in front of the other kids and, and we would just take stuff off the, off the counter like, you know, nothing major, but Oreo cookies.  I remember what I took was this package of Oreo cookies.  And, so, this one day the, I forget what they call them in the school back them.  But, they were the people who, they weren't security guards but they were people that made sure there was no problem going on at school.  So, the guy came up and took like six of us and said, "Hey wait a minute, you guys can't do that," and took us to the principal office.  And, the principal then called our parents up to the school.  And, the first thing my mother said is, you know, "Hey, did you do that?"  And, of course, I was afraid to say yes.  So, I said, "No," I didn't do it, you know.  And, that's all she needed to hear.  The fact that I said, "No," she went in tooth and nail fighting with the principal.  "You can't do this to my son," and this, that and the other.  But, fact of the matter is, when my dad got--heard the story he said, he said, "Well, he probably did," you know (laughter), he immediately took the other, other route.  I mean, because he didn't look at the kids as, you know, just because they said it that made it right.
Story_ID: 532148
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Shirley White Coney] share any stories with you about her growing up?
Speaker 2: You know what, I can't honestly say I got a number of stories about my, my mom growing up.  Because again, my mother grew up as an only child.  And--
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about her mother?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, her mother, my grandmother I actually know very well because we--I grew up in a family where we lived with my grandmother in the same house.
Speaker 1: And, what was her name?
Speaker 2: So--her name was Corrine, Corrine White.  So, the way it would work in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] they had these old three story homes and they were quite large.  I don't know what the square footage would be but, you know, my--so, on the first level you would have--well, on the lower level you would have a basement.  Then you would have your living room, dining room, kitchen.  Then on the second floor, my grandmother and grandfather lived along with my, and my mom and dad [Homer Coney, Sr.] would live on the other side.  And, then, my brother [Homer Coney, Jr.], sister [Celestine Ray], my brother and I and my sister would live on the top floor.  So, we all grew up together is my point about my grandmother.
Speaker 1: What was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: My grandfather's name was Donnie, Donnie White [Dennie White].  And--
Speaker 1: Do you remember their birthdates?
Speaker 2: I don't remember their birthdates, unfortunately.  Both, Donnie and Corrine, both my grandmother, you know, my grandf- my grandmother and my grandfather, they were--they had a laundry business.  So, they, they owned a business.  You know, I feel funny saying owned, owned a business because it's not like as one might think, "Oh, you're a business owner."  But, it was a Laundromat, sort of a, probably would be a dry cleaner today.  But, they, they would laundry clothes.  And, but, my, my grandfather actually had had an accident so he was actually--he could not walk.  So, he was, so he was paralyzed most of my, most of our, our children bearing years.  So, they no--they didn't keep their Laundromat much longer after, after his accident because he just could not go back and forth to work.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what type of accident it was?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I thought it was due to a, to a truck, you know, they had a laundry truck.  I thought it was due more to a truck, truck accident.  Which, again, we're going way back, we're going back probably almost fifty, you know, fifty, you know, six--fifty, sixty years, so.
Speaker 1: So, when you, when they had this business--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --about how old were you?
Speaker 2: Young enough to where I don't remember all the details.  I mean, really, I mean, I would probably from a standpoint of, you know, maybe, you know, I was a little kid going in there holding my mom's hand because she went in there for a minute.  But, I have very, very slight memories about that.
Speaker 1: Did your--what kind of impression did your grandparents make on you?  Did they ever share any stories about their--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Probably more--
Speaker 1: --childhood?
Speaker 2: --probably more so my grandmother because my grandfather was confined to, you know, to a bed more or less.  But, my grandmother just from a standpoint of, you know, hard worker.  She always looked out, you know, for the family.  Just sort of the person who, she kept us all together.  So, I've got really fond memories of, of my grandmother.
Speaker 1: And, you said, she's still living?
Speaker 2: No.  My, my grandmother is no longer living.  She--
Speaker 1: Your grandmother's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) she'd passed over ten years ago.  But, my mother is still living.
Speaker 1: And, what about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: And--both of them are, are, both grandparents are passed.
Speaker 1: Did your grandmother or grandfather ever share any little words of wisdom with you or a little antidotes that you still remember?
Speaker 2: Yeah, not that I can really honestly, you know, I would be making something up.  So, no, not that I can really, I could really recall.  No.
Story_ID: 532149
Speaker 1: Tell me, please, a little bit about your father [Homer Coney, Sr.].
Speaker 2: Okay.  My father, on the other hand, he was, my dad was always, as I mentioned earlier, a hard worker.  He, he worked for many years as a truck driver.  And, he actually did very well.  I mean, as a truck driver it was, it was not, it was like UPS [United Parcel Service], but it wasn't UPS.  It was called the Tose company [Tose Inc.].  There was a gentleman in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] by the name of Leonard Tose.  And, he was famous because he owned the Philadelphia Eagles.  And, their family, one of the businesses that they were in, was they had this trucking business, and they would deliver packages around the city.  So, they were the alternative to UPS.  And, my dad was one of their lead drivers; had been with the company since they started.  But, obviously back then, it wasn't such things as stock options and things of that nature.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But, but nevertheless, he, he made a very decent living driving a truck (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, then they're--they mainly serviced the Philadelphia area?
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.  They serviced the Philadelphia area.  That's correct.  It used to be our--I remember the truck like it as yesterday.  It used to be a blue truck with a yellow ribbon around it.  That was their logo.  And, it was called the Tose company.  And, what was great for my brother [Homer Coney, Jr.] and I, we used to, like when we were, on holiday, we would, we could just ride, we would ride on the truck with my dad.  And, we would help him deliver.  So, my dad used to love that because he used to drive, but then when he gets to the house, then he have to get in and out of the truck, get the package, take it to the house and that, you know, he do that day in and day out.  Well, my brother and I was on the, on the delivery route with him, we could be the one jumping in and out, so.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So, he used to like those days.  And, during the holidays it was long hours because, you know, obviously people deliver, they're more packages to be delivered--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --during, during that, that, that time of year.
Story_ID: 532150
Speaker 1: Do you know where your father [Homer Coney, Sr.] was born?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My father's family is actually from Virginia; between Virginia and Florida.  But, my father, was born in Virginia.  And, then the family moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And, most of the family lived in--my fam- my father comes from a family of elven.  And, all had since passed with the exception of one individual.
Speaker 1: Who is (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and my father--one of the sister is still living.  Nora [ph.] is her name.  And, my father passed probably, it's probably been about three or four years ago now.
Speaker 1: And, what was his age when he passed?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Shirley White Coney] is--he's ten years older than my mother.  So, my, my, my mother is, you know, I guess I could say it on camera.  I mean, my mother is seventy-four-ish, so my, you know, so, four years, so, I would guess my dad would've been eighty--seventy-nine, eighty--
Speaker 1: Eighty.
Speaker 2: Yeah, seventy-nine, eighty.  'Cause I guess it's been about four or five years now.
Speaker 1: Do you know the names of his parents?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, I don't remember.  But, I remember the dad's name, my grandfather's name was Pink- Pinkney [Pinkney Coney (ph.)].  Pinkney was his name.  And, I'd never--
Speaker 1: That was his first name?
Speaker 2: That was his first name and Coney was his last.  I never got a chance to meet him because my--both my dad's parents had passed even before marrying my mother.  So, my mother doesn't even, you know, never really had a chance to, to meet them.
Speaker 1: But, you do have, you do know one aunt from your father's side?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, I knew all--like, my brother--my father's brothers and sisters I knew most of them throughout the years.  As a matter of fact, my middle name, which is Norman, is named after one of my uncle's [Norman Coney (ph.)]; one of my father's brother.
Speaker 1: Did you, did they all live in Virginia?
Speaker 2: I, you know, I'm not, I don't know the exact year they moved to Philly.  But, with eleven kids, I wouldn't be surprised if some of them might've grew up in Phil- you know, might have moved to Philly before.
Speaker 1: But, at the time you were growing up, all of his family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All of them were in Philly, lived in Philly.
Speaker 1: So, you had big family--
Speaker 2: In South--
Speaker 1: --support in--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in South Philly [South Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: But, it--the difference, the different was we--I lived in North Philly [North Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] but my dad's family primarily was in South Philly.  So, he was the only one out of the eleven kids that lived in North, in North Philly.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, when we come back we're gonna--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) talk about the difference between North Philly and South Philly.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Sounds good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 532151
Speaker 1: Mr. Coney [HistoryMaker Lester "Les" N. Coney] you were saying that you lived in--your family lived in North Philly [North Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, your dad's [Homer Coney, Sr.] family lived in South Philly [South Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But, before we talk about that, I want you to just kind of think real hard and see if you can remember your mother's [Shirley White Coney] birthday.
Speaker 2: I think it might have been, as it--well, she's seventy-three.
Speaker 1: July 25th.
Speaker 2: So, and she was born July 25th, but the year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Thirty-three [1933].
Speaker 2: --would've been 1933, I believe.  So, if I, if my math is correct, 1933.
Speaker 1: And, then your dad was about ten years--
Speaker 2: My dad was ten years older than my mom (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) her senior?
Speaker 2: And, and he was born on Halloween.
Speaker 1: So, that would be October 31st.
Speaker 2: So, October 31st.  So, that was always easy.
Speaker 1: Nineteen--?
Speaker 2: So, what would've been, so it's thirty--so it would've been '23 [1923].
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty-three [1923] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen twenty-three [1923].
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember the difference in your mom's age and your grandmother's age?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My grandmom [Corrine White], I believe, she was like twenty years older than my mom.  So, she would've been 1913, maybe.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, would that, would that add up?  Let me see.
Speaker 1: Yeah, about 1913 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From thirty--twenty--1913.
Speaker 1: Thirteen [1913]. Right.
Story_ID: 532152
Speaker 1: You all lived together in this wonderful house.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In North Philly [North Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Describe your house for me.
Speaker 2: Well, first, you know, we lived on a street called Florence Street [sic.] which is in the heart of North Philly--
Speaker 1: Now, what side of town is North Philly considered?
Speaker 2: Well, North Philly considered--is considered really where most of the African Americans, if you will--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --where we lived.  And, I lived--but, there're different parts of North Philly.  So, when, when I was real young the only memories I have from living on Florence Street was my brother [Homer Coney, Jr.] and I had bunk beds and we used to be in this little tiny room.  And, and I just remember that about that house.  I literally can't--there's no other memory I can hav- I have of--so, 'cause I think we moved and I was maybe two or three.  But, most of my childhood memories come from still being on North Philly but living on 18th Street.  We lived on 3812 North 18th Street.
Speaker 1: So, when you lived on Florence Street, what year was that?  Was that where you were born?
Speaker 2: That would've been when I was born.  I was born at Hahnemann Hospital [Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital; Hahnemann University Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  So, that would've been on Florence Street.
Speaker 1: You were born on  Hahnemann Hospital (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Hahnemann Hospital.
Speaker 1: --and, that's in North Philly?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah that's still considered North Philly.  Yeah, that's almost downtown.
Speaker 1: So, that was your first residence?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, you lived there how long?
Speaker 2: I recall moving from there when I was two or three.  That's what I recollect.  But, I could be, obviously I could be proven wrong (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear).  And, then the family moved where?
Speaker 2: And, then we moved to another part of North Philly; eight- called 18th and Butler [Street].  And, while--we lived in a home on--which was 3812 North 18th Street.  And, it was a three story, a three story home in which we lived with my [maternal] grandparents [Corrine White and Dennie White].
Speaker 1: And, what was that like?
Speaker 2: And, that was great.  I mean, you know, because when things happen to you at such a young age, you don't really know it as, as it being a big deal because that's the only thing you ever knew.
Speaker 1: Now, was that a move up?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I could say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that step up?
Speaker 2: I would say it was definitely a move up, no questions about that, because it was a bigger home.  And, it was a much, a nicer community because this part of North Philly was right near Nicetown [Nicetown-Tioga, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And, so, anyone who knows Philly knows you have Nicetown, then Germantown [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], then Mount Airy [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and that's kind of, most people think of, you know, Germantown, and Mount Airy as being like the, you know, the, the area of the city.
Speaker 1: What do--
Speaker 2: One of the areas of the city.
Speaker 1: What do you think enabled your family to move up?  Was it the business, the laundry business?
Speaker 2: I think it was the laundry business.  I think it was my father [Homer Coney, Sr.] working hard as truck driver as he began to, to make money.  I think it was the work, you know, that my mother [Shirley White Coney] also was doing as a, as a seamstress.  So, I think it was a combination of both.  And, I think when I lived, when we lived on Florence Street, to the best of my knowledge, we did not live with my grandparents at that time.  So, I think after my grandfather had the accident and we knew that, you know, in order for my mother to help take care of him, we decided to move in one house.  And, so, I think all the resources were put together.  Now, I was never told that, but as I think back, that's prob- I would guess, that's probably how that all came together.
Speaker 1: Was he actually bedridden?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, for how many years?
Speaker 2: Nearly by, you know, so, you know, at least ten plus years before he passed that I, that I was born.
Speaker 1: And, your grandmother then left the business?  Did she close the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --laundry?
Speaker 2: Right.  Closed the laundry and then, and then she went on to--I should know this but let me just think as we talk, I'll--when it come back mind, I'll let you know.  But, she went on to, to continue to work but in a different, in a different capacity.
Speaker 1: And, you mom was still working as a seamstress?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mom was working as a seamstress.  But, but then I remember when we moved to 18th Street in Nicetown, she then took a job as an educator with Grover Cleveland Elementary School [Grover Cleveland Mastery Charter School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And, I say as an educator, meaning she was working in the educational system.  But, she was called, at that time, they called it a school coordinator, which was really I guess another name of a school, a truant officer.  So, she would be the person that would go out and visit with families if, you know, little Johnny wasn't, you know, missed a couple days of school or whatever the case may have been.
Story_ID: 532153
Speaker 1: Going back to your mom [Shirley White Coney] as a seamstress, do you remember the name of the place where she worked?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: You don't.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't--
Speaker 1: Do you know what her academic background was?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, my, my mother, one of the things I'm, you know, I'm real proud of sort of where we've come is that my mother is a high school graduate, but my dad [Homer Coney, Sr.] never graduated from high school.  So, you know, I was a first generation college grad.  So, I was the first one in our family to graduate from college.  Not just in my own immediate family but even when we talk about the eleven brothers and sisters.  And, again, my mom didn't have, didn't have a brother and sister.
Speaker 1: Do you, did she ever say the name of her high school?
Speaker 2: No.  But, that's a good question, I need to fi- let me think on that one again, and maybe we can come back to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  How would you--
Speaker 2: I promise you when we get into '70s [1970s], I'm gonna know more (laughter).
Speaker 1: You gonna know a lot (laughter). Well, you have to kind of jog your memory, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  Oh, man, we're going--well, so far, you know, this is like a, I feel like I'm taking a history test.
Speaker 1: Did we talk (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, I never was good at that.
Story_ID: 532154
Speaker 1: Did we talk about stories that you dad may have shared with you about his growing up with eleven--
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) brothers and sisters, it must've been a lot.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I would just say, my, my dad used to always remind us how good we had it.  And, that how it used to, you know, wear shoes that had plastic in the, in the bottom, in the sole because it was holes and he couldn't by new, a new pair.  And, he used to talk about how many, how many things he had to do just to, just to provide for his family.  So, I always used to, my memories of my dad, he was always--you know, like, with my kids [Chanel Coney and Javon Coney], you know, I'm fortunate to be when they're participating in sports or whatever, I'm able to adjust my schedule to always be there.  I mean, that's like, something that I'm thankful for.  My dad on the other hand, I mean, he worked hard.  I mean, he, he leaves out six o'clock in the morning, then he didn't come home until 7:30, 8:00 at night, and that was every day.  And, so, and being a truck driver working for the Tose company [Tose Inc.], you wore uniform.  So, I used to always remember the, him in his blue, blue pants and blue shirt with Homer [Homer Coney, Sr.] on his little name tag, you know.  So, so, you figure by time he came in, and you know, took a shower or bath, and had dinner, you know, we always had dinner as a family.  But, many days, it excluded my dad because we ate at five or six [o'clock].  And, then he would come home and it was always one plate sitting on the stove with aluminum foil, you know, around it, you know, waiting for my father to eat.  He would come in and eat.  And, then after he eat, he'll get a report from my mom [Shirley White Coney] as to who need to be, get a spanking that day.  And, then he does that, and then he goes to bed (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 532155
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was his mother's name?
Speaker 2: Well, again, as I mentioned, my father [Homer Coney, Sr.], I remember my grandfather's name which was Pinkney [Pinkney Coney (ph.)], but I never, I never knew (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Pinkney, did't remember--
Speaker 2: I never knew the name.  Because again, both of them had passed even prior to--
Speaker 1: Right.  I remember that.
Speaker 2: --you know, marrying my mother [Shirley White Coney].  But, what was interesting about Pinkney, we do have one picture of him that I've been trying to get from my mom.  But, she wouldn't get rid of it, which, you know, he had on this long zoot suit, you know, with a gold chain that come all the way down to the ground.  So, so that's the, that's the only picture I've ever seen of him.
Speaker 1: Did all of the, or many of his brothers and sisters get together at family gatherings and tell stories, and if so, do you remember any of those?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, we used to get together all the time during the holidays.  But, usually, it was always his family coming to, to, to our house.  I don't have a lot of memories of us going to South Philly [South Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] to be--I mean, we would go every now and then.  But, not alwa- it was more so different ones would come of our house for different things.
Story_ID: 532156
Speaker 1: Now, paint a picture of South Philly [South Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] for us.
Speaker 2: Well, South Philly is a great part of the city.  That's where all of our sports, where all our sports teams are located; whether the Eagles [Philadelphia Eagles] or the 6ers [Philadelphia 76ers], that where--the Flyers [Philadelphia Flyers] that's where they all have their stadiums, and play.  And, also, that's where Rocky--the part of town where Rocky is from; Sylvester Stallone.
Speaker 1: So, was that a more upscale area than North Philly [North Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: You know, rather than say upscale, I would say it was more of Italian.  So, you know, Philly was more of an ethnic sort of, you know, Italians may have lived here, African Americans here, Latinos there.  So, South Philly was always known for the area where the Italians lived, and that--whether they were wealthy or not.

Speaker 1: What is you earliest memory?  You earliest memory of growing up?  Now, you told me about the house, but is there anything else that sticks out in your mind?
Speaker 2: Well, for me, there--a couple things come to mind.  One, I remember how growing up in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], graffiti was a very big thing at that point.  So, it was nothing to every community that I, not only where I went to school, but where I lived, it was just writing all over the walls.  So, that was something that, when I think back I just think, boy that was kind of weird.  Whereas now when I go around, I don't know that my kids [Chanel Coney and Javon Coney] ever see graffiti.  If I said, they wouldn't even maybe necessarily know what graffiti is.  Not because we live in such a great neighborhood, but just because it's not what it used to be back in the '60s [1960s] and maybe early '70s [1970s].  So, that, that's one thing.
Story_ID: 532158
Speaker 1: Two--the second thing, I was very involved in the boys club.  And, so, a good chunk of my life was spent, when I wasn't in school, was spending a lot of times with the boys club.  And--
Speaker 2: Was that the name of it, the boys club?
Speaker 1: It was called the Nicetown Boys and Girls Club [Nicetown Boys Club; Shane Victorino Nicetown Boys and Girls Club, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  So, Boys Clubs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, now, what age are we talking about?
Speaker 1: Since, you know, you know, eight or nine and up.  Yeah, yeah, so, my whole life, you know, through high school [Frankford High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  As a matter of fact in 1976, I received what was called the Boy of the Year award.  Which is the number one award, you know, given in, in every city around the country of the boy or girl for outstanding leadership.  And, you get it, not just because of academics, but you get it for academics, sports, community service, et cetera.  And, so, I received that award.  And, then once you receive it, then you get lumped into a category of what's called the Union League award [Good Citizenship Award], which I actually won back in 1976.  And, I never really thought of that as a big honor but not too long ago, I had the opportunity to go to a--Sandra Day O'Connor was speaking at the Union League Club [Union League Club of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  And, my friend Brenda Russell [Brenda A. Russell] happened to be chairing that dinner.  And, she invited me to, you know, as her escort for the evening.  So, I like, graci- and, you know, I accepted.  And, and Brenda had the head table and I had a chance to sit right next to Sandra Day O'Connor.  And, she, well, in her bio talked about the Union; she had won the Union League of the Year award [sic.].  And, I said, "Oh, where was that?"  And, she said, "With the boys clubs."  And, so, it was same award that I won.  But, I just didn't know the significance of it.  And, and, so what happened, I then, next time I went back to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I was in the basement--my mother's [Shirley White Coney] and father [Homer Coney, Sr.] did a great job of saving, saving things.  So, I went back to the basement and was looking for that award and had it, and I found it.  And, my mother said, "What are you, what are you taking from me now?"  You know, 'cause every time I go home, I take, I take more and more stuff, 'cause the older, you know, the older I get, the more that stuff becomes valuable to me.  You know, and so, I mean, this was stuff I would consider junk and--before.
Story_ID: 532159
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were telling us about the dinner that you attended with Sandra Day O'Connor.
Speaker 2: Yes.  You know, the way that came about is here in Chicago [Illinois] there're probably four or five major private clubs.  One of them happen to be the Union League Club [Union League Club of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  And, a good personal friend of mine by the name of Brenda Russell [Brenda A. Russell], young lady by the name of Brenda Russell, she from--right now she's head of the Illinois security program [sic. Illinois Department of Employment Security].  Well, she provides the checks to, to people who are unemployed.  And, I forget what the exact title would be.  But, she's in charge of that here, that area of the State of Illinois.  But, Brenda and I happen to serve on a board of a non-for-profit company together; had been for years, called City Year Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And, so, Brenda happens to be very active at the Union League and happens to serve on that board and once a month they have a keynote speaker who comes in and tells their story.  They're either promoting a book or they're talking about their life in general.  And, when Sandra Day O'Connor was coming, and this was a real big hoot for the club.
Speaker 1: And, Sandra Day O'Connor--
Speaker 2: Because she was--
Speaker 1: --the chief justice (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Chief justice.  She was chief justice [sic. associate justice].  And, more importantly than that is she was just stepping down as chief justice.  So, that was major news across the country.  And, Brenda happened to be instrumental in bringing Sandra Day O'Connor to Chicago and so she chaired the dinner.  I went with her and that's how we got on the subject of the Union League of the Year award [sic. Boy of the Year].
Story_ID: 532160
Speaker 1: Now, you were saying that you attended the Nicetown Boys and Girls Club [Nicetown Boys Club; Shane Victorino Nicetown Boys and Girls Club, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was that a place that you went every day after school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  As a matter of fact, well, first of all, years ago it used to be called the Nicetown Boys Club.  It was just for boys.  And, then later on in the years it became--I mean, they had a girls club but then the girls club was located at, you know, maybe four or five blocks away.  But, now it's all called Ni- you know, Boys and Girls Club.  They combined the two.  So, it was a place where you could go and you could shoot pool.  You can play ping pong.  You can play basketball.  I was a big basketball player at the time.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year you started going there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I would say when I was eight or nine.  So, you know, if I was born in '58 [1958], I would say '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, so, and it was a place where everyone in the community, not everyone, but most people in the community, that's where you went to socialize.  And, it interesting, you know, you know, I always, you know, it's always a common joke about, you know, African Americans and their capabilities of swimming.  And, when I think back, you know, this--here it is a rec center, but yet they never had a swimming pool.  And, and that was not uncommon throughout the inner city.  And, so, and I, I think if you, you look at it you'll probably see there's a, there's a correlation as to why so many don't.  But, anyway, having said that, it was a place where everyone gone to play ball, to play basketball, ping pong, et cetera.
Speaker 1: So, you would go to the boys and girls club after school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Maybe five days a week?  Or was it a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It wouldn't--
Speaker 1: --place you would go on the weekend?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, your mother [Shirley White Coney], you were saying had--
Speaker 2: They were closed on Sundays though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 532161
Speaker 1: Your mother [Shirley White Coney] worked at the same school that you attended.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How--what was that like?
Speaker 2: Well, it was interesting because, you know, in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you have elementary school, junior high, then, high.  It wasn't until I moved here to Chicago [Illinois] that I realized every city is not like that.  Because I think here in Chicago, you go to--from first to eighth and then you go right into high school as a ninth grader.  That may not be all around the City of Chicago but most of the places where I see, that's the way it is.  So, you know, I was at Grover Cleveland Elementary School [Grover Cleveland Mastery Charter School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And, where was that located?
Speaker 2: And, that was located at 19th [Street] and Butler [Street].  And, my mom when she took the job, she took it probably when I was in fifth or sixth grade.  So, I only had to deal with her being in the same school with me for a couple of years.  But, she was not a teacher, again, she was a school, what they call a school coordinator.  Which basically was similar to a truant officer where she really was the community person.  And, she had to know the folks, you know, knew who the parents were, get them active in the school, make sure that the kids if they were having problems.  And, a lot of the time when kids were having problem, it was usually a problem at home.  And, so, she would be that sort of link into making sure that the kids were, you know, you know--working, you know, working with the parents to see if there were something the community could be doing to help, to help the son or daughter achieve.
Story_ID: 532162
Speaker 1: Mr. Coney [HistoryMaker Lester "Les" N. Coney], what kind of student were you in school?
Speaker 2: Well, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How would you describe yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Well, let me just say I was never an A student (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So, I wouldn't describe that.  But, but I was always the student who was doing multiple things.  So, you know, I wasn't great at anything.  But, I was good at everything (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Everything.
Speaker 2: You know, and that was really the way, you know, even now I think of it the same way.  You know, it's just, you know, I'm not trying to turn in the best, you know, the best grade, you know.  And, yeah, and that's kind of always been the way, the way I am.
Speaker 1: Was there one particular teacher that you would say influenced you--
Speaker 2: Well, I--
Speaker 1: --a lot in elementary school [Grover Cleveland Elementary School; Grover Cleveland Mastery Charter School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?  'Cause then we're gonna talk about that for high school [Frankford High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] also.  So, for elementary school.
Speaker 2: Well, I remember the elementary school teachers a lot more than I remember the high school, which is interesting.  Because, you know, elementary, I don't know if it was more because my mother [Shirley White Coney] also knew the teachers so, you know, there was also--not only were they my teachers but they were also friends of, of my mom, if you will, you know.  So, I remember there was a Miss, Miss Thompson [ph.], there was a Miss Huntley [ph.], a Miss Henry [ph.], Mr. Shelly [ph.].  So, those are some--Pettis, Frank Pettis [ph.].  And, as a matter of fact, now that I live here in Chicago [Illinois], you may know Don [Donald Stewart] and Isabel Stewart [Isabel Carter Stewart].  Isabel Stewart actually grew up a couple blocks from where I lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And, she wouldn't been, not quite my mom's peer but, and I don't know Mr. Stewart's age, but the point is Frank Pettis happens to be a good friend of hers.  And, here's a guy who was my teacher in elementary school.  And, so, those are just a few names that I remember right off the bat, like it was yesterday, from elementary school.
Speaker 1: Do you--?
Speaker 2: Whereas in junior high [Warren G. Harding Junior High School; Warren G. Harding Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I really honestly could not name one teacher that I can recall.  Not that they weren't doing a great job, I'm sure they were.  But, I, I cannot point to one teacher (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 532163
Speaker 1: What do remember about those junior high years?
Speaker 2: Well, just, you know, I, I--the one thing that sticks out in my mind, well, a couple of things sticks out in my mind from junior high, was it was the first time I went to school out of my, out of my community.  You know, my parents [Shirley White Coney and Homer Coney, Sr.] had really wanted me to go to, you know, the best school possible.  And, since my mom was now working in the schools system, she could say, hey, look, you need to be going over there or there, whatever.  And, so, I went to Harding Junior High School [Warren G. Harding Junior High School; Warren G. Harding Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Harding Junior High--
Speaker 1: What year--
Speaker 2: Which is in Northeast.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from Cleveland [Grover Cleveland Elementary School; Grover Cleveland Mastery Charter School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, let's put it this way, I graduated from high school [Frankford High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in 1976.  So, if I take four years away from that, that would make it '72 [1972], and then three years from that, probably '69 [1969].  So, I probably came out of Cleveland--
Speaker 1: So, you graduated Cleveland in 1969?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, from Cleveland, you went to Harding Junior High School?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And, that was grades?
Speaker 2: That would've been grade seventh, eighth, and ninth.
Speaker 1: Seven through nine?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, that was in Northeast Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  So, one--as you asked the question about memories, one of my memories was, I had to take a trolley, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], they still have it too.  Trolleys are, are one of the main form of public transportation.  And, so, I used to take the trolley down Airy Avenue [Mt Airy Avenue].  And, what was great, even though it was all the way on the other side of town, this one transportation would take me from my house all the way to the front of the school.
Story_ID: 532164
Speaker 1: You talked about your brothers and sisters.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'd like to go back and just mention them.  I'd like to get their names.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, their ages.
Speaker 2: So, my brother, his name is Homer Coney, Jr.  He was a junior for my father.  And, I think I mentioned to you, my mother's name is Shirley [Shirley White Coney] and my father's name is Homer.  He was a Homer, Sr. [Homer Coney, Sr.]. My sister name is Celestine [Celestine Ray]; my oldest sister.  And, then my youngest sister is Nicole [Nicole Coney].
Speaker 1: Now, how old is Homer, Jr.?  Do you know their--
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, so--
Speaker 1: Birth year, their birthdates?
Speaker 2: So, my brother would be, you know, okay, I'm forty-eight now, so my brother will be fifty this year.  And, then my sister, is probably fifty-three-ish, fifty-three, fifty-four.  And, then my little sister is probably thirty-two, thirty-three.  So, that's one of the more significant things about me growing up is the fact that I was the baby the whole, our whole life in the family.  And, then my parents had this Johnny come lately, or, I guess you say Sally come lately.
Speaker 1: Sally come lately (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Sally come lately.  And, so, my little sister, Nicole.  So, if she's thirty-three and I'm forty-eight, I mean, there was a, you know, that's a substantial difference.  So, my little sister actually grew up in the house by herself, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you and your brothers and sisters all went to the same school?  For the most part?
Speaker 2: No.  Ele- ele--
Speaker 1: Elementary school?
Speaker 2: Elementary, I would say, yes [Grover Cleveland Elementary School; Grover Cleveland Mastery Charter School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  But, no, but not for junior high.  So, so, my brother and, my brother and sister, they both went to Gillespie Junior High [Elizabeth Duane Gillespie Junior High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which was right in the community.  And, I went to Harding [Warren G. Harding Junior High School; Warren G. Harding Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], as I mentioned.  And, then for high school, my sister, my oldest sister stayed right there and went to Simon Gratz High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and they were right next to each other.  But, then my brother went out of the community to Dobbins, Dobbins High School [Murrell Dobbins Vocational High School; Murrell Dobbins Career and Technical Education High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And, then I went out of the community in Northeast [Northeast Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] to Frankford [Frankford High School].  And, then my little sister went to Olney [Olney High School; Olney Charter High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  So, really all four of us went to different schools.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. I'm sorry, what was the name of her school again?
Speaker 2: Olney, with an O, Olney.
Story_ID: 532165
Speaker 1: Tell me about Frankford High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Well, Frankford was great.  Because by then, you know, I was a star athlete.  And, so, it was a big deal to, you know, it was big deal being a, you know, an athlete.  And, so, you know, you--
Speaker 1: You didn't talk about when you became an athlete (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, you know, in junior high [Warren G. Harding Junior High School; Warren G. Harding Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you know, in elementary school [Grover Cleveland Elementary School; Grover Cleveland Mastery Charter School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] I really wasn't an athlete.  But, in junior high, I played soccer of all sports.  And, that's where I got, got my bug, in terms of playing sports.
Speaker 1: Now, what led you to soccer?
Speaker 2: Well, really just because of another friend.  And, you know, by buddy, he was going out for the team.  He said, "Hey, let's do it."  And, so, I did it.  So, it was really more about hanging out with him.  But--
Speaker 1: And, did he make the team too?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, he definitely--he was really into it.  And, and it was fun.  But, then in high school somewhere along the line, and I think it came through the boys club [Nicetown Boys Club; Shane Victorino Nicetown Boys and Girls Club, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I started playing basketball.  And, with the basketball I, you know, Frankford by my senior year, we became, we were the second best team in, in the city.
Speaker 1: And, what position did you play?
Speaker 2: I played guard at that time.
Speaker 1: Going back to soccer, did you ever get any awards, or--?
Speaker 2: No awards for that.  That was not my calling.  But, no, I didn't win any awards for that one.
Speaker 1: So, you stopped playing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, I was good though.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you stopped playing soccer at--in junior high?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, when you went into high school your first year, you started--did you start playing basketball then?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, actually, I started playing a little bit in high school.  I mean, in junior high.
Speaker 1: In junior high.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I did start playing a little bit in junior high.  And, I think that's when I really kind of began to get the bug.  So, I think between the summer of ninth, ninth and tenth grade going into high school, I really developed.
Speaker 1: Who was some of the start ath- basketball ath- players at that time that you--
Speaker 2: Well, when I look back, you know, I was, I was honorable mentioned all-city for basketball which I was thrilled with.  But, one of the guys--we were the second best team in the league.  The number one team was West Philly High [West Philadelphia High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and they had a gentleman by the name of Gene Banks.  And, Gene Banks actually was a star player for Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina], and he went on to play for the Chicago Bulls and San Antonio Spurs.  So, so he was one.  Lewis Lloyd was another one.  And, Lewis Lloyd played for Overbrook [Overbrook High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and he played for Drake [Drake University, Des Moines, Iowa]; was the number scorer in the country.  But, then he went on to play for the Houston Rockets, so.
Speaker 1: So, by your third year, you were the star athlete in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, we were big--
Speaker 1: And, what did that do for you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) we were big, we were big shots.  But, on my, on my high school team, I had the pleasure of playing with John Chaney's son.  John Chaney is famous because he was the head basketball coach for Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and has won national awards two or three years in a row.  So, his son John was on my team.  And, then also Wilt Chamberlain's sister's son was on the team.  So, 'cause, Wilt Chamberlain is from Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] as well.
Speaker 1: So, did you meet Wilt?
Speaker 2: So--oh, he would actually come to some of the games.  So, my basketball coach was his best man at his wedding.  So, I've known Wilt for, I mean, you know, he was close to our program for, for, for a long time.
Story_ID: 532166
Speaker 1: So, you graduated Frankford High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in 1976.  Looking back on those years, who would you say, was there a teacher that impacted your life, that made a great--
Speaker 2: From Frankford (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) impression on you?
Speaker 2: Well, from Frankford, I remember the one teacher that was always--I was very close with, was the English teacher.  And, I cannot for the life of me, think of, I wanna say his name was like, O'Connor, or, you know, O'Sullivan, something like that.  But, he was this Irish gentleman who also--we just hit it off, for whatever reason.  I mean, 'cause certainly English wasn't one of my, my top subjects, but, you know, but, we just hit it off.  He really liked me.  I liked him.  But, he was also head of the, I wanna say program book, but the yearbook, if you will.  And, and, so, it was nice when I graduated back in '76 [1976] I probably was in every other page.  So, I always got the key positioning on the--
Story_ID: 532167
Speaker 1: Did you have any idea what you wanted to be when you were in high school [Frankford High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: No.  Because actually when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where you saw life leading you?
Speaker 2: Because my dad [Homer Coney, Sr.] was a truck driver back then, it was just automatic that we were gonna graduate from high school and go and work on the truck with my father.  And, that's what my brother [Homer Coney, Jr.] did.  So, my brother never went to college.  He, he immediately started working on, on--as a truck driver.  And, he--which is really sad on one hand, because he was all--my brother was always a very bright individual.  He always got straight A's in school.  But, back then, you know, you just, you know, this is what you do.  You, you go work with your dad.  And, and that--'cause my family didn't have money to send people off to college.  Nor, they didn't go through it, so they couldn't even walk around the house and articulate what, what that was all about.  So, you just, it just wasn't on your radar.  Whereas my, with my kids [Chanel Coney and Javon Coney], you know, my kids' mother [Dawn Worthy Coney], my ex-wife, she has a master's [degree] from Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].  Their grandmother has her master's from Governors State [Governors State University, University Park, Illinois].  And, their brother--their uncle, my wife's brother, has his Ph.D.  So, you know, so, they're all around it, you know, education, if you will.  So, they know that when they graduate from high school, they're going on to, they're going to that next level.
Speaker 1: What about your sister?
Speaker 2: My sister, well, both (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Both of your sisters?
Speaker 2: Both sisters did not graduate from college.  My sister, as a matter of fact, my youngest sister [Nicole Coney] at age thirty-three, she's even now making attempt to go back to school now, and so is my older sister [Celestine Ray] is making attempt.  They're both taking classes, I wish I--they'll kill me because I can't tell you exactly what they taking classes for, but they're taking them.  So, they're both are making an attempt to, you know, to better their lives, which I think is wonderful.
Story_ID: 532168
Speaker 1: So, what made you wanna go to college?
Speaker 2: Well, really what happened for me was when I won that award, the Union League award [Boy of the Year], it came with it a very small scholarship.  And, I wanna say that scholarship was no more than a thousand bucks [dollars].  But, yet, you know, again, you have to go back twenty-five years ago.  That--
Speaker 1: That was a lot of money.
Speaker 2: That was a lot of money.  Okay, so, when we heard they got a thousand bucks, my parents said, "Well, hell, why don't you just go for one year?  We--'cause we're straight, we can definitely squeeze it through one year.  And, then you're come back to the community and you'll be ahead of everybody else, because you'll have one year of college education."  Something that--and that was a big deal back then just saying that you had one year of college education; forget that you didn't graduate.  So, actually after that first year, you know, one thing led to another.  I said, "Well, wait a minute."  I said, said to my mom [Shirley White Coney] and dad [Homer Coney, Sr.], I said, "Look, I, you know, I think I can go another year."  They said, "Okay.  Well, how we gonna do it?"  And, so, I said, "Well, I think I can get this.  And, I think I can get from here and there."  And, they said, "Okay.  Well, we think we can--," you know, so we all came, put it together.  And, then we went--and then, you know, after the second year I said, "Well, wait a minute, I'm halfway through."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, so, you know, and then I was dating my kids' mother at the time.  I met her as a freshman.  Her name is Dawn.  Maiden name Dawn Worthy, but now Dawn Coney [Dawn Worthy Coney].  So, I was dating her.  And, so, I definitely wasn't leaving school now because I wasn't gonna leave her.
Speaker 1: I wanna talk about how you got to George Williams [George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: How did that happen?  Why there as opposed to another school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Again, I wanna go back to that award.  It's amazing that award had an impact in a variety of ways.  When I got that scholarship, it was all through the boys club [Nicetown Boys Club; Shane Victorino Nicetown Boys and Girls Club, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And, George Williams is internationally known for its Boys Club [Boys Clubs of America; Boys and Girls Clubs of America] and YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] work.  And, so, the gentleman who ran the boys club said, "Hey, Les [HistoryMaker Lester "Les" N. Coney], you should think about George Williams."  Now, hell, George Williams could've been in China far as I knew.  And, I never heard of it.  But, again, my kids now they look at schools and they say, "Well, wait a minute.  Is it Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or is it--?"  My daughter's [Chanel Coney] at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] and, you know, that kind of thing.  When I was coming along all it had to, you know, as long as it was a college; that was it.  It wasn't what their rankings were.  So, I, so, when he talked about--he had graduated from there and he would make a phone call, help me through that application process, because I had already missed the deadline.  'Cause I won this award at the end of my senior year [at Frankford High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], so that would've been around May.  As most, most of the people will know that, you know, you're long through your college application by May of your senior year.  And, so, they actually was able to accept my application.  They, they flew, the counselor flew to Chicago [sic. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], met with me over lunch, next thing I know I was off to school.  I mean, it all happened in like a two, three week period.

Speaker 1: This was your first time away from home?
Speaker 2: First time away.
Speaker 1: What was--
Speaker 2: First time, and it was dif- (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was that like?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, my parents--and, I always remember like it was, again, like it was yesterday 'cause they put me on Amtrak [National Railroad Passenger Corporation].  I'd never been on a plane at that point.  And, they put me on Amtrak, and I remember driving off and my little sister [Nicole Coney] who's a very strong African American woman but I remember her crying in the train station 'cause she--as I was pulling off.  But, but, it was, you know, I went with a trunk, you know, and they said, "Okay, good luck," you know.  And, it was funny when I went off to school [George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois], I always felt that I, I was a rich person.  And, it wasn't until I got ov- got out of my community [Nicetown-Tioga, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and went to college that I realized I was poor (laughter), you know.  When I start seeing what others had, you know.  But, it was--so, I really credit my parents from creating an environment where we felt that we, we had.  And, ultimately we did have.  We had food on the table and that type of thing.  But, but, it was--that was really speci- so, they sent me off to Chicago [Illinois] with--I didn't know anyone in Chicago, didn't know anyone at the school, there were nobody making phone calls in terms of connections and things of that nature.  I got off the train with my trunk and the school said, "Hey, we'll, we'll send someone, they next time we can send someone over to pick you up, would be, you know, two hours from now."  And, I'm sitting there at the train station, sitting on my trunk, just sitting out there.  I remember it was August or whatever, so the weather was nice; just waiting.  And, it could've been like it was on the other side of the world.  So, that was, that was, that was an eye wake- wakening experience.  But, I really do feel that I'm sort of who I am today as a result of that experience.  You know, and, I always remember my mom [Shirley White Coney] and dad [Homer Coney, Sr.], when I would call them and they would say, you know, if I had a problem or say the test was hard or this wasn't whatever, 'cause they couldn't really, they had not been through it.  So, they're listening to my stories, and that was learning process for them.  And, they would talk about, you know, they said, "Well, are you reading your Bible?"  Like that.  And, I'd say, you know, 'cause most black families, you know religion is a big part of who we are.  They say, "Are you reading the Bible?"  And, I'd say, "Yeah, I'm reading the Bible," and they say, and she said, "Okay."  And, then, you know, 'cause I got other calls say, "Could you just send me five dollars or a hundred dollars--," or whatever it was.  It wouldn'tve been a hundred dollars at that time. But, (laughter), but, whatever it was, so they would always end say, "Are you reading your Bible?"  So, then one day, when times really got hard, I would say I was reading it but I really wasn't.  The one day when time really got hard, I opened the Bible and I just sat down one evening and was reading the Bible and when I opened it up, there were five one hundred dollar bills in there.  And, so, I always think back to, to how that again, five hundred dollars, how that--
Speaker 1: So, your mother was asking you, if you were reading the Bible--
Speaker 2: Because they had the money in it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because they had put money in your Bible?
Speaker 2: Yeah. That's right.
Speaker 1: And, you, you really hadn't found the money.
Speaker 2: I hadn't, I hadn't found it.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was your church affiliation in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: When I grew up, I went to a church called Abyssin- Abyssinian [Abyssinian Baptist Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Abyssinian (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, this was the family church or--?
Speaker 2: Yes. Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Did the family go every Sunday as a family?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, church was, was a big part.  And, my mom [Shirley White Coney] had sang in the choir or x amount of years.  Even my dad [Homer Coney, Sr.] sing in the choir in the later years.
Speaker 1: And, what did you do in the church?
Speaker 2: I didn't sing in the choir unfortunately.  None of the kids, it's funny, none of us really sang.  I mean, they had to, they had to take us kicking and screaming really.  But, but we would go.  I mean, we would go.  So, I actually did not participate from a choir standpoint, in the choir.  My mother had a very beautiful (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or, in any, any of the, any of the programs?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  We would do like a lot of the teen programs.  I mean, I don't say a lot of it.  But, we would certainly do like the camp.  Like the church always had a summer camp, so I would be a part of that.  But, my mother had a very beautiful voice, so she sang naturally.  And, my dad decided to sing down the road, just because he, you know, he just wanted to do it.
Speaker 1: You said the name of the church was Abyssinia?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Abyssinian.
Speaker 1: Abyssinian.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Abyssinian.
Speaker 1: Who was the pastor?
Speaker 2: And, you know, what, it's been so long ago, I have to think about that.  Let me think about that one.  But, I can't recall who the, who the pastor, I can't think of his name.
Speaker 1: Where was that located?
Speaker 2: In, in, the current address would be on Germantown Avenue, say, I would say like, Pulaski [sic.] and Germantown.  But, when we started out going there it was actually at a different location.
Speaker 1: And, do you remember the years that you went there?
Speaker 2: I would just say all my life, really.
Speaker 1: All your life.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, all my life, yeah, yeah.  I mean even (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your grandparents went their too?
Speaker 2: When I got back, even when we go back now; not so much now that my father died and now my mother is older and can't always go.  But, we used to, you know, even since I've been in Chicago [Illinois] when I come home, if I was home on a Sunday, that's where we would go.
Speaker 1: Do you still have relationships with some of the people that you grew up with or that attended church with you in your youth?
Speaker 2: My, my parents do.  I have very limited relationships with, with a lot of people.  I mean, I still know a lot of people from Philly, I don't wanna say a lot.  But, you have to remember, when I graduated from high school [Frankford High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I moved on--I immediately moved to Chicago.  And, so, you know, I got some buddies who I, you know, there's probably a group of twenty that I see as often as I can.  But, no.  At church, you know, not a lot of, not a lot of--like I remember the Beverly [ph.] family, you know.  I remember, you know, but it was more so my mom and dad's friends, you know, that I, that I remember.  And, then we would tend to know their kids as a result of their parents, if you will.

Speaker 1: Back at George Williams [George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois] opening that Bible what did you (laughter) think?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember having--I think, I think when I did open it, I think that was when I, when I actually went out and bought my, my wife [Dawn Worthy Coney], my girlfriend at that time, an engagement ring.  I think that's what I ended up doing with the money.
Speaker 1: Was this in your, still in your first year?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, this would've been--it took me a couple years before I read the Bible (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, it took you a couple of years to read (laughter).
Speaker 2: It took a couple, a couple of year to read that Bible.  But, I remember--
Speaker 1: And, your mom [Shirley White Coney] would always say?
Speaker 2: She would always say, you know, "Are you reading the Bible?  Are you reading the Bible?"
Speaker 1: But, she'd never tell you?
Speaker 2: Never told me, yeah, yeah.  And I, and it was the other thing too that remember--
Speaker 1: I'm just curious--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember was, was all the money in one chapter?
Speaker 2: You know what, I wanna say, I thought it was, to be honest with you.  It, you know, and it may not have been.  No, it may not have been.  But, I think what happened when I found one, I just opened, you know, I just--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) looking (laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, and I think I found--so, it may not all been on one page.  But, but, I got it all at the same time 'cause I went through it.  I wasn't like saying, "Oh, I'm gonna take this one today and let me wait until times get tough again, I'll read a little more."  No.  I, I went through that whole--
Speaker 1: So, did you call her and tell her?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I told her, I said, "Hey," you know, "thanks for the money."  She said, "Oh, you read your Bible, huh?"
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, so--
Speaker 1: Sounds like a very wise woman.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so that was really, that was a nice, that was nice treat.
Story_ID: 532172
Speaker 1: So, describe your first year at George Williams [George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois].
Speaker 2: It was a really, a wonderful experience.  Because it was, you know, George Williams was a very small liberal arts school.  And, what was interesting to me was I remember going--I played basketball for George Williams, and I remember walking to the gym.  And, this was, you know, first couple of weeks everybody trying to get to know everyone.  And, I remember this one woman [Coney's ex-wife, Dawn Worthy Coney], you know, yelling out the window of the dorm saying hi to me, you know, and she was the talk of the campus.  Everyone just thought she was the prettiest woman of all, of all time.  And, I remember the very first time I saw her, I said, "Boy, if I could ever marry a woman like that."  And--
Story_ID: 532173
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it's funny I was on my way to, to, to the gym one day and this, this young lady said hi to me out the window.  And, you know, I said, "Boy," you know, when I went over to the gym I told a couple guys on the team, I said, "Man, I just saw this beautiful woman."  And, when I went to describe her, they immediately knew who she was 'cause everybody had, had, had picked up on, you know, you know, on this woman.  'Cause you know, somebody come on campus [of George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois], everybody knows who the pretty girl is.  So, having said that, I just said to myself, "Man, if I could ever, you know, get to know a woman like that, I would marry sight unseen," you know.  But, I knew, 'cause I knew that was never gonna, you know, she was smart, bright, you know, articulate, you know, and cheerleader.  I mean, she had everything going for her.  So, anyway, having said that, somehow, because of me playing sports and her being with the cheerleading background, she was a big basketball fan.  She, she and I, we got to know one another and we got engaged our junior year in college, and then we got married right out of college.  So, and, then she's the mother of both my kids, our kids.
Speaker 2: Where was she from?
Speaker 1: She was from Chicago [Illinois].  Went to Lindblom High School [Robert Lindblom Technical High School; Robert Lindblom Math and Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois], grew up in Chatham [Chicago, Illinois].  Still lives in Chatham now.  We, we, we lived in, we lived downtown together for about five years, then we lived in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] for about fifteen years before we went through a divorce and then she moved to Chatham and I moved downtown.
Speaker 2: So, going back to those early years in college when you first met her.  You were a rising star as an athlete.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And, she was someone that everyone wanted to get to know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, how did that relationship develop?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I, okay, say it one more time.  All right, so I was, I was in college--I got distracted for a second.
Speaker 2: You were--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A rising athlete--
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, right.
Speaker 2: She was someone you should know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: On campus.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: So, now the two of you come together.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, how was that?
Speaker 1: Well, a couple things, number one, my, my, my ex-wife, Dawn [Dawn Worthy Coney], she came to school really a very young age.  She was only sixteen, I wanna say back then because, she had skipped two grades during her elementary or--years.  So, she came in around sixteen years old and obviously I was eighteen.  So, that in itself was impressive because she was such a young, young, lady.  And, had she been probably a little older, a little smarter, she probably would've never married me.  But (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But, she actually, you know--and then for me, you know, I was, you know, I won't say star athlete, but we, you know, I was an athlete and I actually made the all fresh- the all-conference team as a freshman and Jack Sikma had made, made the all freshmen, I mean, the all-conference team--
Speaker 2: And, Jack Sikma is?
Speaker 1: And, Jack Sikma plays NBA [National Basketball Association] for the Seattle SuperSonics [Oklahoma City Thunder] at Illinois Wesleyan [Illinois Wesleyan University, Bloomington, Illinois].  Which I always--my son [Javon Coney] played a basketball game there just a couple weeks ago.  And, I was telling him the story about Jack Sikma and he got a chance to see this uniform in the, in the case.  So, it's funny how those things come back, come, come together down the road.
Speaker 2: So, your wife was a Chicago girl?
Speaker 1: She's definitely a Chicago girl.
Speaker 2: And, you would come back--
Speaker 1: She was Miss Teen, Miss Teen Chicago.  She was a Chicago Honey Bear for those who don't recall, that was the, back then, the Bears [Chicago Bears] had cheerleaders for their football team.  Still don't understand why they don't anymore.  But, that's a whole 'nother conversation.
Story_ID: 532174
Speaker 1: What do you feel that in those early years--I don't wanna talk about before you got married; I mean, I wanna talk about before you got married.  During that time, what did she bring to the relationship that you had never had?  In terms of exposure, or--
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, my wife [Coney's ex-wife, Dawn Worthy Coney] actually brought, really a lot of things to the relationship.  Because one, and again, this is no offence to my upbringing which was very rich, but, she brought sort of ev- you know, a lot of who I am today to the relationship.  I remember, I'm embarrassed to say, but I remember going to the first time going out to a formal restaurant, if you will.  It was, the name of it, I will never forget was called, Henr- Henrici's.  And, you probably need to be an old timer in Chicago [Illinois] to know that name.  But Henrici's was a very, you know, it was considered a--well, I'm saying nice, some people might think back and say, "Wait a minute, that wasn't nice."  But, to me, that was, back then that was a nice restaurant.  And, then her parents [Lucille Worthy and Curtis Worthy] would come up on the weekends and we would then, the four of us would go out to dinner, with her little brother Shawn [Shawn Worthy].  Little, but he's now, lives in--married, and has a couple kids and lives in Colorado.  But, he would, he would come up and we would go to dinner.  And, so, that was something that we didn't do, I mean, when I was growing up, you know.  Our weekends meant we might go to the barbeque place, or the pizza place and bring home food, and that what we did on a Friday or Saturday night.
Speaker 1: But, you never went out to formal dinners--
Speaker 2: We, we never--
Speaker 1: Or to a restaurant?
Speaker 2: I cannot--my mother [Shirley White Coney] would probably kill me and say, "Oh, no, don't you remember when we did--?" I don't--I can't remember one time going out to any restaurant.  Other than we went on, when we may go on vacation.
Story_ID: 532175
Speaker 1: And, our vacations really were about going--I wa- grew up in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] so our vacations meant going to Atlantic City [New Jersey].  And, Atlantic City is not what it is today.  Atlantic City is this, you know, obviously casino, you know, place where it's wonderful, you know, vi- very vibrant.  Back then, when I was growing up, Atlantic City was really a, an amusement park with, with a beach.  So, we used to--my mother [Shirley White Coney] used to make fried chicken and we would pack it in the cooler with some generic brands of pop in a cooler and we would all pile into our car, my dad's [Homer Coney, Sr.] car, and we would drive to Atlantic City.  Drive around until we found a meter that was open, you know, and then we would lug the cooler to the beach and we would sit up in the sand.  And, my dad would sit in this little lawn chair that he would bring (laughter).  And, we would just sit there.  And, that was our vacation.  We would sit there from like, nine o'clock in the morning, nine or ten o'clock in the morning, 'til where the sun set.  And, then when the sun set, we would ride the amusement rides, 'cause again, it was an amusement park back then.  And, think they still even have it.  I think it's was called Steel Pier [Atlantic City, New Jersey].  So, we would, we would ride at night we would ride on amusement rides.  And, in between we would be eating the fried chicken that we had in the car.  And, then we would either drive home or, if we were really on a good vacation, we might have spent a night that one night.  And, then do it again on Sunday and then come home.
Story_ID: 532176
Speaker 1: S- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, then when you married your wife [Dawn Worthy Coney], or when you all, when you were dating, that was the first time you'd ever really gone out to a restaurant?
Speaker 1: Right.  Yeah, because her, one of the things I've always told, one of the things I've tried to do with my kids [Chanel Coney and Javon Coney] is that the thing that I learned from my, my, my ex-wife's parents [Lucille Worthy and Curtis Worthy], her family, is they always traveled.  They may al- they may not always was able to fly or whatever.  They would get in the car and they would drive from here to Atlanta [Georgia].  Or, from Atlanta to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], or wherever it was.  Even when they, when it, when it came time to meet my parents [Shirley White Coney and Homer Coney, Sr.], they got in the car and drove to Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  You know, so, and what I found is when they would take these trips, they would stop along the way and they would read, and they would see, and they visit the museum, or whatever it was in that particular area, that's what they did.  And, they did that every year, off and on, whether it was around the holidays or the summertime or whatever.  And, I had saw how much that exposure had given them the opportunity to be who they were.  And, so, the thing that I really wanted to do is I really wanted to, I wanted to do that for my kids.  And, I wanted to travel.  I wanted to expose them.  That was the key.  I always felt like the key to life is exposure which is one of the reasons why I love theatre and we'll talk more about that later.  But, I just felt like the exposure was a key thing for my kids.  And, so, I'm proud and happy to say that they kids' mom and I, we've, my kids have been able to travel all--you know, I mean, they've been to, you know, Italy, you know, Paris [France].  I've been to Barcelona [Spain], Paris; you know, Rome [Italy], Milan [Italy] not to mention, you know, L.A. or New York [New York] or, you know, all the wonderful places here in America.
Story_ID: 532177
Speaker 1: You and your wife [Coney's ex-wife, Dawn Worthy Coney] met in college [George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and, then you got married in what year?
Speaker 2: We got married in 1982.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, you graduated in 1980?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty [1980], two years, right.
Speaker 1: And, she graduated in what year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my wife actually graduated a little later.  And, let me tell you what happened.  Once, I guess I was a bad influence on her.  But, once--she was always a great student.  But, then once we became engaged, our junior year, I think she got a little bit sidetracked with, you know, dating me, keeping up with me, and one thing led to another.  So, she actually took her senior year off, and, and sort of just worked during that year before I graduated and then it was the intent to get married.  But, what happened was when I graduated I actually got a job in Hartford, Connecticut working for Travelers insurance [The Travelers Indemnity Company].  So, actually, we, we relocated in Hartford and she--we were only engaged at that time, so we thought, either I go to Hartford, 'cause I initially was only supposed to go there for eight months.  So, I said, I can go to Hartford and come back, and then we'll get back together again.  Or, we'll just try to maintain our relationship while we're gone.  Or, you know, we can just move our wedding date up and get married and we'll go to Hartford together.  And, that's what--we choose that.  And, I was glad we did because we were young.  Even though Hartford doesn't seems that far away today to me.  Back then, it would've been, you know, it was like I could just fly home on the weekends and say, "Hey, what's happening?"  You know, so, the odds were very slim, I think.  The odds would've been against us, you know, to, to have continued on.
Story_ID: 532178
Speaker 1: I wanna just talk about your college years [at George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois] just a little bit more (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You--did you play basketball all four years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't play all four years.  So, as my daughter--as my wife [Coney's ex-wife, Dawn Worthy Coney], as she took that year off from school, I actually stopped, stopped playing ball because, you know, I was gonna get married then, and I start feeling the responsibility of getting married.  And, so, I worked full-time.  And, well, I don't say full-time, but I worked and--
Speaker 1: Worked.  Well, what did you do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) back, back then, it was there was the mall called Yorktown Shopping Center [Yorktown Center, Lombard, Illinois].  And, I think Yorktown Shopping Center is still there.  And, I actually, there was a Montgomery Wards [Montgomery Ward], this was back when gas stations still had people pumping the gas.  So--
Speaker 1: And, this would've been about 1978, '79 [1979]?
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  And, so, I actually pumped gas at the, at the gas stations.  And, I enjoyed it.  It was actually one of my fun jobs in my life.  And, when I was growing up in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I was known most in the community because I worked for a pizza delivery service, called Pamela Pizza [ph.].  And, I used to--I'll never forget, my dad [Homer Coney, Sr.] had a Monte Carlo [Chevrolet Monte Carlo], a gray Monte Carlo, which was beautiful car back then.  And, my mom [Shirley White Coney] had a Pinto [Ford Pinto], which was this real little small car.  I don't even think they make them anymore but I used to, my mom used to let me drive that car around the neighborhood delivering pizza.  And, that's what I did probably my, my junior and senior year--
Speaker 1: Of high school [Frankford High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Of high school.  So, in college I then was working at the gas, at the gas station.  I did that for a little bit.  I also worked at, believe it or not, I was a model at a clothing store in the mall called J Riggins.  And, again, you have to go way back.  I don't even think J Riggins is around anymore.  But, it was a cloth- a men's clothing store.
Speaker 1: Now, when you say you were a model, did you model in the store (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  In the store.
Speaker 1: --or, did you go out?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, it was in the store.  So, what they used to do every Friday, I think it was like on Friday night, they would have some local student come in and model whatever their new clothes were.  And, again, that was back in my days when I was playing sports.  I was in great shape.  So, I used to go out and model.  And, that was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: So, people would come in and say, "I'm interested in this particular suit."
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: And, so, he say, "Coney [HistoryMaker Lester "Les" N. Coney], put on that suit" (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  And that, and so, what they do is--well, actually, back then I used to wear--'cause it was more a jean, shirt type, jean, shirt type place.
Story_ID: 532179
Speaker 1: And, I never, and I never forget, my wife doesn't even remember this story, and I'm probably embarrassed to even say it.  Because I want people to think of me as an outstanding individual, but--
Speaker 2: And, you are.
Speaker 1: --(laughter) but, I remember when I was in, in college, my wife was there and I was modeling, you know, you're in a mall, so you meet a lot of people.  And, if you're modeling, you know, the girls always liked us, you know.  So, I remember this one girl who, you know, would always come up every Friday, to see what I was modeling.  And, so, one day, you know, we exchanged numbers and, I don't even know if exchanged numbers at that time, because I certainly didn't have a cell phone.  But, somehow we've--it was a way where were we com- we had a chance to commun- it might have been, been as simple as, well, you know, I go to George Williams [George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois], you wanna come over, you know, that's fine.  So, she came one day, here this woman, I remember one of the kids on campus saying, "Hey, it's--" this girl's name, and I don't even remember her name, "is here to see you."  And, if you weren't going to school there, you were easily recognizable by people.  And, I think she went to college to some other local college near.  But, she, but she was driving.  And, I'll never forget because she--I looked out the window and I saw this little red, you know, whatever, I think it was K-car back then, they used to have the K-car.  So, she came up and I said, "Man, I really shouldn't be doing this."  And, she came up to the room.  And, somehow in that split second the word got around campus that Les Coney [HistoryMaker Lester "Les" N. Coney] had this girl up in his room.  And, so, I'd never forget, my wife came out, well she wasn't my wife then, we weren't even engaged.  Dawn [Coney's ex-wife, Dawn Worthy Coney] came up to the room and she knocked on the door and said, "Hey, Les this Dawn," you know, and I, and I kind of hid this girl in the clo- in the, in the closet.  But anyway, she never came in.  She never found out.  She never knew about it.  Somehow I just acted like I wasn't in the room.  So, finally, eventually walked away.  And, then the girl, you know, I told the girl she had to leave.  And, she left.  And, I never saw her again.  But, I never cheated ever, I mean, ever, you know, and that wasn't even really cheating.  But, probably give me another hour, it probably would've been chea- (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But, I never, from that day on, you know, even all the years of being married, you know, I've always, I never forgot that.  And, I just--the feeling that I had during that period of having her knock on the door, as somebody who I loved and who meant everything to me.  And, I said, you know, I almost threw it away for somebody I don't even--I mean, I couldn't even tell you, you know, her full name, you know.  So, I said, "I'm never gonna do that again."
Story_ID: 532180
Speaker 1: What does marriage mean to you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know. Well, marriage meant a lot to me.  It's funny I--you know, it's funny, I have my friends come over now and they even tell me, when I first went through the divorce how--first of all, it took me six months before I even told people.  So, I'd never forget, I was working at Travelers insurance [The Travelers Indemnity Company], and one--it pays, I would say this is a lesson really for, particular for all African Americans, all minorities.  I was the kind of guy who, not only did I try to know the people who were my peers, but I even liked to know the people in the mail room, you know, whether they're black or white.  And, so this one black guy who worked in our mailroom, who, you know, I would take to lunch every now and then.  Just because he was a nice guy.  He, when I was going through a divorce, the State of Illinois had, I guess sent some letter to my office.  Because I guess, when you go through divorce they were going to, you know, garnish your wages or whatever the case may be.  They have to pull child support out of your check, I think that's what it was.  So, it was som- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, this was what year?
Speaker 2: So, this would've been, I mean, hell, within ten years, maybe ten years because I've been divorced, what, eight or, eight years now.  So, it would've had to been like eight years ago.  Somewhere in that range.  So, we're not talking--
Speaker 1: Ninety-eight [1998].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, maybe, maybe more than ten, 'cause I wasn't at Aon [Aon Corporation; Aon plc], I would've still been at Travelers.  So, it would've been at least ten years ago.  So, I remember this guy Tony [ph.], from the mailroom, come to my office.  He said, "Hey, Les [HistoryMaker Lester "Les" N. Coney], I found this just lying open sitting in the office and you might wanna take a look at it."  And, so, I looked at it and it was a letter from the State of Illinois.  Saying, "Hey, you know, we understand you're going through a divorce.  We need to speak to your--."  It was actually a letter not to me.  It was a letter to our HR [human resources] department.  So, anyway, to make a long story short, the bottom line was, it took, you ask me how it felt, you know, what marriage meant to me, and my point is, I was so embarrassed about going through a divorce that I couldn't even tell the folks at my, at my company and that I had--that I was going through a divorce.  I felt like that was, even though 50 percent of marriages, you hear all the stories, 50 percent of marriages end in divorce and blah, blah, blah, you know.  But, I, I just really--because I think of my mother [Shirley White Coney] and father [Homer Coney, Sr.].  They were married like thirty-five years before my father died.  And, I said, "Hell, if they can be married thirty, how can I not," you know?  And, the fact of the matter is I still love my wife [Dawn Worthy Coney].  We have our ups and down, like any other couple.  But, anyway, so, we, so, it took me a while to, to come to grips with that.  And, so, then, you know, after that happened, you know, I kind of, then it gradually would come out in the office.  And, then, I realized, I put more pressure on that than, than, it really was, you know, than it was really necessary.  But, then, then my friends, and I remember because my wife and I we went through divorce, I remember it was right before Thanksgiving.  Because that was the, the tough--I think that was the toughest holiday of my life.  And, even now, Thanksgiving is always a little tough for me.  Because, I think back to, you know, here's a person that's always, every year, Thanksgiving either with my wife or my kids [Chanel Coney and Javon Coney] or whatever.  And, then this was the first Thanksgiving, you know, being alone.  And, it was, that was, you know, that was, that was a, that was a tough time, so.
Story_ID: 532181
Speaker 1: Anyway, but then thirty days later, I remember two of our closest friends was Andre [Andre Rice] and [HistoryMaker] Linda Johnson Rice.  And, Andre had called me right before Christmas and he, we went to the Monroe Club.  And, the Monroe Club is no longer here but it used to be in the Harris Bank Building [Chicago, Illinois].  And, he says, "Hey, man, you know, I just want to let you know Linda and I we're go- we're gonna go through a divorce."  And, I was like floored.  Because they were our best, I mean, they were two of our best friends.  I always, it's well documented that I always credit Linda and Andre for a lot of the people who I know today; I know because of them, whether it's, you know, John Rogers [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.] or, you know, [HistoryMaker] Desiree Rogers, [HistoryMaker] Valerie Jarrett, or you know, Juanita Jordan [Juanita Vanoy Jordan], you know.  These are all people who knew Linda, who I then got to know because of my association through her.  So, when they told me they were going through div- I mean, I was like, I couldn't believe it.  So, anyway, we both were going--so, for years later, I might--people always say, "Oh, well, how long you been divorced?"  And, I might say, "Oh, I've been divorced four years."  And, Andre would always, if he was anywhere around he'd say, "Man, you need to stop saying four, that was seven years ago."  So, you know, but, it's hard to always, after a while, it's not like you're trying to lie, but it's just those years, you know, they come and go--
Speaker 2: They do.
Speaker 1: --and, you don't, you don't really know actually when it was.
Story_ID: 532182
Speaker 1: So, but, when I went through a divorce, I was dead set on getting married again.  I mean, I was like, I had my radar up and I was ready to do it again because I love marriage.  I mean, I love--but, then after I had a year or two of being singled, you know, it was, you know, it changed (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: It changed just a little.
Speaker 2: What do you think that's all about (laughter)?
Speaker 1: It changed, it just changed just a little.  And, I hate to say it 'cause that makes it seem like you just wanna--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, just from the standpoint of just the freedom that, I mean, and not even just freedom 'cause I don't wanna sound like, you know, my wife [Coney's ex-wife, Dawn Worthy Coney] had just, like, a cage around me.  But, clearly, you know, when I went through a divorce, my career just really went like that (gesture) because I had more time to, to one, devote to it, because I wasn't getting--I remember being at the office and it was nothing for my wife to call me at 4:30, 5:00, "Hey, you know, I can't complete dinner."  And, she always used to give me something to stop and get on the way home 'cause that always made me come home right away.  Because if she say, "I can't complete dinner without milk," I know I got my kids [Chanel Coney and Javon Coney] at home.  So, hell, I need to go home because she waiting with the milk, versus just saying, "Hey, when you coming home?"  You know.  Which was interesting because I--her parents, my wife, my in-laws, her mother was a teacher in the Chicago public school system [Chicago Public Schools] for years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, what was her name?
Speaker 1: And, her name was Lucille Dobbins.  I mean, Lu- I mean, Lu- not Lucille Dobbins.  Lucille Dobbins would laugh that I said that.  Lucille Worthy.  Lucille Worthy was her name.  And, Lucille Dobbins does exist, she's just an old time friend of mine (laughter).  But, but, Lucille, those the only two Lucilles I know.  Lucille Worthy and she just passed maybe a couple of years ago of cancer.  But--
Speaker 2: And, her father's name?
Speaker 1: And, her father name was Curtis Worthy who just died a couple months ago.  And, he just, you know, both of them was just--you hear all these stories about in-laws but my in-laws were, were the best.  I mean, I had no complaints there.  I mean, they were all, all good.  So, you know, but, but the reason I brought them up mainly was, you know, my wife grew up in a family where the mother was a teacher.  So she was home at 3:30 or 4:00 o'clock.  The father was janitor at a school.  So, he was home 3:30 or 4:00 o'clock.  They both were home during, during the holidays and all summer and all that.  And, I was a businessman.  So, for my wife, that was something that she had not been experienced to.  And, even though she might laugh hearing that, but a lot of times, we don't necessary know how to react to certain things.  So, when I was, here I was a businessman, where it wasn't that simple for me to come home at 4:30 or 5:00.  I might come home 6:30 or 7:00 or 8:00.  Or, I might need to go to dinner with So and So, whatever it was.  And, that was something that my wife wasn't used to; that was weird to her.  She was like, "Well, wait a minute, you know, it's five o'clock, what are you doing?"  You know, that kind of thing.  And, and so, that was always a challenge.
Story_ID: 532183
Speaker 1: We, kind of jumped a little bit before the wedding (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, okay (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We missed the wedding and--
Speaker 2: We missed the--we already talked about the divorce [from Dawn Worthy Coney] and we didn't even talk about the wedding.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got to the divorce and not even the wedding--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, well--
Speaker 1: Or, the graduation.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, I just wanna, just go back a little--
Speaker 2: I'll summarize that a little bit.
Speaker 1: --bit to your, your years at George Williams [George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois] and you received a bachelor's [degree] in?
Speaker 2: A Bachelors of Arts.
Speaker 1: A Bachelors of Art.  And, what was your major?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I actually, as I mentioned earlier, George Williams was primarily known for their work on developing sort of the top people in the Boys Club [Boys Clubs of America; Boys and Girls Clubs of America] and YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  And, as I told you before, for me, I had no intentions of going to college.  It was by accident, if you will, after I won that award.
Speaker 1: What was it like in your family with your parents [Shirley White Coney and Homer Coney, Sr.]--?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was big time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and your siblings when you graduated?
Speaker 2: It was, it was big time.  And, but, my dad, I must tell you, he was saying, "Hell, why you, you know, why you gotta go to college?  I got this job sitting right here waiting for you," you know, so, it wasn't--
Speaker 1: And, your brother [Homer Coney, Jr.] was working--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and my brother was al- was working--
Speaker 1: --in that business.
Speaker 2: Yes.  My brother was working with him.
Speaker 1: So, did they all come to your graduation?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  No, they actually did.
Story_ID: 532184
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, they all piled in the van and, and, and drove out for the wedding.  It was two times my parents [Shirley White Coney and Homer Coney, Sr.] had a chance to come here to Chicago [Illinois].  Once was for the graduation [from George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois] and the second was from--for the, for the wedding.  One for the wedding and graduation, so.  And, one of those times they flew.  I think it was the, yeah, I'm sure it was the wedding is when they flew out.
Speaker 2: Which may have been their first time on the plane (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, it was their first time on a plane.  I was gonna say that; their first time on a plane.
Speaker 2: And, how old were you when you had your first time on a plane.
Speaker 1: Well, the first time I flew was when I was in college.  So, it would've been like my sophomore, junior year.  I was able to fly home.  And, and it interesting about flying because my parents always talk about not flying.  But, I think, back then, I'm not saying now, but back then, or maybe I would even say now for certain African Americans, it's this perception of flying as to, "Oh, man, that's thousands of dollars to get on a plane."  Whereas, you know, hell, I, I mean, I get on--I fly cheaper than I stay at a hotel now, you know, sometimes.  And, so, it's really not what, or if you call Greyhound [Greyhound Lines, Inc.] or Amtrak [National Railroad Passenger Corporation], I would argue that you can see fares very similar, so.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I think, again, it's just a matter of the perception of what things cost.  But, it was the first time my parents had ever flown which was, which was quite, quite interesting.  And, when the Coneys came through, we turned, turned the city out (laughter).  But, but I had my brother [Homer Coney, Jr.] and sisters [Celestine Ray and Nicole Coney], everyone came out for it.  And, I was very happy.  My best friend from high school [Frankford High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Charles Johnson [ph.], he came out as well.  We called him Feet [ph.].  He's a good friend; family friend.  As a matter of fact, I just saw, when I was down digging in the, in my, in the basement getting some old stuff, we found a letter that Charles, my friend Charles had written me when he was in college--when I was away in Chicago, in college.  And, it was just, "Hey, man, how you doing?"  Blah, blah, blah, 'cause this was prior to cell phones and emails and all that kind of stuff.  And, somehow we saved it.  And, I, so I was--when I showed him that, he couldn't believe it.  I said, "Man, what's this all about?  You writing me a letter.  I, mean, who does that?"  You know, so we laughed, we had a good, we had a good laugh about that.
Speaker 2: Did he graduate college?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  He went to Delaware State [Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, he graduated from there.
Story_ID: 532185
Speaker 1: How many of your friends that you went to high school with went on to graduate from college?
Speaker 2: You know, that's a good question.  I mean, when you talk about high school, because I left Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --I really didn't keep in touch with a ton of them.  But, I would say a good chunk.  Because I actually went to, I went to a high school in Philadelphia, which was then, it was rated the number one co-ed high school in the city.  Central High [Central High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was ranked number one, which is all boys.  Girls' High [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was ranked, number, I don't wanna say number two, but they both were the top ranked schools.  But, they were all-boys or all-girls.  And, and Frankford [Frankford High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was this co-ed school which was all the way out in northeast.  So, I used to go forty-five minutes to an hour out of my community where I live.  But, the reason how I got a chance to go and, again, this--I'm just giving you the true story but I just hate to, you know, mention some of this but it is the history as it was.  When I was at Harding [Warren G. Harding Junior High School; Warren G. Harding Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] because I was an athlete my, one of my best friends was a gentleman by the name of George Benson [ph.]; he allowed me to use his address as if I was living with him, to get into Frankford High.  Because back then, you could only go to your school in your, you know, in your community.  'Cause otherwise they would have every kid trying to go to this school.  And, so, that's how I had a chance to get a leg up and, and go to this fine school.  And, and I went, and that's, that's how--it's funny when you look at my yearbook, it says, you know even now, I said, "Well, wait a minute, I never lived there," and then I remember (laughter).
Story_ID: 532186
Speaker 1: You graduated with a B.A. with a concentration in what?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I, okay, business administration is what I, what I majored in [at George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois], and I had a minor in mathematics.  And, the reason why I wanted a degree in business administration because it was my goal to go work at, you know, if I was gonna work in a YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] or Boys Club [Boys Clubs of America; Boys and Girls Clubs of America], I wanted to work on administrative level, because the guy who was my mentor, he ran the boys club [Nicetown Boys Club; Shane Victorino Nicetown Boys and Girls Club] in, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  So, I said, "Okay.  I will do that."  But, I didn't wanna be the guy working in the gym throwing out the basketball, you know, that kind of thing.  Although that's a respectable, you know, profession.  It's just something I didn't wanna, I didn't wanna do.
Story_ID: 532187
Speaker 1: So you graduated in 1980 with a B.A.--?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Bachelors of Arts (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Bachelors of Arts with a minor in math.  You didn't tell me about your math abilities.
Speaker 2: Well, you know math always had been my, my fajor- favorite subject.  And, I'll tell you what my game plan was.  I've always enjoyed sports, so my, my game, excuse me, my game plan was to move, to go into the school system as a teacher and but really just going in just so I could coach.  And, so, even though I talked about graduating and moving to Hartford, Connecticut working for Travelers [The Travelers Indemnity Company], there was a short stint in between that period where I worked at a private school in South Shore [Chicago, Illinois] called Potential [Potential School for Exceptional Children].  There was a young lady who's, her name--
Speaker 1: Now, now I need to know--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --what year that was.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That would've been right out of school [George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois].  So, that would've been--
Speaker 1: Right out, right--in 1980?
Speaker 2: So, that would've been--
Speaker 1: As soon as you graduated?
Speaker 2: That would've been, yeah, 1980.  'Cause here's what happened.  Because I was now engaged, the summer before, the summer before I graduated, I took a classes during the summer, just so I could stay in Chicago [Illinois] to be near my wife [Coney's ex-wife, Dawn Worthy Coney], my fiance.  And, so, as a result, my senior year, I only had to take a couple of classes and that, that's why I started working almost full-time.  Because I, you know, I had free time, and I wasn't playing ball anymore.  But, right after I graduated, my wife's parents were very close to a woman by the name of Dr. Ramona Fogerty and she ran a school on--in South Shore called Potential.  And, it was really for, you know, I don't wanna say special needs kids, but just children who weren't making it for any--for various reasons in the Chicago public school system [Chicago Public Schools] and they were going there.  And, I always remember Lu Palmer son, Stanford [Stanford English].  I'd never forget Stanford was one of my students.  And, that's how I got into Pal- the Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II] family, they were just wonderful; very wonderful people.  They used to have this home over on Forsyth [ph.] where we used to--that used to be what I did.  I worked at the school and helped with the kids, and--
Speaker 1: Do you remember where the school was located?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was right at 72nd [Street] and Exchange [Avenue].  Yeah, that I remember like it was yesterday.  And, I'd tell you who else, not only did I, did I teach Stanford, you know, the Palmers' son.  But, also Tom Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell] who owns Burrell Advertising [Burrell Communications Group], his mother, was my, was the, was the head cook for--and, it was--
Speaker 1: And, her name was (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ev- Evelyn [Evelyn Kendall Burrell].
Speaker 1: Evelyn.
Speaker 2: Evelyn.  And, and I always, and she used to be my bes- I mean, one of my closest friends.  And, she--and that's how I really got to know Tom.  And, I always admired Tom because this woman clearly didn't need to work.  But, she stayed in her home where she lived all her life, I guess, on the--in Chatham [Chicago, Illinois].  Not, that it was a bad home, but it was in Chatham.  And, she always had--every year she had a brand new Cadillac.  And, Tom used to get--every year.  And, and that's--she said, "You know what, I don't ask my son for anything, but that Cadillac."  And, she said, like clockwork.  And, I remember it used to always be yellow.  And, it was the prettiest thing you ever seen.  So, you go to the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] to this school and all you saw was this beautiful yellow Cadillac sitting out there.  And, that was Miss, Miss Burrell.  And, she was sharp.  I mean, sharp woman, you know, she--but, sharp, very nice.  And, she'd come in the school and she cooks.  This is what she did; every day.  And, so, that was--
Speaker 1: So, you worked at Potential for how long?
Speaker 2: For probably a year and a half.  And, and what happened, I got that job because of my wife and because of her parents.  Her mother, my mother-in-law, Lucille Worthy was best friends with Ramona Fogerty, Dr. Ramona Fogerty.  Who every now and then, she would call me and say, "Hi."  But, she's very, was a very, very good friend of the family. She (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, is this school still there?
Speaker 2: It's not.  Yeah, unfortunately, it's not.
Story_ID: 532188
Speaker 1: Anyway, so after a year and a half working there, when you work in the school system, you get the summers off.  I mean, you get the summers off of course, but, you get the holidays off around Christmas.  And, I had just graduated from high school, and, I mean, from college [George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois], and when I had that, that month off, I didn't have any children so I said, "I should do something."  So, I went down to Marshall Field's [Marshall Field and Company] and got a part-time job during the holiday 'cause they're hiring people during that time because that's their busy season.  And, I worked in the Fields Afar section, which is what it was called.  Most people probably don't know what it is.  But, it was this little section which sold stuff that was five thousand [dollars] or more.  But, it's unusual stuff.  So, you might buy and little, a little, you know a knickknack that--a little music box.  But, that little music box might've been three thousand dollars.  So, I was the sales guy in that, in that department.  So, while I was in there, I met a guy who, who's still one of my closest friends today.  His name is Anthony George.  And, he now lives in Baltimore [Maryland].  But, Anthony was also a--he worked to GM [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company], but he--no, he worked for Travelers insurance [The Travelers Indemnity Company].  But, because he was new to Chicago [Illinois] from Detroit [Michigan], he just worked there just as a way of making more, more money.  And, he was head of HR [human resources] for Travelers insurance.  And, he said to me, as we got to know each other, he said, "You know, Les [HistoryMaker Lester "Les" N. Coney], you should think about coming to work for the insurance company."  And, the first thing I said to him, I said, "No way, I'm gonna work for insurance company."  I said, "You know, insurance company, I mean, I'm not gonna be a door to door sal- I don't wanna sell anyone life insurance or auto insurance."  And, because that was my experience growing up, was the insurance guy coming to the house, collecting the five dollars and, you know.  And, I said no way, I was gonna do that.  But, he said to me, he said, "Well, you know, Les, I'm not actually sure what all it is, but it's not quite what--like that."  So, he said, "Just come in or interviews."  I said, "What the hell."  The only reason why I came in for the interview is because they were gonna fly me to Hartford, Connecticut which was back then, Hartford was the insurance capital of the world.  So, they would fly me to Hartford for an interview.  I said, "Well, hell, I get a chance to fly to Hartford, and stay in a hotel."  I mean, you have to remember, this was twenty-five years ago.  That was--I was big time.  I remember calling my parents saying, "Mom [Shirley White Coney], I'm going--," you know, "mom and dad [Homer Coney, Sr.], I'm going to Hartford."  You know, like that.  And, so, and I thought I was saying something.  Anyway, but, I went, interviewed, found out it was--had nothing to do with life insurance, it was corporate insurance, and you know, and I took the job.  But, I never for--I remember that letter.  I still have the letter.  I got a letter from Travelers insurance saying, "We like to hire you with the salary of sixteen thousand five hundred dollars."  And, I told my, I told my parents, I said, "Can you believe, I'm gonna be making twelve hundred dollars a month."
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And, I just really thought I was the man, you know.  And, and, then they gave me a company car.  And, I remember it was a Citation [Chevrolet Citation], which I don't think they have anymore.  But, it was one of the--falls under that K-car, and it was silver.  And, I remember my wife and I, we, when we got that car.  We just got in it and we would drive all the way up into Evanston [Illinois], up and along Sheridan Road, you know, during the holidays with the lights and all.  We weren't going anywhere, but just driving.  We had gas money and that was it.  And, then we used to stop at this little hamburger place called Homer's [Homer's Restaurant and Ice Cream, Wilmette, Illinois], you know, named after my dad.  But, up on Green Bay Road, which is still there.  And, we, and that's what we, you know, we used to do.  And, so, that was, that was a great, that was a great and unusual time.
Speaker 2: So, your first--I wanna make sure I have this correct; your first job after graduation was--
Speaker 1: Potential (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) at the Potential School [Potential School for Exceptional Children, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, then you worked part-time at Marshall Field's?
Speaker 1: Right, in a Field Afar.
Speaker 2: And, from my--in Fields Afar.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, it was from Marshall Fields that you went to Travelers?
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.  I met the head of HR for Travelers insurance, and he offered me a job, and then I quit working at the school and moved to Hartford, Connecticut.
Speaker 2: And, what year was that?
Speaker 1: So, that would've been in '82 [1982], because I got, remember we were gonna get married but we didn't have a date.  So, when I told m- Dawn [Coney's ex-wife, Dawn Worthy Coney], my fiance about it, we said, "Well, let's move the wedding up."  We got married that summer in June, June 26, 1982.  And, then we moved right to Hartford, Connecticut in July.
Story_ID: 532189
Speaker 1: Tell me about your experience at Travelers [The Travelers Indemnity Company].
Speaker 2: Well, when I moved to Hartford [Connecticut], it was great.  Because, one, it was a new city, new environment, I was now married.  But, it was unusual because most of the people who, who had just started at Travelers were not married.  They were mostly--I think, I was one of maybe, it was thirty--every year they have what's called a training program.  So, I was part of the training program, and so, I think I was one of two individuals that was married (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, you went in as what?  What was your position?
Speaker 2: You know, account exec [executive], account rep [representative].  No, yeah, account rep is what they called us.
Speaker 1: But, your concentration was corporate clients?
Speaker 2: Corporate insurance, yes.  And, Travelers, at the time, had the number one program.  They had the number one training program in, in the country as far as insurance is concerned.  So, they used to, other insurance companies used to wait for us to come out of training school and they would offer us better jobs.  So, when, even though I was making sixteen-five [sixteen thousand five hundred dollars], you come right out, day one, and be making twenty-four thousand, or twenty-five.  I mean, it was--but, for some reason I just stayed with Travelers.  I really, I really liked the company and I stayed with them.  So, when you go to the schoo- to the program, they ask you to, when you go to graduate, they ask you to pick your top three locations you wanna go.  Because when you accept the job, you accept it knowing that you may not got back to the city you're from.  So, I put down, Chicago [Illinois], Seattle [Washington], and Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  That was the order.  And, I only put down Chicago first because my mo- 'cause my, my wife [Coney's ex-wife, Dawn Worthy Coney], she really wanted to move back home.  And, Seattle I always, to this very day, I think Seattle is the only major city in America that I've never been once.  But, yet, here it is thirty years ago, was the number one city I wanted to move to.
Speaker 1: So, actually, this was a training program--
Speaker 2: Yeah, for the training program (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that you went into in Hartford?  Okay--
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, it about thirty kids and through that, we all get dispersed around the country.
Speaker 1: And, how long was that training program?
Speaker 2: It, I think it was about maybe a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A little under a year.  And, really what was also nice about that training program, it was my first introduction to having contacts all around the United States.  Because all the thirty people went some place different.  So, when I go to New York [New York], I had somebody to call.  Just one person but I had somebody to call.  If I went to Atlanta [Georgia]--so, I had--and, a lot of these people I still talk to this very day.  And, so, it was really nice because you gotta keep in mind, being from Philly and then going to Chicago to George Williams [George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois], I didn't know people in Atlanta, or L.A. [Los Angeles, California], or, you know, people around there. But, it was through that vehicle that I immediately knew individuals that, that was, which was a, a wonderful experience.

Speaker 1: What was the African American population at George Williams [George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: George Williams, the Af- it was probably 25 percent; so it was decent.  And, I remember me and a couple of other guys, we started, we didn't have a fraternity.  We had fraternities but not African American and we started the first African American fraternity there.
Speaker 1: Which was?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was black, black something, something.  But, but, it was never was accredited or anything like that.  It was just on our campus, something we did, and it was, and it was wonderful, and it was a lot of, it was a lotta, it was a lot of fun.  I enjoyed it.  And, a lot of these guys are still some of my closest friends.  I mean, I still talk to all these guys now.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us who a few of them are?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, one of them would be Rodney McKinney who works for the state, DCFS [Department of Children and Family Services], right now, and he's one of my closest friend and was in my, my wedding.  Another gentleman is Willie Pierson [William Pierson].  Willie Pierson works for American Family [American Family Insurance].  Another one, Michael Jackson [ph.], he worked work, I think he's, he's looking right at the moment.  But, he was, he spent a lot of years with, I wanna, I keep wanna say Big Shoulders [Big Shoulders Fund, Chicago, Illinois], but it's not that; I'll think of it, Junior Achievement [Junior Achievement USA].  He spent a lot of years with Junior Achievement and he worked at Chicago State [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].  Perry Gunn, he runs, Leap, Leap to Learn Program [sic. Leap Learning Systems, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].  So, Perry Gunn was also another friend.  Ken Bynum [Kenneth Bynum] who lives in Washington, D.C.  He's a lawyer.  Herman, Herman Wright lives in St. Louis [Missouri]; he's a lawyer.  So, there were a number of guys.  It's funny I don't remember a lot of females though, from school.
Speaker 1: But, you started this, your own fraternity?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we started our own fraternity and it was great.  I mean, we really, I mean, we had our first benefit, if you will.  You know, not a benefit to raise money but just a benefit.  I think I have one of the few pictures I still have of my wife [Coney's ex-wife, Dawn Worthy Coney] and I was from that dinner.  She was all dolled up and I was all clean, you know, as always.  And, you know, and it was the two of us.  So, I still have that, you know, in my little special file when I, when I die, you know, my kids [Chanel Coney and Javon Coney] get that little special file and that's, I think that's the only picture I have in there of my, of my wife and I, so.
Story_ID: 532191
Speaker 1: So, your years with Travelers [The Travelers Indemnity Company], you started out in Hartford [Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, then you went on to be transferred, where?
Speaker 2: I started, and then I actually got my number one choice.  We got sent to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Got sent to Chicago.
Speaker 2: And, Chicago, out the thirty, out of thirty kids, it was the first time, they had sent more than one person to Chica- to one location.  So, it was me and a gentleman, by the name of Dave Gilmett [ph.], who got sent to Chicago.  And, Dave and I we're still--don't see each other that much, but we exchange Christmas Cards every year.  And, now he has a wonderful, it funny when I see the Christmas card, how he has a picture of the family and now they're just grown.  But, I'll tell you an interesting story.  When we were sent to Chicago, it was one of those, you know, a different time for your life, you understand, I don't wanna call it all race related, but certainly income related.  Now, Dave who is a white male, and I was an African American male.  I was married.  He was single.  But, when we came to Chicago, we both making sixteen-five [sixteen thousand five hundred dollars], we both got a company car.  But, his parents gave him twenty thousand dollars to buy a condo [condominium].  And, you know, as a down payment on a condo.  So, where I was sort of scrambling to get an apartment, he, he hit the ground running with property.  And, I always think back to how that was such a leg up on, you know, on my life, and his life.  Now, I don't look back with any regrets 'cause things worked out just fine.  But, I, but, I thought about that and how, how I said, "Wow!  This was a big difference," you know.  And, how, you know, how different people--so, I wanted to position my kids where when they leave college that they gonna be wanting to go off and, you know, move into a condo, with a down payment and immediately start earning equity, you know, versus, you know, just giving the, you know, giving the money away as so many of us have to do initially starting out.  And, not coming through school with loans.
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean, one of the thing I'm very proud of is, you know, I paid my--knock on wood, I'm able to pay for my daughters [Chanel Coney] tuition, and son's [Javon Coney] tuition without having them come out of school with debt.  When I graduated from college [George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois], I made it through, but I had debt.  And, you know, and it takes, it takes time to get through that debt.
Story_ID: 532192
Speaker 1: How many African Americans were in that first training pro- in your training program [with The Travelers Indemnity Company]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In that training program, it was probably out of thirty, it was probably four of us.  One, one of the guys went to New York [New York].  Victor [ph.], another guy, went to St. Louis [Missouri]; another guy, Rick [ph.], lives in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]; and, and I came to Chicago [Illinois].  And, I--
Speaker 1: So, tell me about, what you did here?
Speaker 2: When--once I came?
Speaker 1: And, who was some of your clients were, yeah?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  When I came to Chicago, they said, as an account rep [representative], you're don't, you're not given a territory.  You really work as, with one of the older sales, you know, more seasoned salespeople and helping them close deals.  So, you just travel around with them for a year or two.  And, then, what traditionally happens is as people leave or get transferred to another city, then they start moving you into somebody else's territory.  And, that's how it happened.  And, back in those days, it was pretty clear as to your career path.  So, I was account rep.  So, if I do A, B, C, I was gonna become account exec [executive].  After I do A, B, C, I'm gonna become a senior account exec, you know, so it was those, it was very clear; unless, you screwed up, what you needed to do to grow.  And, you could look around the office and you could point to that account executive.  You could point to the manager.  You could point to the--those days are gone now.  I mean, you know, I try to tell people, you know, you have to create, you know, much of what I'm doing today has been created by me.  Not, not, because somebody said, "Okay.  You're now gonna be account exec."  And, that's the, the sort of the business climate that you're in now.  And, those who try to figure that out early on tend to do a lot better--
Story_ID: 532193
Speaker 1: Back then, you were shadowing--
Speaker 2: Other individuals (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) so to speak, someone else?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, there--they were, their clientele was primarily corporate clients?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was that like for you as an African American man?
Speaker 2: Well, two things--
Speaker 1: That should've been a whole new--
Speaker 2: A whole new experience.
Speaker 1: --experience.
Speaker 2: Without question, a whole new experience.  Well, first let me say, when I was in Hartford, Connecticut before I even moved to Chicago [Illinois] and graduated from the program [with The Travelers Indemnity Company], I met a young, a young man by the name of Al Grace [Albert Grace, Jr.].  Al Grace was my next door neighbor.  He and his wife, Sharon [ph.], really reached out to me, kind of, you know, Al was a lawyer with Connecticut General insurance [Connecticut General Life Insurance Company].  You may know Al, because he's now here in Chicago and he's, he's the president of Loop Capital Markets [Loop Capital Markets, LLC], the firm that him and Jim Reynolds [James Reynolds, Jr.] founded.  So, Al just remains to this very day one of my closest friends.  But, I bring Al up because back then I didn't even own a suit.  I'd never forget, I used to have a corduroy, brown corduroy blazer that I used to wear with brown pants.  And, whenever I had--that's what I would wear.  And, you know, during the training school, you didn't have to wear suits.  But, when I came to Chicago, that's what I had.  And, I remember having to go out and buy my first suit.  And, I, trust me, I got more than my money's worth out of those clothes, because I didn't have a lot of 'em.  But, but when I came out, I started going out to these meetings and as, as you mentioned it was a new experience for me.  And, one of the, one day, one of the guys pulled me aside and said, "Hey, you know what, you gotta start wearing, you know, different clothes."  I mean, he said, you know, "Look around the office here, you know, see what they wear."  And, he said, "You don't wanna put yourself in a position--," you know, 'cause back then I used to wear, not a beard, but, you know, now that I'm older, I kind of get, get away with, you know, having that two or three day old beard.  But, you know, he pulled me aside, he said, "You know, you need yourself a dark suit," you know.  "Put a cuff in your pants," you know.  And, I started, and that was part of my learning process.  Now, I don't do it as much because I feel like, you know, I like for people to be who they are, and not feel like you gotta be something, to be something.  If that makes sense.
Story_ID: 532194
Speaker 1: For me that was a brand new experience for me, going out meeting with people, driving out getting, you know, going out and talking to people about insurance and why they should replace--now, keep in mind, at that stage of the game, I was dealing with very, very small companies.  It wasn't until like now that I'm dealing with companies like a Boeing [The Boeing Company], or and Abbott, or Sara Lee [Sara Lee Corporation], and those size companies, or an Aon [Aon Corporation; Aon plc], you know, those days are just here now.
Speaker 2: Give us examples of names of some of the types of companies.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean, well back then, they were all ma and pops sort of companies.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: So, those names wouldn't be relative, if you will--
Speaker 2: But, but did you--
Speaker 1: But, today--go ahead--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: No.  Today, those companies are, as I mentioned, like the Boeings is who I work with.  Or, you know, Bally's Total Fitness [Bally Total Fitness Holding Corporation].  These, you know, Abbott [Abbott Laboratories], you know, these are companies that I work with today.  But, back then, you know, they were small companies.  They were companies might've had ten employees and you would never know the name.  You know, I wouldn't even remember the name (unclear) (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, were they African American companies?  They were--
Speaker 1: No.  They were not African American companies.
Speaker 2: So how was it--
Story_ID: 532195
Speaker 1: --American companies (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, how was it for you--?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --as an African American going into selling to non-African American companies?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, it was, it was, it was great; because I tell you what happened.  After I spent a year of following behind someone else, when I took over, I had already been introduced to these folks so they liked me, or they knew who I was, so it wasn't, I was no longer just this black, black guy coming in, I was Les Coney [HistoryMaker Lester "Les" N. Coney].  Who, you know, they had gotten to know over the past year.  And, the key for me, I worked for Travelers [The Travelers Indemnity Company], so I was always working through a broker.  So, I didn't go out to the company and sell.  I went out to the broker to sell.  And, I said to the broker, "Look, when you're--when that company comes up for renewal, think about us at Travelers."  And, and that's the way it would work.  So, that--most brokers would have twenty to thirty or fifty accounts that they had.  So, they were really the face guy, if you will.  I just had the relationship with them.  And, they were almost forced to work with us, 'cause Travelers was the number one insurance company.  So, if I was the guy, they had to deal with me.  Unless, they were, they had to, you know, you know what to go to the company and say, "Hey, I don't wanna deal with a black guy."  And, I'm sure maybe one or two people might have done that behind my back.  But, 'cause back then, I was too young and wouldn't understand it.  You know, I didn't realize when they said, "Hey, we want you to no longer call on this person, that person."  You know, I'm sure maybe some of that did go on.  But, I--not that I'm aware of.
Story_ID: 532196
Speaker 1: So, you stayed with Travelers [The Travelers Indemnity Company] for ten years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I stay--oh, I stayed with Travelers longer than that.  I actually stayed with Travelers for sixteen years.  And, what happened was, I was with Travelers but then Travelers was bought by Citibank [Citibank, N.A.].  And, I have to tell you another story just to digress for a minute, you know.  Every year of my career, I was a sales winner.  We used to have a sales conference every, every year.  And, it was always at someplace beautiful; Florida, Palm Spring [sic. Palm Springs, California], wherever.  And, it was always a big deal for me because I would've never had the chance to travel to Palm Springs.  And, we would stay at some of the best places in the world; like, Innisbrook [Innisbrook Golf Resort, Palm Harbor, Florida], Boca Raton [Florida], and these, these were great, great trips; the Wigwam in Arizona [Wigwam Resort, Litchfield Park, Arizona].  And, it used to be you only had to, you could go as an individual.  But, as the years change, they started allowing spouses to come along.  So, then, I used to bring my wife.  And, my was great, beautiful, smart, you know, educated.  And, that used to be, we used to treat the sales conference as our vacation.  And, so, we did that for a few years.  Well, Citibank purchased Travelers insurance.  Sandy Weill took over Travelers insurance.  And, they first bought just a small portion of 25 percent of the company.  But, then they later on bought the whole company.  And, I'll never forget, I, I had had a great year and they had asked me to sit at Sandy Weill's table in Palm Springs at this big dinner.
Speaker 1: And, Sandy Weill is?
Speaker 2: Sand Weill is the CEO at the time.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: He was the CEO of Citibank.  And, so, Sandy Weill, and he's a, he's a legend in his own right.  I think he's the retired chairman now of Citibank, just as of a year or two ago.  But, and has a book out now called the 'Art of the Deal,' [sic. 'The Real Deal: My Life in Business and Philanthropy,' Sandy Weill] which is on New York's [The New York Times] bestsellers list.  But, when I got called from, you know, Travelers, the president saying, "Hey, I want you to know, you know, you're gonna be seated, we're gonna seat you and your wife at the president's table, at Sandy Weill's table."  And, Sandy, again, was the man.  So, I was honored, right.  But, in the meantime, I had been married a few years, and there was some issues going on in the marriage.  I think we argued, had an argument about something, or whatever.  So, everybody else wife, would always come down with their husband.  When they come down on Thursday, they were there on Thursday.  I don't, I don't care if they had kids or not.  They weren't missing any day in the sun or any day on that golf course, or any day drinking and eating.  So, my wife, she actually said, "Well, I'm not gonna, you know, I'm not gonna come down.  Let me see you handle it by yourself."  Like I'll show you, because she was upset with me.  And, she had done this in the past, but she had always, when it came time to go, she always showed up.  Well, this time, I'll never forget, I'm at the airport; she, she didn't fly down with me, but, she was gonna come down the day of the event.  So, I'm at the airport and waiting for Dawn [Dawn Worthy Coney] to get off the plane and it was no Dawn.  Dawn is my, again, my ex-wife.  And, so I called, you know, I called her, you didn't have cell phones back then, but I called her father [Curtis Worthy], her father and said, "Hey, have you--did you take Dawn to the airport?  Do you know (unclear)?"  He said, "Yeah Dawn is not, Dawn's not coming."  I said, "What do you mean?"  She--he said, "She's still here."  I said, "What do you mean, she's not coming?"  So, I just said, "Okay."  I mean, there was nothing I could do, I mean, I'm in California, right.  So, then I said, "Now, what do I do?"  And, so, I sat down at the airport and said, "Now, how do I get outta this one?"  Because now, I'm supposed to be sitting down that night at dinner with Sandy Weill.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, I said, "Now, do I just show up, and say, 'Oh, my wife, my wife didn't come.'  Or, do I say something?"  And, I ended up saying something in advance because they made it very clear that this, he had just bought the company, he's the chairman.  They didn't want any open--
Speaker 1: Empty seats (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) seats at his table.  So, they ended up removing me from the table and, and that was like, that was like, I can't tell you how I felt because it was such a big deal and, and not that I was bragging about, but I was talking about.  Like, "Oh, man, I can't wait," you know, to be with, you know, Sandy Weill, you know, that kind of thing.  Anyway, so, they removed me from the table and then I think I ended up even leaving the conference early, came back home.  And, shortly after that that's when we went through a divorce.  Yeah, we went through a divorce.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have an opportunity to meet him and talk with him?
Speaker 2: Down the road, I did meet him on occasion.  But, never, I mean, not, not really, not really (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not like that.
Speaker 2: But, I will tell you, his number two guy is Jamie Dimon [James Dimon], was Jamie Dimon at that time.  And, Jamie Dimon is the new head of Chase Bank [JPMorgan Chase and Co.].  And, Jamie Dimon's daughter and my daug- and my son [Javon Coney] are best friends.  They were classmates at the Latin high school [Latin School of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  And, as a matter of fact, they'll be heading to Mexico for their senior trip together, the five of them, in a week.  So, that shows you how things--
Speaker 1: It comes back around (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Comes back around.  Right.
Story_ID: 532197
Speaker 1: When did you know you could sell?
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: When did you know you were a salesman (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I mean, I guess, the first time someone said yes to something. You know, so.  But, but yeah, no, I mean I've sold my whole career.  I enjoyed--people always said, I remember years ago, don't say it now, but years ago they used to say, you know, "How many people--?"  They always judge people by how many people report to you, as your sign of success.  And, I've never had a bunch of people reporting to me.  But, that was intentional because I enjoyed selling.  I never wanted to be the guy that's sitting around in the office everyday taking, you know, having people coming in my office talking about, you know, "Well, this is a problem or that," you know.  I just wanted to do my own thing.  And, even to this very day, that's what I do.  And, I've been very blessed to have that as an option to do.
Speaker 1: So, when you left Travelers [The Travelers Indemnity Company] years later, what was your position?
Speaker 2: When I left Travelers, okay, so here's what happened.  Travelers, when, when Sandy Weill bought 25 percent of the company, but then when he bought all of the company, he sold the insurance division to United Healthcare [United Healthcare Corporation; United Healthcare Services, Inc.].  I was a part of that division that went on to United Healthcare.  And, technically speaking, that was still like I stayed for the same com- working for the same company (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No break in service.
Speaker 2: So, there was no break in service.  So, I stayed with United Healthcare for about six years.  And, then I met--okay.
Speaker 1: And, how had you moved up the corporate ladder?
Speaker 2: And, so, what happened was, you know, I was always a sales guy, winner and growing, and all that.  But, then I had gotten a--I took over an agency by the name of Mesirow Financial [Chicago, Illinois].  And, Mesirow was one these agen- brokerage firms that nobody wanted to work with because they had a lot of prospects, but they would never do any business with Travelers.  So, I was the new kid on the block.  So, I said, I'll take Mi- I'll take, I'll take Mesirow.
Story_ID: 532198
Speaker 1: Mesirow [Mesirow Financial, Chicago, Illinois] was an agency where, Mesirow was an agency where, no one really wanted to work with this firm because they would always have opportunities to quote but never really closed any deals.  And, and, that became really almost my claim to fame, if you will, because I took on Mesirow because, you know, I was the new kid on the block.  And, they became the number one producing brokerage firm for Travelers [The Travelers Indemnity Company] in the whole country.  So, I was very proud of that.  Well, through that I got a chance to meet a gentleman by the name of Jim Tyree [James C. Tyree] whom was the, back then he was the president, but now he's the CEO and chairman.  And, we became very good friends and had been friends for years.  So, while I was with Travelers, it then was sold to United Healthcare [United Healthcare Corporation; United Healthcare Services, Inc.].  United Healthcare after a few years, I decided I was gonna go work for Jim Tyree at Mesirow.  He had offered me a job, and I had accepted.  And, about a month before I went to take the job, I happened to mention to John Rogers [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.], my good friend John Rogers, who's the chairman and founder of Ariel mutual funds [Ariel Investments], that--and he serves on the board of Aon Corporation [Aon plc]--I happened to tell him that I was going to work for Mesirow.  And, he says, "Well, wait a minute, you always told me if you left United Healthcare, you would at least look at Aon."  So, I had agreed to, I had agreed to, to at least just go over and talk to Aon as favor to John.  Without telling John that I actually had already official, officially accepted the job at Mesirow.  So, but, after I went over and met with Michael O'Halleran, who was then the president, and then met with Pat Ryan [Patrick G. Ryan], who was then the chairman, and is still there as the chairman, as executive chairman, you know, they--we hit it off and they, and they made an offer that I couldn't refuse.  And, so, I went on to work at Aon for the next ten years.  And, working with Aon was a wonderful experience for me.
Story_ID: 532199
Speaker 1: Now, when you went to Rayon [sic. Aon Corporation; Aon plc], you went in as, in what position?
Speaker 2: I started out at Aon as a, you know, a managing director, senior managing director, if you will.
Speaker 1: What are the responsibilities?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the responsibilities really, at the end of the day, was a sales guy.  I mean, you know, I think my title was senior, but, but I was really a sales guy.  It was my job to go out and work with larger companies, larger global companies on getting them to, to hire Aon, you know, to do some work for them.  Whether it was managing their risk, whether it was managing their HR [human resources] needs.  That's what Aon is a global company and was, if not the large- second largest in the world at doing.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the clients that you brought to Aon?
Speaker 2: Well, probably the biggest, well, two, there are two accounts that stands out heads above.  And, that's The Boeing Company and the Exelon company [Exelon Corporation, Chicago, Illinois].  Both of them are two of the largest accounts every written by Aon in the history of the company.
Speaker 1: And, you are responsible for those?
Speaker 2: And, I was totally responsible for bring those accounts in, without question.  And--
Speaker 1: Which earned you (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well, you know, it's like, you know, I say it's interesting in sales.  The probably the biggest thing, I love sales and I've been doing it all my life.  But, probably the biggest, the only negative I can point to is how with insurance, as a sales guy, you don't do big deals like that without a lot of people helping.  I mean, so, it was always a team effort.  So, you know, when it's a team effort, it's also a lot of times, people will look at it as well, this person did this and that, you know.  So, it gets to be complicated, if you will.  But, it, it--working with Aon was a super opportunity.  Pat Ryan [Patrick G. Ryan] is just, you know, he's a class--I still talk to Pat, you know, you know, often, you know.  And, John Rogers [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.] is still one of my closest friends; talk to John.  And, Greg Case [Gregory C. Case] the new CEO there is doing an outstanding job.

Speaker 1: And, although now, I have since moved on from Aon [Aon Corporation; Aon plc] to Mesirow Financial [Chicago, Illinois] where I now work, you know, these are still friends of mine.  It's not, you know, people always say it's--like, when I went through a divorce people always said, "Oh, you know, well, what did you do to Dawn [Dawn Worthy Coney] that you're going through a divorce?"  And, it say, "Why does it have to be, I've done anything to her, or she done anything to me?  It's just sometimes people grow apart."  And, and, with Aon, that's clearly what happened.  You know, Aon did everything they could to keep me there.  Did everything, while I was there, they treated me like a king, if you will.  As a matter of fact, I think they treated me a lot better than they probably should have.  But, having said that, it got to a point where it was a time where it was an opportunity for me to move on.  And, Jim Tyree [James C. Tyree] had been my friend for over twenty years.  And, I've gotten to a point, where my daughter [Chanel Coney] is now a sophomore in college [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], my son [Javon Coney] is a senior in high school.  And, I said, "You know what, I got ten more years that I really wanna make a mark professionally."  And, I felt Mesirow would be a better area, better place for me to do so.  And, the reason why I felt it would be a better place, is not only does Mesirow broker insurance, but they also do investment banking, they also do real estate, they also do private client services.  And, these are all things that Aon didn't do, or don't do.  And, so, for that, I felt that it would give me a chance to capitalize on some of these wonderful relationships I've developed over the years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 532201
Speaker 1: Wanna just briefly talk about your relationship to the arts.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because, there's so much that you do within the artist community.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Start us off with Congo Theatre [Congo Square Theatre Company].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, let me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, you know what, before then.
Speaker 2: Even, even beyond Con- okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Let's go beyond that.  How did you interests in the arts?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, let me just go, yeah, before Congo Square, I would just say, when I was growing up my parents [Shirley White Coney and Homer Coney, Sr.] used to always say, "We want you to go out a marry someone with culture in their life," you know.  And, so, it was--I never really understood what it meant.  But, then as I got older I understood, you know, someone who goes to the theatre, or to the symphony, or to the opera, or whatever it is.  Something that I clearly didn't do growing up, and that's unfortunate, but I didn't.  So, what happened with the, with the Goodman Theatre [Chicago, Illinois], well even before--yeah, I have to start with the Goodman.  What happened with the Goodman Theatre, [HistoryMaker] Peter Bynoe, who's a life trustee now here at the Goodman Theatre, he and his wife, Linda [Linda Walker Bynoe], had a reception at their home for August Wilson (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, isn't Peter a businessman also?  Would you tell us--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Peter Bynoe is a, not only is a life trustee of the Goodman, he is a very prominent internationally known lawyer.  He's responsible for building the White Sox [Chicago White Sox] park here, the Cellular park [U.S. Cellular Field; Guaranteed Rate Field, Chicago, Illinois].  He also is the first African American to own an NBA [National Basketball Association] franchise.  He owned the Denver Nuggets years ago.  So, Peter is a very prominent, generous, super, African American male.  Who he and his wife, who, and his wife Linda is equally as accomplished as Peter is, or even more so, if you will.  But, but, they, they hosted a reception for August Wilson, who unfortunately passed over this past year, at their home.  Peter and Linda as they always do, they invite people to come out.  And, so, when I got the invitation, I was first honored to go to their home.  And, when I went to their home, I had a chance to meet August Wilson, and a lot of folks who serve on the board of, serve on the board of the Goodman Theatre.  So, after that, after that reception, they called me and, the Goodman Theatre and Peter Bynoe called and said, "Hey, would you ever consider joining the board?"  And, I said, "Well, hell, you know, absolutely."  So, that was, so I didn't--people always say, "Oh, how did you develop the love for theatre?"  So, it wasn't as much the love for the theatre that got me involved.  It was more so the love of the arts in general.  And, the Goodman just happened to be the first one knocking on my door.  So, it could've been the Lyric [Lyric Opera of Chicago] at that time, although maybe not the Lyric, because that's probably the least form of the arts that I, that I seem to be able to grasp a hold of.  But, but, you know, mus- it could've been CSO [Chicago Symphony Orchestra].  It could've been Hubbard Street [Hubbard Street Dance Chicago], Joffrey Ballet.  It could've been any number of organization within the arts community that I would've said yes to immediately.  But, the Goodman just happen to be the first one.
Story_ID: 532202
Speaker 1: And, and then I look back, I see more theatre than I do movies. I was, it was funny I was, I was talking to my friend Juanita Jordan [Juanita Vanoy Jordan], we were at a basketball game with our kids, and we're all sitting--
Speaker 2: Now, is Juanita Jordan the wife of--?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Of--
Speaker 2: Of Michael Jordan?
Speaker 1: The famous Michael Jordan.  That's correct.
Speaker 2: And, how did you become friends with Juanita?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, Juanita, [HistoryMaker] Linda Johnson Rice, Linda actually introduced me first to Juanita many years ago.
Speaker 2: And, Lind Johnson Rice is the?
Speaker 1: Linda Johnson Rice is the publisher of--
Speaker 2: Johnson.
Speaker 1: The present CEO of Johnson Publishing Company [Chicago, Illinois].  What happened is I really got, I met her through Linda, but I really got to know primarily her and Michael because our sons play on a basketball team together.  And--
Speaker 2: And, where is that?
Speaker 1: It's called AAU [Amateur Athletic Union], and that's really, they play all around the country.
Speaker 2: Is this a sponsored team?
Speaker 1: It's a sponsored team in which Michael Jordan's company called, Jump [Jump Inc.], the company's called Jump.  But, but Jordan is the brand.  And, they sponsored the team.  And, it's made up of successful basketball players in different parts of the city.  And, so my son [Javon Coney] happened to play with Jeffrey Jordan, their son.  And, so over the past five years, we've traveled to people like--places like Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada], Orlando [Florida], Chi- all around Chicago [Illinois] playing ball together.  And, when we happened to be at a game just over the holiday, and Juanita was saying how, it was some movie that she was talking about that she had just recently seen.  But, and, I said, "Boy, I really wish I had a chance to go to movies more."  But, and she talked about how she goes to the movie often, like, I wanna say even every week.  But, I don't wanna misquote; but, she goes a lot.  And, I was saying how I almost, the last movie I saw was 'Million Dollar Baby,' and that was probably a year and a half ago.  But, I brought all that movie stuff up only to say, how I see a lot of theatre though.  Not only do I see the work here at the Goodman [Goodman Theatre, Chicago, Illinois], but I go to the Lookingglass Theatre [Chicago, Illinois], or Steppenwolf [Steppenwolf Theatre, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 532203
Speaker 1: Or even I try to see, you know, plays at eta [eta Creative Arts Foundation, Chicago, Illinois] in which my daughter has performed in a play at the theatre, and got paid performing.  So, she's an actress and she's starring this quarter in her first play at Princeton University [Princeton, New Jersey].  So, I'm looking forward to going down to see her there.
Speaker 2: What is your daughter's name and your son?
Speaker 1: My daughter's name is Chanel [Chanel Coney] as in the store or the perfume.  And, my son's name is Javon [Javon Coney], J-A-V-O-N.
Speaker 2: And, Chanel--
Speaker 1: Is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and Javon; their ages?
Speaker 1: Javon. Yeah.  My--Chanel is nineteen and she's a sophomore, as I mentioned, at Princeton University.
Speaker 2: May we have her exact birth date?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  She is born February, her birthday is actually next weekend.  But, she was born February 25, 1987.  And, my son was born May 14, 1989.  So, my son is seventeen currently, at the time of this interview, and my daughter is nineteen.  And, my son was actually born on Mother's Day which was a wonderful gift from--for--
Speaker 2: Oh, certainly.
Speaker 1: For not only my, my, my ex-wife [Dawn Worthy Coney], but also for myself.
Speaker 2: And, Chanel is a sophomore at Princeton?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And, Javon is?
Speaker 1: A senior at Latin high school [Latin School of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay.  And, you were, you were saying about the--
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was just talking about how my daughter is also into ac- the arts, she's an actress.  And, she--her first performance was at, where she was paid was at eta.  She performed in a play which I think it was called 'Coming Home' [Athol Fugard].  And, that was a wonderful experience for her.  And, now she also started in a play that David Schwimmer worked--produced called 'Race' ['Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel about the American Obsession'], which was on stage at the Lookingglass [Lookingglass Theatre, Chicago, Illinois].  And, now she's gonna be at this play at Princeton.  I tell her all the time, I would love to see her just really make a commitment to be in the business and not sort of just dabble in it as she's doing.  But, we'll see how, who knows, that still might even change and go her way.
Story_ID: 532204
Speaker 1: But, you were also affiliated with the Congo Square Theatre [Congo Square Theatre Company] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  So, once I joined the board of the Goodman Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] about eight years ago, I remember after opening night we have a cast party.  A cast party is when we celebrate and congratulate all the actors and actress on their fine work.  Well, at, at one of the cast party of one of the August Wilson productions, and I'm drawing a blank which one that may have been.  But, one of the understudies and the understudy are people who sit in the, sit in the control room who is, if one of the actors get--become ill, someone's able to step in and take over.  So, at the cast party this gentleman came up to me; these two young African American males came up to me and said, "Hey, listen, we didn't know the Goodman Theatre had an African American on their board of directors.  We heard you are."  I said, "Yes.  How are you?"  And, we introduced ourselves.  They said, "Well listen, can we get together for lunch?"  I said, "Sure."  And, I said, "What's going on?"  They said, "Well, we're starting this theatre company, African American theatre company, wanted to see if you could be involved in some way."  And, that's how, and so they were starting Congo Square Theatre.  And, these weren't some guys who just off the street decide they wanna act.  They had their master's in acting.  I mean, they went to, I wanna say University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], and Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and studied under some famous people.  And, so I met with them, and I said, "Sure, I'd love to help."  And, I treated it as a way of giving back.  Because all this that you see here at the Goodman Theatre, this was a way to how do--all this means nothing if I can't give it to someone else, you--and, so that was my way of sort of passing it on to these young fellows.  And, a young lady by the name of Roxanne Ward who works for John Rogers [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.] at Ariel [Ariel Investments], she too got involved.  And, the two, between the two of us, we started Congo Square Theatre.  Well, the actors started the theatre but we formalized it, if you will, with developing a board.  And, so, one day I said to her, I said to Roxanne if, "Instead of just volunteering, we need to really just create a board and really get serious."  And, so, we founded, we founded the board.  And, I went out and asked some friends to join the board.  And, my good friend Vanessa Bell Calloway who you may recall.  She's famous actress out of L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  She's been in a number of movies.  But, she was on 'All My Children' for all those years.  And, he also in 'Coming to America.'  Well, I called Vanessa and asked her would she come to town for a fundraiser, and she flew into town.  You know, and I'm, she still remains one of my best friends and I'm thankful for the time she gave.  But, with her coming in, I was able to advertise Congo Square, this unknown entity.  But, people came out because of Vanessa Bell Calloway.  And, she watched the play with us.  It was the 'Soldier's Play' ['A Soldier's Play,' Charles Fuller].  And, it was really sort of a coming out party.  Because they went from performing in this twenty-five seat theatre on the Near North Side [Chicago, Illinois] to now performing in two hundred people theatre.  And--
Speaker 1: And, where is Congo Square located?
Speaker 2: We still don't have a home right now, but they, they, have some place here.  They perform at different locations.
Speaker 1: Is this not the, I know there's a place at Duncan Y [Duncan YMCA Chernin Center for the Arts, Chicago, Illinois], would that be it?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, that is, that is it.  And, they do three--so, what we did was, we moved to the Duncan Y which is the near South Loop [Chicago, Illinois], primarily because most of our patrons are from, so, I always hear people say, "Boy, I'd love to come to Congo Square but I wish you were a little closer."  So, we signed an agreement and we, we're in our second year agreement with the Duncan Y performing there.  But, unfortunately, just a couple weeks ago, Duncan Y has been sold to St. Ignatius high school [St. Ignatius College Prep, Chicago, Illinois].  So, now we're gonna have to find a new home.
Story_ID: 532205
Speaker 1: So, I have--I had to step down as chair of Congo Square [Congo Square Theatre Company] because I then became chair of the Goodman [Goodman Theatre, Chicago, Illinois], chairman of the Goodman Theatre.  And, that's been a wonderful experience because I became the first African American ever to chair a major cultural institution in Chicago [Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, what does that mean?  What does, what are the chairman's responsibilities?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, a lot of times people think it means I get to come up with all the plays that are on the stage.  And, that really doesn't, I don't get that opportunity at all.  Nor, do I want that responsibility because then we probably wouldn't have the great work that we have right now.  But, basically it means, and I'd like to change, I would love to change title from chairman to just chief, chief volunteer officer because really what we are, we're volunteers.  And, I among eighty other individuals, we, every day we go out and we promote the Goodman Theatre.  And, that means, getting people to come see plays, getting people to buy subscriptions, getting people to write personal checks when they have a little extra money in the bank.  Whether it means getting their corporations to contribute; it means all those things.
Story_ID: 532206
Speaker 1: Now, it seems to be a larger black contingency here at the Goodman [Goodman Theatre, Chicago, Illinois] now.
Speaker 2: Well, pardon me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or, black support.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, you know, one of the, one of the main reasons for that is the product on stage.  The Goodman Theatre is the only theatre in America whom has had every single production, every--all ten of August Wilson plays in a cycle on--here.  And, and we're the only theatre in America that has done that.  So, so, first it starts with the product, if you will.  Second, it starts with having minorities on the board who can advocate, advocate people coming here, because you know, you bring your friends.  So, if you're black and you're bringing your friends, and they're black then that's more blacks coming to the theatre.  If you're white and you bring more whi- I mean, that's bringing, you know, so, it's that kind of thing.  So, I think that's--the Goodman has been an institution to, not only has the work on stage, but it also has the diversity in the staff.  It has the diversity on the board.  It has diversity in places where we do business, and we have diversity in our subscribers.  So, it's really an institution that has gotten it right.  And, I'm proud to be, I wish I can sit up here and say I take all the credit, but I just, I play just a small role in that whole effort to, to help the Goodman be the institution that it is today.

Speaker 1: You have been recognized by many organizations for your civic contributions.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you just--
Speaker 2: One or two.  But, but I will tell you, I have an award coming up in May by the Associations Fund--I should know the name, but the AFP [Association of Fundraising Professionals] is their title.  But, it's really an organization that honors, they had--I'm gonna be the executive of the year.  And, this is an award where John Ryant--John Bryant [sic. John H. Bryan], who's the former chairman of Art Institute [Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] has won, John Rogers [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.] has won, Ed Gardner [HistoryMaker Edward Gardner] has won, just to name a few.  And, so, I'm very thrilled about that.  Where every award--anytime someone pause and honor you, it's, it's thrilled.  But, I'm extremely thrilled about receiving that ward- award that's coming up in May.  I also was thrilled when I received an award from 100 Black Men [100 Black Men of America, Inc.].  I alone with John Rogers and his father received an award about a year or so ago.  And, and that was just a great, an award because 100 Black Men, I look at as my peers.  And, so when your peers say, "Hey, we think you're doing a good job," that means a lot.  And, then one of the first award I ever received was the Seeds of Africa [Seeds of Africa Foundation].  That was one of the first awards.  And, that means a lot to me because, you know, yes I do have a lot more attention now, but the Seeds of African recognized me at a time when most people didn't necessarily know who I was; so, that meant a lot.  The, the Martin Luther King boys club [Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Club, Chicago, Illinois] will be honoring myself, [HistoryMaker] Harry Porterfield, and Michelle Flowers in a couple of week for their annual Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] award celebration.  So, I'm looking forward to that.  So, it's been, it's been a wonderful, it's been a wonderful--
Speaker 1: And, then N'DIGO honored you.
Speaker 2: Then, and, yeah, N'DIGO honored me as one of the most influential African Americans in Chicago [Illinois].  They did that, honored me a couple of times.  And, you know, so, it's been, it's been a blessing to, to, to be, to be recognized.  And, I'm always concerned though when the, you know, you keep getting awards, because I think of awards as things you should get when you're much older--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And, you're about to, you know, sail off into the sunset, so, I, I'm just hoping that that sunset is not quite there yet.
Speaker 1: Not at all.
Story_ID: 532208
Speaker 1: Mr. Coney [HistoryMaker Lester "Les" N. Coney], just a couple more things--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) before we conclude that we didn't quite finish.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: We didn't talk about your marriage--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --when you got married and we'd like to just know--
Speaker 2: Yes, let me tell you--
Speaker 1: Like for you to share--
Speaker 2: --a little family--
Speaker 1: --a little bit more about that.
Speaker 2: As I mentioned earlier, I met my wife [Dawn Worthy Coney] I college, married her a couple years out of, about a year and half out of college [George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois].  I was married for about sixteen years.  We have two wonderful kids; Chanel [Chanel Coney] and Javon [Javon Coney], who I mentioned earlier.  And, you know, I, even though I'm divorced, there's not one day I would've changed as I look back; other than the day when we split.  But, you know, I have nothing but fond memories of my marriage.  My wife, still to this very day, remains a super woman, you know.  She's done a great job, as I'm doing the things that I do around the community, she's working her tail off making sure our kids are achieving what they are achieving.
Speaker 1: And, what is her profession?
Speaker 2: And, she's a speech pathologist.  She has her master's in speech pathologist from Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois].  So, and--
Speaker 1: And, is she in business (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She works for a company, she works for a company that has a contract with the Chicago Public Schools.  And, so, she get assigned certain school where she goes in and she helps, she helps kids with speech problems.
Speaker 1: And, you were saying, you're still best friends.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we still, I don't wanna go as far to say best friends, but, we're still friends.  I mean, 'cause you know, when you're parents of two wonderful kids, you gotta communicate.  And, so, we still have bumps along the way.  But, there's nothing that I wouldn't do for her.  She still comes as my guest to the Goodman Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] from time to time.  We sometimes travel together if we need to relate--as it relates to the kids; not, not just the two of us for any vacation.  But, but, it's really, you know, again, it's unfortunate that we're divorced.  But, you know, she's moved on, I've moved on, and, and it's all good.
Speaker 1: And, that makes you one of Chicago's [Chicago, Illinois] most eligible bachelors (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's fun--someone was looking at--I think [HistoryMaker] Linda Johnson Rice is on the cover of Today's Woman [Today's Chicago Woman], and they also featured in that same edition the top twenty-five most eligible bachelors, and people came over to me and they always say, "Well, why didn't, why didn't they have you there?"  And, I tell them, "Sherren Leigh who's the publisher of that publication has asked me on a number of ti- occasion to be in there."  And, I just, I didn't wanna represent myself in that way, you know.  I mean, I enjoyed marriage life, I'm enjoying the single life now, while I have it.  And, I--but, I'm not trying to promote it in any sort of way, you know.
Story_ID: 532209
Speaker 1: Just briefly, a little bit more about Mesirow [Mesirow Financial, Chicago, Illinois] and your responsibilities.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: One of your responsibilities, is crea- is nurturing new business opportunities?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which new businesses have you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --nurtured and brought to Mesirow (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, for instance, when I, as I talked about being with Travelers insurance [The Travelers Indemnity Company], and then Travelers to United Healthcare [United Healthcare Corporation; United Healthcare Services, Inc.], and then United Healthcare to Aon [Aon Corporation; Aon plc], I made a decision to go over to Mesirow, as I talked about earlier because of their broad scope of businesses that they're in.  But, some of our, what I love, what I really, a couple things I really love about the company now, is I get a chance to work with minority companies.  So, people like Jim Reynolds [James Reynolds, Jr.] from Loop Capital [Loop Capital Markets, LLC], Loop Capital is a client of mine.  Deborah Sawyer [HistoryMaker Deborah M. Sawyer] from EDI [Environmental Design International inc., Chicago, Illinois], she is a client of mine.  Larry Gray of Larry Gray and Associates [ph.], Andre Rice, who was one of my first clients.  I mean, these are companies that are not necessarily large in the amount of money that a company makes.  But, just the fact that these are people who I deal with on a daily basis that are clients, you know.  Michael Alter is a client of the Alter Group [Alter Group Ltd., Skokie, Illinois].  He's the owner of the Chicago Sky, the WNBA [Women's National Basketball Association] group.  Marty Nesbitt [HistoryMaker Martin Nesbitt] is another client.  So, so for me--
Speaker 1: And, these are all clients that you have brought to the--
Speaker 2: Brought over to Mesirow. Um-hm. And, these are important to me because, again, these are--I enjoyed it.  James Bell [James A. Bell] from Boeing [The Boeing Company], another client, you know.  So, it's, it's very important to me to be able to--it's fun when you have friends who are clients.
Story_ID: 532210
Speaker 1: What would you, what advice would you give to a young person who's interested in going into insurance, or sales?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know how much I would promote insurance, but I would promote sales (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sales.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so, if you have an opportunity to be involved with sales, I always say, "It's the best job in the world."  Because, if you're, if you are a person that enjoys people, I could never take a job sitting in an office, like I have some friends who are lawyers who sit in the office all day and they do research.  That would drive me up a wall.  Even sit, sitting through this interview, at certain points--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --even though I enjoy it, you know, it gets to be a bit much.  But, the fact of the matter is, there is nothing better than sales.  Because you get a chance to, I mean, you just get the opportunity to, to--every day of my life has been different.  And, there has never been a Monday that I have awakened where I was disappoint about going into work.  I don't care if it's Mesirow [Mesirow Financial, Chicago, Illinois] today, Aon [Aon Corporation; Aon plc], the United Healthcare [United Healthcare Corporation; United Healthcare Services, Inc.], Travelers [The Travelers Indemnity Company], every single day has been a joy to me in going to work.  Does that mean I never had any problems?  Oh, of course, I've always had my bad days.  But, but, I've always been able to enjoy what I do.  And, I think, I think a good chunk of that comes from each day being different.  And, a good chunk of it comes from having the leadership of a Jim Tyree, CEO of Mesirow, or Pat Ryan [Patrick G. Ryan] from Aon, or Marshall Rozzi from United Healthcare, you know, being my, being my boss, you know, and being--their leadership, and allowing me to do what I do.  So, that's, that's been very, that's been very special for me.
Story_ID: 532211
Speaker 1: Well, Mr. Coney [HistoryMaker Lester "Les" N. Coney], we have enjoyed talking with you and--
Speaker 2: Well, thank you (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) just before we conclude--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I just wanna ask you a few more questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you've lived your life?
Speaker 2: No complaints.  I mean, it's been, it's been a wonderful life.  I think if, I think if I die tomorrow, the thing that, you know, they always say well, what would, would you say something about yourself that no one really knows?  Well, most people wouldn't know that I, I read the Bible every single morning before I leave the house, seven days a week.  So, that's a, that's a must.  So, I do that.  I'm a member of Apostolic Church of God [Chicago, Illinois], which I didn't get a chance to talk about earlier.  Bishop Brazier [HistoryMaker Bishop Arthur Brazier] means everything to me.  I mean, even though we're not best friends, just the fact that I go and I listen to the word.  He has helped me get through my week so many times.  So, I'm proud to be a member of Bishop Brazier's church, Apostolic.  And, I've been a member of that for twenty years.  You know, Munir Muhammad who has his own show ['Muhammad and Friends'], you know, my, you know, a very, another good friend and a guy who I admire because he's getting the word out for individuals around, around the city that I greatly appreciative.  And, I just love the City of Chicago [Illinois].  Even though I'm from Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and I love Philly, I'm still a 6ers [Philadelphia 76ers] and Eagles [Philadelphia Eagles] fan before anything else, but--and Flyers [Philadelphia Flyers], but, and Phillies [Philadelphia Phillies].  But it's still Chicago; I would not like to live any other place but here.  And, I--especially being an African American male, I, I think, you know, we talk all day long about the challenges of being African American, but I will tell you, I wouldn't exchange being African American for anything else in the world.

Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the main thing is, for me, is I've always tried to live my life with not trying to make excuses.  And, so, when I talk to my son [Javon Coney] and daughter [Chanel Coney], I always say, like, I remember my daughter was talking about this one teacher that she felt that was unfairly, you know, treating her in class.  And, I know her mom [Coney's ex-wife, Dawn Worthy Coney] was ready to go up to school and say, "What's wrong with you Mr. Teacher?"  And, what I said to her, and she felt I wasn't supporting her, but what I, the lesson I was trying to explain to her is that throughout your life, you're gonna meet people all the time who are not gonna be fans of yours for whatever reason, you know, for whatever reason.  Even when you're popular, you still have people that don't like you.  Take Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], as popular as he is today, there's people who don't like him.  So, there's always gonna be somebody who don't like you.  So, I always say, "You can either be upset with them or, either not spend any time with them.  Or, you can figure out how to get them on your side."  And, and, I try to tell them stories of throughout my life, when there might have been one or two people that, for whatever reason, we didn't see eye to eye.  But, then became, later on down the road, became best friends.  So the key is not making excuses.
Speaker 1: Not making excuses.  What do you still want to do that you haven't done yet?
Speaker 2: For one, I still wanna get a college and, and--

Speaker 1: How would you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, first and foremost, I'd like to be remembered as a good father; a great father.  My kids mean everything to me.  Chanel [Chanel Coney] and Javon [Javon Coney], they bring me so much joy, and you know, people say all the time, they say, "Well, how can you treat your ex-wife [Dawn Worthy Coney], like, like that?"  I try to treat her as nice as I can, like I try to treat everyone.  But, and I say, "Well, hell, she's the mother of my kids."  I mean, you know, this, there will never be anyone that will more important than that, than for me to say that, you know, the two beautiful kids I have.  So, I would like to be remembered as a good father.  I'd also like to be remembered as a person who, who never had an agenda.  So, when I walk in a room, I'm more concerned about whom I might meet.  So, like, when I meet someone, I'm always thin- I don't say, I'm not really thinking about, "Oh, man, I know Michael Jordan, because, now I can be his best buddy."  I'm think, "Oh, well, it's nice to know Michael Jordan, so now, somebody who might wanna meet Michael Jordan, I can, I can put them two together."  I don't know if that makes sense.  So, it's more about, you know, I'm always thrilled.  But, even with money, the more money I make in life, I'm always thinking about, well, not because I'm gonna have millions of dollars in the bank.  I'm thinking about how much more I can give away to charity.  I mean, I love the charitable work that I do.  It's really, really, special.  And, and that means far more to me than say--it was a long time until my kids kept bugging me about flat screen TV, you know.  They said, "Dad, this is ridiculous, why can't--," you know, so.  You know, I still had this little old Sony that I've had for thirty-two years, you know.  But, it worked, so.  But, anyway, and I'd like to be remembered in that way.
Speaker 1: When you look back at your life, what stands out the most?
Speaker 2: You know, what, I would say similar to what I wanna be remembered.  I mean, I think it stands out, stand out, I think I've been a good friend to most.  I think, I'm always amazed when people say, "I can't believe you returned my call."  And, and I tell people all the time, well, I mean, "What do you mean?"  You know, I return every call I get, you know.  I can't always help everyone, but I certain can return a call.  But, people say, that people don't really return calls.  I don't understand that.
Story_ID: 532214
Speaker 1: What values to you consider the most important, and why?
Speaker 2: Well, I really do think it's important for you to respect people, you know.  And, just, not just respect people like, you know, don't step on your toes.  But, respect, respect other opinions.  So, you know, I always--that's why politics is so intriguing to me, if I, you know, if I had, if I ever had the energy that would be something I would love to be involved with.  But, I always think, you know, if you like, if you don't like abortions, I like abortions, well, okay, all right, that's fine.  But, it's--who am I to say you're wrong because you don't believe in abortions, you know.  If you don't believe in the war we're currently fighting in Iraq [Iraq War], I mean, if you don't believe in the war and I do, you know, does that make you right or wrong.  I mean, you know, capital punishment; I know people who, I don't believe in capital punishment, some people do.  Okay, that fine.  So, so, so I really like to see people be more respectful of other's opinion.  It's not like saying, you know, I'm gonna take my car and drive on the side of the, side of the, on, on the street, on curve, on the pavement, and say, "Okay, well, that's what I wanna do so let me do it."  Or, I'm gonna sit in a restaurant and I'm gonna over talk loud and interrupt your dinner next to me.  I'm not talking about stuff like that, which is just wrong.  But, just opinions.

Speaker 1: Why did you wanna tell your story?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I always--the main reason is I love to tell my story, regardless of how much you talk to your children, you never really get a chance to get it all out.  And, not that I got it all out in this interview, but I certain got out a lot more, than I've gotten out to them [Chanel Coney and Javon Coney] over the years.  And, I think, and with me being from Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], probably my biggest regret is not having my family here with me to enjoy some of the success I had.  And, so, I think this video will be a way for my brother Tommy [Homer Coney, Jr.], my sister Celeste [Celestine Ray], my sister Nicole [Nicole Coney], you know, to, to really feel like they've connected on some of the years that they've missed; that we've missed being together.  And, also, really just wanna thank my family in Philly because, you know, here's, I mean, my family in Philly, we just, we just all normal folks and, but they've always treated me in the highest regard, you know, whatever I needed.  If I, if I call them right now and say, "Hey, look I'm having a problem here."  They would be on a plane; first time flying or not.  They'd be on plane here tomorrow, dealing with it, you know.  And, and so, for me, you know, I want their story out because, you know, it's important that I communicate with them.  It's important that I communicate with my children.  And, then, anything else that comes above that, this--it's all gravy.
Speaker 1: Mr. Coney [HistoryMaker Lester "Les" N. Coney], is there anything that you would like to add that we haven't asked you?
Speaker 2: No.  I think we covered a lot of territory.  I first wanna thank you for taking the time and sitting through this long boring story.  But, second of all, I wanna congratulate Julieanna Richards [sic. Julieanna Richardson], who's doing, I think, an unbelievable job in capturing these stories.  It's just really a remarkable idea.  I just hope people continue to embrace it.  I hope she continues with the energy to do it.  And, and, I just, you know, only thing I ask is to let me see the tape at some point.
Speaker 1: We'd like to thank you so much for being--
Speaker 2: Well, thank you very much (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) a HistoryMaker and being with us today.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: And, God bless you in everything that you do (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, I, and I wish you all the best.  Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
