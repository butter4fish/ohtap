Story_ID: 647692
Speaker 1: I want to ask you a little bit about your family.  Tell us about your mother.  What was her name, and where she was from.
Speaker 2: Her name is Emma C. Tucker [Emma Hill Tucker], maiden name was Emma C. Hill.  She is from Shannon, Mississippi.  She passed away April 30, 2002.  She was my best friend.  I, when I left college [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], I think I probably talked to her almost every day, from the time I was eighteen and then all the different places that I lived.  She was just a beautiful person, not just physically, but she was gorgeous.  And I can understand why my father [Ernest Tucker] married her.  She was the pretty girl in town.  She grew up in Shannon, Mississippi.  As I said, one of--oh god, we lost count--sixteen, seventeen siblings or so (laughter).  She grew up in a very large family that had a lot of history in the town.  They were the Trices.  And the great thing about the Trices was that they owned a hundred and sixty something odd (background noise) acres of land.  So we should stop.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: George Trice--and I don't, I don't want to go over all the answers. I'll let you prompt the questions.  But anyway, Mom grew up on this huge block of land, where the Trices owned a hundred and sixty some odd acres, which they still own today.  And she was the girl from the side of the tracks where her family was well educated.  They were, you know, had the first cars, lots of different things.  So, and my dad was from the wrong side of the tracks (laughter).  And, but his family was equally--bel- a real strong belief in education.  And he was just very driven, a very driven young man.  And they got married very young.  I think my dad was seventeen and my mom was eighteen when they got married.
Story_ID: 647693
Speaker 1: What education did she [Tucker's mother, Emma Hill Tucker] have; and what was her career?
Speaker 2: Mom graduated high school and she, they moved up here.  They got married, I think because she got pregnant.  And then they came north like so many families back in the--and that would have been the 1950s.  My sister [Joyce Tucker Boykins] was born in 1955.  So they came, they came north.  And she was a homemaker.  She was a homemaker the entire time.  After we got older, she would do a little work outside of the house.  She volunteered when we were young, when we were growing up.  But my father [Ernest Tucker] insisted that she stay home.  His--it was important to him that she was home when we got home from school and that she was very, very involved in our lives, because he worked a lot.  So, you know, he wanted somebody stable there all the time.  So Mom was always there.  And she was my best playmate, you know, because she loved to sew.  And she would make little Barbie doll clothes for my sister and I, and then she would play with us.  And the best way to punish me was the time that she wasn't going to play with me anymore (laughter).  And, so if I did something wrong, she would say she was not going to play with me.  And I would just like, "Okay, fine."  Because she was, she was, she was so good at it.  But, so we had lots of great meals every day, every day.  Because, you know, that's what she did.  She cooked from scratch every day.  And every Sunday was practically like Thanksgiving, because there was always family around.  People would drop by, so she always cooked enough for the relatives who might drop by.  And she baked all the time.  We always had sweets in the house--yeah, homemade cakes and cookies and pies, because my dad loved sweets.  And, so he always had to have sweets after, after dinner and stuff.  And there was always stuff there.  And people knew they could to our house and always have plenty of food and sweets.  And it was a, it was a, it was a great childhood.  It really was.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite dessert?
Speaker 2: My favorite dessert is German chocolate cake because obviously, you know, my mom was just great at it, and she would make that for my birthdays.  I haven't quite been able to duplicate her German chocolate cake.  And the other one is pecan pie.  I love pecan pie (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 647694
Speaker 1: Did she ever tell you any stories about growing up what her early years were like; and what it was like growing up with all these brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: She was the baby of the family.  And yeah, I mean, you know, it wasn't just her.  I heard about a lot of the stories from her and the other family members because we do family reunions.  So I know a lot about the oral history because we would go south a lot when I was, when I was a child.  And we still do huge family reunions.  So I would hear a lot of stories from her and stories from everybody else, who would tease her, because her mom [Hattie Trice Hill] died when she was about eight months old.  So she never knew her mother.  So everybody took care of Emma [Emma Hill Tucker].  Emma was everybody's baby because her mom had died so young.  Every--she was everybody's little sister.  And, so consequently there was--she would, she would talk about being--going anyplace and always having a protector, you know, always having somebody there to take care of her.  And, you know, her favorite story--and probably one I asked her to tell me time and time again--was how she met my father [Ernest Tucker].  You know, because I used to ask her, "Why'd you marry him?  Why'd you marry him?"  And, you know, she would say that she met him when they were sophomores in high school.  And she wanted, she wanted a pop or a candy bar or something or the other.  And, so she asked him to loan her a nickel.  And he gave her a quarter, and told her to bring the change back.  And, of course, you know, she brought the change back.  But she said it was clear to her that he was going to amount to something that he was smart.  And he was the smartest boy in the class, and she was very impressed with that.  So she said she knew early on that that boy had something special.  And, so she would always tell that story.  And the early years, you know, she talked about when they were in Chicago [Illinois], and sometimes things were difficult.  Because, you know, you have a seventeen year old kid who now has a young child.  And they're in Chicago, just the two of them, and trying to make ends meet--sharing an apartment and, you know, trying to get things started.  But I don't remember her ever complaining about those early years you know.  She would just, you know, she said, she said they were tough.  But because she could sew, because she was a homemaker and stuff, she could just--we never saw it.  You know, she al- she always made things great for us.  I think if she talked about anything it was all the siblings, and all the fun that she had growing up, going literally from house to house to house because on this hundred and sixty acres [in Shannon, Mississippi]--everybody who lived there was related.  So you went to auntie's house and then the cousin's house and the next auntie.  And that's what I enjoyed about it as a child: being able to go down there, just go from house to house to house and eat my way down the block (laughter).
Story_ID: 647695
Speaker 1: Now you say you have a lot of family reunions?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How often do you have them?
Speaker 2: On my mom's [Emma Hill Tucker] side, we get together every couple of years.  On my dad's [Ernest Tucker] side, sometimes every year, and then we may go a few years.  But my mom's side is a little bit more organized.  And once we started I think maybe in the--that I can remember--the early '60s [1960s].  But they would get together before that.  But, you know, my memory goes back to the early six- '60s [1960s].  I'm sorry, late '60s [1960s], rather.  And they became very, very organized.  But I see everybody from Mississippi every other year.  So I know them very well.  So the extended family is very close because, you know, I grew up with them.  And then you grow up with your cousins, and you go back and then you see everybody as they progress and get married and have children and, you know, then we'll go to a wedding here or end up going back for funerals, obviously.  But it's--we can probably have on the Trice side easily a hundred and fifty people, take over the hotel.  You know, sometimes, sometimes more.  And it all gets--you order your T-shirts early and, you know, and then you have the big fish fry on Friday night.  And then on Saturday you have the big dinner.  And that's when everybody exchanges what's happening in their lives and who's going to school where and who's doing what.  And, you know, it's fabulous.  I thought everybody had family reunions like this (laughter).  I just assumed that everybody did this.  And then, you know, as I got older and I'm meeting people--and they don't do that many.  I thought, you know, it was just, it was a way of life for our family.  And then on my dad's side, you know, it's a very, very similar thing.  You know, just everybody coming together and, again, seeing them all the time.  So we spent--when I was growing up, we spent a lot of time south.  And I know when I married my husband [Anthony Wilkins], be- between the two family reunions, we were going to a family reunion every year, every year--at least a couple of them.  We just, that's just what we do.
Story_ID: 647696
Speaker 1: How would you describe her personality?
Speaker 2: My mom's?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Pause) You know, my mom [Emma Hill Tucker] was--sweet seems like a very general word, generic kind of word to--that can apply to so many different things.  But she was very generous.  She--really kind of shy.  You know, I mean she wasn't the one who would start a conversation.  You know, if you engaged her she was, she was talkative.  But she would just kind of, you know, sit back and watch.  You know, I think, I think she was the kind of woman who was very traditional, you know, in that she was a traditional homemaker.  And she accepted her role but at the same time, you know, I can remember her sending signals to me that she didn't want me to be a homemaker.  You know, I mean she, and sometimes she would say to me, "I didn't do all of this so that you would grow up like me.  You know, I want you to work."  So she was supportive in my, in my career, and she wanted to help me make it work with the, with the family.  And she was, she was probably somebody that you would love to have as a friend because she was so non-judgmental, you know.  I mean, she never made you feel like you weren't--there was something wrong with the way you were doing things or, and her love was unconditional, you know.  It was--she just plain loved you because you were her baby, or you were in her circle or you were in her world.  And there was never this feeling that if you did something wrong that you would lose her love.  If you did something wrong, she would just, you know, step up to the plate and love you even more, because you needed it, yeah.  She, I think it bothered her sometimes that she didn't have, that she didn't go on to college, you know, and didn't get that education.  I think that's why she pushed us so much and she was so supportive of us, in terms of our education.  And I really looked to her--there were times along the way that if I wanted to quit, you know, I would remember how my mom--and she must have been in her fifties.  And she decided to take some courses, because she wanted to volunteer at a school or something or other, you know, and she decided to take some courses.  And she would come home and do her homework, you know, every night.  And there, you know, there were times when I would think, oh, my god, I can't do this anymore.  This is hard."  And I just would think of how difficult it had to be for her, to be in her forties or fifties doing these college courses now, after so many years of not being in school.  And she never complained.  She just, you know, she just did it.  She just got through, she just got through the courses.  And it really inspired me, you know, that I can--whatever it was that I was going through was small, probably compared to what she was feeling.  And I know it seems like a small thing.  But in a--given--I think, and I guess I looked at her as somebody who--because she, you know, got pregnant at such a young age--she didn't have an opportunity to really figure out what she wanted to do.  You know, she just fell into what she was doing, which kind of said to me what she did was to be the best at what her role was.  And she was very good at being a mother.
Story_ID: 647697
Speaker 1: You said that one of the reasons she [Tucker's mother, Emma Hill Tucker] went back to school was to do some volunteer things?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What kind of volunteer things?
Speaker 2: She would volunteer at the, at the, at the schools that--when we were kids, she would just volunteer in the classroom.  And I think at some point that she wanted to do, to get a job in Head Start, you know.  And then I think they kind of wanted to see some college credits.  So maybe she just kind of felt like that's what, you know, she wanted to be able to put on her resume or something or other.  But she only took a couple of credits.  So I don't, I didn't get the sense that it was required, but I knew it was something that she wanted to do before she started working, you know, in the Head Start program or something.  And she worked a bit, and then she worked at a store, because she was very good with crafts.  You know, she would, she would make a lot of things.  So she worked in a crafts store in Oak Park [Illinois].  And that's really where she spent a lot of her time after--this is long after we were out of the house.  Because remember, I mean, she had to be--by the time we even graduated high school [Austin High School, Chicago, Illinois]--college, she was just in her forties, you know.  So she was young.
Story_ID: 647698
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your father [Ernest Tucker].  Where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Shannon, Mississippi as well.
Speaker 1: Same place.
Speaker 2: In a very poor family.  And what's interesting because--I mean, you know, poor just in terms of--his father [Henry Tucker] died when he was four years old.  And they used to tell that story, too, and that that was really something that was a connection for them.  You know, my mom [Emma Hill Tucker] didn't know her mother [Hattie Trice Hill], and my dad had very faint memories of his father because he had died when he was, when he was so young.  So my grandmother who I knew quite well, my dad's mother [Lillie Belle Ingol Spates], really became a surrogate mom to my mother as, you know, as well.  And my mother really appreciated that.  But my dad was the--oh, I guess he--six or seven siblings as well--the same sort of thing.  Yeah, I think there was, I think there was six of them, yeah, and some stepsisters.  And, you know, you know, back then if somebody--my grandmother had been married a couple of times and stuff, so there were stepsisters and brothers and such.  But he was--his grandfather had a huge influence on him.  And the grandfather, my grandfather--whose name was George Ingol, at one time, had a sawmill and had both blacks and whites working for him.  He was very, very successful.  And he could pass for white.  And my, and my grandmother would tell the story of how the home was burned down.  You know, they lived in a very nice house, yeah.  And all of a sudden, there was a fire outside of the house.  And, you know, she always suspected that it had been purposely burned down.  And, so they left wherever they were, and I think they moved to--they were in Ohio or something or the other, and then they moved away.  And I, you know, I get the sense of that's really what kind of killed my great-grandfather's business.  But he died when my dad was about thirteen.  So my father talks with him, talks about him with such joy.  Because he would listen to him, you know.  He would take walks with his grandfather and listen to his stories and listen to him talk about the importance of hard work and business and owning your own--and that sort of thing.  So, you know, as a child my father was very, very driven.  And was determined that he would grow up and be a doctor because the doctors were the ones who had the money.  The doctors were the ones who had the houses.  Well, my mom got pregnant, and then they moved up to Chicago [Illinois].  And, now he needs to figure out a way to take care of his family.  And then I, you know, I came along two years later, and my brother [Corona Tucker] is eight years younger.  So, you know, my father worked two and three jobs, you know, when he came to Chicago.  And he also went to school at the same time, went to junior college.  And just, you know, determined that he would not be poor, and his family would not be poor.
Story_ID: 647699
Speaker 1: He is an amazing man, he really is.  You know, he's done an incredible job of filling in for my mom [Emma Hill Tucker].  You know, just kind of filling in for her after she passed, which was a very, very difficult time for all of us because it would happen so quickly.  But you know, my dad [Ernest Tucker] is, my dad has always been my rock, you know.  And that's why I said it was such a great childhood because, you know, I had this mother who provided everything that a child would need in terms of love and just always there.  And then I had this father who was the perfect balance of strength, you know and just always able to say the right thing when you needed it and always able to just make sense of the world.  And you knew you could always turn to him.  You know, growing up, you know, when I would get teased about being too black, you know.  And when the boys in grammar school [William Cullen Bryant School, Chicago, Illinois] would tell me that I was pretty, but I couldn't be their girlfriend because I was too black, you know.  And I would go home, you know, crying to my father.  And he would say to me, "But you're my pretty little black girl.  And you're the prettiest black girl in the world."  And I suspect he must have said that a lot because that gave me strength, you know, that it didn't make a difference what the boys thought, you know.  The man who was the most important man to me said I was his little black baby, and I was the prettiest black baby in the world.  And that's the kind of strength that I think women need, young girls need, you know.  When you're--that you have somebody (claps hands) who has your back.  And when I went away to college [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], you know, he said to me that I didn't have to do anything that I didn't want to do.  I didn't have to be with anybody I didn't want to be with because he would always take care of me, you know.  "I got your back."  So no matter where I went, I knew that I could always go home.  And I always wanted to go home because there was this fabulous food that would be there, that would be there and this really comforting home.  And, you know, then there was this, this father who just had your back.
Story_ID: 647700
Speaker 1: So it sounds like you were very close with both of your parents [Emma Hill Tucker and Ernest Tuckers].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who--
Speaker 2: I like them.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, I didn't just love them.  Mom and I laughed a lot.  We would go shopping a lot.  I don't shop like I used to because there was nobody better to shop with.  Because she'd call me, and she'd say, "Dot [HistoryMaker Dorothy Tucker], Dot, Dot, there's a sale going on."  I'm like, "Oh, I got to go," (laughter).  And I'd go pick her up.  Or I'd call her up and say, "Mom, Mom, there's a warehouse sale, and we got to go."  And we may not buy anything.  But that was not the point, you know.  And then it was a running joke that even after I, you know, had money, I would still go out to lunch and say, "Are you going to buy me lunch?  You're treating, right?  You're treating, because you're supposed to treat.  You know, because you're the mom, you're supposed to treat."  And she would go like, "How is it that you never have any money?  You never have any money," (laughter).  And we would just spend all day shopping and hanging out.
Story_ID: 647701
Speaker 1: Who do you think you're the most like?
Speaker 2: My dad [Ernest Tucker].  Oh, absolutely my dad.  You know, my dad is easily the center of attention most places and very outgoing, very outgoing.  And yeah, I'm the spitting image of my father.  We think very much alike.  Very--again, both of us are very driven.  I mean, I think I inherited just naturally a lot of his personality.  Yeah, and, so, you know, we just--today we get along, we get along very well.
Story_ID: 647702
Speaker 1: Were you a daddy's girl?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely, a daddy's girl, absolutely--and proud to be a daddy's girl, you know.  I think one of the reasons that I kept my last name was because I'm just very proud of my father [Ernest Tucker].  I'm very proud of that name. And, you know, I don't know that it started out that way.  I think when I was about, I made the decision when I was about twelve years old.  And people think that I kept the name because I'm in television.  I made this decision when I was about twelve that I wanted, I didn't understand why girls who grow up get married and change their name.  You know, and I just remember going and seeing the tombstones.  And there would be two names.  Or there would be the last name, the married name, and then somebody would have to come along and explain that that wasn't the name she was born with.  And I just always thought, well, why don't we just--the name that you're born with, why don't you just die with that name?  And we could eliminate all this confusion and this explanation.  So in my, you know, little young mind at twelve, I decided then that I would, I would keep my name.  And then as I got older, trying to explain to people why, you know, I was so insistent upon keeping my last name; you know, and then it was kind of like, "And you know what?  I like this name.  That's my daddy's name."
Story_ID: 647703
Speaker 1: My father [Ernest Tucker] is one of the few African Americans in this country who has his own screw machine shop, his own die shop--in the country.  And it's a business that he started when I guess I was about thirteen years old.  He went into business, and it's still in, you know, it's called Precise Products [Precise Products Inc.] in Warrenville [Illinois].  And, you know, he took his money that he had saved and went into business.  And there just aren't a lot of them around, who have factories.  You know, African Americans who make little dies and tools for, you know, other companies and corporations.  And I am, I am very, very, proud of him.  And he, and he's taught me so much about, about business. You know, he has property.
Story_ID: 647704
Speaker 1: When I was away to school at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], all the kids there were on scholarship, you know.  And they had to work in the afternoons.  I didn't tell anybody that I didn't have to work, and that I wasn't on scholarship.  Because it--like everybody African American, all the black kids said they were on scholarships, or they had grants, and they had to go off and work and my father [Ernest Tucker] wouldn't allow me to work in college, because he was like, "You have one job.  Your job is to go to school.  That's your job."  So I mean I was as poor as they were, because he wouldn't let me work.  You know, he gave me a budget.  "This is what you will spend.  And you will just make this work."  So, and I couldn't, I wasn't going out spending a lot of money because I didn't have it.  Because he, you know, he wouldn't, he wouldn't give it to me.  And that was fine because that's the way we'd been brought up anyway on a budget.  So I didn't, I wasn't angry about being on this budget.  That's just the way--what life was.  But it was, you know, it was kind of funny when--I think I was--freshman year.  I did very well, and spring break came around.  And my dad said, you know, "Where do you want to go?"  And while all the other kids were going home for spring break, we went to the Bahamas.  And this was different back then.  I'm talking 19--the early '70s [1970s], you know.  We went, we went to the Bahamas and went on vacation.  And most spring breaks and whatever, you know, I would go all kinds of different places.  And, you know, and then somewhere along the way, Dad had bought--and his partner--bought a condo in Florida.  And we would, you know, go down to Florida and hang out--not as much as my parents wanted me to because I was, you know, I was up and busy and stuff.  But I, you know, everybody just kind of assumed that, you know, I was the poor little girl from the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 647705
Speaker 1: You were talking about your father [Ernest Tucker].  I just want to back up a second.  Did he talk to you about what his life was, growing up in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: It was hard, yeah.  Life for Dad was difficult.  He talked about being afraid constantly of losing his mother [Lillie Belle Ingol Spates] because he remembered vividly losing his father.  And, so he was a very obedient child.  And if his siblings did anything wrong, he was the one who was obedient, and he was the one who protected his mother because he was so afraid that he would lose her.  Even though that there, you know, there were relatives around, he always, he always felt that he'd be on his own if something happened to her.  He left Mississippi because he was also afraid that he would kill a white man, and he'd end up dead.  You know, it was that time when he saw his uncles, and he saw a lot of things that, you know, it was interesting that he never, he never talked about--it took years for him to tell me some of the things.  And I asked him once, and he said he didn't want me to grow up bitter.  You know, he didn't want me to grow up angry like he was.  But, you know, I just re- remember him telling the story of how his father, you know, I guess had--a white man came to the door and was angry about something and was cursing.  And his father said, "You will not disrespect my family this way."  And, you know, got his shotgun and aimed it at him and said, you know, "Off the property.  You don't come in my house and disrespect my family that way."  And, you know, and I think that left an impression with my father--that it was important to protect your family, make sure that your family was respected.  And somewhere along the way he realized, he said when he was about sixteen--with the things that were going on that he knew to leave because he was not going to survive because he would get angry at the injustices.  And, you know, I think he was afraid that he would do the wrong thing, say the wrong thing and end up dead.  And he wouldn't, he has always said he would never, ever move back to Mississippi.  He won't.  He'll visit a lot and love his people.  But he said he would never, ever move back there.
Speaker 1: It sounds like he got a lot of his strength from his father.
Speaker 2: A lot of his strength from his father.  You know, his father had a reputation for being the man in the community, who just everybody even almost feared and everybody respected.  You know, you didn't mess with Henry Tucker, you didn't mess with Henry Tucker's family.  So it was kind of like somebody else might cow down, but not Henry Tucker.  And, so my father is a very, very, very proud man.  So he was fortunate.  I mean, I think from my grandmother he learned a lot of compassion.  My grandmother was a very religious woman, you know.  So he was, you know, raised with a very strong, God fearing, you know, kind of upbringing.  So it was a good balance.

Speaker 1: Tell us a little (cough), a little bit about your [paternal] grandmother.  What was her name?
Speaker 2: Lillie, Lillie Belle Spates [Lillie Belle Ingol Spates].  Lillie Belle Ingol when she was growing up.  She found religion at eight or nine.  And, you know, she tells the story she remembers when she was saved in the backyard.  She, her mother [Alice Ingol] died early as well.  And she would always tell the story of sitting, of going to the funeral and sitting on the casket and begging them to let her sit on the casket.  And they did.  And, so she rode the casket.  You know, while the horse was taking the casket, she sat on the back of it while it went to the funeral home to bury her mom.  She was a daddy's girl, you know.  She was her father's [George Ingol] favorite, I think.  And she talked a lot about her grand- her father.  And she was obviously very proud of him.  And, so that's where I got the stories of the sawmill and the store and the farm.  And they lived, it seemed, a very, very good life until the fire, until they lost everything and had to move.  You know, so it was clear from the stories that things changed, and she was angry about that.  And it was interesting.  I never--they made a point of not passing along the really bad negative stories in their anger.  You know, they made a point of that--both my father [Ernest Tucker] and my grandmother.  It was only years later when my grandmother told the story of the fire again.  And we'd heard it many times.  And, you know, and she finally talked about how her stepmother--oh, but maybe it was her mom--had carried a piece of furniture out of the house because they were trying to get things out of the house.  And the fire was raging, and they were not able to save that much.  And this was only a few years ago, just a few years before she passed.  And it was the first time I heard her say--and she was sitting on the couch and she looked up at me, and she said, "Be careful of white people.  It's okay to like them but don't trust them."  And she'd never said anything like that before.  And she wouldn't explain, but she had just told the story of the fire.  You know, so I'm sure that there was still a very--you know, hurt and anger.  But you know, never had any proof, but she was just like--but she, you know, she lived with us.  So I knew, I knew my grandmother very well.  She lived with us for about seventeen years.  And she was very strict, because she was very religious--I mean, not strict, strict.  She--we could not play music in the house, really, when she was around.  You know, the music that we would dance to, we had to be very careful when we played it and stuff, because she didn't like it.  And we couldn't wash on Sundays, and we couldn't iron on Sundays.  We could do absolutely nothing on Sundays because that was God's day.  So, and again, you know, it was all part of life when I grew up.  And you, if you had to prepare for something on Monday for school, you had to do it on Saturday.  So all of the gym clothes had to be ironed and washed, and everything taken care of by Saturday because she didn't do anything on Sunday.  And she, you know, she would take the bus to church all over the city until she was like ninety something odd years old, and she was still taking the bus.  And she walked everywhere, she walked everywhere, to visit relatives or just--because she was very, she was very tall, a very stately woman.  And very healthy, you know, very strong and, you know, very opinionated.  And she and I would get into it sometimes because I would challenge her.  You know, I would always say, "Well, why?  Well, but why did you do that?"  And, "Why did you think that?"  And, "Why did you end up doing--," (laughter) so she would eventually get to the point, "That's it.  I'm done.  Don't ask me anymore," (laughter).  But I see, I look like her.  I saw a picture of her once on the side view, and then I saw a photo of myself.  And I have her, you know, I have, I have her shape.  I have her hair texture.  I look very much like my grandmother (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did she have a dimple?
Speaker 2: No.  Nobody else in the family had dimples.  That was so weird.  Nobody, I don't know where the dimple came from.  My son has a dimple, but nobody else, you know, I don't know where the dimples came from (laughter).
Story_ID: 647707
Speaker 1: And you said that her mother [Alice Ingol] died when she was fairly young?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did other people in the family tell her any stories about, you know, what would be your [paternal] great-grandmother and grand- grandfather [George Ingol]?
Speaker 2: You know, the only things that I can really remember about her talking about her mother was just the discipline.  You know, that her mother was the, you know, the kind of woman who would not--had to keep everybody in line.  And my grandmother [Lillie Belle Ingol Spates] said that she was spoiled, you know, and her dad would spoil her, and she was a very spoiled little girl.  And she would have to, she would get spankings with the, you know, the branch.  And she'd have to go and get the branch, you know, that sort of thing, when they were growing up.  But I don't, you know, if she did, which I'm sure she did--I just can't remember.  I just can't remember.  I know, and I guess most of the stories were mostly about her father, you know, than they were, pretty much than they were, than they were her mother.  And everybody was--we didn't grow up around my grandmother's siblings.  So, I think because of that, we didn't hear as many stories about my grandmother's mother, my great-grandmother.
Story_ID: 647708
Speaker 1: Your grandfather [Henry Tucker], did he die young also, or?
Speaker 2: On my dad's side?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: No, because he died when my dad [Ernest Tucker] was about thirteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So no, he was around a very long time.  You know, my dad just--he was the kind of man who--again, very much a hard worker, you know.  And Dad would just kind of tell stories of how they would go and walk and walk.  And that's when he would share with him about business.  And, you know, my father would talk about how one of the reasons that he went into business was because he knew he had it in him because it had been passed down from his grandfather [George Ingol].  And, you know, he had these huge sawmills, and they made so much.  And he had all of these people working for him, blacks and whites.  And he just, you know, described him as a very tall man who could have easily passed for white.  And I think, I remember him telling the story about the travel.  They actually lived in one of the Carolinas, I believe, at some point.  And I can't--there was something about having to pretend that my grand- my great-grandmother [Alice Ingol] was his slave, you know, as they were, as they were traveling together.  But they were, they were, they were married.  You know, had to--must have been very interesting times (laughter).
Story_ID: 647709
Speaker 1: Having a sawmill in Mississippi must have been something, I mean somewhat extraordinary.
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  You know, I look at, you know, just--on both sides of my family, you know, you've got my [paternal] great-grandfather, George Ingol, with the sawmill.  And then on my mom's side was George as well, George Trice [George Trice, Sr.], who was like--was born a slave and was taught to read by the master's daughter, who was eight years old.  And she taught him to read.  And he went on to have twelve children, and made sure--the one thing he said to them was that, "You will never sign anything" because he didn't want them to lose the land.  And he educated every one of them, every one of them.  And that's just how important, you know, education was at that time.  And I mean, educated them to the point of--the majority of them went to college.
Speaker 1: And you said he was born into slavery?
Speaker 2: He was born into slavery.
Speaker 1: Was that Mississippi also?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  And their land--actually, we were down there recently because we're still trying to learn more and more and more about the history.  He actually bought a hundred and sixty acres in more of a swamp area because that's, you know, what they would allow you to buy.  That's what was sold to him.  And somewhere along the way, a white man said, "No, we're going to give you that land over there, as opposed to this," because this was thought to be a better plot of land.  And I think it was closer to the railroad, and it was going to come through.  And, so it would have obviously have been a better location and a, you know, we would have had--been able to make more money off of it.  So he was forced to take the other plot of land.  So he did.  And then of course, that's probably when it came, "Well, don't sign anything, because we don't want to lose this land."  So today we went--last year we went to see the original land that he would have had.  And it was never developed.  It's just there, you know.  And my family--they're not near a railroad track.  But at some point, there was oil on the land (laughter).  And for a very long time, family members would get checks because of the oil that was on the Trice land.  And I don't know whether we--I think they still kind of get little cuts or something or other.  You know, and it was very good land, and they would raise cattle and soybeans.  You know, you could do whatever you wanted to do in your little plot of land.  I used to always tease my mother [Emma Hill Tucker] and tell her there were so many people in the family now--so many siblings and stuff--I figured by the time it was down to me, I'd have about this (demonstrates) much, but that I wanted my little square share (laughter).  But, you know, it's really kind of comforting to know you've got a plot of land in Mississippi you can go back to.  But he would--and nobody ever, nobody ever signed away the land.  They held on to it.  And I think that's what--on my dad's side, somewhere along the way they lost the business, they lost the property.  You know, I think one of the brothers or something ended up signing something away, you know.  And my dad [Ernest Tucker] learned from that.  You know, my dad learned from that.
Story_ID: 647710
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned that that great-grandfather [sic. maternal great-great-grandfather, George Trice, Sr.] was taught to read by an eight year old girl--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --on the plantation.  Did you ever find out who the plantation owner was?
Speaker 2: No.  We are, we have been trying, trust me.  There are a couple of cousins and I--we have gone back.  And, you know, we can, we can see the rolls.  And she's, you know, she's found it in the courthouse, but we cannot find, we can't quite find yet who owned, where they came from.  Because they didn't, they were somewhere else.  They were not--he left--I want to say he came to Mississippi, and I believe he was in Alabama prior to that.  So they're not--the original owners are not in Mississippi, they were not in Mississippi.  They were somewhere else.  But at one point we can see that he was, he was a Trice.  And I think her mother, Sarah [Sarah Mobley Trice], was like George's wife, great-great-grandmother.  Sarah was at least perhaps half Native American, Chickasaw.  Sarah was part Chickasaw.  So we were able to go back, and we found somebody.  Actually we found this, this time we went back, we had, we visited a white man who believes that Sarah may have been his great aunt.  And he says that because--and he showed us photos of his grandfather.  And, you know, in just in talking, they were all from--Sarah was kind of from that area or something, and the photograph that we have of Sarah and his father, there's a similarity there, you know.  Do we see the similarity because we wanted to?  I don't know.  But we're trying, we're really trying to figure it out, and we haven't yet.  It's difficult.
Speaker 1: Yeah, very difficult.
Speaker 2: It's just very, very difficult.
Speaker 1: Especially when you try to get back into the slave records.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, well, we can see records of every child.  You know, from the census we can see that.  But, we don't have anything before that.
Speaker 1: And often from the slave records, they just put a first name.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So that makes it even more difficult.
Speaker 2: It's very difficult.
Speaker 1: And I guess, you know, your great-great-grandfather, he came from Alabama to Mississippi.  Mississippi was a place that a lot of slaves did not want to go.  They were sold in Mississippi, and that was someplace that, you know, that was not the best place to go during slavery times.
Speaker 2: No.  But remember, you know, I don't think, I mean he was born into slavery but--I remember correctly, and I did try to figure it out.  By the time slavery ended, where they're at--they left wherever this plantation was.  But he definitely was old enough, you know, he was definitely old enough to have been taught.  And he may have been, he may have been only like eight or nine years old, as well.  You know, if he wasn't--because you got to remember--back then he was probably her age.  They were playing together and, you know, she teaches him how to read.  So he only got up, he only had a third grade education because that's about where she was (laughter).  You know, so he was fairly, he was probably fairly young at the time.
Story_ID: 647711
Speaker 1: Now let's talk a little bit about your growing up years.  Where did you go to--well, you actually were born in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: I was born in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What's your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Sitting on the back porch.  We lived at 1331 Tripp [Avenue].  And actually before that--so maybe I was about two or three years old, we lived on Kolin Street [sic. Kolin Avenue], which was about a block away.  It was maybe in the 1200 block of Kolin.  And we lived with another family.  And I--they weren't relatives, but we shared kind of an apartment with another family.  And the first childhood memory is a grownup coming in the door, slamming the door and breaking the glass.  And we got blamed for it.  The children got blamed for it.  And I just--it didn't make a difference that we were saying, "We didn't do it, we didn't do it."  It was, you know, "You guys were playing around, and you broke the door."  And this grownup never 'fessed up, and he let us take the heat for that one (laughter).  And I wish I could figure out who that was, so I could go and find them. That--and I had to be maybe three years old at that time.  And I remember the house, though.  You know, I remember living in that apartment and the cocktail table.  And I just, and I can see it.  And my father [Ernest Tucker] just always would tell the story of how I would climb on the cocktail table.  And he would keep saying, "Get off the cocktail table.  Get off the cocktail table," you know.  And, so I must have been two then.  I don't remember climbing on the cocktail table.  But, you know, I've heard him tell that story many times.  But probably the better, most vivid memory, is wanting so badly to go to school and waiting--sitting outside.  And I was, and I must have been four then, because my sister [Joyce Tucker Boykins] would have been--she went away.  She went to school.  And, you know, we'd always play together, and now my playmate was gone.  So I would put my clothes on and go sit on the back porch and wait for her to come home.  And I probably did that quite a bit, because that one is very vivid--just kind of sitting on the back porch, just waiting for her to come home from school.  And then finally, the first day of school [at William Cullen Bryant School, Chicago, Illinois], and being with my mom [Emma Hill Tucker] and having her walk me to school.  And, you know, she was holding my hand.  And we'd get to the door, and I was so excited, I was so excited.  You know, I just, I turned around and she was crying.  You know, she was crying.  And I, you know, I just kind of, you know, remember wanting to hurry up and get inside this building so I could go to school.  And, you know, she was just standing there in a very long, plaid skirt, and she was just staring at me.  And she was crying.
Speaker 1: Now was this preschool or kindergarten, first grade?
Speaker 2: This had to be kindergarten, this had to be kindergarten.  And all I can remember thinking, crying, really?  This is the best time.  This is so much fun (laughter).  You know, but I was her baby, because my brother [Corona Tucker] wasn't born then.  So I was, I was her baby girl and going off.
Story_ID: 647712
Speaker 1: How many siblings did you have?
Speaker 2: My sister's [Joyce Tucker Boykins] twenty-two months older; and my brother [Corona Tucker] is about eight years younger.  It's just, just the three of us.  So it was just the two of us for a very long time.  So we kind of--my sister and I are very close, very, very close.
Speaker 1: What was your household like?  What kind of things did you do as a family?
Speaker 2: Dad [Ernest Tucker] worked a lot.  You know, I remember he would come home and, you know, we could hear the key coming in the door.  And I would run into his arms.  And he would say, "What's the first thing you're supposed to do?"  And we'd say, "Think."  That was always important, that you have to think before you do anything, think before you do anything.  And he would just say, "What's the first thing you're supposed to do?"  And of course, we eventually said, think without thinking, (laughter) because that's just--because we were very trained.  But we would spend Sunday dinners together and go out on Sundays.  And, you know, Dad thought that it was really important that we understood that the community, that the world was larger than our neighborhood.  So he would put us in the car, the whole family, and, you know, we'd go and visit somebody.  But sometimes we'd just drive around the city.  And he'd take us, you know, then he'd say, "This is what this part of the city looks like.  This is what this part of city looks like."  And, you know, it was important that we not grow up and just stay here.  He wanted us to grow, and, "You have to leave here to grow."  You know, and, "There's so much more than just this."  So we did, we would go out and just drive.  Like I said, we went south a lot, because there were relatives down there.  So, we'd take family trips to Mississippi.  And as we got older, we would take a family trip and drive to New York.  I think we, I think the first plane ride was maybe when I was about sixteen years old, and we flew to New York.  But growing up in the apartment before we moved into a house, it was just kind of mostly just the dinners, and Sunday dinners--and having all the relatives.  People just dropped by all the time, all the time.  Because that's what, you know, that's what you did a lot.  Everything was centered around lots of food because my mom was the best cook among everybody.  So everybody came to Emma's [Emma Hill Tucker] house to eat (laughter).
Speaker 1: And this was on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: This was on the West Side.
Story_ID: 647713
Speaker 1: You grew up on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you describe your block and your neighbors?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We lived in a three story brick yellow apartment building.  I think there were at least a, at least a dozen--eighteen apartments in this, in this building.  We, once we left Kolin [Avenue] and shared the house, and the next place was on 1331 South Tripp [Avenue].  That's where we spent--I mean I spent the--we didn't leave there until I was in seventh grade [at Roswell B. Mason Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois].  So we were there for several years.  There was a house next door, a single family home next door.  And then--it was mostly single family homes on the block, as a matter of fact.  There was maybe another apartment building on the block but mostly single family homes.  There was a corner store, you know, that we would, we were allowed to walk to after we got a little older.  And a little older back then was maybe six, (laughter) you know, maybe seven--we could walk to the corner store if we went together and stuff.  So, you know, mostly, mostly families in the houses.  The people who lived downstairs was a single mom raising four girls.  And there was a woman upstairs who my mom [Emma Hill Tucker] was friends with.  It was just she and her husband.  I think her daughter was--she had a son or a daughter who was gone, who was grown and had left the house.  And I don't remember there being a lot of fathers around.  But I kind of felt like they were in their lives, in these families' lives, you know.  But I don't remember seeing a lot of fathers.  But it probably was because they worked sometime.
Speaker 1: What was the racial makeup in the--
Speaker 2: It was all black.  It was all black, yeah, yeah.  And this was--I don't, I don't remember anybody else, any other race there.  And we lived not too far from Roosevelt Road.  And those stores were owned by whites, Jewish people--and I was told that.  I mean, at the time I'm sure I didn't know if they were Jewish or what they were.  But, you know, I just remember all the storefronts there.  But we didn't go up there very often.  You know, there probably was really no need for us to go.  There was a grocery store on 16th [Street].  I can't remember the name of it, but that's where we'd get groceries.  And we did a lot of shopping on Madison [Street] and Pulaski [Road].  We did, we did our school shopping or whatever we were shopping for, clothing.  Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] on Homan [Avenue], we got a lot of our clothing from Sears on Homan.  I didn't mind.  My mom would go to the bargain basement of Sears or the bargain basement of Goldblatts which was on Madison at the time and get us the shoes.  And they would have the rubber that would connect the shoes, because they'd come from the big table of shoes.  My sister [Joyce Tucker Boykins] hated that.  To my sister, it was an indication that the shoes weren't that expensive.  I, it didn't bother me at all.  I didn't care where the shoes came from.  But I just--that was--I don't know why that was significant, but she didn't like it.  So my mom, of course, would buy the shoes from there, but she'd cut off, she'd cut those little, (laughter) you know, and then give them to my sister before she could see them.  But it was, it was, it was, there were a lot of kids on the block, a lot of kids.  And I particularly remember the family next door--there--it was a huge house, and we could see the house from our window.  We could look out our window, and it faced one of their windows on the second floor.  And they seemed to have six or seven kids in this single family house.  And the rest of them was in another family house.  So there were a lot of kids to play with, a lot of kids to fight with.  You know, I used to get into a lot of fights when I was, when I was growing up--mostly because people would pick on my sister who was older than I was but very tiny and skinny and just shy.  So I'd have to, you know, protect her and stuff.  So I think sometimes people think, there's no way in the world that little girl could ever have ended up on television (laughter).  And I remember my mom would have to go and apologize to the people across the hall because there was some kid obviously I just kept beating up.  And she would go, "I'm so sorry."  You know, she'd drag me over there and make me apologize (laughter) to his family for what I'd done.  But it was a, it was a fun block. You know, I mean, I just remember jumping rope all the time and playing baseball.  And there was a vacant lot right next to the building, and we would play ball there a lot.  Or we'd play baseball, softball out in the alley.
Story_ID: 647714
Speaker 1: When I was in seventh grade [at Roswell B. Mason Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois], my mom [Emma Hill Tucker] said, "You know, you can't do this anymore."  Because all I wanted to do was play softball and play out in the alley with the boys and stuff.  Because the girls weren't doing this, you know.  But I, you know, the boys still were.  So, and she was like, "No, you can't do this anymore."  And I'm like, "Why?"  You know, you know, "Because you're a girl.  You know, you need to act like a girl.  You can't do this."  And I just thought that was so wrong.  I just thought that was so wrong, yeah.  So, now my life stops because all of a sudden I'm supposed to be a girl, and I can't play baseball anymore.  And of course, she would say that, and I would still go out and play ball (laughter).
Speaker 2: So did you consider yourself a tomboy?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  I was definitely a tomboy.  I was a tomboy, and I just--and only because, again, the girls were very girly.  And I was very good at softball, you know.  So the boys definitely wanted to play with me because I could compete.  I could keep up with them and stuff, you know, hitting the ball, and running and stuff.  So I ended up playing with them a lot.  And I didn't, I would wear shorts up under my dresses to school every day, every day.  Of course, the idea of having to wear that dress did not make me happy.  So I put, I put my shorts on up under the dress.  And, you know, I'm sure my mom knew.  And she was--probably kind of went, "Let it go, let it go, whatever, whatever."
Story_ID: 647715
Speaker 1: I hated to comb my hair, hated.  I thought, I couldn't understand why if I combed it yesterday, we had to do this every day.  (Laughter) To me it was like, "It's in a braid, it's in a ponytail.  What's the problem?"  And that was just, like, the source of my aggravation--her [Tucker's mother, Emma Hill Tucker] pulling my hair and combing it.  And it was just, it hurt so bad.  And of course, now I realize it was because it hadn't been combed in three or four days (laughter).  I didn't know what to do.  And she would, she would just, "Go get the brush, go get the comb, go get the brush."  You know, and I tried to get out of it every which way I could because I just didn't want to--I didn't want to sit through it.  And I think that's what bothered me, to have to sit there and let you comb my hair.  I have to sit through this?  So I was a, I was a difficult child in that regard.  And because she, and then she would press my sister's [Joyce Tucker Boykins] hair and, but she wouldn't press mine.  Me--she just, like, you know, "Put some water and some grease on it.  You'll be fine."  I'm like, "Okay, but if you're going to do this--." This is after I got a little older, "But now I want you to press my hair.  I want you to use the straightening comb on my hair."  "You don't need a straightening comb."  "Why can't I have a straightening comb," (laughter)?  So it was, it was, it was fun.
Story_ID: 647716
Speaker 1: I, you know, remember the fights.  Some of the fights were because I'd go to school, and the girls would tell me, the kids would tell me that I sounded like a little white girl.  And they would tease me.  And it wasn't so much--and the teasing I could do, you know.  I didn't, I didn't give in to the teasing.  They would tease me, and it would be okay.  But when they, when they would mess with my sister [Joyce Tucker Boykins] though, you know, then that's when, that's when I would have to, I'd have to fight.  And I remember giving this girl--I remember telling this girl if she would just leave my sister alone, I would give her a nickel.  And then she came up and she said she was going to beat my sister up.  And, now came the time I had to give her a nickel.  And I didn't want to give her my nickel (laughter).  So it was going to be a fight.  "No, we're going to have to fight."  And, so we did.  And we fought and, you know, you kind of had to send that message to the rest of them that you're not going to extort money from me.  And that's like--this is not going to happen.  So I had to become probably a little badder than my parents [Emma Hill Tucker and Ernest Tucker] knew because I didn't want to have to deal with that every day.  So the kids on the block probably thought I was a little bit of a bully.  And my--of course, Dad thought I was an angel (laughter).
Story_ID: 647717
Speaker 1: But it sounds like at a very early age that, number one, you were tough; and number two, you had strength to recognize that being a female should never be a hindrance to you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I did.  I didn't--there--the boys in the class were my competition, even academically.  You know, my goal was to be smarter than Lemont Lennox [ph.], and he was the smartest boy in the class.  So I competed with him, and I wanted to be, I wanted to be the best.  You know, I wanted to be the smartest.  And I did not, I didn't like it when I, when I was told that I couldn't do something because, because I was a girl. You know, even in, even in high school [Austin High School, Chicago, Illinois] it--we didn't have a girls swim team.  The boys had a swim team.  And I loved to swim.  And, so I joined the boys swimming team because it was like I should be able to swim.  Well, they wouldn't let me compete, but the boys who were selected for the team were the boys who could beat me.  Because that was the kind of the, you know, the coach would let me come to the practices and stuff.  And I would, I would swim with the boys, but I wasn't allowed to be on the team.  But I could swim faster than most of them and if--it was the worst thing in the world, if I beat them.  Oh, my god (laughter).  That was the worst thing in the world.  So, and, but I never even looked at it as--and those were the rules.  I didn't like the rules, but I didn't want to be prevented from, you know, doing what I wanted to do, which was to swim and to play baseball.

Speaker 1: Now (clears throat), you said you (clears throat), excuse me, you fought a lot to protect your sister [Joyce Tucker Boykins].  You mentioned earlier that some of the kids might tease you about your skin tone.  Did that precipitate fights?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I don't know why.  I think that I, I didn't fight over that.  I accepted that.  And I think it was because--and there was nothing I could do about that.  And that was, that didn't make me angry, that just hurt me.  You know, that one just hurt me, having the little boys tell me that they just weren't going to--I couldn't be their girlfriend because I was too dark.  But the girls never did it, you know.  It was just, it was, it was, it was just the, it was just the boys.  It was just the boys, who wanted to--it was okay to be my friend.  And, so they didn't treat me bad.  And it was almost kind of like they were saying, "You know, we like you, it's too bad you're dark," (laughter).  You know, so you didn't feel like, you know, you knew they liked you, because they always wanted to be around you and, you know, include you in things.  But you couldn't go to the next level.  You could not be the girlfriend.  You know, not--and it wasn't like at that time I was really thinking about being their girlfriend.  But, you know, they just wanted to make it clear that, you know, you can't be the girlfriend because you're, because you're too dark.  But no, I never, I never fought.  And I think what was, you know, would probably help--like I said--was because, you know, when I would go home and cry to my father [Ernest Tucker] he would, you know, he would, he would make me feel better.  And that--by the time I got maybe--I clearly remember that was just about the time, you know, or soon after that--it was, say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud.  You know, so, I was saved by that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, when all of a sudden black became okay or, you know, and we moved into that whole era of black pride.  So I was, I think I was, I think I was saved by that, in that regard.  So I didn't, I didn't face that.  I didn't face that in high school [Austin High School, Chicago, Illinois] at all.
Story_ID: 647719
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned that you moved into a house, but you're still on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: We're still on the West Side.  We just moved to, we moved from Lawndale, K Town [North Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois] to Austin [Chicago, Illinois].  When my--so I did eighth grade [at Robert Emmet Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  You know, I did eighth grade because my dad [Ernest Tucker] didn't want me--he wasn't really crazy about me going to the high school.  By then my father was beginning to see that he needed to get me out of that neighborhood.  You know, he was, you know, I think--because he talked about it later.  He was beginning to see that I, you know, his fear was that as I got older, you know, I would be more involved with the kids in the community and stuff.  And he was like, "No, I don't want her to go to that high school."  It would have been--and I think it would have been Marshall, which is not a bad high school, but Austin [Austin High School, Chicago, Illinois] was better.  That's really what it, you know, kind of amounted to.  And my sister [Joyce Tucker Boykins], he didn't let my sister go to Marshall High School [John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois].  He sent her to an all girls school, Lucy Flowers [Lucy Flower Technical High School, Chicago, Illinois].  So, you know, he wanted to make sure--I'm going to hold that thought.  You didn't--pause it for a minute?  I'm going to go to the--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: And you mentioned that your father sent your sister to an all girls school.  And I think you said the name, but I don't think I got it.
Speaker 1: Lucy Flower High School.  Lucy Flowers, with an S [sic.].  It was on the West Side as well.  So she went there for two years, and then we moved to the Austin neighborhood.  Because when my dad went into business, he had said to my mom [Emma Hill Tucker], you know, he was saving all this money.  And my mom, of course, wanted a house.  You know, she wanted a house.  And Dad was working two jobs, sometimes three jobs, to save this money.  And she basically said to him, you know, "If you don't get in the business, we need a house."  And my dad promised her that.  "If I can't find a business, then we'll take the money and buy a house."  So she had to wait a little longer because he did find a business.  But then a couple of years after that, he did buy a house for her.  And, so we moved to the home that he's still in, in Austin.  And he, you know, wanted to also get me and my sister both to a better high school.  And Austin, at the time, was an excellent, excellent high school.  So we were--there, we were like the third black family on the block.  When we moved in the beginning of the summer, literally, by the time school started, there were no white people in the block.  I am not exaggerating.  And I can remember the people next door.  We came shortly after they did.  But then, everybody else--and it was a long block, the 5300 block of Gladys [Avenue], long block.  Everybody else was white.  And, you know, there was like graffiti on the garage next door.  You know, some nasty graffiti had been painted, some anti-black graffiti.  And, you know, we were a little bit concerned.  But by the end of the summer, you know, if there was a white person on the block, we certainly didn't know it.  We certainly didn't know it.  It changed just that quickly.  And the whole neighborhood--just everything changed, literally, in a matter of months, in a matter of months.  It was amazing.  And by the time we got to Austin, I think my sister--I went into eighth grade, and my sister was going into her junior year at Austin.  And there were a number of white kids in her class.  By the time I became a freshman, she became a senior, she may have had two or three.  But I think there was maybe one white girl in my class.  As a freshman and eighth grade there was, you know, one white girl in my class.  And I felt sorry for her, I felt very sorry for her.
Speaker 2: But to go just for one summer--I mean that's white flight as--
Speaker 1: Oh, my god.
Speaker 2: --fast as it could go.
Speaker 1: It was amazing.  It was amazing.  And we, and we saw it.  And I can remember us going, "They're gone, they're gone," (laughter).  "Wow," you know.
Story_ID: 647720
Speaker 1: Let's back up a minute, in terms of your education.  Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: Bryant [William Cullen Bryant School, Chicago, Illinois].  Bryant elementary was K [kindergarten] through sixth grade.  And it no longer exists.
Speaker 1: Where was it located?
Speaker 2: It was located on maybe--if we lived on 12th [Street], it would have been 16th [Street]--about 14th [Street] and one of the--Kedvale [Avenue] maybe?  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure, you know, because in my world, I could tell you how to get there (laughter).  Turn the corner, go two blocks, and make another left, you know.  But I don't remember the exact street because they tore it down years ago, years ago.  It was a beautiful school, I thought.  And then I spent seventh grade at Mason Upper Grade Center [Roswell B. Mason Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois], in seventh grade.  And then eighth grade at Emmet [Robert Emmet Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], which is--I don't remember the exact address of Mason.  But it--and I think Mason--I don't think that building exists anymore either.  But Emmet just closed.  In fact, we did a story over there recently.  But Emmet was like on Central [Avenue] and Madison [Street].  So I just did one year there, though.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yes, Mrs. Taylor [ph.].  Mrs. Taylor was my third grade teacher, who was a beautiful black woman with--not just long fluffy hair, shoulder length fluffy hair.  And she was just very kind.  You know, I just, I just remember that she would always, always give me a little bit of extra work because Sheila Jackson [ph.] and I would always finish early--and Lemont [Lemont Lennox (ph.)].  So we, she would take us aside and give us something extra to do.  And I, and I--she gave me extra attention, I think, for that reason.  And I, and I, and I liked her.  And then, but then she got, she left.  She got pregnant and she left, and then she didn't come back.  And some adult came in and told us that she lost the baby, and it was probably because we drove her crazy or something.  And that was like such a cruel thing to say.  But she didn't come, she didn't come back to school after that.  And then another teacher was the sixth grade teacher whose name escapes me now, but I remembered it for a very long time.  And he was very strong.  He was a man, he was an African American.  And what's interesting is I had probably all African American teachers, you know.  He was, he eventually became the assistant principal; we had him for sixth grade.  And he was just very strict, and he ran a very strict classroom.  And I felt like I learned a lot from him.  He was very, he was very tough, but I liked him.  I liked him as well.  And then my, you know, in high school [Austin High School, Chicago, Illinois] I had my favorite teachers as well.
Story_ID: 647721
Speaker 1: You said that you were very competitive.  What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: If I didn't get an A, I'd fall apart, you know.  I remember--and it was probably third grade, and it was probably, you know, Mrs. Taylor [ph.].  The words--we had a spelling test, and I messed up on which and witch.  And I switched them around, and I got a 90 [percent] because I did the W-I-T-C-H.  You know, because the teacher wouldn't call it out, witch.  And I put them in the wrong place.  And, so I spelled them correctly--I just put the witch, W-I-T-C-H where the W-H-I-C-H should have been.  And I got a 90.  And I just fell apart, I was in tears.  And, you know, she called me up and she sat me in her lap.  And she's like, "It's okay."  "But I didn't get a hundred.  I didn't get a hundred," (laughter).  And, so she's consoling me and saying, "You know, but you still got a 90, you did really well."  But, and I, you know, it was like it's inconceivable I didn't get a hundred.  And I just expected, I expected to, you know, to get hundreds on all these and everything.  And, you know, I worked hard, but I--and my father [Ernest Tucker] expected it.  You know, I mean my father--and my, and my sister [Joyce Tucker Boykins] was--she was extremely bright.  But my father really stressed the perfection.  You know, if anybody was going to be the teacher's pet, it would be you.  If anybody was going to get the best grades, it is to be you.  So you didn't even think about it, it's just supposed to be.  And, you know, when I, when I wouldn't, I would just be devastated.  And it stayed that way for a very long time, very long time.  I, you know, I can count the Bs that I got throughout (laughter) college [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], you know, from kindergarten [at William Cullen Bryant School, Chicago, Illinois] to college.  I just--weren't a whole lot of them because you just weren't supposed to.
Speaker 1: So were you the teacher's pet?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  Because my dad took the teacher's side, you know.  He was, he was not the kind of parent who would come up and say, "Oh, you know, you did something wrong.  My child said this," you know, my dad would come up, and he would be like--you know his rule was that, you know, and Mom [Emma Hill Tucker] was the one who would come up doing Dad's bidding.  Daddy, Dad, wouldn't come to school.  But, you know, but Mom knew the rules.  It was kind of like, "If they complain about you, fix it.  They may be wrong, but that's the teacher, that's the adult.  Fix it, do what you're supposed to do."  So it was very, very--I mean there were not a whole lot of times that we ever, ever, did anything wrong in school.  You know, but you'd get back home and, you know, you just didn't want to hear it.  Dad wasn't going to put up with it.  It was, he--it was totally, totally unacceptable, and you just knew this.  You know, I can remember learning my ABCs and, you know, being in my father's lap.  And he was drilling me and drilling me and drilling me.  And, you know, I'm like, you know, I felt like I was near tears.  And he would just, like, "Let's do it again, let's do it again."  I'm just thinking, come on, you know.  And he was just, like, "No, do it again until you get it right.  Just do it again."  So, you know, that left an impression.  You didn't want to go through that again.  So you were just, like, "No, we'll just get it right," (laughter).  "We'll just get it," you know, and it became--I don't remember feeling like it was because he was going to do something.  After a point, it was like, this is--I'm just supposed to get the hundred.  I'm supposed to, I'm just supposed to be the best.  And I even kind of looked at that--even playing outside with the kids--it was supposed to be my rules, my way.  And I'll just never forget this one girl.  We're playing double dutch.  And it's like, "Okay, now, you do this, and you do this, and you do that, and you do that."  And she came around and she said, "Well, who--why do you get to say how everything's going to be?  Why are you directing?"  And I, and kind of looked at her, and I'm thinking, because that's just the way it is (laughter).  That's just the way it's supposed to be.  Are you questioning me?  Don't you know these are the rules (laughter)?  That was my first experience.  Wow, everybody doesn't go along with my way (laughter).  So I think it was a lot of my personality, unfortunately.  So the last thing I needed was a father who was saying, "You were going to do this," combined with that natural personality.  Bad news, bad, bad, bad news.
Story_ID: 647722
Speaker 1: Did that ever put pressure on you?  Or did you really, did you ever really feel pressure?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, I felt, I felt pressure.  You know, but it wasn't a, it wasn't like something bad was going to happen, you know.  And my father [Ernest Tucker] never spanked us.  I mean, I can--he spanked me one time, maybe, that I can really remember.  You know, so it wasn't like something, you know, bad was going to happen to you.  He just had a way of setting such high expectations.  You didn't want to disappoint this man.  You just didn't want to disappoint him.  Because, you know, he would, he would reward us.  You know, if we did well, you know, you'd come home with good grades, my father was so happy.  And he would, he would give you money.  He'd give us, you know, you'd get ten dollars if you got a great report card.  So, you know, "And now we're going to take you out for ice cream."  So you really wanted to make this man happy, because it was, it was worth it.  But there was this underlying pressure, you know.  And I, and I remember I wrote a letter to him when I was sixteen.  I never gave it to him, but I did write the letter, saying that I wish I would just fail just because I'm tired of the pressure. I'm tired of the pressure.  I just, I just want to fail.  I just want to, I just want to not do well, just so I can see what happens, you know.  And I put the letter in an envelope and sealed it, and said, "Open this in 1984.  You'll probably be dead by then," (laughter).  I did.  And I sealed it.  And the letter just went up--I opened the letter up when my son [Trevor Wilkins] turned sixteen, and I gave it to him.  And I said, "I want you to understand that I know how you feel about me.  I know what you're thinking.  And I can't let up on you.  And here's proof."  And I hadn't opened it.  And by then it was well beyond--it was like--he was born in '89 [1989].  He's sixteen, you know, we're talking a long time after that.  But I happened to stumble across the letter, and I gave it to him.  And I said, "I just want you to know I understand."  And I read the letter.  It was hysterical.  I was so mad at my father.  I was so mad, you know.  And who knows what it was at the time?  But it was like, "I've just had it", sixteen years old.  You know, because even then, you know, you'd get all A's, and you got a B in something.  And he would be like, "Problem?  It sure is.  You got a B."  You know, and forget the fact that you're taking all honors and AP [advanced placement] courses (laughter).  You know, but I, you know, now I knew him well enough.  And as a parent, I know that it was just, it was just an expectation, you know.  And, so it was my own perceived, "Boy, am I going to get in trouble if I don't do this."  'Cause he never said I was going to get in trouble (laughter), he didn't have to.
Story_ID: 647723
Speaker 1: We were talking about essentially your elementary school days [at William Cullen Bryant School, Chicago, Illinois] and a few other things.  Where did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: Seventh grade was Mason junior high [Roswell B. Mason Upper Grade Center], which was in Lawndale [North Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois].  You know, it was pretty nondescript.  I mean, I remember seventh grade but, you know, it was nothing really stellar, yeah.  Eighth grade was a little frustrating, because when I got to the new school, we were using the same book that I had used in seventh grade for history.  And I never understood that.  And I--that made me angry.
Speaker 1: What school was this?
Speaker 2: Emmet [Robert Emmet Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Emmet.
Speaker 2: I got to Emmet, which was supposed to be in a (air quotes) better neighborhood [Austin, Chicago, Illinois], a (air quotes) better school.  I get to the school, get to eighth grade, and I kind of started acting out in class because I was bored, because we had read this book.  You know, my mom [Emma Hill Tucker] came up, and she's kind of like--so the teacher calls because probably I was talking too much, you know, or something or the other.  I mean, you know, and she comes up and she's kind of like, "What's going on here?"  And I said, "This is the same book.  I did this already," (laughter).  "I did this.  What are we doing this for?"  And, you know, it was kind of like, "Too bad.  Do it again," (laughter).  So we did.  And eighth grade was, eighth grade was okay; but, so I graduated from Emmet and went into high school (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 647724
Speaker 1: You went to high school?
Speaker 2: Went to Austin, yeah.
Speaker 1: Austin.
Speaker 2: You know, went to Austin High School [Chicago, Illinois] freshman--and I joined a lot of things, you know.  I was, I joined the yearbook staff. I--that's when I started swimming.  Very--again, right back into--or continued the competiveness of that core girls and boys who were at the top of the class.  And my mom [Emma Hill Tucker] made me take homemaking class.  And that was the only thing she insisted that I take.  They had a sewing class and a cooking class or something or other.  But it was mostly sewing and the whole thing about how to be a homemaker.  I hated that class, I hated that class.  And she wanted me to take typing.  I refused to take typing because I wasn't going to grow up and be a secretary.  So why should I take typing?  And why was I taking this homemaking class because I had no intentions of (laughter) doing this.  And, so, but she made me take this class.  So I took the class.  So everything else though, was, you know, all of the--lots of honors classes and stuff.  And in high school, I enjoyed high school immensely.  I had a ball in high school.  You know, I had a great group of friends.  We all--my next door neighbor [Cassandra Powell] was also my best friend.  And we were in the same class, so we had our books.  We would split the books up because we had all of the same classes.  I'd take two or three of them home, she'd take two or three of them home, and then we'd scream out the window.  I'd raise my window, and she'd say, "Okay, are you done with this one?"  "Yeah, I'm done with that one."  And then you know, if it was the wintertime, you'd try and toss the book (laughter), one window to the other, so we didn't have to go outside.  Or we would just, you know, go over and exchange the books at the backdoor.  And, so I'd go to my backdoor, and she'd go to her window and drop the book out.  I'd give her my book, and we'd go back and do that homework.  And, you know, we did a lot in the neighborhood--riding bicycles, yeah, and just--it was, it was, it was fun.  And then by the time junior year came around, you know, now we're--the classes are getting smaller.  And that was the thing that people didn't realize was--I didn't realize until years later.  It was like being in a private school because there were only maybe ten of us in honors this and ten or twelve of us in this AP English class [advanced placement].  So you got a lot of attention.  So the teachers are really able to work with you and get through a lot of material and a lot of books.  Because, you know, there were only ten, twelve, fifteen students in the class.  And by the time we became seniors, there were five of us taking AP English, just five of us.  So we got through so much.  So much so, by the time I got to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], I'm sitting in my class.  And I'd placed out because I had done well on the AP English test.  So I'm like in Sophomore English.  And I'm sitting in this English class, and they give out the reading list.  And I'm thinking, I must be dreaming.  I'm like looking at the books.  I've read these books, oh, my god (laughter).  This is awesome, I've read these books.  You know, and I--the other teachers at Austin, they were amazing.  They were so dedicated to those of us who were willing to listen, willing to learn.  I mean, and they had a great audience in these, in these group of kids.  And then there was the one teacher, Dagny Bloland, who was with the yearbook.  And freshman year she--I think I had her for creative writing.  And, so she kind of takes me under her wings and, you know, grooms me to eventually be the editor-in-chief and taking on different responsibilities and more and more and more.  And she got to Northwestern.  That's why I ended up at Northwestern.  And she would just say, literally, you know, I'd come to class and we'd be in a meeting, yet another meeting, for the yearbook staff.  And she would start singing (singing), "Go to Northwestern, go" (laughter)--and she'd be marching around, around the classroom.  So I went to Northwestern.
Story_ID: 647725
Speaker 1: Now what was the classmate's name that you said that you used to share your books with?
Speaker 2: Cassandra, Cassandra Powell.  She's now the godmother of my oldest [Trevor Wilkins], and I'm the godmother of her oldest.  We, you know, remained friends for a very long time.  And she--it was a great relationship, because we weren't, we didn't compete.  We, you know, we supported each other, you know.  I mean it was--and it wasn't, and we both wanted the A's, we both wanted good grades.  But we didn't really, we weren't killing each other over it and stuff because we both knew what we were going to do, what we had to do.  But it was great to have a partner, you know, somebody so close.  And then Tim [ph.] was around the corner.  He was the only boy that was in the honor society [National Honor Society], he was the only boy in our group.  And, you know, he went on to go to IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois] and was very, very, very smart--on the basketball team and all of that.  So he would, he--if we needed any help with the math part of it, Tim would just hook us up all the time, yeah.  And then he got a car, and we really, really liked him then (laughter).  Because the school [Austin High School, Chicago, Illinois] was a mile away.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: You know, we had to walk a mile, or nine blocks, to get there.  You know, it was an awkward place.  We couldn't take a bus, so you'd end up walking.  It was cold.
Speaker 1: So Lemont [Lemont Lennox (ph.)] is no longer competition or was he--
Speaker 2: No.  Lemont, you know, I left Lemont in sixth grade [at William Cullen Bryant School, Chicago, Illinois].  You know, and after--then there was, there were no other boys to compete with.  Then it was, you know, because all the girls were at the top.  You know, outside of, you know, Tim.  But Tim was, Tim just kind of did his thing.  He just kind of did his thing, you know.  And he wasn't, he wasn't in all of our AP [advanced placement] classes.  He was in some of them, but not all of them.  But the girls were in all (gesture) of the AP classes.
Story_ID: 647726
Speaker 1: What other type of activities were you in in high school [Austin High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: The yearbook took up a lot of time.  I was on the, I was the--National Honor Society and one of the--what do you call them--executive board of the honor--National Honor Society.  For all four years, I was very active in that.  I did--teachers--they had something, Teachers for America [sic.].  I did that for two years, and then realized I didn't want to be a teacher.  So I got out of that one.
Speaker 1: Future Teachers?
Speaker 2: Future Teachers of America, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  But like I said, I decided I didn't want to be a teacher.  So I ended that one.  I did, I mean I did, you know, I did track for a short time.
Speaker 1: What did you run?
Speaker 2: You know, I went out--I--the sprints, 400s or something that you would do.  Just the short ones--or the 100s.  But it was a little further than my mom [Emma Hill Tucker] wanted me to safely walk to.  So it was just--and she didn't drive.  And it was just a little bit, it was a little, it was a little difficult.  And I liked swimming better, so I stuck with the swimming.  But, you know, not a, not a lot a whole lot of club stuff.  Because once we, once we did the yearbook, that took Saturdays and Sundays--and the National Honor Society.  Oh, student government, you know, I was, I was very involved in student government.  And then the other thing that happened that took a lot of time, was my sophomore year, the board of education [Chicago Board of Education] had a program called the Introduction to Radio.  So that's when--junior year, I got accepted into the program because of Miss Bloland [Dagny Bloland], you know, because she came in and said, "The board is doing this.  I think this will be good for you."  And I went down and I auditioned for it.  And then, so I got accepted into the program.  So my junior year and my senior year, on Tuesdays I would leave school about noon, get downtown at one o'clock, and stay until 4, 4:30.  And that was the whole radio class.  Senior year was the same sort of thing, except we did it on Thursdays.  So there were after school activities connected to that because there was always a play, or you'd go visit a television station here, or something.  Oh, and then there was the Model UN [United Nations].  That was the other thing that I did.  And we would do these mock things.  And that started freshman year, went all the way up to senior year as well.  That one, we traveled for, and we would do a lot of competitions, you know, in different places around, around the state for the Model UN.  And there was the ski club, too.  I forgot about that.  We did do the ski club.  Weren't a whole lot of people on the ski club.  I did the ski club.  And we won the bowling competition, because it was mostly girls.  We were in the bowling club, as well.  So we did do a lot.  So we had the bowling club.  The crazy thing about the bowling club was that it was mostly girls, and I think Tim [ph.] was the only boy.  And we wouldn't, we couldn't hit the ball as fast, but we were precise (gestures).  We'd figured out how to be just very, very precise.  And we won the championship; I think senior year, we finally won the championship.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So Austin [Austin High School, Chicago, Illinois] at this time is really a progressive school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I saw the differences, though.  This program that--the radio and TV program--the radio, Introduction of Radio program [sic. Introduction to Radio] that we were in--I went to--there were kids from all over the city in this program.  And that, again, was like the second time I saw the inequities of different schools.  There was a girl from Senn [Nicholas Senn High School, Chicago, Illinois], and it was all, it was an all-white school.  They had more AP [advanced placement] classes than we did because she'd talk about them.  They had a lab.  I'll just never forget.  We had a lab, but the way she described her lab, hers was much bigger, much better.  And the kids from--she was the one they stood out, but it was clear to me that the white schools had more.  And I thought we were doing pretty good.  And they had, they had a television station.  You know, they had this equipment that we didn't have.  They put on theater productions.  Because I was also in theater, yeah, I was also in theater.  You know, but they put on huge productions, and they would work for months and stuff.  And, you know, and we had our productions.  And we did some pretty good productions.  And maybe it was just the way that they were describing it, selling it.  But it was--I saw the differences, and it just, it bothered me that we didn't have what they had.  And then that's when I found out they were doing ACT prep.  We weren't doing ACT prep.  We were told to have a good breakfast and take the ACT.  They were taking classes in ACT prep.
Speaker 1: Did you ever discuss this with your mother [Emma Hill Tucker] and father [Ernest Tucker]?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, no, I didn't.  You know, I mean I, no.  I don't know why.  I guess maybe--what were you going to do about it, you know?  They had done the best they could and moved me to this school.  But then that was a white school.  There was nothing that, you know, I wasn't going to go to that school.  Freshman year when they, when Lane Tech [Lane Technical College Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois] became all girls--I mean, I'm sorry--went from all boys and they wanted to accept girls--they, the school came to me, and I was a freshman.  And they said, you know, "You have the grades and test scores to go into Lane Tech.  Would you like to?"  And I said, "No, I don't want to go."  I don't even remember.  And I probably discussed that with my mother.  But I didn't want to go.  I didn't want to go.  So I didn't want to move because I loved where I was.  But I noted the differences.
Story_ID: 647728
Speaker 1: Where was the radio program [Introduction to Radio]?  Was it at a radio station?
Speaker 2: It was at WBEZ [WBEZ Radio, Chicago, Illinois], yeah, which is, you know, yeah, we would go down to the radio station and have class in a room you know about the size of this one with radio equipment around.  It was a--we--they taught us how to speak on the radio and how to do radio productions.  And we would do sports, and we'd read books related to broadcasting.  It was fabulous, yeah.  I mean, it really introduced me to the city, to the culture in the city, you know.  And my father [Ernest Tucker] had already kind of taken us, "You got to go outside your neighborhood [Austin, Chicago, Illinois]."  Now this program took us to plays.  You know, for the first time, we saw 'Raisin in the Sun' ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry]. The different you know, theater programs that we went to, and I loved it.  You know, and just going to the different museums and stuff and hearing about things that I never, I didn't know existed.  It was everybody in our class.  I don't think anybody else went into broadcasting.  But that's why I majored in radio, TV, film, when I went to college [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].  Because I knew then, I was sixteen years old--I was like, this is what I want to do.  I want something in broadcasting.  I didn't know what, but I knew I wanted something in broadcasting then.  And, so I went into college knowing exactly what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: When you were in that program, did you get a chance to meet some of the radio personalities at that station?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.   The--Charles [ph.]--I know--I'll have to get you the name.  I don't remember.  I know his first name was Charles because he allowed us to call him that.  And he was, he did radio there at the station.  You know, he was one of the guys.  And he ran the program, too.  So really kind of--and it was the board of education's [Chicago Board of Education] pro- radio station.  So, you know, he kind of ran it from the board.  But, you know, outside of the other--outside of him, no.  We, if, you know, we probably did, I don't remember.  You know I remember being in the booths and stuff.  So I would imagine that the people who came in--none of them really made an impression upon me that I can remember.
Story_ID: 647729
Speaker 1: What made you decide to go to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I would say a lot of it was Dr. Bloland [Dagny Bloland], Mrs. Bloland at the time.  She'd gone there and, so she introduced me to the school.  And the counselors were not that good at Austin [Austin High School, Chicago, Illinois].  That was the one thing I do remember.  They just did not give us a whole lot of guidance.  And, you know, I'd go to them, and I don't remember them offering a whole lot.  So I relied on Mrs. Bloland to guide me through college.  I mean, she helped me with the ACT, she would prep me.  You know, and it was her I told about, "They have ACT prep over there, you know.  Something, something's wrong, we don't have that."  And so, she would work with me every day after school to help me to prepare for the test.  So she was really my counselor.  And she had gone to Northwestern.  She knew that it had a good program in broadcasting, and if that's what I wanted that was a good place to go.  Columbia [Columbia University] was the only other place.  Because when I started doing my research, Columbia had a great program in broadcasting.  So, and it was in New York City, and I really felt I should be in New York City [New York, New York] on Broadway.  You know, clearly, I must be a star.  So (laughter) I wanted to go to New York, and I wanted to go to Columbia.  But my father [Ernest Tucker], he didn't want me to go that far away.  You know, he wouldn't, and he didn't want me to go that far away my first year.  So, you know, we drove up there.  And, so I finally convinced him, "Dad, Dad, just come see it.  Just come see it."  And it was in Harlem [New York, New York] at that time, before it, you know, it was right on the outskirts of Harlem.  So, we go there and he, you know, and he's saying like, "This is in Harlem.  I'm not going to let you go to Harlem."  I turn around, and I go, "We live on the West Side of Chicago [Illinois].  What are you talking about," (laughter)?  "It looks like home."  But what it really came down to, he didn't want me that far away.  So he said, "You can go there your second year.  Just get through Northwestern the first year, go somewhere close.  And then you can go there."  And of course, once I got to Northwestern and they had this great program, it didn't make sense to transfer.  So I stayed.

Speaker 1: What was your freshman year at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] like?
Speaker 2: Stressful because, you know, I assumed I should be making all A's.  And I went in to continue my tradition of making all A's.  So I studied a lot.  I had a great time though.  I also partied.  You know, I had great friends.  But stressful because it was stress I put on myself in wanting to make sure that I did well.  And I had one class that was a theater class, you know, that English course. That was easy because I'd read the books already.  And, you know, whatever other courses I had--we only took four courses.  But one of them was a theater course--some kind of introduction to theater.  And that was, that was my only C in my entire career.  That was the hardest class I've ever taken.  The theater majors at Northwestern, these people came in with so much background.  And Northwestern attracted--I mean even today--I mean its reputation in theater was just off the charts.  And these were pre-requisites for us in radio, television, film.  I understand that now, because the theater classes really helped me with my career.  But I'd never had theater at that level, and it was graded on a curve.  And I just could not get anything above a C in this class.  I was so grateful for that C.  But the freshman year, I got all A's and one C for both--the next quarter, I got A's in everything.
Speaker 1: Did you sense that it was a different level of competition when you got to Northwestern than--because you're still pretty competitive, in terms of academics I assume?
Speaker 2: You know, it was a different level, but I didn't feel like it was--I didn't, I didn't feel like anybody there was so much better.  I went in thinking--I was afraid.  And I think that fear really drove me to focus on it.  Because I assumed that the west girl, the--from the West Side of the city was not going to do as well--that I would face so many people that were so much smarter and so much better prepared that I had to work harder.  You know, I was gong to have to study more.  I was going to have to spend more time in the library.  I went in ready for this because the assumption was that they were the valedictorians from, you know, around the country--and the salutatorians.  And they were--all these kids were tops in their class.  And clearly, my education from the West Side of Chicago [Illinois] was just not going to compare.  You know, I was terrified, I was terrified.  So I spent time reading and writing the papers and doing everything that I needed to do.  And once I got, once I did well, you know, then I felt, I felt better.  And I could see that all it really took for me to succeed was put the work in.  And I was willing to do the work.  You know, I was willing to put the hard work in.
Story_ID: 647731
Speaker 1: Were you the valedictorian of your high school [Austin High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I was number two, yeah.
Speaker 1: Who did you let beat you?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Who did you let beat you?
Speaker 2: There was a girl who's a doctor today.  And quite honestly, and she beat me because I was stubborn, and I took Spanish and I didn't want to.  And I would do what I needed to do in the class.  And the teacher said, but I really didn't participate--I'd just ace everything and raise my hand or--and she said to me, "If you don't participate, I don't care.  I will not give you an A."  And I thought, "You got to be kidding (makes sound).  How can you not give me an A?"  You know, I clearly was the best one in the class.  So sure enough, she didn't.  So the valedictorian beat me by .00 something or other.  It was so much of a fraction.  And it was so close that the counselor called me in.  And she said, "Dorothy [HistoryMaker Dorothy Tucker], they have, you know, Carolyn [ph.] is a little bit ahead of you, but not really."  And it was clear to me they were trying to say, "Maybe you should be valedictorian."  Because again, I was the more outgoing one, and I was probably going to prepare and deliver this better speech or something, or I don't know.  Or maybe because they liked me.  But I thought this was really wrong, you know.  And you know, I just remember thinking Carolyn deserves this, because she really worked harder than I did.  You know, I worked hard but not as hard as Carolyn.  You know, again, Carolyn really--and she deserved everything.  And I said, "No."  So I was, you know, I was fine with number two.  But I just wanted to beat the girl who was one of my best friends, who told me in junior year that she had already done the math, and when the math came down to it, she would be number two, and I would be number four.  And I was thinking to myself, I don't think so.  No, that won't happen.  You won't beat me.  So I was number two, and I was okay with Carolyn being number one (laughter).
Story_ID: 647732
Speaker 1: Your sophomore year at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois]--how did, how did that go?
Speaker 2: You know, very well.  Like I said, I, you know, throughout the entire--I got, I got the one C in the theater class.  And, you know, maybe one other B in something else.  So academically it was, it was fine because I enjoyed it.  And by sophomore year, because I had placed out of the English class, I was into taking classes in my major.  And I was so, I was really interested in a lot of the classes that I was taking.  In fact, you know, one summer--or I remember taking a sociology class.  And I loved it so much that I asked the professor if I could continue the research over the summer because it was all about my neighborhood [Austin, Chicago, Illinois] and the white flight, and the Jewish people who would come in.  And I'd gone to the library, and I found this letter from this Jewish woman who--she'd written it to her neighbors, saying, "Don't do this.  Why are we running?  Why are we being afraid of these people?  It's going to be fine.  You know, they're fine upstanding people.  They have houses and they care about their life, just like we do."  And then I found the woman's daughter.  And, so I'd done a paper on that, and I wanted to continue research.  And I'd gone to the library.  So I en- I enjoyed the academics, you know.  And I really got off on the, on the research that I had to do, and the papers that I would do.  And I was, I was going--I'd kind of come up with my own internship.  I'd gone to one of the radio stations downtown and said, "I'll volunteer if you'll just teach me how to write radio."  So I would leave campus on Saturdays and go from Northwestern to downtown.  And I would just sit in this radio room.  And the news director there, I don't remember his name.  But he was kind enough to just teach me how to write radio, you know, just teach me what I'm supposed to know.  I figured out that I needed more print or more of a crux of writing than what was offered in the School of Speech [Northwestern University School of Speech; Northwestern University School of Communication, Evanston, Illinois].  So I audited classes in Medill [Medill School of Journalism; Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications, Evanston, Illinois], so I could, I could learn--I would just sit in on them, so I could learn how to do that sort of thing.  So, you know, the only bad thing about college was that I was so driven, I forgot to smell the roses.  That was the only thing that--my biggest regret is that--I mean, you know, and mind you, I partied like everybody else.  I would party on Fridays and Saturdays and, you know, study.  But you know, because I wasn't working, you know, I would stay up and I'd party until two o'clock in the morning, and then I'd go home and study until four o'clock in the morning.  I'd get up, I'd go to the eight or nine o'clock class, and I'd come back and I'd take a nap, and do it all over again.  So, it was, you know, the sophomore year was really good.  And, you know, junior year was really good.  And then they called me in, and they said, "You know, you have enough credits to graduate."  And I was like, "What?"  And they said, "Yeah, you've taken, you know, this course or that course, or that summer and--" because everything I did, I got credit for it.  I'm like, if I'm going to do this work, you should give me a credit.  And I just kind of worked out these deals with the professors.  And they would go, okay.  And I had an internship in Peoria [Illinois] because I wanted an internship.  And, so I applied to all these different internships, and I got one in Peoria [at WRAU-TV; WHIO-TV].  And I went to--when they said, "You can graduate," I said, "Well, what do I need?"  And they said, "You need, you know, you literally need three more credits.  And, you know, you don't have to come back for a full year your senior year."  And I went to the dean, and said, "Well, here's the deal.  I'm going to go down and take this internship in Peoria.  I'll write you a paper about the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] and the changes that are coming.  (Gestures) You give me the three credits, I give you the paper."  He said, "Okay."  So I was, I was, I was done then.
Story_ID: 647733
Speaker 1: One thing you said about your sophomore year [at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] is that you didn't stop to smell the roses.  What did you mean by that?
Speaker 2: You know, and I think that was all through, you know, not just the sophomore year, you know, throughout, throughout college.  I enjoyed my friends, but I was, I enjoyed college, I had a lot of fun in college.  I went to a lot of parties.  But I was always planning the next phase of my life.  Everything was about getting to broadcasting--everything.  So every, you know, every waking moment I felt like, I was like, you know, is it going to be grad school?  Is it going to be the internship?  You know, what are you, what are you applying for next?  You know, what application are you filling out, and what phone call are you making to say I want that internship, and now I want this internship?  And, now we need to do this and that and the other.  You know, I really, but I, you know, I did the spring break things with my friends and stuff.  And I did, and I would go and visit them on the holidays.  But there's--and maybe it's not even so much as sophomore year as it is--I wish, I wish I had not graduate- graduated early.  I wish I'd gone that last year and just really kind of taken a breather and taken classes that, you know, were easy and just did a little bit more of hanging out, you know.  And, so I regret that I graduated.  Really, I didn't want to go to graduation.  The only reason I went was because my mother [Emma Hill Tucker] said, "You will do this."
Speaker 1: What kind of activities were you involved in in college?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  And I, you know, and I think I--I did, I did the radio station, WNUR [WNUR Radio, Evanston, Illinois], you know.  And I would produce the commentaries.  You know, I would go there, but again, it was all about broadcasting.  You know, I didn't do anything that wasn't a means to an end.  I joined the Sigma something something of a society [Sigma Delta Chi].  It was a journalism thing, you know.  And I didn't, and I think that's what I said, you know, the regrets were.  Other kids joined the choir for the sake of joining the choir.  And in my mind, it was kind of like, nope, don't have time for that, (laughter), you know.  I--and there was really, you know, I didn't join the newspaper because it was primarily print, and I knew I wanted broadcasting.  You know, if I did a project, I'd do a television project.  And I'd pour everything into whatever television project that I was working on for class.  But, you know, I didn't sign up for anything, you know, outside of something that was career related, and I wish I had.
Speaker 1: Did you continue to do theater?
Speaker 2: No, no, because they were, they were so good.  These kids were kicking my butt.  I barely made it through that one class.  After that I, you know, I learned what they wanted.  But, no, I didn't, I didn't do theater anymore.  I mean, it was clear to me that, you know, my dreams of ever being on Broadway--there were others (laughter) who were much better.  And you just better get real with this (laughter).  Accept this--you're not that good.
Story_ID: 647734
Speaker 1: Now you're graduating really a year early.  And you apply for this internship.  What was, what was that about?
Speaker 2: The, you know, I felt like at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], the internship was actually the end of my junior year.  And that was the one that, you know, I just needed the credits to, you know, I knew I needed internships.  I don't know how I knew I needed internships.  I think I probably learned that from other kids.  Because I didn't feel like at Northwestern the dean or the professors--they were, they didn't offer a lot of guidance.  And I would have to go to the boards and look up and see what was available.  And I kind of felt like the white kids got a little more attention and guidance in that area.  And I had to find everything on my own by reading, you know, things that were offered at different places and apply to them.  I mean, nobody really ever, ever helped me in that regard.  So the internship in Peoria [Illinois] was, you know, one of the things that were on the wall that I applied to.  And made the phone call and, you know, convinced them to give me a chance.
Speaker 1: Describe what that internship was like?
Speaker 2: I'd already had an internship at WBBM [WBBM Radio, Chicago, Illinois] by then.  I had spent my spring semester at WBBM, writing, which was a great internship.  So this last one in Peoria [at WRAU-TV; WHIO-TV], I went in for production.  I wanted to, I didn't have a desire to be in front of the camera.  I really wanted--my dream was to be a producer for '60 Minutes.'  That's--I wanted to be behind the camera, and I was good at it.  And if the, if the producers or if the professors saw and said anything to me, they acknowledged that I was probably--I was gifted at directing and producing because I'm really good at directing people.  So that would make sense.  So I was really good at this, and that's what they saw.  And, so I knew that this is what I wanted to do.  So it was a production.  It was behind the scenes internship in kind of like the community affairs promotion department.  And it was great because they allowed me to write for them.  You know, so I was actually writing things that ended up on television--some of the editorials and the community pieces that they did.  You know, they would allow me to do.  And then this girl one day, who was another intern, she came in and she was about to go out, and they were going to let her be on television.  And they were going to let her do a story and actually air it on TV.  And, you know, then the competitor in me took over.  And I was like, "Excuse me.  You mean she gets to be on television?  Well, I should be on television.  I should be able to do this."  And the news director basically said, "Well, you know, you find the story, you research the story, you find the story, and we'll let you do it."  "Okay."  So that's how things switched.  I found the story, and they kind of said, "There's your deadline.  Make that deadline, and it'll be on television."  And I made deadline, and they put it on television.
Speaker 1: What was the story?
Speaker 2: The story was about a new something or the other in divorce court.  Something in divorce court going on there, and there was a new rule that you now had to do.  And I remember we had to shoot inside the courtroom.  And, you know, I had to write the story and got the interviews.  And, you know, I don't remember how in the world I found the story (laughter).  But I did, and they put it on television.  And, you know, it was, it was fun.  That part of it was fun.
Speaker 1: And this was your first experience in front of the camera?
Speaker 2: That was my first experience in front of the camera, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 647735
Speaker 1: What did you do next?
Speaker 2: Once I graduated, I wanted to, I wanted to go to New York [New York].  I started kind of looking for jobs, but I really, you know, I'm still in my mind thinking I just want to go to New York, you know.  I really want to be in New York.  I love Broadway.  And I still loved the energy of the city, and I still say, "Okay, I can still get there."  And I had applied for another job in Peoria [Illinois] at the CBS station [WMBD-TV].  I was interning at the ABC station [WRAU-TV; WHIO-TV, Peoria, Illinois].  And I applied for a job at the CBS station because I was at a party.  So I'm sitting at this party, and this guy is talking about this job at the CBS station, and that how he was a shoo-in for it.  And in my head, I'm going, you have this, this, this.  But my resume has this, this, this, this.  I think I'm better suited for this job, I'm thinking.  And, so I went and applied for the job (laughter).  And of course, I got the job.  So I applied for that job, and I pretty much knew I had it.  And I also applied for a job in New York at CBS, at WCBS [WCBS-TV] there.  And I had been offered that job to be, to be a desk assistant.  And one of the mentors--and it was a woman who I think I had met at WBBM [WBBM Radio, Chicago, Illinois].  And I asked her, "Which one should I take?"  And she said, "Well, you certainly don't want to take the one in Peoria.  Do you really want to be standing out on the cornfield in the freezing cold and stuff?"  You know, and I'm thinking--the other one was kind of a management track.  And she was in management, and she was trying to say, you know, "You should go into management."  But I just still wanted to do production.  And I--so, I said I'm going to take the job in Peoria, especially after my father [Ernest Tucker] said, you know, "You can go to New York, but I'm not paying a penny for it unless you have a job before you go," (laughter).  So it was like, okay, I need a job.  So I took the job in Peoria.
Speaker 1: And what did that job entail?
Speaker 2: Three hundred and sixty-four days of pure hell.  Yeah, I hated it, yeah, but mostly because I was probably really bad at it.  I mean, I'd done one story (laughter) by then, and it was like learning on the job.  You know, it was--I had to learn how to write it and produce it and make deadlines.  And by then we were doing film and tape.  And it was the first time I'd ever been that far away from home, so it was a lot of personal stuff.  I mean, Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] wasn't that far away, and here I am in Peoria, which is three hours.  And the only thing I would ever do is, as soon as I got off the air and finish my shift, I'd drive home to Chicago [Illinois].  You know, I'd drive back home all the time.  And, so I never really embraced the city because I didn't, you know, I didn't want to really be there.  I found it to be a very racist town.  I lived in, I lived next to, I lived in an apartment where there were--it was very, on a very busy street.  And, you know, I would come home and the white men would always be whistling and saying things.  And I hated to have to come home and walk through that every day.  So, you know, in my mind I was, I was, I was terrified.  I was terrified that, you know, something, something would happen to me.  So I didn't, I didn't want to be there.  You know, I didn't want to be there.  So I would leave--every free chance I got I would just, I would just go back home.  And so I wasn't--I wasn't happy, because I wasn't comfortable.  And I was living alone.  You know, you go from living in a dorm with everybody to now you're living alone.  And I'm living alone, and all I ever think is that, you know, one of these days I'm going to get grabbed, one of these days because they had clearly no respect.  And they probably didn't have any respect for any woman, but they certainly let me know it.  And I, and I didn't, I didn't want to be there.  So I did the job.  And I was saved by a guy named Don Terry [ph.], who is a white photographer, who we worked together on the ten o'clock shift.  And he would go out to dinner with me.  He was very, very kind to me.  And he, and he saved me (laughter).  He absolutely saved me because he was my friend.  You know, so I got, I got through it because of Don.  But otherwise, I just didn't want to be there, so then--
Story_ID: 647736
Speaker 1: They fired me after they called me in.  And, you know, and I think my attitude, too--I would be there, and I'd see all these people who were not--I felt--(unclear) and it wasn't so much that they weren't nice to me.  It was just that they had the superior, superior attitudes.  And I would look at them and think--my father [Ernest Tucker] owns his own company [Precise Products Inc., Warrenville, Illinois].  You don't make anything.  You can't compare to my father.  And they acted like, and they treated me as if I were inferior.  And that also bothered me.  So, you know, I, you know, but, you know, I made, I made mistakes.  I made the mistake of not embracing where I was, you know, and not focusing on enough, I think, on the craft.  Because, again, you know, I was--I'd just turned twenty-one.  I'd just turned twenty years old, first time, first time really away from home, really trying to deal with all of the other stuff.  So, you know, at the end of the year, at the end of my contract they said, "We don't think this is working."  And I was, I went home and I cried.  And then I went to, I went back to my apartment and I stayed down there for, you know, because I think I was living out the lease.  And I called my [paternal] grandmother because remember this is Grandma Lillie Belle [Lillie Belle Ingol Spates], who in my mind sat on God's board.  And, you know, and Grandma said to me, "Baby, don't worry about it.  You know, God has a plan for you.  It'll be just fine."  And that just really made me feel better because pretty much anytime Grandmother said something like that, that's just the way it was going to be (laughter).  It was going to be fine.  But I came home, interviewed for a job at Xerox [Xerox Corporation] where my aunt was working, and thinking it was supposed to be a three week process.  And they said, "You come in for the interview the first day.  And then you have to come back, and you have to come back, and you--," and she was making like fifty thousand dollars back then as a salesperson.  And I'm thinking, okay, maybe I'll just do that.  Because I was making eighty-five hundred, so it was, it seemed like a lot of money.  Anything was better than--but I didn't care about the money.  You know, but I just remembered she was making so much money.  She was, you know, she was living this great life and great, you know, I will go along this track.  So I go to the interview, and I was supposed to come back the next week and the next week.  And we'd go out to lunch.  And she says to me, "They really like you, they really like you.  And they want you to come back this afternoon, and they're going to offer you the job today."  And I said, "But what about the three week process?  I thought I was supposed to come back the next week and the next week.  It was a three week process."  She goes, "They really, really like you."  And at that moment I was like, okay, this is too easy.  I have to go back to television.  And I didn't go back for the interview (laughter).  And I went back and applied for jobs all over the place.  I had some relatives in Denver [Colorado].  I flew out to Denver and sent resumes to all the places, called up one of the news directors, and said, "Hey, I happen to be out here.  You know, will you stop, will you see me?"  (Gesture) And then he did.
Speaker 2: Let me take you back to Peoria [Illinois] for just a second.  You talked about the racism there.  Did you experience racism in terms of the station you were working at [WMBD-TV]?
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  You know, I never--the station was fine.  The--it was everything outside of the station.  And I--the people that I worked for, they--I didn't know what I was doing, you know.  I mean, it was all about trying to get me to do the best story.  And, you know, I was working the night shift and turning it out and stuff, and doing what I was supposed to do.  But I--no, I never felt like they were, that they were treating me any differently, you know, because of my race.  But it was having to deal with the people in the grocery store and just being out as a single black woman there.  It was just too much.
Story_ID: 647737
Speaker 1: What is your next position?
Speaker 2: Denver [Colorado], KWGN [KWGN-TV].  I think I actually got in touch--there was a book [sic. magazine] called the Broadcasting magazine.  And before I got out there, I saw an ad in the Broadcasting magazine of a woman from KWGN who was looking for a job.  So I called her up, and I said, "Oh, you're looking.  When you find that job, will you call me and let me know, so I can apply for yours?" (Laughter) And she was a black woman.  And I think it said something like that, "Black reporter looking for--." I'm like okay, sister girl.  You're going to be replaced by a sister girl because that's what they did back then.  So I'm like, okay.  So I called her.  And she said, "Absolutely."  So she called me and she said, "Okay, I have a job.  So you need to send your stuff now because I haven't told them."  So I sent my stuff in, and then I went out to Denver.  And then that's when she by then had said, "Here's my two weeks."  And coincidentally, he already had my tape in hand.  And then he gets an interv- you know, he gets a call from me saying, "Hey, I happen to be in Denver," (laughter).  And, you know, he liked what he saw.  And, so I was in Denver for about a little over a year, almost two years.
Speaker 1: Describe what you did in Denver.
Speaker 2: Same thing.  You know, I've only ever had a job as a reporter.  Denver was fabulous.  I enjoyed Denver immensely.  It's a beautiful city.  By then, you know, I had a year under my belt.  I knew what I was doing and, you know, continued to learn.  I was continuing to learn my trade, but still I was really beginning to enjoy covering the stories and writing the stories and interviewing people and, you know, enjoying my colleagues and people at the other the stations and stuff.  It was, it was an independent television station, like WGN here [WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois].  So that was frustrating in the sense that sometimes I felt like I could do a story and I--we didn't have the eyes.  You know, people were watching the ABC, CBS and NBC stations, and they weren't watching KWGN as much.  So that was frustrating to me so from a professional viewpoint.  But, you know, after what I'd gone through now personally, I was, I was good.  You know, I, but I wanted to be in Denver, and I enjoyed Denver.  So I then began to concentrate more on the career.  So Denver was good.  It was good.
Story_ID: 647738
Speaker 1: And where did you go next?
Speaker 2: Denver [Colorado], I left Denver and moved--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Can I--what year are we in (cough)?  I don't know what year we're in.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  So, and can we understand also how the newsroom works?  And, so, but what year are we in?  I don't know what year we're in.
Speaker 2: Let me see.  I started working in Peoria [WMBD-TV, Peoria, Illinois] in 1977.  I left there in '78 [1978].  So I'm in Denver in 1978.  And that would have been the year I would have been graduating [from Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] but, you know, by then I'm in Denver.  So it's 1978, early '79 [1979] maybe, something like that.  And I stayed in Denver for almost two years, '78 [1978], '79 [1979], '80 [1980].  So somewhere around early '80s [1980s] or so, I left Denver because I wanted to get back to an affiliate.  But to your question.  The newsroom in Denver, it was very, very small and there--very, very small staff.  We were videotaped then, but I still had a photographer.  So I work, would work with the photographer, and somebody else did the editing.  Somebody else shot the story and, you know, all I had to do was the reporting.  But you would get twenty-five dollars every time your face appeared on television.  You know, that was your production fee.  So we would break our necks to do stand ups (laughter).  Because you wanted to make sure you would get that other twenty-five dollars.  I wasn't making--even then--oh god, like I said, if I did eighty-five hundred dollars in Peoria the first year, you know, I may have been up to ten.  You know, I don't, I don't think I had broken ten thousand, you know, living there.  They paid you in sunshine out there.  It was a beautiful place, but you still didn't make, didn't make a whole lot of money.  But it was, it was a fun shop.  You know, I think everybody in that shop really got along.  You know, again, now I'm, what, twenty-two years old.  And most of the people in the shop are about the same age and--little older, though.  Because while I was KWG- KWGN [KWGN-TV, Denver, Colorado], that's a bigger market, you know.  So Denver is a good sized market.  So many of the people in that market, it was their third job.  You know, maybe even their fourth job, depending.  But it was, it was my second job because of the independent television station I was working for.  We--and the news didn't come on until nine o'clock.  So that was really kind of strange for me because you worked a nine to five shift.  And you would get out of there at five o'clock but, you know, you could--really your deadline wasn't until close to eight or something, just because the news didn't come on until, until nine o'clock.
Story_ID: 647739
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Who was the black woman that you replaced?
Speaker 2: I don't re- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Simultaneous) Do you remember her name?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, okay.  Fine.
Speaker 2: No, I don't, I don't remember her name.  But that's what we did back then.  You know, we did a lot of that back then because we knew--like the--when I, when I got the job in Peoria [WMBD-TV, Peoria, Illinois], I replaced a black woman.
Speaker 1: What was her name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cynthia Todd.  Her name was Cynthia Todd.  She worked at the newspapers, and then they needed somebody in television, so they got her.  And she then moved on to, I want to say she went to St. Louis [Missouri].  She went to St. Louis after that.  So, and that--and I really kind of knew I probably had the edge because they had just lost a black woman.  So I knew I had a good chance of getting the job in Peoria because they were probably going to hire a black woman.  And I also knew the same thing about Denver [KWGN-TV, Denver, Colorado].  I knew I had a good chance because they had just lost a black woman, so they were going to bring in another black woman.  That's just, you know, that was kind of expected.  And I don't know where the woman in Denver went to, but I'm eternally grateful to her because that was very nice of her to do that.  And in Memphis [WREG-TV, Memphis, Tennessee], things changed.  By now, I'm not--I left Denver and decided I wanted to go and work for an affiliate station.  I no longer wanted an independent.  I wanted something connected to ABC, CBS, NBC.  So Memphis--I sent my resume out to a number of different places, you know.  And by then--again, the Broadcasting magazine book was around, and you could just kind of see, you know, who was looking and, you know.  So you would send your tape to the stations that said, "We are looking for--," and they'd have a little ad and, you know, "We're looking to hire."  And you would just, you know, sometimes you made a phone call.  And you'd say, "Well, are they looking to hire somebody black?  You know, what are the numbers?  And did they lose somebody?"  Because that, you know, would increase your, increase your chances of actually getting the job if you know they had just lost somebody black.  You know, if they lost somebody white, they were just like, am I going to pay the money to send the tape (laughter)?  Because you probably weren't going to get the job.
Story_ID: 647740
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: This was like 19--let's see.  I was there [KWGN-TV, Denver, Colorado] '79 [1979] to '80 [1980], 1979 to '80 [1980].  This was probably 1980.  Nineteen eighty [1980], now I'm moving to, moving to Memphis [Tennessee].  And again, it was the sort of thing--I was going down there for a family reunion.  And I, you know, I just called them all up and said, "Can I come to--by and talk to you?"  And I would do there--that anywhere I went.  If I went to a city, I'd go see a news director.  And, you know, I was fortunate enough that one of them, they were looking.  And I got the job that--I got a phone call, and got the job at WREG [WREG-TV, Memphis, Tennessee] shortly after that.  Memphis--I was only there fifteen months--my choice to leave.  And after that it was always, you know, my choice to leave.  But Memphis was--back in the early '80s [1980s], everything in that city was based on race.  You know, they didn't tear up a sidewalk, put down a sidewalk, put up a stop sign, unless they considered the black and white issue.  And there were maybe nine people, nine city councilmen.  It was always five to four.  Black folks always lost (laughter).  You know, and it just amazed me just how everything in that city was based on black and white race.  And I'd never, I'd come from Denver [Colorado], where Denver was not a very race conscious city.  You know, see, you didn't have to think about that.  You know, now I was in Memphis where--very southern.  I didn't like being called baby girl, you know, by men, especially older white men.  You know, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't like that.  Because you know, again, having come--grown up in a different kind of atmosphere in the North--I mean I wasn't, I--it really, really bothered me.  I had a great time socially in Memphis, though--great clubs.  We would hang out and we'd party all the time.  That was a lot of fun.  But it was--it was aggravating to have to cover a story and deal with having, you know, the--just kind of overt sexism, you know, of wanting to give everything to the male reporters and not the female reporters.  You had to work a little harder if you were a woman.  And you weren't expected to do certain stories.  And it's just, you know, to dress a certain way.  You know, and it wasn't that bad, in terms of dressing a certain way.  But, you know, you were supposed to be looking sexy all the time because this is what women in the South were supposed to be doing. They were supposed to look--so it was, it, you know, I had issues with Memphis because of that.  But I thought, I appreciated it, though, when I left.  Because what it did was to teach me to look at a story in more than just two ways.  You know, it wasn't--there was a third side.  And it was the first time I learned that there was actually more than even three sides to it, you know.  It was whatever the basics was and then the opposite side of objectivity.  And then was race a factor?  So they were--it taught me to look at stories and incl- consider all the factors and nuances and layers in a story.  So, you know, I--from a journalistic view- viewpoint, journalist point, it was really one of the best jobs that I, that I worked in.
Story_ID: 647741
Speaker 1: You were talking about Memphis [Tennessee], and you said that you learned there that there, there were more than two sides to the story.  Can you elaborate on that a little bit?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There are just other factors that you have to consider in a story, is what I realized.  Because, you know, for example, you could cover a story and, you know, let's say that--and the little league was a story about a cul de sac, and whether there was going to be a cul de sac in this neighborhood or not.  And you could say, well, one person wanted the cul de sac because it was going to protect kids from getting hit.  And the other person didn't want a cul de sac because they liked the fact that they could drive through the street, and they didn't want it blocked off.  And that seems to be a simple part of the story--you want it, you don't want it.  But in Memphis, what I found out is that this person over here really didn't like the fact that--what it really came--what he really suspected is that the person who wanted the cul de sac was only saying that they wanted the cul de sac there to protect the children.  What they really didn't want is for the black teenagers who would drive through the town down the street.  And because the neighborhood was changing so, now they wanted to keep the black kids out.  And, so this person knew they wanted to keep them out.  So under the surface, it wasn't just about the street and protecting young kids from getting hit.  It was all about we want to create a barrier that we don't have to see anymore but--to keep black people out.  And we don't want you to create this barrier just for the sake of keeping black people out.  So the race thing.  And sometimes you wouldn't hear that.  And it took asking that question and considering that perhaps there was, there was something else behind just was, what was obvious, what was on the surface for the story.  And there were many times I'd go to the city council meeting and, you know, would hear one alderman saying this, and the black one saying this, and the white one saying that.  And it really just would always end up coming down to a black and white issue, and not just what was there.  So, you know, I--that was, that was good.  Because then, you know, the next place that I went to--and now, every story that I cover, you know, it's like, so, what's behind the scenes?  And you learn that you have to keep asking more and more questions to get more of the background.  Is there an ulterior motive?  Is there a hidden agenda?  You know, to be able to bring that up out of the story.  And I think before then, I was just, I would have just covered the sidewalk.  And miss the best part of the story.  And so, you know, it was, it was, it was good to learn that.
Story_ID: 647742
Speaker 1: Who were the other African American reporters in Memphis [Tennessee] at this time?
Speaker 2: You know, there were quite a few in Memphis.  Our main anchor was Pam Crittendon [Pam Crittendon Roberson].  She was, she was the weekend anchor, and then she moved to the five o'clock anchor.  African American woman--our weather person, Sharon [ph.], I forget her last name, African American.  I don't remember us having--I think it was all females.  You know, I don't remember there being a black male reporter at our shop [WREG-TV, Memphis, Tennessee].  There were male reporters at some of the other shops there, but I don't think we had one in our shop.  You know, it was easier then, I think, and I think maybe even today--it was always easier for black women to get a job.  You know, and I think it was easier for the audience to accept us.  But, and there were always--there were always many more in the smaller markets, especially.  There were always many more black women.  Because even in Denver [Colorado], thinking back, there was no, there was no black man who worked at that station in Denver that I worked in [KWGN-TV].  Peoria [Illinois], there was no black man who worked at the station that I worked at [WMBD-TV].  There was another, there was a black man who worked at the agency station in Peoria, who was one of my best friends, and is still one of my best friends today.  But--
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Harold Hayes.  Harold Hayes was, he was at the ABC station where I had interned [WRAU-TV; WHIO-TV, Peoria, Illinois].  And he, you know, we used to tell the story of one of the reasons Harold left Peoria was that there was a bank robbery, and Harold got stopped because he was in the area.  And it took him awhile to convince them--for him to convince the officer that, you know, he just happened to be walking by.  And it was only because of, you know, a white woman said to the officer, "That man's been there the whole time.  Now why are you stopping him?"  That saved Harold.  Otherwise, Harold would have been in jail first (laughter).  And then they probably would have continued to ask questions.  But that, you know, Harold, he stayed there for about another year or so.  But Harold and I became very good friends while--because we were the only two black people in television at the time in Peoria.  So, you know, and in Denver there were a number of black people.  There was another black guy, Michael [ph.], at the ABC station.  And I think there was a, there was a black guy at the, at the CBS station as well.  I don't remember his name because, but Michael, I remember.  You know, so there were always, you know, two or three, but always many more, always many more women, always many more women.
Story_ID: 647743
Speaker 1: Was there an NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] group in Denver [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: The NABJ started in 1977 [sic. 1975].  So no, there was no local NABJ in Denver when I got there.  We began to form an organization of black journalists.  And we would gather as black journalists.  But we were not, we didn't officially call ourselves NABJ because we really, we were only hearing about it, you know.  In fact, it was in Denver that I heard about this national organization of black journalists.  And I heard that they were having a convention.  And that would have been their second convention in 197- '78 [1978] in Washington, D.C. [sic.].  And I put myself on a plane and I went out to, I flew out to D.C. to go to this convention, just because the idea that there were going to be lots of black people in one place, lots of black journalists in one place.  I was excited to get there and see them.  But somewhere along the way, I didn't have a place to stay because I couldn't afford it.  But I could afford the ticket.  And when I get all the way out to D.C., I register and I'm, you know, and I fill out everything.  And I'm sitting there.  And the, and the woman--and I believe her name was Essie [ph.], who was the executive director back then--I may have her name wrong.  And she's sitting there, and I sit down.  And then I come back to the desk, and I'm just standing there.  And she says to me, "So, now what?  You're registered.  What do you want?  Why are you here?"  And I said, "I don't have anywhere to stay," (laughter).  And she said, "What?  Where are you from?"  "I came here from Denver."  "And you don't have a hotel?"  I said, "No, I don't have a hotel."  And she said, "Oh, my god.  Girl, sit down."  And I sat there, and she was so angry with me.  And, you know, I was so determined to just get to this organization and get to these black people that--I don't know whether I didn't think about it, or whether I thought that (laughter)--just get me there, I'll figure it out.  And she finally turned around, and she says, "Come here.  This woman here, her corporation is paying for it.  You go stay with her."  And I did.  And I--to this day, I do not remember that woman's name, but I know I thanked her.  But oh, my god, if I could see that woman again.  She let me stay with her for the, you know, for two or three days, and she didn't charge me a penny.  Of course, I didn't have a penny to pay her, so it's a good thing she didn't charge me.  But she was very kind.  But that was my first experience with NABJ.
Speaker 1: What went on there that kind of stuck out in your mind?
Speaker 2: At the conference?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You know, I--the workshops where every--the panel would just be talking about their experiences, and what they were going through, you know.  I--and the first one, I just remember going to the different luncheons and the receptions.  And, you know, I was like a deer in headlights then--I, you know.  It was just, like, seeing black people.  I mean, I didn't know any of these people and stuff.  And just kind of being in the room with them, you know.  Just really kind of hanging out and listening to the veteran journalists, you know.  And back then, we could literally all fit in this room.   You know, just, there just weren't a whole lot of us.  But, and I've been to the conventions now every year since then.
Story_ID: 647744
Speaker 1: Who were some of the veteran journalists that you came in contact with there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, [HistoryMaker] Vernon Jarrett was the only one that I remember.  And a lot of that was because he was from Chicago [Illinois], you know.  So, and I knew he was from Chicago.  So he was about, you know, I remember meeting Vernon early on and seeing him year after year and, you know, and just hearing--at the time, I think he did some work with ABC here in Chicago [WLS-TV].  I know he's done--he--I don't know whether he was with the paper then or was writing for the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times].  He was just doing everything.  And, you know, and they would just talk about integrity all the time, you know.  That was, that was really what they were stressing.  You know, just how important it was for us to be in the game.  You know, just to be in the newsrooms.  Because this was when we were, we weren't snatched off the street anymore.  You know, I'd gone to school for broadcasting [at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].  You know, I mean I--and we were getting graduate degrees and stuff.  So we were well educated in making, in making choices to do this.  And, you know, they wanted to just make sure that we understood that our role still was to tell our stories and tell the stories in our community.  And, you know, we would gather around and complain about how we had to cover all the black stories, and how tired we were of always having to do the black stories, and every time anything happens in the black community, they send the black reporter.  So we exchang- exchanged funny stories, and stories of aggravation about, "Oh yeah, well, you know."  And, literally, we would all--if there was a story that happened in the black community, all of us would be there, and we knew we'd all see each other (laughter).  Because, you know, that's--it's like the news directors went, "Oops, you know, it's a black story, you know.  Send a black reporter."  And we would, we would complain and fuss about it at the time.  But we came to really appreciate covering those stories and wanting to cover those stories.  Because we were going to do, we felt, the best job.
Story_ID: 647745
Speaker 1: Now you talked about there were a number of black journalists in Memphis [Tennessee].  Did you guys have an organization?
Speaker 2: We did, we did.  We got together.  By the time, by the time I got to Memphis, we had the Memphis Association of Black Journalists, and we would meet every month.  And we would hold, we would, we would attend the regional conventions [of the National Association of Black Journalists].  We would do fundraisers.  We would have, you know, little dinners and more than anything, we would support each other.  And we became very tight, and we were very--lots of friends.  And, so that year when the convention was in New Orleans [Louisiana], I think--or wherever it was--we all pooled our little resources together and drove down, flew down, and made sure that as many of us as possible were going to get to the convention, yeah.
Story_ID: 647746
Speaker 1: You talked a little bit about the racial aspect of some of the stories in Memphis [Tennessee].  Did the other journalists have that same sense of--when they did stories?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  Oh, absolutely.  You know, I can remember if--and we would all--it was kind of like something you learned from the next journalist.  That if you go out to certain neighborhoods, if you were with a white photographer, you don't knock on the door.  You know, we would go out covering the story, you know, because, you know, you're doing whatever story it is.  And I worked the night shift then.  And it was, you know, everything in Memphis--pitch black once you get out of the city.  Because, you know, it's a rural area.  And, so, you know, we'd drive up to the house.  And if we were in the white community, it was like, "Yeah, I'll stay here.  You get out, you go knock on the door.  And you introduce us, you know, and say who we are and stuff."  And you just, you really kind of had to learn.  And you learned from the other reporters who had been there--how to cope, you know, and what to expect.  So, yeah, I mean, it was, it was like common knowledge, of just what was going on.  Harder for me, though, because I was from the North.  So, you know, it was their way, and I, and I think easier for them.  Because many of them--yeah, many of them were from the South, so they'd grown up in the area or in the South or something.  So they grew up in the culture.  And it may have been easier for them because they were, they were known, and they were veterans.  You know, I was coming from the North.  I was the new girl on the block, so, you know, I had to learn, I had to learn the ropes, yeah.
Story_ID: 647747
Speaker 1: You said there were a number of women there.  Did you sense that women were getting, weren't getting like equal pay or the best assignments and things of that nature?
Speaker 2: Compared to--
Speaker 1: To the white males or the white females for that matter.
Speaker 2: You know, I don't, I don't know that I ever, I think, I don't know that we ever looked at, or we ever felt that the white male reporters were getting more than us.  I think we were very naive to that.  I don't think we knew.  Or I don't think, I don't, you know, I'll say me personally, I never, I don't think I ever really knew that.  I never really focused on that.  And a lot of it was because, again, I was new, and they had been there.  So I think I just assumed that they were making more money, and they probably were making more money.  And I didn't really--and we never really talked about it.  We never really talked about the money aspect because the race was just much more prevalent for us in Memphis [Tennessee] anyway.  You know, and there were white male anchors who, you know, admitted they made lots of money.  I never--there was kind of a base.  And if the white girls made more than we did, I never knew.  But the ones who came in when I did or came in after me--I never really got the, got the sense that we did.  And, you know, keep in mind by then, people really didn't talk about the salaries because it was kind of this is what this station pays.  You know, it was only when you got to a larger market that there was--what the union did, and then there was much more then.  You came up with a lot more experience in negotiating contracts and stuff like that.  And money became much more of, we became much more aware of money.  I think by then we were all, we were all so happy still to have good jobs (laughter).  You really didn't talk about money that much.  The guys, the black guys, didn't stay in the business.  Back then, they didn't stay in the business very long at that level.  It was easy for them to drop out because, you know, now we're, now we're twenty-four, twenty-five years old.  And some of them are getting married, and they're having families, and they can't live off the salaries.  I mean, they don't want to live off the salaries that they're making.  You know, I think I made, I think when I got to Memphis [WREG-TV, Memphis, Tennessee], I made seventeen thousand [dollars], you know.  It was the first time my father [Ernest Tucker] didn't have to help me out.  You know, he didn't, he didn't have to send me money so I could pay the rent and the car note in the same month.  But, you know, if you're a man, you don't--tough to have a family on that.  So I think that's one of the reasons that we didn't see a lot of African American men who were in the business in those markets, in the smaller markets because they could make more money other places.
Story_ID: 647748
Speaker 1: How long did you say you were in Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: I was in Memphis fifteen months [at WREG-TV].  And then, then I moved to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: How did that come about?
Speaker 2: You know, I was made--I'd been promoted to weekend anchor in Memphis.  And I just, I think I was, I was, I turned twenty-five.  I believe I turned twenty-five when I was in Memphis.  And I just really felt by now I was ready to go to a larger market.  You know, I--this was my third job.  I really knew, I knew what I was doing.  And I'd gone to the black journalists convention [National Association of Black Journalists] and gotten a lot of positive feedback from my tape.  So I really felt that I was, I was ready, I was ready to move.  And I understood my career then, you know.  I understood that moving was how I was going to ultimately reach my goal of coming back to Chicago [Illinois].  So I needed to go to a larger market.  And my plan was to send out my tapes to places I didn't want to go.  So that I'd send the tape out.  I'd get feedback from the news directors, "Oh, you need to do this, you need to change this."  And, so I picked three or four cities that I didn't want to go to.  And I know on that list was Buffalo, New York because they had an opening and Pittsburgh.  And they called me from Buffalo, and they flew me up there.  And I got up there in the middle of a snowstorm and like people come to Chicago--and, you know, and looking around, and, really, Buffalo is a very, very strong market.  But I was--said to the news director, "You know, I don't think this is the place for me.  I don't think I can do this job," (laughter).  But all I could think was, oh, my god, I can't do, I can't do, I can't do this weather.  I can't do this.  And, again, by now I had enough of an experience to know Memphis was really good.  So I didn't have to take this job in Buffalo, so I turned the job down in Buffalo.   And then I got a call from Pittsburgh, which was at that time--I think it was number twelve.  And again, it was on my list of places I don't want to go.  But Harold Hayes was in Pittsburgh.  Harold was the one from Peoria [WRAU-TV; WHIO-TV, Peoria, Illinois].  And he was working at KDKA [KDKA-TV, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And I called Harold--and Pittsburgh was home for Harold.  And I asked him what he thought about the station, and what he thought about being back home.  And of course, you know, Harold was really a funny guy.  And, you know, he loved it.  But he was like (imitates), "It's a television station.  What do you gonna expect?"  So, okay, fine, let me go up here and see.  And I--you fly into the airport [Pittsburgh International Airport, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and then as you're driving into Pittsburgh, you go underneath a tunnel, and the city just kind of smacks you in the face.  And it was beautiful.  And, so I had a very good experience when I went up for the job interview.  And I said, "Okay, I'll do this."  So I ended up in Pittsburgh for three years because I signed a three year contract.  So I was there, I was there for three years.  And by then, you know, now I can, now I'm making, you know, much--making decent money, and I can afford to pay the rent.  I can--bought a condo.  I had my own talk show.  And it's a, it's a good time, you know.  And it was a good time.  And people are--in Pittsburgh, we're in a large enough city--people are raising families and they're staying in Pittsburgh, and they're making good, you know, making a good living.  You know, I enjoyed Pittsburgh.  It reminded me a lot of Chicago.  People talk about their communities there.  You know, you ask somebody where they're from, and they say Point Breeze [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], they say Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], they say Shadyside [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  You know, just like we say Austin [Chicago, Illinois] and Englewood [Chicago, Illinois].  You know, you--talk about their communities.  And I, and I, and I liked that very strong working atmosphere, you know.  And it was fun.
Story_ID: 647749
Speaker 1: Now you're at KDKA [KDKA-TV, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  What is the atmosphere at that station; and what were some of your assignments?
Speaker 2: KDKA was probably the first station where I'm a little bit, I'm a strong reporter now, you know.  And I had a reputation, you know, as a, as a very strong reporter--that if you, that I would come back with the story.  So I, you know, my assignments--I got, you know, I got top assignments in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], and I was very well respected as a reporter in Pittsburgh.  The shop was--I think we had maybe, there might have been one other black reporter there, black male besides Harold [Harold Hayes].  But I think, I think there was maybe Harold.  And again, there were two of us, two black females, maybe.  Was Harold there that long?  No, I know it was just the two of us.  And, you know, and we're, and we're still getting, we're getting good assignments.  But it was a really, really, really big trial, you know, then, the main white reporter, white male--would probably get it, you know.  And now, you begin to see how the white reporters tended to cover things like politics, politics.  You know, they own that beat, for the most part.  They were, they would get the business reporter, and they got titles and stuff.  You know, which of course probably gave them more money.  And you didn't have a lot of black reporters who were specialty reporters.  You know, most of your specialty reporters were your white reporters, be they man or woman.
Speaker 1: What was the other woman's name?
Speaker 2: The other black woman?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Rehema Ellis.  You know, she is now a network correspondent for NBC.  So she and I became very, very good friends, you know, because I called her.  She was the person that I called and said, "Okay, so tell me about this KDKA thing."  And that was the thing about it was that there was, there weren't a whole lot of us at a shop.  But, you know, we weren't, we were friends, you know.  We really kind of saw each other as only a few of us are here.  And, you know, and we made a point of protecting each other.  And, you know, it hadn't gotten to where it is, I think, today, is where there was, you know, that competition.  You know, I felt very comfortable calling her as another sister, and saying, "Hey, you know, I'm thinking about taking this job."  Because I wanted to know, what is it like there, you know?  What is the atmosphere?  Is it going to be a place that as a black woman I'm going to be comfortable?  Is it a good place to work?  Is it a good city to be in?  And, you know, she assured me, "It's fine, and I'm here."  You know, so, and we did that with any black person that really came into the market.  You know, we--you know, it was kind of like you had your own, we had our own little black club of we're going to tell you where the beauty shop is.  And, you know, we're going to--if we see you on assignment, we're not going to let you, we're not going to let you fail, you know.  We're going to make sure that you know and you understand that that's the president of the city council because you're new.  That's the president of the school board, and that's his title.  And, you know, hey, you might want to do this and might want to do that.  So it was very, it was a, it was a good time.  You know, it was a good time for that reason.  And we socialized a lot with the people at the other, at the other station.  And, you know, we would, we would go out for drinks, dinners after work.  We saw each other on the weekends.  You know, Rehema is still one of my best friends today.  And then there was a, you know, there were other women there at the station with radio or promotions and stuff.  And, you know, because, again, by now, we have enough money to travel and to get up and get around.  So it was, it was good.
Story_ID: 647750
Speaker 1: You're in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] now.  What--and, you know, you're talking about some of the black journalists, was there an NABG- J [National Association of Black Journalists] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --chapter there?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, the Pittsburgh media association [Media Association of Pittsburgh].  And started it because there had not really been an organization of black journalists before.  So Rehema [Rehema Ellis] and I and a woman named Cynthia [ph.]--we said we need to do this.  We need to start this organization, this chapter here in Pittsburgh.  So we actually were the founders (laughter) of that.  As a matter of fact, I got an email from them recently asking us to come back for a gala because yeah, we were the founders of that.  Now there had been a chapter, maybe.  They--somebody had kind of attempted to start one, and it never took off.  But ours was very strong.  Again, very active, brought everybody together.  We gave out scholarships, you know.  We you know raised money for different things going on in the community.  So it was, it was a good chapter.
Story_ID: 647751
Speaker 1: Did you feel that you were getting better assignments in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know, I said--but even in, even in Memphis [Tennessee], as a ten o'clock reporter [for WREG-TV], I got a lot of good assignments because I was the only one.  There were one or two ten o'clock reporters, so you got the assignment, you know.  And in Pittsburgh, yes, I got top assignments in Pittsburgh [at KDKA-TV].  The only thing was, you know, I di- I didn't have a specialty.  So, you know, you covered everything.  I didn't do, I didn't do politics very much un- unless it was a general thing in Pittsburgh.  And because I had the talk show, the talk show--it took me out of the box sometimes because I was working on the talk show stuff.  But I had a very prominent role in Pittsburgh and worked a lot of nights in Pittsburgh as well.  I think I worked, I may have, I didn't work mostly nights, but I worked, I had a night shift also in Pittsburgh.  And the night shift is where you put your stronger reporters, you know, in some markets.  You want--you've got to have strong reporters at night.  So I ended up on a lot of night shifts.
Story_ID: 647752
Speaker 1: Now you talked about you had a show.  How did that come about, and what was it a- and what was it about?
Speaker 2: Westinghouse [Westinghouse Broadcasting Company] that, at that time owned KDKA [KDKA-TV, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  They had these, they almost developed a talk show genre, and then they had a lot of them, I want to say.  But they were very strong in developing--they were very strong in it.  So that's what they did in their stations.  And at the time, too, you know, you had your community affairs programs that--and usually it was somebody from the community who was the talk show host.  And that's what we did for a very long time.  And then I think the community, the community person left, or the station just decided to go in another direction.  And they came to me and asked me to do the, to host the show.  And we would bring in people who were coming through Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]--artists and authors and, you know, covering different events.  So I mean, I got a chance to interview a lot of very interesting people.  And we would actually put stories together.  So that year we went to the NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], the national conference we actually took a show there, because [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou was there.  And I think we interviewed Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] when we were down there.  There were a bunch of newsmakers, and we went down and videotaped a good portion of our show and then brought it back and, you know, put it on.  It was a, it was a chance, really, to take advantage and interview some key newsmakers and then put our show together.
Speaker 1: Can you talk a (cough) little bit about the--there was an issue with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the general manager there, when you were there.  Do you remember how that came about?  It was with Bill Burns.
Speaker 2: When I was there?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: Nineteen ni- '81 [sic. 1988].
Speaker 2: I may not have been there then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, I think it probably happened right before I got there because I do not, I don't remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, I've heard of that.  But I don't think I started there until fall, maybe of '81 [1981].  But I don't remember, I don't remember that issue.
Story_ID: 647753
Speaker 1: You're there three years.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Where do you go next?
Speaker 2: Chicago [Illinois].  I had, when I got there, my plan was to come home after that.  You know, I knew I could probably have a good chance of getting, getting home or getting to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] or San Francisco [California].  Again, it was about the next big station.  So I started, when I would come home, I would stop by WBBM [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois] and see the assistant news director or anybody who would see me and have them look at my tape.  And, so I probably spent the last year and a half, in my mind, working for WBBM.  Because all the stories that I did then was, you know, they--it was, it was all about building a resume tape that would get me the job in Chicago.  You know, if the news director said, "Oh, you need to cover a few more live stories and this--you need to do this and then the other," I would go back and work on that, and then I'd send another tape.  And I'd work on the next thing, and I'd send another tape.
Speaker 1: How did, how did you learn about the position in Chicago?  Or did you just, you know, go after it on your own?
Speaker 2: The one in Chicago, there was no position.  I just stayed on them, you know.  But, for example, the job in Pittsburgh [KDKA-TV, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]--the reason I knew there was an opening in Pittsburgh was that at the NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], I would go and meet different people.  And there was a guy who worked in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  And when I met him, you know, he said, "We're looking, or I know that somebody is eventually going to leave, so you should send your tape to Pittsburgh."  And, you know, I felt the NABJ then was really instrumental in getting me the job in Pittsburgh.  I also at the NABJ had met Max Robinson.  And he had talked to me about Chicago and what to expect in Chicago because I think he was, he was here at the time.  And one of the reasons I didn't apply to Chicago as early--any earlier--was that he really instilled in me the importance of being ready for a market like Chicago.  You know, and I didn't want to come to this city and not be able to survive.  Because, you know, by then I had seen people get to a city that, in my opinion, was more than they could handle, you know, beyond what they were ready for.  And they'd lose the job after the contract.  So, you know, I wanted to stay in Chicago when I got here.  So, you know, and I remember, you know, Max talking about making sure that you were ready--making sure that you made your mistakes in a smaller market.  And, so, and then, you know, Charles [ph.], the guy who was working in Pittsburgh at the time, you know, looking at the tape and he went kind of like, "Yeah, you can do, you can do Pittsburgh.  You're ready for Pittsburgh."  And, so that was, you know, and I, and I am sure one of the reasons I was probably offered the job was because he, you know, took the tape into the manager.  And that's what black people would do.  If you knew somebody who was, you know, by then as we're going along--now we're talking about the mid-'80s [1980s]--if you knew somebody in that shop--especially now we've got a few blacks who are in management.  You know, and Charles wasn't a reporter, you know.  He was a technician there, a producer or something.  You know, they walked the tape in.  And the news directors, you know, they're looking for black people--not exactly, you know, they know where to look.  But, like any manager, if you can make my life easier for me--oh, you got somebody that you think is good and I can look at them?  Oh, okay.  You know, so I, you know, Charles really helped me out then, by taking that tape to the news director.  And you know, it kind of comes with the, yeah, and they're really good people, too.  You know, they look good on TV, they know what they're doing; and they're really good people, because I know them.  So, all of that stuff makes a difference.
Story_ID: 647754
Speaker 1: So Chicago [Illinois] was not exactly the same way because, you know, Chicago was home.  You know, I did my homework in Chicago in that-- [HistoryMaker] Bob Petty, for example.  I reached out to Bob Petty.  You know, I'm like reaching out to everybody in Chicago, saying, "Okay, what do I need to survive here?  What do I need to do to get here and then survive?"  And you know, once when I came home, you know, I had lunch, I met, I met Bob somewhere near ABC [WLS-TV, Chicago, Illinois].  Because I would just call people up and say, "Just give me a little bit of time.  Just, you know, just give me a few minutes of your time."  So Bob said, "Okay."  So after, after the shift once, he met me somewhere and he was, he was talking to me.  And he was another person who made me realize or just really made me want to make sure that I was ready, and I was strong enough to be able to come into Chicago.  Because he was doing, "When you get here, you're competing against the people in your shop.  You're competing against, you know, the folks at the other station.  It's a different level of competition, and you've got to be the kind of reporter who is willing to--," and I'll never forget him telling me this story, you know, "You've got to be the kind of reporter that if you really need to find somebody, you will stand on the "L" platform for hours, knowing that they're going to come to that "L" platform so they can get that "L" [elevated train] and they can get to work.  But you need to get them, you need to find them.  You will stand there for hours in the cold.  And if you're willing to do that, then you can handle Chicago.  But that's what you have to do here.  That's what it takes here in Chicago."  You know, and I, and I, and I never forgot that because, because he was absolutely right.  So you have to sit back and go, okay.  You know, and can I, can I handle just the competition in Chicago?
Story_ID: 647755
Speaker 1: I'll never forget there was a, there was a young woman who came from a smaller market.  And we were both listening to Max at the same time.  And you know, back then the NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], they would, you know, by now, you have the Max Robinsons of the world and [HistoryMaker] Vernon Jarretts of the world holding court.  And, you know, we were young reporters, and we were just hanging on every word they said.  And, you know, Max was talking about, you know, getting to the next step and doing what you need to do.  And he said, he said, you know, "And some of you, you know, you may be ready, coming from the smaller markets.  Maybe you're ready for Chicago [Illinois] now and stuff."  And I'm, you know, based on different things that I'd heard, I'd already decided that I wasn't ready.  You know, at this point I think I was in Memphis [WREG-TV, Memphis, Tennessee], and I was like, I'm not, I'm not ready to make that jump to Chicago.  And that's one of the reasons I went on to Pittsburgh [KDKA-TV, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And there was another woman who was from a market very much like mine, about the same size.  And she went on and applied for a job in Chicago, and I applied for the job--another market--in Pittsburgh.  And, you know, Max had--and she was talking and saying, "Yeah, I think I can do this, I think I can do this."  And, you know, I remember Max said to me, he said, "So, you know, you, you know, you, you know, you're a pretty girl. You're a pretty girl, you should apply.  You know, maybe you should do Chicago, too."  And he had forgotten that I had talked to him two years back, you know, in another conversation where he's talking about integrity and doing, you know, and I said to him, "I'm not ready for Chicago.  I'm not going to apply.  I can't handle Chicago, yet.  And when I come to Chicago, I want to stay."  And she applied for a job in Chicago, and she got it.
Speaker 2: Do you remember her name?
Speaker 1: I do, and I'm not going to share that with you because she didn't last (laughter).  She didn't make it.  And I always use her as an example.  Oh, she got here all right, but she didn't, she didn't last.  And I've been here a long time because I waited.
Story_ID: 647756
Speaker 1: When did you actually feel you were ready for Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: After just a couple of years.  By year number two--when I was entering year number two in Pittsburgh [KDKA-TV, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and I was getting those good assignments.  And I had a good, strong reputation.  After another year, I felt I was ready, I was ready for Chicago.
Speaker 1: So you come--what year did you come to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-four [1984], 19--November, 1984.
Speaker 1: What was your sense of the market in Chicago?
Speaker 2: That I'd bitten off more than I could chew, as ready as I thought I was.  It's a tough market.
Speaker 1: And why did you feel that?
Speaker 2: Because the people here, you know, especially then--they were so good, so good, and the expectations were so high.  And I just remember going home and telling my mom [Emma Hill Tucker] that they treated every story like it was the last coming of Christ.  You know, this was the story.  And I, you know, in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], you had the big stories and you had to, you know, wrap it up for the big stories.  And then there are the stories you do them everyday.  And then you cover this story and you knew what to do.  But, in Chicago, it's like, I felt like every story took all the producers and the writers.  And, you know, somebody would look and make sure that--not just the facts, but that the story was told in the best way.  It's just--there was a lot, there was a lot.  And it was every day that that expectation was there.  You know, and it was, it was draining.  But it didn't take long, it didn't take long to adjust.  It didn't take long to catch on.  But I just remember, just the pace.  The pace was fast, the pace was different.  And going out to cover a story and realizing that, you know, the reporters at the other station--they had such, they had great sources.  And they knew people, and they had relationships with them.  And, so you weren't just competing against who was just trying to get the facts.  You know, you had to make sure that you established the same kind of relationship so that you could know about a story early, get the information, get everything that you needed.  So it was, took a lot more energy beyond just this story today.  You know, you were a reporter, it felt like, 24/7.  You were on 24/7 in Chicago.  But I, you know, I mean it's--I--it's the best news town, I think, in the country.  But I'm biased (laughter).
Story_ID: 647757
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Can I jump in here?  But let's talk about also 1984, and what's happening in Chicago [Illinois].  You have Harold Washington as mayor.  You've got council wars still going on--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I mean this is--and who's at WBBM [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois], too?  Because I mean, you need to talk about all that.
Speaker 2: Okay. Nineteen eighty-four [1984], Bill Kurtis is not back.  I think Don Craig [Donald Craig] was the anchor and [HistoryMaker] Harry Porterfield.  Bill Kurtis was still at the network, I believe, with CBS morning show ['CBS Morning News'], whatever it was called at that time.  Harold Washington had, he was a year into office.  Because in 1983, I was in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] when he won because I was on the phone with my mom [Emma Hill Tucker] all night as she's watching the returns.  And we're both (laughter) talking about--she's taking me through it.  So this is a year into his office, and it's just, it's just like the Wild West, with the city council wars.  And, so even though you didn't cover politics, you didn't have to be a political reporter to cover politics in Chicago at that point because there was so much going on.  You know, there was always a side story to whatever the main story that was going on with the, with the mayor.  And then, you know, anytime the mayor went somewhere, it was again, not just the political story.  You know, you'd run, you'd cover the mayor on different openings of this and introductions of that.  And he had a way.  He was really funny.  He, if he didn't want to answer a question, you know, I'd be asking and he'd answer, and then you'd ask the next question, next question.  And he would get tired of answering the questions, and he would just say, "Oh, you are such a pretty girl."  And it's like, you know, everybody would laugh.  And of course that gave him enough time to just, you know, change the subject and get off the air.  And it was just so aggravating when he would do that.  And, you know, and you had to rein him back in and, "Thank you, mayor very much, but, you know, will you answer this question?"  And, "Why is it this and whatever?"  But he--it was, it was very, it was interesting covering him.  It was great to be, to be in this setting, you know, when he was mayor and seeing how people reacted to him and watching, you know, in our, in our own shop how--it was also--when Harold Washington, you know, again, and I wasn't here when he, when he won.  I mean, I heard about everything because, you know, Mom let me know.
Story_ID: 647758
Speaker 1: A year later we're seeing a lot more African Americas--African Americans in different positions in the city [Chicago, Illinois], you know, so we're now covering African Americans.  And as journalists we had always--one of the things that we always complained about was that the experts that we see on television--we just didn't see experts, enough experts, of color.  You know, you didn't see African Americans who were specializing in X, Y, Z.  You know, you always tended to see the white person who was the expert in this.  Well, with Washington [Harold Washington] in, now you began to see many more African Americans on televisions because they were the head of this and the head of that stuff.  And it was, it was, you know, it was really great to watch.  It was great to be a part of that--to interview people who were the head of this department and head of that department--and which I think is great for the images that our, that our children see on television.  So it was, it was a very, very fun time.
Story_ID: 647759
Speaker 1: Shortly after that, what, he [Harold Washington] passed in '87 [1987].  And that was a very interesting time to cover, too, yeah.  The neighborhoods in Chicago [Illinois], I remember every--you know, I got here, and I used to think that wow, I was glad I had lived in Memphis [Tennessee] and covered race, you know.  That's when I really appreciated what I had learned in Memphis because Chicago was, during that time, very much the same.  And whatever the issue was, there was a race factor.  Or you could, you might want to ask that question.  You might want to look at that.  You know, there were, communities were changing.  You know, we had Marquette Park [Chicago, Illinois] which, of course, when I was growing up, you definitely didn't go.  You know, Cicero [Illinois]--you just didn't go.  But now, you know, the communities are changing, and they're becoming more melting pots.  And we're covering that, you know.  You're covering some very interesting stories that involve race.  You know, there was this huge march through Marquette Park on the anniversary of one of King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] marches or something that I got a chance to cover.  And, you know, seeing just whites that were very angry and seeing a mix, racially mixed, crowd marching through Marquette Park.  And, you know, and realizing that you were witnessing this change.  And it was only a matter of time before it all changed.
Speaker 2: So did you cover council wars also?
Speaker 1: Not really because I wasn't a political reporter [for WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois].  I mean, I would, I would cover them when something was happening--when there was an issue--subject matter, coming up.  And then maybe if there was something that happened in the council, then you'd go out to the community.  And I would do the sidebar, you know, the different communities for the stories.  But I did not, you know, I wasn't in the room when all of this was going on.  Again, this was primarily the political reporters who--they were in the room, when a lot of that was going on.  The other reporters--we weren't.

Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-five [1985], [HistoryMaker] Harry Porterfield is replaced by Bill Kurtis (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Laughter.
Speaker 1: What was the atmosphere in the newsroom at the station [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois], and what was your sense of what was going on?
Speaker 2: Harry was, went back to weekends.  And Bill came back, and Bill was the main anchor.  It was, you know, it was, it was a very tense time in our newsroom.  And I think it was because everybody loved Harry, you know.  And it was, you know, the management had made this decision, and those of us in the newsroom--we were living with this decision.  And I think the, you know, the majority of the people wanted to understand and accept that it was great to have Bill back, but we wish we'd--they'd done it a different way--some kind of way not to have put Harry back on the weekends.  And, you know, but he wasn't there very long.  You know, when he left and then went to ABC [WLS-TV, Chicago, Illinois], you know, we were, we were, we were left with the mess, you know.  And there was a lot of--I think people were sad.  They were very, very--and the newsroom was very subdued about what we were experiencing, you know, what we were going through, having lost Harry because of that, you know, for that, for that reason.  And the protest was, you know, PUSH [Operation PUSH; Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] was out there every Thursday.  In fact, you knew it was Thursday because they were out there.  And they literally were, they were out there every Thursday for about nine months.  Not every other Thursday, every Thursday.  So every Thursday you had to cross the line in order to get into the station.  And it was, you know, there was always a sense of--you just, you just wish you didn't have to go through it, you know.  I mean, I didn't--and it was hard because it was great to have Bill back, you know.  So it was really a difficult time, because Bill was so awesome.  You know, he's so good at what he does.  So that's why you kind of say, couldn't we, you know, you wish you had figured something else out.  You know, it was--Harry--it was a demotion in Harry's eyes, you know.  And then to be put back on weekend anchor after all that time.  And he was so, he was so incredibly good.  It was a, it was a, it was a difficult time.  And Robin [HistoryMaker Robin Robinson] was there at that time as well, you know.  So everybody just kind of--it's almost like one of those things as a kid, you know, when the fight's going on: you just kind of go back in the room and just kind of wait for the storm to pass.
Story_ID: 647761
Speaker 1: I was reading something that there was some thought that management had missed what was going on demogratically--demographically in Chicago [Illinois].  You had, you had a black mayor [Harold Washington]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the reaction of the black community to Harry's [HistoryMaker Harry Porterfield] demotion, to a certain extent, was more than they expected.  Did you have that sense?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  You know, I think, I don't even know that it was so much--I didn't get the sense in the newsroom that was it because we had a black mayor.  You know, it was really just about demoting Harry--somebody who had done, who was doing a very capable job, to make way for Bill [Bill Kurtis], who had left.  You know, so I don't--and if it was--if--I don't, I never had this feeling the community said, you know, "Here we are with this black mayor."  I think you would have had the same kind of reaction at any time.  You know, just because Harry was such a fixture, and he'd been there for so long that you didn't want to see that sort of thing happen to him, you know.  So I--and I think where, I think management probably didn't expect--because so often when management makes a personnel decision like that, you know, people get upset for a little while, and then it goes away.  And I think that's what caught them off guard was that they had really--that black folks were upset, and they stayed angry for a very long time.  And then--you know, and because Rainbow PUSH [Operation PUSH; Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] really kept it in the black community.  You know, it may not have been in the media for nine months, but it was in the black community the whole time.  It was a reminder.  It was a constant reminder of what the management at Channel 2 [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois] had done.  And it--so they were, the community was insulted.  And I don't know that management expected that.  They didn't expect a strong, lasting reaction.  You know, because over the years--I mean, from their viewpoint there were a lot of people that--you decide, "Well, we're going in a different direction, we want to do something different."  But, you know, and it may have been the way--just all of a sudden.  And you know, Bill comes back to lots of fanfare, and then Harry is demoted, you know.  So, it may have been the way that it was done, you know, as well.  But, yeah, black folks were angry.
Story_ID: 647762
Speaker 1: We were talking about [HistoryMaker] Harry Porterfield and the reaction not only in the community but, you know, I guess there was reaction even within the WBBM [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois] staff.  Who was the general manager then?
Speaker 2: Gary Cummings was our general manager at the time because he actually was the one who--he was there when I was hired.  But we had--I mean, what I was saying, the interesting thing about WBBM is that behind the scenes, we had a number of black writers.  I don't know that we had a black producer, but we had blacks that, you know, ran the assignment desk or at least on the assignment desk and production assignments.  So film producers.  And there were a number of African Americans who--probably more than some of the other stations.  You know, we had a number of African Americans on our staffs.  So in terms of diversity, WBBM was doing the right thing.  So it was just really kind of--it was awkward.  It was awkward when this decision was probably made because of whatever ratings and personnel decisions.  And, but the, but the fact that he was a very popular, well liked African American was something that didn't sit well within a city that is, you know, almost 50 percent African American.  And, you know, and I think what you have to remember, though, is that he, you know, in Chicago [Illinois] we--our news people are media stars.  You know, because we don't have, we don't have Hollywood.  We don't have Broadway.  You know, and, so people in Chicago watch their news, they know their news, they care about their news, you know.  And BBM's reputation--I mean, I grew up watching BBM.  You know, that was the only thing in our, in our home.  You know, Fahey Flynn--and just such a strong reputation.  It was number one for eons.  And so, when everything in life is changing, you know, it becomes a part of that as well.  You get people--and Harry's been on--Harry's been the main anchor for a couple of years by then, if not longer.  I'm not sure.  And then all of a sudden you want to shake things up.  And people were very proud that Harry had that position.  You know, the African- African Americans--they, you know, they count black folks on TV.  You know, they know exactly who's there and how long and all of that.  And they support them, and they embrace them.  So, you know, I mean Bill [Bill Kurtis] leaves, you put Harry in there.  Harry does a great job; and then you want to take Harry out.  It was, it was a tough pill to swallow.
Story_ID: 647763
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other on air personalities, African American on air personalities, during this time?
Speaker 2: During that time?  Robin was our weekend anchor, [HistoryMaker] Robin Robinson.  Because when I got there, Robin was our weekend anchor.  And John Davis [HistoryMaker John E. Davis] was a male reporter that was there.  And that may, that may have been it for African Americans on the air.  And I think I'm probably--and then [HistoryMaker] Warner Saunders was hosting a show.  So, you know, Warner was very prominent at the station [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois].  I think that was it.  I'm probably forgetting somebody.
Speaker 1: Who were at some of the other stations?
Speaker 2: At the other stations?  [HistoryMaker] Bob Petty.  What's the gentleman where people were turning themselves, you know, they were turning themselves into?  Russ.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Russ Ewing?
Speaker 2: Russ Ewing.  [HistoryMaker] Diann Burns was weekend anchor at 7 [WLS-TV, Chicago, Illinois] at the time.  At NBC, [HistoryMaker] Renee Ferguson was doing investigative journalism, I think, at NBC [WMAQ-TV, Chicago, Illinois] at that time.  She was definitely, definitely reporting.  [HistoryMaker] Art Norman was at NBC at the time.  Oh, and Pat Harvey was WGN [WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois].  There was no WFLD [WFLD-TV, Chicago, Illinois] because, you know, Robin was the first one to leave and go do that.  It was Pat Harvey, Jim--no, he's still weekend anchor at WGN.  Help me out here.  His daughter [Karen Jordan] now is a weekend anchor at Channel 7.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Oh, you're talking about Bob, Robert--
Speaker 2: Jordan.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  --Robert Jordan [HistoryMaker Robert H. Jordan, Jr.], Bob (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Bob, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Bob Jordan.
Speaker 2: Bob Jordan was weekend anchor at--and then Muriel Clair was at Channel 9.  So I'm probably forgetting somebody.  But, so, you know, you had a really good, quite a few.  Chicago [Illinois] was, has always been a fairly strong market for African Americans--always pretty strong.
Story_ID: 647764
Speaker 1: Now Gary Cummings is let go or fired or?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  After that, he left.  And one of the things that Rainbow PUSH [Operation PUSH; Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] demanded was a change in management because it's kind of like, you know, Cummings made this management decision.  The African Americans--community didn't like it.  So one of the things that they were, they really asked for, was for a change in management, more African Americans in management.  And that's when [HistoryMaker] Johnathan Rodgers came in, and he became our general manager.  And he brought in some other management in different positions and stuff.  And Harry [HistoryMaker Harry Porterfield] is done by now, you know, he was gone by then.  But Johnathan came in, and it was, you know, and I think it made a difference to, it made a difference in the African American community.  I think people saw that, and they really saw that BBM [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois] was trying to do something.  But I think it was very difficult.  People were still hurt, and it would, it would take us years, years, years to get over that--years.
Speaker 1: Was there a special sense within WBBM as to Johnathan Rodgers coming in?  Did they think that was--kind of made up for what they did, or what the previous management had done?
Speaker 2: The people at BBM?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You know, you have to, you have to remember that for us--we, we've seen so many personnel changes.  You know, we're not quite looking at it like the African American community is.  You know, we understand that management has made some decisions, that if there were more African Americans, you know, they made, they made decisions that a lot of people don't like, a lot of times.  So, you know, from our viewpoint, it wasn't like, you know, Johnathan was necessarily going to balance out, you know, the--what the bad thing that had happened or not.  You know, we--as professionals in this business, we know that you can be gone tomorrow.  You know, so, we didn't look at it exactly like the community did to Harry, what happened to Harry.  You know, that's not to say that we were, that we weren't unhappy about it.  But Johnathan coming in, it was really, from my viewpoint, an opportunity to have an African American in a very high position, which is something that is even to this day, something you don't see a lot of in this industry.  So we were happy, we were ecstatic that we had an African American as the general manager.  You know, that was a history making moment there.  And then he brought in a young woman who--I think, I think actually she was already there.  I think Aretha was already there.  But then, you know, she gets promoted to kind of help with promotions.  And then, you know, Monroe comes in after that in community affairs.  Then we get a film producer who's African American that comes in.  So, you know, it was, it was, it was great.  It was, it was really great to have Johnathan there and have some other African Americans come into the fray.
Speaker 1: What was the woman's name?
Speaker 2: Aretha, Aretha Mills [Aretha Marshall-Mills].  And I think Aretha was, I think Aretha already worked at the station.  I think she was there already.  But, you know, she just had a larger role.
Speaker 1: And Monroe--that was [HistoryMaker] Monroe Anderson?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 647765
Speaker 1: You're still involved with NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] at this point?
Speaker 2: Very much so.  I was on the, I served on the national board.  As a matter of fact, when Johnathan [HistoryMaker Johnathan Rodgers] came in, he was on the national board before he got there.  And he had been elected to represent our region.  And then of course, his job was very overwhelming, so he asked me to take over the board position.  So I did that, so I served on the national board for about five years.
Speaker 1: Now you, I think this may be around 1987.  You were honored by NABJ.  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was that for?
Speaker 2: I want to say it was a story--we would--it was like any competition.  You know, it was a story that I did, I believe on a kid named--maybe it was Yummy Sandifer [Robert Sandifer].  Or maybe it was, or was it Harold Washington's death?  I don't, I don't know the story.  Because here's how this works--it's that, you know, you kind of turn your stories and your tapes in for this contest or this award or that award.  And, you know, you were, you were, you were chosen as kind of based on your body of work as journalist of the year or journalist or something.  And then you get the Emmys [Emmy Awards] because of that.  But, you know, I'm not the kind of person--I don't, I don't--those things, you know, I don't remember them.  You know, I think those awards are great, but I never was really the kind of person who lived for them.  I enjoy what I do.  I do what I do to serve my community and serve my God.  I don't do it for the awards.  I probably didn't even pay the money to enter that.  I probably didn't even enter it, to tell you the truth.  I remember because I didn't enter.  Somebody else's station probably said we're going to enter this.  I probably wouldn't have done it.
Story_ID: 647766
Speaker 1: In 1993, an issue arose with you.  Can you describe that for us?
Speaker 2: In 1993--I think my contract was coming up.  My contract was close to coming up, and new management came in.  You know, and again, remember, you know, we look at things a little different.  New management came in, and they just, you know, well, your contract is coming up.  They look at all the contracts that are about to come up.  And they're like, okay, we can get rid of this one, get rid of this one--and it was--I think they wanted to really get rid of me.  It was the way, though, that they decided to do it that, again, may not have been the smartest way to do it.  I was, you know, I was doing fine.  I was having great assignments.  New management comes in and somebody--one of the managers asked me one question about my complexion and indicated that my, that I would get dark in the summertime, and that was there any kind of makeup that would help me out.  And I was offended by that, you know.  And I shared that with one of the assignment managers, you know.  Because I, you know, I felt like, yeah, I do.  But, and there is no--I can't do anything about, you know, my getting darker in the summertime.  And no, there is no makeup that I can use.  And it really became one of those stories.  You know how you whisper in some--a kid--in an ear, you know the game that kids play.  You whisper, and the next person whispers and the next per- well, by the time the story got out, it got out that he had said I was too dark for television.  And the truth be told, he never said that.  He said (laughter) exactly what I said--he questioned it.  I was offended by what he said and shared it with someone, who told the next person and the next person and the next person.  And it took on a life of its own.  And, you know, and then they just--then the station [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois] is now, is kind of caught because they didn't say that, and I never said they said it, you know.  And, so they can't say anything to me because I never said any, I never said anybody said that.  You know, but it really just kind of came down to, I think, them wanting to take advantage of the fact that, you know, the contract was up.  And then when it all kind of got out into community because somebody told the people at PUSH [Operation PUSH; Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] or something, and then PUSH said something.  So, now it becomes public, and the community gets really upset.  Because in our community, you know, my mother [Emma Hill Tucker] was very fair skinned, you know.  And my father [Ernest Tucker] was a shade darker than I am.  So you have your children, and complexion is a very sensitive thing, a very, very sensitive thing in our community.  So, yeah, as opposed to, at that point getting rid of me, you know, when it really came--got out into the community--I was called in.  And they said, "Okay, fine.  Look, you know--," kind of, it was kind of like, we're going to let everything die down, and we'll just give you a year's contract.  And we'll just let everything die down and just, you know, just sit there for a year and don't say anything.  Well, after about six weeks, they called me back in again and said, "Look, we have this new assignment we'd like you to take, and we want to give you a three year contract."  And I was floored.  I was like, but six weeks ago, it was a different story.  And they were like (makes sound), we're done with that.
Story_ID: 647767
Speaker 1: Now did you know Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] was going to get involved?  Did they-
Speaker 2: No.  I was--no (laughter).  No, no.  I was literally at home celebrating my fifth wedding anniversary, my fifth wedding anniversary.  And I put my dress back on, and the children were my ring bearers.  I had two little boys [Trevor Wilkins and Cody Wilkins] by then.  And we had set the house up ca- cathedral style.  And the preacher was there.  And I get a phone call from my husband's [Anthony Wilkins] aunt, who says to me, "They're talking about you on the radio.  And they have gone on radio, and Reverend Barrow [HistoryMaker Reverend Willie T. Barrow] said that if you're too black for Channel 2 [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois], then we're too black to watch."  I'm like, what?  So people are coming to my home.  Operation PUSH though, Rainbow PUSH, is five blocks away.  I take my dress off, I throw some clothes on, I go down there.  And, you know, I see Janette Wilson.  And I'm like, "What are you doing?  Who said this?"  Because I had just really kind of resigned myself to--if--again, this is their candy store.  If this is what they decide they want to do or don't want to do, I understand this.  Okay, fine, you know, I'll live out the two months or whatever I have on my contract and then figure out something else to do in life.  And, so I was really angry with her, because I'm like, "What are you doing?"  You know, nobody talked to me.  Where did this come from?  And she said to me simply, "This is bigger than you.  This is not about you.  This is about the larger community, and they can't do this."  And I just turned around and I left and went back to my wedding, to my party.  And fortunately, the next day--and I, you know, I remember the media people were like, oh, you know, and after this came out, she took off and she left.  Well, I had vacation scheduled already (laughter) because, you know, we were going to take the family--we were going to celebrate this fifth year anniversary.  And our honeymoon--we were going to take the kids now.  So we flew out the next day to Mexico.  We went to, you know, because--which was a planned trip, to go to Mexico.  We go to Mexico for the week.  And, during the time that we were down there, again, it was that word of mouth in the community, and things were crazy.  Well, you know, at the time, I, you know, I looked at it, and I was furious, I was embarrassed.  I was like, just let it go.  You know, I look, I look back on it now and say, "They saved, they saved my job."  You know, and Janette and all of them just really totally ignoring me, and doing whatever they were going to do.  They saved my job.  Because, you know, I go away.  And I didn't even, I didn't even go back home.  Because, you know, I couldn't get in touch with anybody, and this was obviously before cell phones and stuff like that.  So I'm like out the box for this week that I'm in, I'm in Mexico.  And the only thing I'm doing down there is, you know, I know what was happening before I left, but I don't know what's going on while I'm down there.  And I do one of those moments of, you know, I walk the beach--and you let go, you let God.  You know, and I was kind of like, it be Your will.  If I'm supposed to not do this and stay home with the kids or whatever, you know, I throw my hands up.  I said, "I can't fight this battle, I'm done."  And I got back, and there were reporters outside my home, according to my neighbors. So I went to my mom's [Emma Hill Tucker] house, and I just stayed.  I just stayed at my mom's house.  And then I got a phone call from Johnathan [HistoryMaker Johnathan Rodgers], and Johnathan explained what had been going on.  And he, and that's when he said, "You know, we just need to, you know, let's just take some time, just step back and take some time.  Come on in, you know, and let's talk about this."  And Applegate [William Applegate] was the general manager because, because by then Johnathan was the station manager.  And, you know, it was the same sort of thing.  You know, they were kind of like, community is not happy about this move (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Again?
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  And I'm sure somebody in New York [New York] is going, again?  You know, this wasn't a good thing.  So let's just, you know, do the one year and sign it, and let's see what happens.  So I'm like, okay.  And like I said, six weeks after that, it was like nothing had ever happened.  It was amazing.  It was just, shows you just how crazy the business is.
Story_ID: 647768
Speaker 1: When Janette [Janette Wilson] first told you that, did you feel that maybe PUSH [Operation PUSH; Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] was trying to use you?
Speaker 2: (Pause) You know, I don't know that I felt PUSH was trying to use me.  But she said to me, "This is bigger than you."  So I don't know that I felt I was being used, abused, but it was clear to me that I was being used to make a point.  So yes, I under- I understood that because that's what she said (laughter).  And it wasn't that, it was--that's exactly what she said to me, "This is bigger than you.  We are not, we will not allow this sort of thing to go on.  There has to be a message."  And I remember at one, at one point sometime after that, Robert Feder, who wrote an article.  He had written about how, you know, they wanted to get rid of me.  And I don't remember the details but, you know, he wrote about everything that was going on at the time.  And he, and he called me, and he, and he said, "Why did you stay?"  You know, he said, "Clearly, the station [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois] didn't want you.  But then maybe the only reason they kept you, you know, was because you were black.  Why did, why did you stay?"  And, you know, I said, "Well, you know, thank you for calling me now.  Because when you wrote the other articles, you didn't bother to call and ask me what my side of the story was.  Or you didn't ask my opinion.  Or you didn't ask anything.  You didn't ask me what happened, you just--but, you know, thanks for calling now."  But, you know, so I said, "I'm not going to engage in a conversation.  I will simply say I stayed because it was important to the community.  If the community fought for me, then clearly they see me as a role model.  And if I have an opportunity to stay, I'm staying for them."  Because also during that time, you know, I didn't--people were saying--and I didn't realize this, you know, they would call me and say, "You look like my daughter.  You know, my daughter is looking at somebody on television who is the same skin color as her.  My son is looking at, you know," and while at one point I was kind of like, you know if they don't want you anymore, they don't want you anymore.  But then you have people in the community saying, "You look like my baby."  And I said to him, "Yeah, I'm staying because it's important to some kid out there.  So yeah, I'm going to stay."
Speaker 1: Then a short time after that, they come in and offered you another contract?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They offered me a three year contract with more money.  And, you know, there's a part of me that thinks that during that time--but shortly after I got back, you know, I said to one of my bosses, "This is very distracting."  And, you know, he said to me, "Dorothy [HistoryMaker Dorothy Tucker], just do what you do.  Do what you do."  And, so I did.  I came to work every day and, you know, just did my best.  And, you know, three weeks afterwards--and I, and I want to believe--I can't remember whether we had a--I don't think we had a new news director.  But, you know, about six weeks afterwards they said, "We think we want to do something else."
Story_ID: 647769
Speaker 1: Now what other types of things did you do during this period?
Speaker 2: What do you mean?
Speaker 1: I mean were you--you weren't just doing reporting, you were doing some other things?
Speaker 2: Oh, and that's, at that time I think I was just, I may have been just reporting.  But at somewhere along the way, I had done, I did a talk show when I--and this may have been along the same time.  If not, maybe a year before.  So I did a talk show with WVON [WVON Radio, Chicago, Illinois] for about three hours once a week, which was just a community talk show.  So I mean, I had done other things to kind of keep myself in the community.  And remember, this was different for me.  You know, this is home.  So, you know, I would, I was always more than willing to emcee different things and to show up at events.  And, you know, I was in the community a lot.  And I, and I think that's probably why the community really stood up for me, was because I, you know, I was--grown up on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].  So I was on the West Side a lot because my dad's [Ernest Tucker] still there.  My sister [Joyce Tucker Boykins] was still there and, you know, I'm living on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], I go to church on the South Side, and the kids are in public school.  You know, so it's very, very ingrained.  But, so I did the radio show for about a year or so before--and I think it's probably before the birth of the first child [Trevor Wilkins], because it was hard after the baby came.  But I did a radio show--and then this was also during the time when I think Warner [HistoryMaker Warner Saunders] had left.  So I was hosting 'Common Ground,' I believe is what it was called.  So I was also hosting 'Common Ground' at that time, which was--I think we did something every week.  I think it was a weekly show.  So I'd take some time out of the schedule, and I would, I would do that.
Speaker 1: What was 'Common Ground' about?
Speaker 2: It was, it was a community affairs show.  It was a community affairs show.  Again, the sort of thing I'd done in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] with news makers and different writers and artists.  And mostly, mostly stuff that was going on in the community.  And yeah, but mostly, mostly reporting then.  After that, I did, I wrote for N'DIGO.  You know, I wanted to do consumer reporting for a short time.  So I did some consumer reporting and then would write for--take the stories that I did on television and tweak them and do a column every week for newspaper.  And then, of course, now I do the consumer show for WVON again.  I do just strictly consumer show once a week, a half hour show, that I've been doing now for about four years maybe, maybe a little longer, four or five years.

Speaker 1: Something else happened around this time.  [HistoryMaker] Felicia Middlebrooks had--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) she had an issue--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember--
Speaker 1: What do you recall about that?
Speaker 2: That was a little--I want to say maybe that was the early '90s [1990s].  I believe it was kind of like Felicia found out that B96, which is also owned by CBS Radio--she was not making as much money her--as the deejays were, and working--her Q rating or her--the ratings were higher.  And it was something that had to do with the ratings and stuff.  So I remember that Felicia--there was, again, another kind of out- outpouring of support for her and protests in the community that the white deejays at B96 were making twice as much as she was making.  So, you know, as a--the main anchor, you know, she was the main anchor for WBBM Radio [Chicago, Illinois], for the news station.  And I don't think she was ever off the air.  But it was very, very, it was very, very public, again.  BBM [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois], poor BBM, they've had so (laughter)--they keep having these public scandals.
Story_ID: 647771
Speaker 1: How did your parents [Emma Hill Tucker and Ernest Tucker] feel about you coming back to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh, they were ecstatic.  They were absolutely ecstatic.  My, you know, you have to remember my dad.  Neither one of them really knew what it was I was about to go into, and what I said I wanted to do.  You know, so I just remember once when--my dad just would always tell me, you know, I have to be a doctor or a lawyer.  In fact, he said the only grad school that he would pay for would be law school or med school, and that's just the way it was.  And I said, "Okay, keep your money.  I'm not doing that."  And, so, you know, he would finally--somewhere around, you know, he's asking me--and I was still in high school [Austin High School, Chicago, Illinois], "What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?"  What do you want to do?"  And then I get to college [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], and I go major in this broadcasting thing.  And he finally says, "What kind of job are you going to get?"  And I said, "Dad, I want to do broadcasting."  And he couldn't get it. "What's broadcasting?  What do they do (unclear)?"  I finally said, "Dad, look.  You know how you watch Walter Jacobson on TV?  That's broadcasting.  You know, I want to work behind the scenes for Walter Jacobson."  And he said, "Okay."  And his famous line, "Well, just be the best one, then," (laughter).  "No matter what it is, you just be the best."  Okay, so when I, you know, he would go to different places.  They'd come to visit me and, you know, I'd always make a point of giving them a tour of the station and introducing them to everybody.  And they'd watch me on television because otherwise they couldn't see me.  So by the time they get to Chicago, they've only seen me a handful of times.  So they were, they were very, very happy.  And I remember when I got the phone call that I was hired.  I was at my mom's house when they called me.  And, you know, we were both on the bed jumping up and down.  "I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home."  And I said to my mom, you know, as I'm going, "I'm coming back home."  And I said, "I'm coming home, and I'm going to move back in with you."  And she stopped and she went, "Well, you don't have to do that," (laughter).  And, so, but they were, they were happy.  And my mom used to make a point.  Because one time she said she was--some guy came over--something, to get something fixed.  And a repairman comes over for whatever reason to repair something.  And he says, "Oh, I see you have [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Tucker's picture."  You know, "Wow, you know her?"  She said, "That's my daughter."  "Really, that's your daughter?  Oh, my god."  And I think he gave my mother a discount or something or something extra (laughter).  So of course then from then on out, anytime a repairman came, she said she'd get both pictures out (laughter).  Put them front and center, you know.  She wouldn't say anything, but she'd put them front and center, just to make sure.  Because I think then she had the picture with my name up under it that had the Channel 2 [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois] logo or something or another.  And she'd frame them and she'd, you know, take them out of the corner with the other kids (laughter), and put mine front and center, because there was an advantage, she said.

Speaker 1: Now you mentioned that when the Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] and the contract then came up, you were celebrating your fifth wedding anniver--
Speaker 2: I was celebrating my fifth, yeah.
Speaker 1: When did you get married?
Speaker 2: I got married in April of 1989.  Yeah, I mean I pretty much kind of made the decision by then.  I think I was on my, maybe the--no, '88 [1988] because the child was born in '89 [1989].  I married in '88 [1988].  I married in '88 [1988] because I actually met him in '86 [1986] or so.  So I was still kind of probably working my first, maybe on my second contract, when I, when I met my husband.  And by then I was really kind of thinking I would either, if I didn't meet anybody to marry, my goal then was to go to the network, you know.  So I was about to set my sights on the next goal because I'd done what I wanted to do, which was to get back to Chicago [Illinois] and, now I was going to go to the next place.  Or, you know, if I meet somebody, I'll get married because I, by then I also knew that the network correspondents, they were on the road all the time.  They had a hard life, from my viewpoint.  And I'm sure it's a fabulous life.  But I really didn't know if I wanted that life, but I would have done it if I didn't meet anybody.  And I met, I met my husband at a fundraiser.  I think it was a fundraiser for a black orchestra or something or other.  And it turns out we'd both gone to college during the same time.  We didn't know each other, but he was a year behind me in college.  So we had a lot of friends in common, you know, a lot of places in common.  So it was, it was an easy relationship once we met.  So, we married in '88 [1988], and had two kids by '93 [1993].
Speaker 1: What is his name?
Speaker 2: Tony Wilkins, Anthony Wilkins is his name.  You know grew up in Grand Crossing [Greater Grand Crossing, Chicago, Illinois], went to Mendel [Mendel Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois].  You know, he was--Catholic high school and stuff.  And then did engineering and track at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].  And probably was, I was looking for somebody like my father [Ernest Tucker], you know.  I made no bones about it.  I mean, I wanted to marry a man who had the same kind of values and drive and commitment that my dad had.  And, you know, he went out to--I took him out to my dad's shop when we were dating, and he was walking through the shop [Precise Products Inc., Warrenville, Illinois].  And he stopped, and he was talking to my father and stuff.  And it was pretty much at that moment I know I said, "Okay, that's the one because that's as close as you're going to get.  So that's, that's the one."  You know, he had a lot of the characteristics of somebody who you kind of felt would always be there, would always take care of you.  And he was very supportive of my career, and he respected my career.  And that was critical to me, that he understood that what I did was just as important as what he did.  And, you know, and I, and I think it's worked twenty-five years because our relationship is based on a lot of respect, you know and a, and a lot of understanding and friendship.
Speaker 1: What does he do?
Speaker 2: He is a titled personnel in BNY Mellon bank [Bank of New York Mellon Corporation].  He worked for Northern Trust [Northern Trust Corporation, Chicago, Illinois].  Basically he's in the finance world, you know, investments, and all that good stuff.  And he does a lot of things in the startup world--an entrepreneur, startup, that sort of thing.  So, again, you know, my dad coming from that entrepreneur--that was--I understand that.  I understand men who have a commitment to their careers as well.  And, you know, and he, and that entrepreneurial--and just I'm very supportive of what he wants to do, and what he is doing.
Speaker 1: How many children?
Speaker 2: We have three.
Speaker 1: Can you give us their names and birth order?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Trevor Wilkins is twenty-three years old.  He was born in October of 1989.  And Cody is the second one, Cody Wilkins.  He is twenty-one.  He was born in 1992.  And then Nya [Nya Wilkins] is the baby.  She is eighteen now.  She was born in 19--April of 1995.  They are--I call them my heart, that's Trevor.  My soul is Cody.  And my spirit is Nya.  And they pretty much fit that description pretty well.
Story_ID: 647773
Speaker 1: Going back to your career, what would you say are some of the highs and lows of your career?
Speaker 2: The low is clearly the time during 1993.  Yeah, that was, that was a low point.  Because, you know, while I understood it, it still doesn't make it easy.  You know, I understood where--why they were going to make the decision because they can.  But it would have been the end of my career because I wasn't going to go anywhere else.  I pretty much made the decision that, you know, this was probably, this was it.  I'm just not going to go.  So that was probably the, that was the, that was the low point because it was a very, very difficult time emotionally.  You know, I think there are many high points.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, there are lots of high points.  Because I think I'm so blessed, I'm so fortunate to be able to really tell the stories and to meet the people and to learn new words every day, you know.  And the stories that I have covered--not big stories, you know.  The high points are not any of the major stories.  The high points are when you know you've made a difference in somebody's life, or when you know somebody appreciates what you've done.  And when you feel like you're talking to a mother or a child and because of something, because of a story that you did--it had an impact on their life, you know.  I mean, you know, I've learned lots of lessons, too, as a reporter.  You know, it's difficult for me to remember all the stories after thirty some odd years.  You know, I remember the ones, the recent ones--that have had an impact.  You know, I had an opportunity about--last month--to do--I pitched--five days, I asked the manager to just let me do a positive story everyday.  Because all of the stories, not all of them, but many of the stories that we have been covering have been about the violence in Chicago [Illinois], you know.  So, I said, "Just give me one week, one week, to turn some really positive stories and show the good things that people are doing, you know, in our community."  And they said, "Yes."  So, you know, I--all of them I thought were great.  We did a great story on Englewood [Chicago, Illinois]--people who live there and love their community.  And they kind of basically said the reputation is bad, but we don't have a shooting everyday.  We don't have a shooting everyday on every corner.  The majority of the people here are law abiding students who care about their community.  And we went to some of those community meetings, and we saw that.  We saw beautiful homes where people took a lot of pride in their homes.  You know, so we put that in the story.  You know, we did a story in Austin [Chicago, Illinois] where a peace baseball group, they--it's an opportunity for gang members to come.  And maybe it's a way out, you know, to show them services and show them ways out.  And, you know, I did a story about a father who watches his kids in the Englewood community, to make sure they're safe.  He watches them when they play baseball or when they play basketball and stresses education and is raising two beautiful boys.  And when some people look at a community--then nothing good would come out of it.  So, you know, those are the kind of stories that--those are, those are my highs, you know, just--so the highs, the great thing is that the highs come often.  You know, the highs come a lot.
Story_ID: 647774
Speaker 1: What's your sense of the Chicago [Illinois] media market today?  I mean you say that, you know, so many people are just covering the violence.  Is--I mean do you see that that's the focus?  Or is there something else, like what you're doing, going on out there?  Or is it just not enough of it?
Speaker 2: Well, it's definitely not enough of it.  You know, I think, you know, I think what we, what we do in the media is we cover the definition of news.  We cover it because it's news.  And it becomes easy to do the violent stories and, because there's so many of them.  So we, we will always be able to pick the most compelling one.  And people watch those stories, so we keep doing those stories.  But I, you know, I think that there is probably--especially in Chicago, you know, there are many of us African American journalists who fight for the positive stories.  You know, so we do get the positive stories on, but unfortunately they still--the memories of them get lost.  Because if you're doing another crime, another shooting, another this every day--every newscast, you know, my story is two minutes long, a minute and a half long.  It's on one newscast.  Well, you know, we've got five newscasts (laughter).  You know, and, so the majority of what's out there is still going to be, you know, the crime story.  And the positive stories that get in every now and then kind of get lost.  But I think the journalists here in Chicago, we still fight for them.  We still get them, get them on.  And I think because we are respected in our newsrooms, it is possible to get them on.  Or you at least will have at least one or two at every station that fights for them.
Story_ID: 647775
Speaker 1: Is there anything (clears throat) we haven't talked about that you would like to express, or--?
Speaker 2: About the only thing is I think, you know, when people, when they see this, when they, you know, listen to this--I think I want people to walk away with the fact that I have, I enjoy what I do.  You know, I think I'm very good at what I do.  I think I make a difference.  I think I try to make a difference, anyway.  But as much as I know I'm here to talk about--and because of being a journalist--my biggest joy, like any mother's biggest joy, is my children and my family.  There were times that, you know, I don't--I'm not a big star.  You know, I'm not a major anchor.  I'm not, you know, I'm not a named reporter because I have three children.  And it was important to me at times to kind of get off the track.  So, or not push for the biggest assignment or the next big promotion, because I wanted to be home at night.  And I wanted to be around as many weekends as I could.  And I didn't want to do the early, early morning shifts, so that I could get my children off to school and, so that I could see the football games and the soccer games and the water polo games and the dance games and all of those things.  And be there to say goodnight and send them off to school in the morning.  And as a journalist you get called, and you're always--sometimes--and you have to, you have to work late sometimes.  But, you know, juggling it all, you know, I didn't do any of it perfect.  And, you know, sometimes you think that I could have been a better journalist, but I had the family.  And I could have been a better mother but, you know, I had the job.  But I am still very happy with my children.  They are incredible, incredible children.  I think I'm very blessed that my father [Ernest Tucker] passed so much along to me that I hope I have instilled in my kids.  You know, my oldest [Trevor Wilkins] graduated from Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] in June.  My middle one [Cody Wilkins] is going into his senior year at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  And my baby [Nya Wilkins] is starting at the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And, you know, and it's, and it's not just about where they're going.  It's the fact that they are going someplace, you know.  And it is--to me it's trying to continue what my dad did for me, and also hope that I've brought enough of what my mother [Emma Hill Tucker] provided for me into, into their lives.  That's one thing.  I think that's personal.  I think professionally, I think it is extremely important that those of us who are in this position continue to reach back to the young and encourage them to get into this business.  If they don't, we won't have people like us who tell our stories from our viewpoint.  Other people who tell our stories--and they may not come with the same kind of background and sensitivities.  So it is important to me that we help the interns coming behind us.  You know, that we embrace them.  Because there were people who helped me, you know.  I mean, I was--there weren't a whole lot.  But, you know, there was one, there was two.  Now there are a lot of us, maybe not enough.  But there are many more of us that are here now than there were when I came along and when those before me came along.  You know, I was like--if the others were trailblazers, I was on the trail.  And they may have been there but it was still tough.  So, you know, it's really, really important to me that we, that we reach back.
Story_ID: 647776
Speaker 1: What else do you want to do, career wise?
Speaker 2: You know, I think I'm at the end of my career.  Yeah, I think I'm at the end.  I am now looking for that next thing.  You know, at the end of my career, you know, maybe I'll sign another contract, you know.  I mean, I'd like to stay as long as I can.  On one end, I say that.  But at the other end, you know, on the other hand rather--I think, I know I'm nearing the end of my career because of my age.  You know, this is a, this is a business for some, for young people.  And I'm very fortunate to have been in it this long.  And I'm not, you know, I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do next.  I know, I know I feel like I'm being called to use my journalistic skills and my parenting skills to help other young African American public school kids, help them with their college applications, so that they can also get into elite schools or get into colleges that perhaps they only dream about and maybe didn't even know about, you know.  So I, you know, I will do that in some form or fashion, whether I get paid for it or not.  Because that's basically the way I looked at television.  I would have done it whether they paid me or not because that was just how much I wanted it.  So, you know, I'm kind of looking at that.  I'm trying to figure out, I'm trying to figure things out.  I mean, it's great to be an empty nester and have the opportunity to be able to figure that out (laughter).
Story_ID: 647777
Speaker 1: What would you want your, say, your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: You know, I think I want my legacy to be that I did (unclear), and I don't know, I probably can't be eloquent with the words because it would take some time.  But I think basically I just, you know, I want people to understand that it was really important to me to tell, to tell our stories.  You know, just to make sure that African Americans were being portrayed in the best light.  You know, every story that I did, I really tried to make sure that even if it was a crime story that we were portrayed in the best light.  You know, understanding that you have to be truthful, but still, you know, if you have an opportunity to make somebody look as good as they can, then to do that.  You know, to try and find something good.  You know, and a lot of, a lot of what I do--it really is, and it always really has been--because I told my [paternal] grandmother [Lillie Belle Ingol Spates] that if I had the opportunity to come back home to Chicago [Illinois], I would, I would use this platform to serve my God.  And I really do try to have a positive impact on people that I meet, and things that I do.  Because I really think this is God's way of helping this person and educating this person and informing this person because they, because they needed it.  And, so, you know, I--but, you know, if there's a, if there is a legacy that somebody thinks of, it's that I really--and I'm not the most religious person in the world.  But I think you have to, I think you serve God by helping His people; and I try and attempt to use journalism in that vein.
