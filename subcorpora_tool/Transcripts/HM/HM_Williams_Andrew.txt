Story_ID: 27540
Speaker 1: Well now I'm going to ask about your family history. I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but, but we'll start with your mother's side first so we don't get them mixed up. Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's name is Yuson Kim Williams. Y-U-S-O-N, K-I-M, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1929 in Chejudo, Korea.
Speaker 1: Okay, you have to spell that for us.
Speaker 2: I believe it's spelled C-H-E-J-U-D-O, South Korea.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family? How, how far back can you trace them and, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: So my mother lived in South Korea during the time that Japan occupied the country, and she was forced to speak Japanese only and she couldn't speak Korean. Her parents died when she was young and she had to live with an aunt. And she had a very trying life. She spoke of at one point the Japanese soldiers lining up the Koreans and walking them down a road. And she didn't know where they were going, but she asked the, one of the guards if she could use the bathroom. And so she went behind a bush and then she just started running and so her history is kind of vague. But I know she did things like work odd jobs and she met my, my dad during the Korean War.
Speaker 1: Now that's quite a story. Now she--the Japanese as I recall re--invaded in the late '30s [1930's], mid, mid-'30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: I'm not that familiar with the history, just only from my mom, but she was, yeah she was born in 1929. So yeah she was a child around that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, right, right, okay. Cause I know they invaded China first and then Korea and now from what I understand again from, from--I can't even tell you specifically what I read or heard, but the, that Koreans were really badly used by the Japanese, more so than the Chinese on some level.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I came across a birth certificate from my aunt. I'd visited Korea in 2000 and the Korean police actually helped me find my aunt. My mom had passed away in 1999. But the birth certificate was hard to read, it was almost a little history. It was Korean, but even Koreans had a hard time reading it, but it's possible that my--her, her father may have been Japanese. And I know she had at least one other sibling who I, who I met.
Speaker 1: This is your, your mother's father?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Yeah I know that Japan had--I know they had--there was a big bloodletting in Manchuria [China] or someplace in the late '30s [1930s], I know that but I, I don't know how long the occupation of the rest of Asia took place. They started working on it at the turn of the century and trying to conquer the rest of Asia.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But I'm not sure how--
Speaker 2: Well my oldest siblings, my half-brother Robert and my, my sister Jeanie and my brother Morgan, they were born in Korea. And Jeanie recalls as a child having a, a Japanese name even though she was in Korea. It was (Shionogi?), and she recalls other kids making fun of her and I think even at one point throwing rocks at her because she was a child of an American soldier, and at that, an African American soldier. But my dad after the war was over, went back and married my mom and brought all the children over, my oldest three siblings.
Story_ID: 27541
Speaker 1: So did your mother [Yuson Kim Williams]--now growing up in war-torn Korea, did she have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: She went to school to the equivalent of third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I recall her being very intelligent, although she spoke broken English. She could speak three languages, Japanese, Korean and English. And she became a, an American citizen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so from what you said earlier, your mom had stories from, you know, childhood about all the things that happened. Okay, are there any other stories you can share, share with us?
Speaker 2: About my mom?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so my mom was a very loving person and she really made sure that the kids, all my siblings and I had enough to eat because she remembered so many times not having food to eat. And so we kind of jokingly would talk about, you know, how she was always trying to feed us, even as we became adults. And she always made it a point to only cook Korean food on special occasions or once in a while because she wanted us to become Americanized and she really didn't want to pass on the language to us. I mean we, we--I learned, I probably learned the most Korean from her because I would ask her. But she didn't want to speak Korean to use cause she, she had a hard time speaking English so she wanted us to make sure we spoke English well. And I think some of her childhood ex--experiences kind of carried over to her adulthood as well as she had--was diagnosed as having schizophrenia. So I, my earliest memory of her having to go to the hospital for her schizophrenia was when I was in first grade. But I know it happened even before that. And she had to go to the state mental institution. And so growing up, there were different times when she would have I guess different episodes. So that was, that was challenging as a child, but at the same time she loved us so much that we, we just had a lot of sympathy and empathy towards her and tried as much as we could to, to help her get through those times.
Story_ID: 27542
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to go to your father's side, then we'll put them together. So can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my dad's name was John Morgan Williams, J-O-H-N, Morgan, M-O-R-G-A-N, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born December 25, 1917 in Ansonia, Connecticut, which is outside of New Haven, Connecticut.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and what can you tell us about your father's side of the family? How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: So his father's name was George Albany Williams, and his mom was Mary Morgan Williams. George Albany Williams was born in 1864 in Culpepper, Virginia. So we believe he was born into a slave family, or as a slave child.
Speaker 1: So this was your father--this is your grandfather.
Speaker 2: This is just my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, so alright, so he goes back to 1864.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and my dad was 1917, and my dad had us children pretty late. I believe he was forty-seven when he had me.
Speaker 1: And your grandfather had your father, let's see '64 [1864] and, you know to 1917, that's quite--he'd have been almost sixty I guess when he fathered your father.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I--so I don't know the full history, but I think my, my grandmother, that might have been his second wife. And I've seen pictures of both of them, my, my grandfather--at least my relatives tell me that he was--and my dad, he was a plumber. And I know--and my mom, she almost looks Italian, but on the birth certificate of my father it says she was a Negro, but--and my dad said he--it was illegal for blacks to marry whites back then, so, so then I, I heard some I guess family legend that somehow Mary Morgan may have been connected to the JP Morgan family somehow. But it's just a family kind of legend or mystery. But she, she, she did look possibly like she was white or at least partially white.
Speaker 1: There are stories, we heard a couple stories in the course of doing these interviews of white people actually passed for black because--you know to get around the illegality of marrying a black person. So I don't know that's a--I don't know, I just raised that. Anybody watching this, you know they're--if they want to investigate it in your family or, or without can, you know, know that that's a possibility.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Where people, you know changed their racial identity for love. It's possible. So that, this some--so your grandfather, I did a calculation here. If I'm correct, your grandfather was fifty-three when he fathered your father. Your father was forty-seven when he fathered you, so that seems incredible to me and you, and you're still a young man. That you go back just two generations you're--we're in slavery.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah and then also I think about if my mom [Yuson Kim Williams] never would have ran behind that bush, she never would have met my dad and just have those different histories connected.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so well I'll ask about that story in a minute, about how the, how your parents met. But--now your father, so he, his father was born in Culpepper County, Virginia and I, I--
Speaker 2: The birth certificate, Culpepper I believe is spelled C-U-L-P-E-P-P-E-R, Virginia.
Story_ID: 27543
Speaker 1: Yeah, so some of our family, some of my relatives went to like the [Washington] D.C. area, and also Pennsylvania, and then Connecticut.
Speaker 2: Okay, so did your grand--now did your grandfather pass down any stories about what it was like down there in--he'd have been born a year before the end of slavery.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The end of the Civil War and--
Speaker 1: So unfortunately my dad [John Morgan Williams] didn't pass down a lot of stories about his dad. It's almost like it was a different time when the parents didn't talk as much to their kids or something, or share that many stories because they--it would have been fascinating to hear, you know my grandfather's story, particularly how he became a, a plumber. And my dad though would talk about living in a, some kind of apartment, or some kind of house that had a lot of immigrant families. So you know from Italian, Italian, Polish, think even Russian, and so it was a, it was a uniquely diverse community. I know it was a low income community. My dad talked about having to go up to the outhouse and they would have a Sears Roebuck catalogue and they would tear it, you know they would look at it and then tear out a, a page for toilet paper. And he talked about how he would go search, you know by the railroad tracks for coal to put into their stove. Then he talked about playing in the, the river, or on the train bridge and jumping off it and there were different chemicals in the river from the factories and you know, so it was a very industrial--sounds like it was a very industrial city. And I remember him talking about you know, working in a factory.
Speaker 2: Okay, and, and, in Ansonia, Connecticut.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now I was curious about the Albany in your grandfather's name. Was that--is there a story behind that?
Speaker 1: That's a good question, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Cause it seems I, I would be surprised if it was a, a after slavery name. Something that he adopted in the, in the family--that situation. You know if he settled in Albany first and had goal of going there, or what--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 27544
Speaker 1: Now did your dad [John Morgan Williams] have a chance to, to get much schooling growing, growing up?
Speaker 2: My dad did graduate from high school. He also talks about you know going to vacation bible school at Macedonia Baptist Church. And he talked pretty fondly of the, the past. Talked about how he had to memorize lines for the Christmas play. And somehow I want to say that my dad would talk about somehow the pastor being related to someone named Norman Cousins. And I remember my dad having a newspaper article about that. He was real proud of that connection.
Speaker 1: I'm not sure--I've heard the name, but I'm not sure who he is, but that's a good, that's good to know.
Speaker 2: And my dad would also talk about, you know like jelly donuts were like a nickel and then sometimes they would steal them and it seemed like he had a lot of pleasant memories growing up. Although he, he did talk about going to the Civilian Conservation Corp started by president [Franklin Delano] Roosevelt and during the, during the [Great] Depression. And he said that they would go out into--essentially like a forest area and they would mark trees, like diseased trees. That was their job. And it would, there would be snow and so they'd walk around in the snow. But he, he talked about fondly being able to drink milk every day for the first time and, you know have regular lunches and you know, with sandwiches. So that was kind of the prelude to him going into the Army.
Speaker 1: Now that, that speaks to tough times. You're glad to be able to drink fresh milk and have a sandwich.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah definitely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so yeah so he was right in the middle of the Depression. Depression hit I guess he would have been, what--
Speaker 2: Twelve maybe.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 27545
Speaker 1: So, so he [John Morgan Williams] joined the Army. This is prior to the War [World War II], right he joins.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so he--I don't know the exact year that he joined the Army, but I know he was in the Korean War, I mean the World War II and the Korean War. And he got out the year I was born, in '64 [1964]. So he didn't go into the Vietnam War.
Speaker 1: So he made a career of the service basically.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well it's almost like half his life I think. Because when he got out of the Army, he became a garbage collector for a while and then he worked in a place called Mobile, first they called it Mobile Tops, and then they called it Mobile Travelers. And he, he was kind of a plumber there, but he assembled I think sinks and toilet systems for recreational vehicles until two years before he was supposed to retire, he was laid off. My, my dad shares some stories of being in the Army. He said he was stationed in the Philippines and the U.S. government had very big depots where they would store, you know food, equipment and, and I believe even gold. And they, they were armed with rifles and had to guard it as well as somehow he was involved in repairing trucks, driving trucks. So he--I know growing up he was a great mechanic. So I, I believe he got those skills in the Army.
Speaker 1: Now there was a, a--is this during World War II?
Speaker 2: Yeah, World War II.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there, yeah black people did a lot of, you know, transporting of materials and stuff in those days.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: The Quartermaster Corp and then the Motor Corp, the Redball Express was a big, you know one of the famous black motor corps that, you know, drive supplies through enemy lines. So he was in, he was, he did, did that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. And so he was stationed--his final place of being stationed was in Fort Riley, Kansas, which is known as the Big Red One, the First Infantry Division. It was--I remember growing up in Junction City [Kansas], which is right next to Fort Riley, we would go visit there. We went to the, the Army hospital there where I was born, Irwin Army Hospital. Go to the commissary. But I remember General Custard's house was there before he went to Little Big Horn. And also in Junction City, they, they also had a calvary. So also in Junction City after I left there and I saw a monument for the Buffalo Soldiers, you know the African American soldiers that were in the, in the Army Calvary. So there was a lot of history there.
Story_ID: 27546
Speaker 1: Now, your father [John Morgan Williams] joined the Army during the most segregated phase of the U.S. Army I guess, or one of the most--just before they integrated. They actually integrated during the Korean War. So did, did he talk about that transition? That was a tough transition from what I understand.
Speaker 2: So my dad, my dad was a very proud African American man and I remember growing up he would tell me stories about you know, great black men and women just to instill in me a lot of--a sense of pride in being African American and some great role models. You know, Paul Robeson was one, George Washington Carver which, you know I probably talk about more with the science connection and my interest in science and engineering. And also about athletes, great athletes that broke you know records and color barriers. You know even when--as he got older, you know just, he just got elated when the first black quarterback that played in the NFL [National Football League]. I don't know if it was James Harris, but I know he was one of the first ones. And
Speaker 1: I think Marlon Briscoe may be the first one, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then I guess I was old enough to understand, you know, a little bit about sports when he started talking about those players, but any time there was a black coach. So later on in my, my life I, you know, got to know Tony Dungy, which I, you know I'll probably talk about more later. But I know that would have made my dad proud that I knew you know, the first black coach to win a Super Bowl. But my--I, I wanted to say that my dad had a great sense of pride, but at the same time, he wasn't a militant fighter against, you know, racism. He--I don't know if he wanted to instill in me there were ways to achieve in spite of racism, but I mean the fact that he got laid off two years before he was supposed to retire, that made me, you know, angry that you know--and I thought maybe he should fight that. But he was the type of person who just accepted it.
Speaker 1: So he didn't get any retirement benefits?
Speaker 2: So he had--he got Social Security and, and then he had a small pension from the Army. When he got out he was a, a Spec Five, Specialist Five. So I guess similar to a sergeant rank. And back then they didn't have that big of a retirement.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah I wondered, I was gone ask you what rank he was when he got out.
Story_ID: 27547
Speaker 1: Well what is the story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: So my--from what I know about how my parents met, my dad [John Morgan Williams] as I said before was in World War--I mean the Korean War and he somehow he met my mom [Yuson Kim Williams]. And he had my, my older sister Jeanie and then my brother Morgan and my mom already had a child. We believe that was Robert. So they, they had different fathers. So I never knew exactly what my mom's occupation was, but I think she did whatever she could for money. And was, whether it was cleaning people's houses or whatever, but I think she met soldiers you know and became boyfriend, you know had different boyfriends. But all I know for sure is she had my oldest brother by one man and then my siblings by my dad. But my dad after the war was over, went there, back to Korea, to marry my mom, which I found out later that not very many soldiers did that. And, and not only did he marry, marry her and then you know adopt the, the children, or his children. But he adopted Robert, my oldest half-brother who I didn't know he was a half-brother till I was in college. But--and he had some kind of sickness. I think it was like pneumonia or something. And he, he really shouldn't have traveled back to America but somehow my dad convinced whoever was examining my, my brother to, to let him go. So I think it's a great--to me it was a great love story. My dad wasn't a very affectionate person. He just was in that generation, but he show, he showed a lot by what he did by getting my mom, my, my brother and sister and the half-siblings and moving them back to, to Connecticut.
Story_ID: 27548
Speaker 1: So your father [John Morgan Williams] was able to survive the Korean War without getting wounded or anything, or having--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, my dad didn't get wounded in the Korean War or World War II. And it was interesting because you know growing up in the [Great] Depression, he didn't have access to a lot of medical care, so he was saying that people would die from you know things like strep throat and cause they didn't have penicillin. And so I think his body built up a lot of antibodies or something because he talked about one time getting malaria I think in World War II. But it was funny because it was when he was probably in his ninties he got pneumonia again but the doctor asked him when was the last time he took medicine and he said like back in World War II when he got malaria; so he was pretty healthy.
Speaker 1: How long did your father live?
Speaker 2: My dad lived to be ninety-one.
Speaker 1: So he--what--he passed in 2007 I guess.
Speaker 2: Let's see, okay. I think it was--
Speaker 1: Or 2008.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was 2000-- 2009, the first part of 2009.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mom [Yuson Kim Williams] was in her sixties, so she was--it was in 1929 to 1999 [sic, 1996].
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. So there was a pretty big difference in their ages. Twenty one years I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so and you were born, it just dawned on me, one hundred years after your grandfather.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's true. And I know growing up my dad was old enough to be a, a lot of my friends' grandfather. So I always thought that was interesting. But yeah, I, I never really thought about I was born one hundred years after my grandfather.
Story_ID: 27549
Speaker 1: So now you were born in Kansas near Fort Riley.
Speaker 2: In Fort Riley.
Speaker 1: In Fort Riley, okay. And, and you grew up in--did you grow up in that area?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--I, I grew up in Junction City, Kansas, which is right next to Fort Riley. So when I was born, we lived in a two bedroom trailer. I think it was called Holiday Trailer Court. And there weren't enough beds for all six of us kids, so my mom [Yuson Kim Williams] slept, my mom said I slept in a cardboard box, which is part of the reason why I titled my book 'Out of the Box, Building Robots, Transforming Lives'. And so my dad [John Morgan Williams] worked as a garbage collector and one thing I remember about my parents, even though we didn't have a lot of money growing up, they always sacrificed for, for our education, and they always put a supreme value on whatever we needed for school.
Story_ID: 27550
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities and their habits and how they walk and talk and look, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: That's a good question. Well I always identified the most with my, my dad [John Morgan Williams] because in our family since we're interracial, I always thought there was kind of a different gradients of skin color and back then I always felt like I had to choose one, you know, identity over the other. You know African American versus Asian. And it wasn't until I got older, till I appreciated both as much. But probably my dad although, I was the youngest, and so I was more outgoing than my dad. My dad, socially probably was more like my mom [Yuson Kim Williams] because she was a lot more outgoing I think. But I always identified more with my dad as far as like looks and things.
Story_ID: 27551
Speaker 1: I know you refer to your siblings, but can you name them in order and place yourself in them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I'm the youngest. My oldest brother is Robert.
Speaker 1: Okay, and he was born in [South] Korea, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Jean, Jeanie was born after Robert, then Morgan, which he was also born in Korea with Jeanie and Robert. And then Mary, George and myself were all born in Fort Riley, Kansas. So it's interesting that Morgan's name is my grandmother's maiden name Morgan, Mary Morgan. And then Mary my sister's named probably after my grandmother as well, Mary. And then George was probably named after my grandfather, George Albany Williams. And then I don't know who I, I was named after. I don't think I was--maybe a former president. But also Andy Williams might have been popular back then, back then. And I know my sister always reminds me that Brent, my middle name has to do with a steep climb and kind of how God's allowed me to achieve a lot but I've had to go through a lot in a short amount of time to achieve what I have, given our family history. And then Andrew means manly and strong and just I think about the, the strength I got from my parents [Yuson Kim Williams and John Morgan Williams] and my family too, you know to endure you know some of the obstacles we had just family-wise with my mom's illness, mental illness as well as coming from low income. But I never thought of it that way growing up cause we all loved each other. We all supported each other. My, my brothers and sisters were my, my role models and mentors and friends and you know even though we fought like any, you know, kid, kids do. And my mom just loved, loved us. She was very affectionate. So she always gave us hugs and told us we, we--she loved us. And my dad was the opposite, you know he, he thought demonstrating love meant making sure he had food on the table and working, going to work even though he was--may have been sick, you know. I don't recall him ever missing you know, work. So he was a real good role model that way.
Story_ID: 27552
Speaker 1: It seems like, you know you really got a, a big, intense concentration of people in a trailer, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is, this is your earliest memory, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You're in this situation where they're like--how, how many? One--six--
Speaker 2: Six kids.
Speaker 1: Kids and two, your two parents.
Speaker 2: Right, in a two bedroom trailer.
Speaker 1: Eight people in a two bedroom trailer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we, we lived--it was right next to the Republican River. Junction City [Kansas] is named after the junction of I believe the Republican River and I want to say the Smokey Hill River and they formed the Kansas River. There's some kind of connection between those rivers, but we would you know, go--we lived right by the river, so we would play in the river, make little boats or whatever, swim, fish. And then I remember we moved when I was still--even before kindergarten, we moved to a house on Fifteenth Street, the east side of Junction City. There was a old--by the time we were in it, it was probably at least a hundred years old, but it was a old house for railroad workers. So we lived close to this wheat field, just at the edge of our block was a wheat field with a, a big grain elevator. And then there was a field that went out to some train tracks, and then there was a junk yard, salvage yards out there that we would go play. We just had great memories of going out into the field, you know, past the wheat field, building little huts or forts out of straw or hay or whatever and sticks and exploring the junk yard, you know finding little things we would take back and little lawnmowers or something we'd try to put together and make go-carts and that's one of the things that I think was an advantage of not having a lot of income. Cause we, we played a lot and we invented things, we would make things, we would imagine things. And you know going to school, I never thought of myself as being poor or low income cause my, you know, my dad [John Morgan Williams] would-mom [Yuson Kim Williams] would find us clothes. You know whether it was the thrift shop or whatever, but I don't think anyone in school knew that we didn't have a lot of money. I mean and I could make friends with anybody, you know regardless of how much they made.
Story_ID: 27553
Speaker 1: I'll say a little bit more just about imagination. I mean I, I remember my brothers and sisters during the summers we would go to the library for almost, almost every day. It was, it was, it was a good walk away, but you know I'd find books and try to learn how to make things or do things or learn about rocks or electronics. I remember reading books about being a detective, Encyclopedia Brown, making my own detective agency one summer modeled after him and--
Speaker 2: Encyclopedia Brown?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was--
Speaker 2: Now is he, is he a character in a series?
Speaker 1: Yeah, a series of children's books and he would solve, you know, mysteries or little crime, crimes. And a lot of times there was science behind it. And so I, I remember setting up my own detective shop or whatever.
Speaker 2: Did you have any cases?
Speaker 1: I tried to. I, I, I tried to get as many you know little things like magnifying glasses or things to dust off, fingerprints. I also remember getting a book that had little things you can make and one of them was a rain detector. And so it was making a little circuit with a battery and wires and then trying out different kinds of pills or like aspirin or Alka Seltzer and put that, that part of it in, in like a clothespin that had a little spring, you know, hinge thing. And the wires, if they made contact after the, the pill dissolved, then the bell would go off and that would tell you there's rain outside, so if you had clothes on the--hanging out to dry, you would know to go, go out and get them and close the, and close the windows, so I used to enjoy doing things like that growing up. And I think which, you know led to my interest later on you know in science and engineering. But--
Speaker 2: That sounds like a, you know, you were a young engineer on some level, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. One thing I do regret about--what I did learn was my dad [John Morgan Williams] was such a great mechanic. And he would--we never had a brand new car. We always--my dad would go and buy old cars and he would fix them up enough to run well. And sometimes he would take the whole engine out and so he would have me come out once in a while and have me you know, push down on the brake pedal or whatever while he was adjusting the brakes. And you know I always wished I would have learned that, that part of engineering, the mechanical side. So I always kind of geared towards more to the electronic, electronics but--so we had a lot of learning opportunities that way.
Story_ID: 27554
Speaker 1: Now this a question we always ask. You've answered it on some level already, but what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: And what, what--go ahead, go ahead, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: No, go ahead.
Speaker 1: I was gonna ask--I didn't ask you what--if there's a name for the neighborhood you lived in when you were growing up, and you moved to, to the house?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was called the East Side [Junction City, Kansas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I went to Washington Elementary, which was two blocks away and it was on East, East Fifteenth Street between Franklin and Monroe Street. So some of the streets were named after presidents. So yeah growing up in a small Kansas town, I think there was around--I want to say seventeen thousand people at that time. It was an unusual Kansas town because it was adjacent to such a big military base. And when I say big, a lot of it was land-wise. They had just a lot of--had a lot of land where they would hold military exercises, you know for the Big Red One, the First Infantry Division. And actually Junction City is an infamous city. There was a movie made about Junction City called "Ninth Street". It starred Isaac Hayes and Martin Sheen.
Speaker 1: It's called Night--
Speaker 2: Ninth Street.
Speaker 1: Night.
Speaker 2: Ninth.
Speaker 1: Ninth, okay, Ninth Street.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we lived on Fifteenth Street. It was Ninth Street. I've never seen it. I started to watch it, but I probably should watch it.
Speaker 1: You, you--
Speaker 2: I believe it came out in 1999. But the person that was behind it had grown up in Junction City and I--he became a filmmaker. Think his name was Kevin Willmott. And so Junction City was notorious for the crime, drugs and prostitution brought by the military base, particularly on military paydays. So there was a lot of money flowing through Junction City through, you know the Army.
Story_ID: 27555
Speaker 1: On one side of me there was a, a German lady who had met her spouse in the military and she had some sons and daughters. And we were good friends with them. And then--but I know some of them had some trials with, you know, having to go to a boys' home. I think one of the daughters had to go to a girls' home. And then across the street was a--
Speaker 2: Did they have an African American father too?
Speaker 1: Yes, they had an African American father too. And I'll tell you something interesting about Junction City that I learned. It was later on, later on I learned from another friend of mine that's black and Japanese, he was doing his Ph.D. research at University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] and had found out that the, the government had compassionate bases or forts that they would send interracial soldiers, families of soldiers that were interracial. That the families met their spouses in Europe and in Asia. So I didn't realize it growing up, but looking back there were lots of black and Asian, black and European families. So it was no big deal that we were black and Korean. But we were in a small Kansas town, which was unusual that we had that kind of diversity. So and then across the street there was a, a kind of a row apartment house which a lot of soldiers would live in if they lived off base. And I--we all thought at different times they were selling drugs across the street. And then on the other side was another single mom, but she was older. And she had a daughter and at least two sons. And I remember one of the sons, he would dress up as a woman and hang out with the prostitutes on military payday. So we weren't--so the East Side wasn't known for--I mean it was known more for maybe the lower income, maybe more of the criminal activity and my only memory of my street is I remember seeing this black lady walking down the middle, it was during the day time. She was walking down the middle of it. I want, I want to say it was on a Sunday. And she was holding a cross up and she was just walking down the middle because there was all kinds of bars and places. I also heard though that there was you know, a lot of musicians would come there. So there was kind of a, you know African American music scene. I mean we--Junction City I think was a couple hours from Kansas city. And you know Kansas City was home to like Count Basie and Charlie Parker, and now there's the, you know a, a Jazz Museum there as well as the Negro League's Baseball Museum. Some interest--other kind of little trivia about being close to Junction City were we were about fifteen minutes from Manhattan, Kansas where K [Kansas] State [University] was. But that's where Tiger Woods' dad went to college. I, I want to say he, it's possible he grew up in Manhattan, Kansas, but I know for sure he went to college there. I think he was the first black player in the big--I think it was the Big Seven. I think baseball. And then it became the Big Eight and then the Big Twelve. But I found that out, you know years later because for a while I think he had a, a golf camp. Cause when my kids were involved in the First Tee in, in Atlanta, they would talk about the special kind of leadership camp for golf that Tiger's dad had in Manhattan, Kansas. So--and then of course Tiger Woods also had the, you know the black and Asian family as well.
Story_ID: 27556
Speaker 1: So Junction City [Kansas] was an interesting place, but you know it was like a tough place, sounds like you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so you were talking about the sights and sounds. I remember they had some theaters, the Call Theater, the Junction Theater and the Colonial Theater. The Colonial Theater was more of the family theater. The Junction Theater was like, was definitely off limits for us kids. And then the Call Theater I remember seeing a lot of the black exploitation movies and karate movies there. And I remember sometimes we'd come home from, you know us kids were, were watching those movies and you know doing our karate moves down the street when all the prostitutes and all the drug dealers were hanging out there. So I mean that was just life for us. We didn't think anything of it. This was, you know, Junction City. But it was a real interesting mixture of cultures with the farming culture, you know, agriculture, the military culture and then kind of like the black subculture and then kind of the criminal activity subculture.
Story_ID: 27557
Speaker 1: Now, now your father was--he was able to retire from the military, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean he had an honorable discharge and I think he was probably making--I would say a little over five hundred dollars a month from his retirement. And then at Mobile Travelers he was making probably about a hundred dollars a week. So we weren't quite in the free lunch category as kids, but we were reduced lunch. But my dad later on when we got older, he said that he thought you know people that were on welfare were getting more than him. But it was just his nature, his culture, his character. He just always was a worker. And you know I think he had the intelligence to go to college, but he never had any guidance or opportunity. Well he probably had a opportunity but just not the guidance and the, the mentoring and the--but it turns out all six of us kids ended up going to college and graduating. And two of us have Ph.D.s in electrical engineering. Robert has his Ph.D. in electrical engineering. He went, he enlisted in, into the Air Force and they sent him back to college to get his engineering degree, so he went back to K [Kansas] State [University, Manhattan, Kansas]. He was stationed in Wichita, Kansas and he was a Nuclear Warhead Specialist in the Air Force. But they sent him back and he got his electrical engineering degree and went to Officer Training School. And so really my brother Robert was the one that let me know what engineering was about initially, cause otherwise I wouldn't know what electrical engineering was, but I would see some of his circuits. Even growing up when he was in high school, I remember him teaching me some of his algebra and I was like, wow, I was fascinated by the math. Jeanie ended up getting her degree I believe it was in art education and Spanish at K State as well, Kansas State. And she's now working on her Master's. My brother Morgan went to University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas], which is about 90 miles from Junction City. And he majored in aerospace engineering. He worked a couple of years, then he went to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] in Cambridge, Massachusetts and got two Master's degrees. I think it was aeronautics and astronautics, and then one in math. And then my, my sister Mary got her degree in English from K State and then she got her Master's not too long ago in marriage and family therapy. And my brother George majored in computer science at K State and got, ended up getting his Master's in marriage and family therapy. He was, he was an executive, executive director for the Urban Fathering Project. He worked with the National Center for Fathers. And he's working on his Ph.D. now. He's just having to write his dissertation. And he works with the state of Kansas, I think it's related to the fathering or family projects. So--
Speaker 1: So they're all ahead of you, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you got lots of role models in terms of going to school and achieving I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so even growing up, I had the benefit from you know their advice, their being role models, but also you know my teachers would, you know, "hey, your sister Jeanie, she was a great student," you know and they had, you know expectations that I would do well, which some of my other friends was like hey, "your brother was a great, you know, basketball player." But it had nothing to do with the education. And so I thought that was a, a blessing from having them as my role models and supporters back then.
Story_ID: 27558
Speaker 1: Now, now where did you start school? What was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: It was Washington Elementary [Junction City, Kansas]. And one of the, the stories I like to tell about my dad [John Morgan Williams] and my mom's commitment to my, our education was you know I knew if I asked my dad to go to--it wasn't, it was the Walmart of the time, it was called Gibson's, to buy a toy or something. He would reluctantly sometimes give my brother and I George, some money to go get toys. But if I needed something for school, he always you know, would open up his wallet and get, get it for me. And so like in--sometimes when I--like I would need maybe eight crayons, you know the box with eight crayons or sixteen, I would say, I would tell my dad I needed the sixty-four color, sixty-four color box with the crayon sharpener on the side. And so he would buy it for me because he thought I needed it for school, but I probably could, could have gotten by with something less, but that was--and I remember my brother Morgan, the one that became an aerospace--basically he's a rocket scientist now cause he's worked on the space shuttle engines and computational fluid dynamics. But he might as well have his Ph.D. cause he's written lots of publications and papers, technical papers. But my brother Morgan would want to get these SS rocket kits and they were kind of expensive, but my dad, you know for--on special occasions would get those kinds of things. And of course we, we were, we got the byproduct of being able to watch him or play with him or help him make them. And then also I remember my dad getting my brother Morgan a chemistry set and my dad ended up towing that trailer to the house that we were living in. And we set up the, the boys set up like a boy's club on one side, and the girls set up a girl's club and I remember him using the chemistry set to make some kind of--we called it green gas. And it was probably dangerous but he made a green gas bomb and put it in the girl's section and made them run out the, the trailer. But you know my, my parents always kind of did things to support us. Getting things to, to learn about science or engineering.
Story_ID: 27559
Speaker 1: We were talking about the region during the break and you were just saying that one interesting feature in our capsule I guess would be the fact that Wilt Chamberlain--well you can go on and tell us that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, so Kansas--so I went to the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] undergrad and my Ph.D.--they were called the Jay Hawks. But the Jay Hawks or the Jay Hawkers were the ones that would go raid Missouri towns to try to make sure that Kansas stayed a free state cause Missouri would come and raid Kansas towns and like Lawrence and try to make it a slave state. But it was interesting cause Wilt Chamberlain played at University of Kansas but he wasn't allowed to stay on campus. He had to stay off, off campus back in, was it the '50s [1950s], so we weren't a slave state but yet, yet we had racism. Interesting thing that I experienced in Junction City was I talk about how, I talked about how we would go to the library a lot, the George Smith Public Library. And you know as a kid, I'd go there with my brothers and sisters and check out books and get all excited and stimulate my mind as well as my body and I'd have to use the bathroom. And when we asked if there was a bathroom, they said no, there wasn't a public bathroom. And so I remember one occasion that happened, I really had to use the bathroom really bad and they wouldn't--they didn't have a bathroom, couldn't use it there. Can't remember if we went, stopped at the Woolworth's and we couldn't use that one either, I can't remember for sure. But we ended up having to go home which was several blocks away. I remember making it to the end of the block and my brother George saying, "Run Andrew, run." Cause I really had to go and then I got to the steps and opened the door and it was too late. But my--I found out though, this was well after college, that they did have a bathroom, but since we were black we weren't allowed to use it. And so I had no idea that was the reason why you know, we couldn't use it, but--.
Story_ID: 27560
Speaker 1: And I, I did want to say also about growing up that helped make the difference beside, besides my parents was you know I told you about how there was a lot of crime and drugs around our family. My dad [John Morgan Williams] had grown up, you know going to a, a Baptist church but really didn't go to church when we were kids that, that much. And then my mom [Yuson Kim Williams] was from a Buddhist background. But there was a small church two blocks away, it was called the Free Methodist Church. And it was mostly, it seemed like it was a lot of the families were connected but it--I don't know if there was more than thirty people that went there, maybe cause it was a Army town, but it was small. But--
Speaker 2: It's called the Free--
Speaker 1: The Free Methodist Church.
Speaker 2: Free Methodist, okay.
Speaker 1: The Free Methodists were Methodists that broke off form the Methodist because they were for free, you know for freedom of slaves and then--
Speaker 2: This is a--you know that represents a third break. Cause the Methodist church was anti-slavery in England.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When they came over here, the Methodists in the south broke off and formed the Southern Methodist Church to keep slavery. So they probably are a breakaway from the southern Methodist.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah to be free. And also they, I think they used--another reason why they were free was because I think somehow people used to pay for seats, certain seats and pews. And so they wanted to keep that free as well. But they were kind of out of the tradition of John Wesley, kind of the Holiness Church and the Nazarenes and the Free Methodists. But they had this family, her name was Meryl Folley, the grand, the grandmother, or she was, yeah she was the grandmother. She was white and her husband had owned a lot of farmland outside of Junction City [Kansas] and then the government wanted to build a, a reservoir, a lake called Milford Lake and so somehow I think she made a lot of--relatively a lot amount of money back then because the government bought her land. And she had a son, Warren, I believe it was her son, Warren Martin--was interesting because he ran for governor on the Prohibition Party. And then one of his daughters, Sharon Sloggin, she was my first Sunday School teacher. But my dad was real reluctant. So I talk about this in my book a little, that my, my oldest brother found this gospel track on a park bench and he, you know, prayed to receive Christ you know as a child. I think he was a teenager. And he thought he should look for a church. And so he was looking for a Salvation Army church and he came across--he was looking for a church and Warren Martin saw him outside the Free Methodist Church and said, "What you looking for?" And he said, "A church." And he said, "Come on in."
Story_ID: 27561
Speaker 1: And so--but my dad was reluctant to let us kids go to church. And so Meryl Folley, she came to our house one day and I, I--maybe even before that. I remember the church bringing us--it may have been before or after. But I remember the church bringing us some food in these, you know, paper bags, grocery bags, and some Christmas presents. And so there were, you know Christmases that were kind of lean and I think the only thing that I got that year was from this church, and it was a little blue shirt with a red lantern on it. And I remember coming from that church. But anyway she came to our house and you know, my--she put my--her hand on my dad's hand and said you know, "John, if you let us, you know, have your kids come to our church, you know I'll take care of them." And so their kids had been to college, so my older siblings learned about college through them. You know I think one had been a school teacher, and they would pay for and send us kids to you know, summer camps, you know Christian camps, missions, conferences. So--and they would get us involved in, you know the activities of the church even though it was small, you know memorizing Bible verses for contests, for vacation Bible school. So you know that, those people I think along with my parents, really made a difference growing up in the environment that we did. We had some role models. And then also I don't think I even really understood racism because these were white families that, you know almost loved us like their children. So it wasn't, it wasn't until I got older that I really kind of know about racism I think. Although I did see racism probably in academic performance. Cause I, somehow I was convinced that I was gonna let, I wasn't--I was just as smart as anyone else. And I wanted to always show that and I wanted to do my best to do that, prove that as well as you know make my parents proud. My, my dad--my mom, you know she, she thought I was always making As, which I always was until I think ninth grade. And my, my dad you know he--I remember when I got a D trying to take differential equations my freshman year in college, which usually people take their sophomore year. And so you know I was real sad about it and my, and my dad said he would have just been happy to get a D cause he never even got to go to college. So he kind of put things in perspective for me. But, but that church--
Speaker 2: Was pivotal in--
Speaker 1: Yeah it was pivotal. And my dad actually when I got older, he said you know a lot of kids these days don't have that moral foundation and that was one of the reasons why he wanted you know, let us go to church and wanted us to go to church. And you know these, these people really cared for us, they prayed for us. And that's where, you know I found my faith and you know, which I, you know I want an authentic faith. I don't want the kind that you know just talks about being Christian but doesn't really follow what, you know Jesus' teachings. But that's where I first, you know, received you know Jesus as my savior and lord. And it made a difference. I didn't always walk the path, but always had that foundation which I agree with my dad that I think in a lot of cases that's, that, that moral foundation is missing with a lot of kids.
Story_ID: 27562
Speaker 1: Now did your dad [John Morgan Williams] ever attend [the Free Methodist Church] with, with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, he, he attended on occasions and as he got older, I think he did so more, more so. And my mom [Yuson Kim Williams], she attended a lot more, but it was interesting because sometimes she I think she would talk about her mom kind of doing some fortune telling. And then you know with the schizophrenia, sometimes my mom would hear voices. And then you know the mixture of the Buddhism and the Christianity and I think you know towards the end of her life, she got things kind of--an understanding but it still was, it was still a challenge for her. Because sometimes there was the language barrier. But--
Speaker 1: I would guess a cultural you know, challenge too, coming from--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: [South] Korea to the United States.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in fact--
Speaker 1: And plunged into this.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in fact it was interesting because my dad when he got back from Korea, he went to visit his family in the northeast Connecticut and Pennsylvania. My oldest siblings remember that. But I think there was something that happened where my dad never went back. And I, I have--I think that some of it has to do with--could have been the interracial aspect because you know interracial marriages weren't really accepted back then. But he never went back even 'til--we always tried to get him to go back you know even when he got older. But he nev--he never went back and we suspect there was something that had to do with you know marrying someone from another culture. But I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you not--as a kid you never went back to--did, did, did you ever go to Connecticut with your father?
Speaker 2: No I didn't. But my, my older sisters, they ended up going back, and then as I got older I would go back and visit and met my relatives.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At least my cousins.
Story_ID: 27563
Speaker 1: Well, back at Washington Elementary School [Junction City, Kansas], were there any particular teachers or mentors there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I think all of the teachers were, were great I thought.
Speaker 1: So you would have started school about 1969, is that about right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's probably about right. My kindergarten teacher was Mrs. Zombado (ph.). Then Mrs. Sanders for first grade. Mrs. Sloan for third grade, no, no for second grade, and then Mrs. Turner for third grade. Mrs. Rhett (ph.) for fourth grade, fifth grade Mr. Waterhall. Sixth grade, Mrs. Rosa. And a few years ago I was honored by I guess the Junction City School District and Mr. Waterhall, Mrs. Rosa were, were there and they talked about me and they were, they were great teachers.
Speaker 1: So was the school integrated in school? I mean in terms of--what was the ratio of black students to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah it was probably, it was very integrated. I look at, you know sometimes I see on Facebook some of my friends' old photos. Maybe they were in different grades, you know, graduated with my siblings. It was very integrated, almost, I almost--some occasions it almost seemed like 50 percent, you know of color. But again there was the--some of the racial mixture. But yeah it was, it was integrated cause it was--of all the schools in Junction City, it was the closest to Fort, the border between Junction City and Fort Riley.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So a lot of soldiers' kids were there.
Speaker 1: And were your teachers--did you have black teachers there at school?
Speaker 2: That's a good question. Mrs. Baldwin was a black teacher there, but she was the only one, she was the fifth grade teacher. She wasn't mine, I think my sister had her. But yeah, there weren't, there weren't too many black teachers.
Story_ID: 27564
Speaker 1: Did you have a chance to do a science project in grade school?
Speaker 2: That's a good question. I, I remember more the science projects I did at home, like the one I described before.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: More so than the ones at school, but I have to think about that cause I haven't thought about that for a while.
Speaker 1: That, that's the one with your brother's chemistry set?
Speaker 2: Well the one where I tried to make the, the rain detector.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then also I was trying to design a rocket. I didn't talk about that one, but I was trying to design a rocket from toilet paper tubes and balloon and gunpowder from firecrackers. And--
Speaker 1: And was that successful?
Speaker 2: No, I never, I never implemented that one. But yeah my brother George used to like train sets. So whenever he could save up enough money to get a train set, he would get train set, but then I remember him taking the gunpowder from firecrackers and using the train set transformer to make sparks and try to light that. I remember one time he kind of got blind and had to go to the hospital. But, I mean he was fine, but we sometimes did risky you know, scientific experiments.
Story_ID: 27565
Speaker 1: Now when you were in middle school, I guess around 1977 or so, you'd have been in the year that Star Wars came out. I hear that you had an experience with the computer. I mean your first--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah so when I was in junior high, so junior, junior high was from seventh to ninth grade and then high school was--
Speaker 1: So what, what, what was the name of your junior high school?
Speaker 2: It was called Junction City Junior High [Junction City, Kansas].
Speaker 1: Jack, Junc--, okay.
Speaker 2: Junction City Junior High, and then the, the high school was called Junction City Senior High.
Speaker 1: So did you see Star Wars?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember seeing Star Wars. My, my biggest, my biggest memory though of like computers was when I was in junior high visiting my brother Morgan. He was at the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] studying aerospace engineering. And he worked, he had a research assistant job as an undergrad, now I--that's kind of unusual. And so it was a separate research building on the west side of campus. And they had this computer that was a line printer computer. And so there wasn't a monitor, it was just print what was on the screen just line-by-line on paper. And this was the first time I had seen a computer and on the, on the computer was a, a Star Trek game. And so you would have your, your spaceship and then there were Klingons would have spaceships in different quadrants and sectors of the, the galaxy. And you had to type in different commands to move to a different quadrant or sector. You had to find fuel. And it would just print out you know, how many photon torpedoes you would have left, whether or not you hit the Klingon ship. And I was just super fascinated by, by that computer. And on top of that was the time, that was the time when video games were coming out like Asteroids, you know in the arcades. And so when my brother George and I went to go visit Morgan while he was a college student, Morgan would get a roll of quarters and we'd go to the arcade and it was the first time I played Asteroids. And you know of course Pac-Man and things like that, but Asteroids was our favorite cause it was spaceships and shooting you know, asteroids and other spaceships. And we would play there for hours. And so as far as engineering, computer-wise, that, that had the biggest impact on me cause I wanted to see how computers worked and I wanted to see how to make you know, video games.
Story_ID: 27566
Speaker 1: My favorite sport growing up was basketball. And I remember when I was you know in high school, my senior, no let's see I think my sophomore year I was around five [feet] five [inches], and then around my junior year I shot up to, close to six foot. And, and I wasn't a starter but you know I was like the sixth man off the bench and used to like to shoot and I remember we were playing our arch rivals, Man, Manhattan High School [Manhattan, Kansas]. And we were losing in the third quarter and the coach told me to get in. And he told me to shoot cause he had seen me in the summer league, you know my friends would call me a gunner. And so I, I just got really hot and I think I scored thirteen points between the end of the third quarter and the last quarter and we won. And, but you know it was interesting because my, my dad told me--I think this was kind of the advantage of having an older father. But he said you know Andrew, there's such a small percentage that make the NBA [National Basketball Association], and there's some people that are just naturally taller than you, they play more than you, you know, faster, stronger. And he convinced me that if I was gonna be successful, it was going to be using my, my mind and my academics. And it was wise advice. Although when I got to the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas], I remember being in a one-on-one tournament and the guy that I beat in the championship for our dorm one-on-one tournament, he walked on to Kansas's junior varsity team, back then they had a junior varsity team. And I always wondered what would have happened if I would have tried out and actually I regretted not trying out, especially after he made it. And that was one of the things that when later on when I had the choice of getting my Ph.D., I decided well I'm not gonna be afraid, you know and then regret it. I'm gonna go for it.
Speaker 2: And just by the way I mean Ka--Kansas is big time college basketball.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: This is--the University of Kansas has one of the top teams every year.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So I mean it's not like just any college.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah and it was--they have a great basketball heritage, you know, Wilt Chamberlain played there, Jo Jo White. The, the person that invented basketball, Nate Smith, was the first coach at Kansas.

Speaker 1: I want to say also about computers was after seeing the computers that my brother used, also his girlfriend, Marian, worked in the, I guess it was called the Computer Building [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas], I can't remember what it was called. But it had the big mainframe for the campus, and that was the place where you--computer programs were written on punch cards at that mainframe. And people would turn in their punch cards and then they'd run them overnight. And then in little boxes, you know the printout, the results would come on these sheets of paper. But she worked there, so I was, I was fascinated by computers and video games so much so that I started looking to see how I could get my own computer when I was in high school. And my dad, he got laid off, so he got on Social Security. So I think part of my junior year and my senior year I, I got a Social Security check as a dependent of his. So this was enough to buy a computer. So I researched computers, cause there was a magazine called Byte Magazine. And I decided the best one with the, the one with the best graphics and best video games at the time was called Atari. There was Atari 400 and Atari 800, and my first computer that I bought was an Atari 400 and Atari 400 had a flat keyboard, just a membrane, plastic. But I had, had, added onto that a keyboard and one of the reasons why I bought the Atari is they, they had a game called Star Raiders, which was the closest thing to the Star Trek game, but this had really great graphics. So it was like the, the Star Trek game, but with great video graphics, and it would come on a cartridge, a ROM [Read Only Memory] cartridge and you would put it in there.
Speaker 2: What year is this? This is, this is--
Speaker 1: That was probably '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: 1982?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And you're what, you're in--
Speaker 1: Eleventh grade.
Speaker 2: Eleventh grade.
Speaker 1: Yeah. It was either eleventh grade or my senior year. So and then I, you know, you had the ability to write simple basic programs. And also around that time, it was either my tenth or eleventh grade year, I was put into the gifted program and I think they were just starting to have a gifted program in high school.
Speaker 2: This is at--
Speaker 1: Junction City Senior High School [Junction City, Kansas].
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And all I remember is there was three of us in that class I think. And one was Hispanic and I think the other was a girl. And I remember we had a TRS80 computer. That must have been, thinking that must have been my sophomore year. They had a, a Radio Shack or Tandy TRS80, which some people have called the Trash-80. And we did some computer programs with that and some basic programs. And then our school got some Apple 2es with a little monitors that, you know I guess had the green lettering. And I remember not only doing word processing, but the teacher teaching us how to program. And that must have been around my senior year.
Speaker 2: Now was this a little self-contained Apple?
Speaker 1: No, so that came out later, in '84 [1984], the little self-contained.
Speaker 2: The Apple was.
Speaker 1: The one that was like the little box, the Macintosh. But before that it was just like the keyboard, you know it had the, the main motherboard on it, and then a separate monitor.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But they were nice looking computers. But I remember Junction City getting those.
Story_ID: 27568
Speaker 1: And going back to the basketball versus you know, engineering. You know I had done great in some of those games, we went to state you know in Kansas, Class 6A, but we didn't, we didn't win but we made it. And--but I remember an article being written about me and it was how, the title was "How Does JCHS, Junction City High School, Spell Relief?" And instead of, it was a playoff of that commercial how does, how do you spell relief, R-O-L-A-I-D-S, Rolaids. They said how does JCS spell relief? You know A-N-D-R-E-W, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S. And so they talked about, you know, how I would come off the bench and--but then it also, it also quoted me talking about I was--wanted to study engineering, electrical engineering because my dad told me that you know I could be successful using, you know my mind and academics. And I actually initially wanted to combine electrical engineering with medicine cause I wanted to be a doctor. And they had a, a track that you could study electrical engineering but take the chemistry and things. But then I took chemistry and realized--I didn't do too well. The class was--I would say there was at least maybe six hundred people in the class. And we were in Hoch Auditorium, and Hoch Auditorium was where they used to play basketball. This is at University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was gone say.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was at University of Kansas. I'm sorry, I jumped up there.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But I didn't do too well in chemistry. But just went the electrical computer engineering route.
Story_ID: 27569
Speaker 1: Okay, so Junction City High School [Junction City, Kansas]. Now in your senior year, you're in the Gifted Program, right? You're, you're a sixth man on the basketball team going to the tournament. So you know, things are pretty good it seems like in, in high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah and I, you know I write a little bit more of the personal things I went through in high school. Actually in junior high some of my, you know I went from you know going to church a lot to you know, giving in to peer pressure with marijuana, and mostly marijuana. But probably, you know, five times I smoked marijuana as a junior high student. But then my excuse was I wanted to be the complete athlete, so I didn't want to do drugs. So that was like in high school I quit, you know, didn't do that. But by the time I had taken the PSAT [Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test] test, I was getting a lot of letters from like Ivy League schools, you know Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you know Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island], Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], thinking them possibly from Stanford [University, Stanford, California]. And I was showing these letters to my dad and he was saying well why don't you just go to [University of] Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] and do like your brother did, you can do well there and then you can go to MIT or whatever. I kind of wished though he would have said yeah, this is great, you should try to go, you know you should apply. I think I half-heartedly started the application process to Harvard and you know I interviewed with a alum who was a prominent attorney in Junction City. But, but I didn't. I mean in hindsight it worked out great. But I don't think my dad had the, the understanding of how those networks would have kind of really changed a lot of things. But--
Speaker 1: Did, did you have a, yourself have a sense of the importance of Harvard versus University of Kansas maybe in terms of--
Speaker 2: Not like I do now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and in fact I didn't even know about, really about HBCU's, Historically Black Colleges and Universities cause Kansas didn't have any. And I vaguely heard of Morehouse [University, Atlanta, Georgia] because of Martin Luther King, Jr. I know Missouri had an HBCU.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lincoln [University of Missouri, Jefferson City, Missouri], right.
Speaker 2: Yeah so that would, that would have been another you know option. But it worked out. I mean I have no regrets going where I did, learning what I did, experiencing what I did and yet at the same time I think young people today, if they get that opportunity, they should pursue those schools just because we need more role models to teach at those schools and I think those opportunities are available. I don't think money--I think maybe in my dad's mind money was the issue. But I think we could have qualified for all kinds of you know, aid going to a place, you know, like that back then.
Story_ID: 27570
Speaker 1: So you look back on high school, were your major mentors your brothers and sisters or the church people, or, or teachers in school do you think?
Speaker 2: In high school, yeah in high school I didn't really go to church. It wasn't until I got to college that I came back to my faith and I would say still from afar my, my brothers and sisters. Just seeing them starting to achieve you know going to college. I mean I still had good teachers, but probably what was missing was someone that you know like a school counselor saying okay you're getting these letters from these great schools, here's how you should apply and this is what you should do. Cause my dad didn't know how to do it.
Speaker 1: So your counseling wasn't very good.
Speaker 2: No, I just knew who she was. She, she--and we in fact we had some students go to--one student I think went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], one went to West Point [United States Military Academy at West Point, West Point, New York].
Speaker 1: But it seems to me, I mean from the standpoint as an adult as old as I am today, or even as old as you, looking back on what the job of a counselor is, doesn't it seem appalling that if you have a student who's gifted and being recruited by Harvard, that you don't give them any advice?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it's--yeah.
Speaker 1: It seems like a person like that should be driven from the profession you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know I have kids now. And I face teachers, counselors even you know a black counselor who didn't want one of my kids to take the highest level of math that they could. And let him waive into the class. We finally, you know, got him to do that. And here I am with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and I've taken almost all the math, the highest level of math and physics that you could take, to tutor him and, and she was a black counselor. And she was like no, it's going to be too much. So I, I almost cringe when I think of you know, a single parent who wants their child to achieve and take the highest level of math in high school or junior high, and then having someone advise them not to. And but then if they don't have the educational background that I, I have to, to really kind of fight it. And so even with my educational background, having to fight it. And that's one reason why I try to instill my, in my students you know, high expectations that they can. Even though it's, you know, difficult and you know I have a whole I guess track record of trying to do that because of my personal experience and still with, you know, children in school having to face that.
Story_ID: 27571
Speaker 1: Now, now what was the highest level of math that you could take at Junction City Senior High [Junction City, Kansas]?
Speaker 2: You could take calculus. I took calculus and really enjoyed it. The teacher's name was Mrs. Kimmy (ph.). And yeah I started, I remember taking Algebra II Trig with a, a teacher who used to brag about how hard he made it. And I don't think I did, I didn't do too well in that class, but looking back I see that a lot of times difficult subjects are made difficult by the way they're presented. And I mean I had a geometry teacher in tenth grade, Mr. Harris, people used to kind of, kind of made fun of him cause he--the way he walked and talked and he wore a bow tie. But he was a great teacher. And I remember breezing through that class because he was such a good teacher. And, and my like my calc, my calculus teacher, she was excellent as well. So of course though, I don't recall very many African Americans. Not of course, I shouldn't say of course, but I didn't see that many African Americans in the class with me, in a lot of my classes. And I talk to kids nowadays and it bothers me that if they're perceived as being too smart, sometimes they're ostracized from like the cool crowd and they try to not dumb themselves down, but make it seem like they're not as smart. Which I'm talking about kids of color, which fortunately in, in high school I was able to navigate that cause you know I played basketball and I felt like I could make friends with any, you know, group. Particularly, you know I was interracial.
Story_ID: 27572
Speaker 1: Did you enjoy popular music? I mean did you have like a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah I would go to, you know, parties and dances and I remember my dad, I think my brother at the time he was working and he kind of gave my dad some old cars. Or, they were, they were kind of--I think it was like a Datsun and a Ford Pinto, or whatever. But my dad would let me drive to school and my brother put a eight track cassette in there and I remember, you know, having like the Gap Band. And--but yeah there was, those were actually--and, and also the, the Army base had converted a gym into a skating rink. So I did a lot of roller skating, you know early '80s [1980's] with a lot of the you know, groups like Chic and what are those--
Speaker 1: Disco groups.
Speaker 2: Yeah, kind of disco roller skating.
Speaker 1: Disco going on.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. So that was, that was a, that was actually a fun outlet. And then finally Junction City [Kansas] got a roller skating rink.
Story_ID: 27573
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you graduated from Junction City Senior High School [Junction City, Kansas], what was--were you the top student?
Speaker 2: I wasn't the top because when I, I, you know I went through my rebellious years starting in late junior high, and you know high school. And so my grades weren't as stellar. I mean literally I don't think I got less than a "A" ever until I got to ninth grade and maybe got a "B" in math. And then--but I was, I think I was the senior class treasurer. I wasn't the, the top student. And again I think somewhere I was missing the experience of a parent that had gone to college. You know who would have said, "You know your GPA [grade point average] is, you know, really important, your ACT [American College Testing]." You know, I think I did well on the ACT and things. In fact I think I did really good on standardized tests, probably not so much the SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] 'cause I didn't even know you could study for the ACT or you could study for the SAT, or you could take courses.
Speaker 1: This raises, kind of raises the question that I notice with other people we've interviewed that it hasn't--brothers and sisters that have gone to college, it's not the same thing as having a parent that's gone.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It seems like the translation isn't--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I don't--yeah I think it's maybe cause we're still kind of close to being peers. And a parent that's gone, they, they know the process. And I would say just adults in general if you may even have gone to college, but if--one of the things I, I learned when I ended up working at GE [General Electric] Medical Systems here in Wisconsin, Waukesha, was there are tiers of, you know, universities. And companies, some companies, elite companies will mainly hire from these elite schools. And I didn't realize that until, you know I had gone to college, started working my master's. I don't think a lot of people even today realize that. But on the other side, I remember hearing Spike Lee say one time in a speech he was making at [University of] Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas], that talent can come from anywhere. So a person could go to any college and university and with the right mentoring and the right situation, they can excel and compete with anybody. So you know someone can go to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] and compete with someone from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you know. And end up going to Harvard or whatever, or teaching you know, at an institution like that. So, so on one hand I think there needs to be the mentoring, the stress, stressing of you know, achieving and going to the highest level that you can and the highest ranked institution you can. But on the other hand there has to be the right fit for that person, you know and the right institution.
Story_ID: 27574
Speaker 1: So University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas], this is in 1980--
Speaker 2: '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: '83 [1983], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I was a Kansas Merit Scholar and, and then also the University of Kansas endowment which I only recently realized that Kan--University of Kansas has a billion dollar endowment, which they, I think they've done well with some people that had gotten in the oil industry through the chemical engineering there. But the Kansas endowment had a scholarship program where they invited African American students from--the top African American students from their high schools, from Kansas and to visit for a weekend. And I just fell in love with the campus. If, if you ever get a chance to visit University of Kansas it has one--the most beautiful campuses in the country I think, especially the time of the year. It's built on a, built primarily on a hill. Trying to remember the name of the person that arranged for that. But then I, that was great because I met other African American students that were achieving in their schools and I write about it in my book, meeting a girl named Karen who was the Miss Teen of Kansas, she was African American and she became my first college girlfriend.
Story_ID: 27575
Speaker 1: University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas], partially through students, Gene Kendall who became a Rear Admiral, African American student, Bill [William] Hogan who was on faculty at University of Kansas, he's African American in electrical engineering, he's a professor and a role model for me. They started a, a program called SCORMEBE, which stood for--it's spelled S-C-O-R-M-E-B-E, it stood for Student Counsel for Recruiting, Motivating, Educating Black Engineers. And it was a predecessor to an organization like NSBE, National Society of Black Engineers. I think it started even before NSBE. But it was started by those black students and the faculty and I think, I want to say the dean of engineering at the time, in order to recruit and get black students to major in engineering. And I think at that time there was a lot of things going on with Affirmative Action and so they had a summer program. And so I found out about the summer program for engineering, early entry program for engineering, through SCORMEBE and took three classes, one engineering class, a math class and an English class during the summer right after my high school year. Stayed in JRP Hall, Joseph R. Pearson Hall, with African American students from Kansas City [Kansas] and St. Louis [Missouri] primarily. And some were rising seniors in high school from Kansas City through the Inroads Program. And that was, that was a great experience because I got the experience of an academic setting, but also the peer group support and mentoring by the people running that program. And I remember a friend of mine in high school, we were trying--he went to that program too and he decided to go to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] instead and major in electrical engineering. And to my knowledge, he's African American, and to my knowledge, he never finished cause I never heard from him after my sophomore year, but I was able to finish. I finished in five years but that support group made a big difference and Florence Boldridge was the director by the time I started my freshman year. And I think she's still the director. She became--like a couple of years ago she was awarded the National Minority Engineering Program Director for--by the National Society of Black Engineers. So I owe a lot to her--
Speaker 2: What is her name again?
Speaker 1: Florence Boldridge.
Speaker 2: Okay, Florence, and how do you spell her last name?
Speaker 1: B-O-L-D-R-I-D-G-E.
Speaker 2: Okay. So she was with SCORMEBE, okay.
Speaker 1: And then it became I think Minority Engineering Program, and then Diversity Program or something like that. But that period, I would say, I'm guessing late, I guess in the '70s [1970's], '80s [1980's], I can't remember how large that organization became, how many students. But I think when I was there, there was at least thirty. And University of Kansas, the population I think at that time of black students in, was maybe eight hundred out of like twenty-five thousand. I don't know what the population of University of Kansas is now, but it, it made it seem--without that organization it would have been very difficult to go through, through engineering. And looking back, I think the way electrical engineering was taught, may have not been the easiest way to absorb it.
Story_ID: 27576
Speaker 1: It took you five years [to graduate from the University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas]. Was there any--what were the obstacles in your way I guess that, that, that prolonged it? Cause you, you'd have ordinarily gotten out in four years, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who was a gifted student you would think that you would be.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, so I, I think like some students who haven't, who didn't have parents that went to college, or maybe a really good mentor, could recognize that your high school wasn't challenging you enough and you weren't really learning the study skills that you need in college. Although that summer early entry program I did well. But then the onslaught of social activities and you know, the friends I made during the summer, whatever, with all the, the activities of social activities that occur. It was hard, it was harder to, to be as focused and to really know. I mean now I can make a list of ten things that a student should do, and I'll probably put it on my, my blog, andrewbwilliams.com, that they can get a 4.0 in college. I wish someone would have told me those things you know. Some of them are basic. You know just go to every class, take notes, go see your instructor regularly with questions, you know. Start reviewing for tests, you know, at least a week before class. But some of the, some of the other things that I didn't realize until I became a, you know, professor, an educator is that students have different learning styles. You know they may be more auditory, just to hear it and they, they learn it the best that way. And that's kind of how classroom lectures are kind of set up. But someone that's more of a visual learner like myself, if there's--if I don't realize that, then I can't use that in the way I study. If a faculty member doesn't realize that, they won't cater to all the learning styles. Someone could be more hands on and tactile learning. And that's one reason when I was a faculty member at University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa], I got into robotics as a teaching tool because it's more hands on. So also another reason why it took me five years was I think our minority engineering program director kind of encouraged us to take fewer hours so we could concentrate on the classes. Which I don't know if it's always the best advice. But it ended up working out okay.
Story_ID: 27577
Speaker 1: Did you major in computer science?
Speaker 2: No, I majored in electrical engineering.
Speaker 1: Electrical engineering, okay.
Speaker 2: But I took, I took some computer science classes. So that was another thing that no one really kind of explained the difference between electrical engineering and computer science. And then at that time they didn't have computer engineering, which most places have computer engineering. Which is kind of a combination of computer science and electrical engineering. And I'd like to think of myself now as a computer engineer cause electrical engineering deals more with, well electrical engineering is diverse. So--but in general when it comes to computers, electrical engineering is building the circuitry and electronics for a computer. Computer science is in general as it relates to computers, is building the software to run the computers. And computer engineering is integrating both of them, understanding both the hardware and the software.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now who were--were there any special teachers or mentors in college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Harvey, Harvey Domlan was a faculty member and my advisor, and he would give advice, he would meet with me and see how I was doing. And of course Florence Boldridge. But he's the one that stood out. But also Ken [Kenneth] Demarest was another professor that I took for electromagnetics. He remained an academic member, mentor through graduate school and even when I was deciding whether to go back to graduate school or work in industry. And then one summer I worked in the radar systems and remote systems lab around my senior year, and that was with Richard Moore, who was, who's been called the godfather of radar. And he was just a great person to work for and very I guess famous in academia as far as remote sensing and radar systems lab, but you know I would meet with him regularly, mainly for--cause I was working for him with the computer networks. But he, he became someone that just supported me when I wanted to go back to grad school. So as I mentioned earlier, I was trying to take differential equations my spring semester of my freshman year and got a D. And partially again was not just my study skills, but maybe just seeing the big picture and understanding concepts. But that kind of made things an uphill climb for me GPA-wise [grade-point average]. But it was also a, a character building experience. And that's when I first came across the, the Winston Churchill quote success is never final, failure is seldom fatal, but it's courage that counts. And it was that saying as well just again my, my personal faith in God that kept me persevering. And I think that's why I can relate to a lot of students who may have not had the, the preparation you know in high school, to get into a major institution and then also seeing that just because someone gets a bad grade doesn't mean that they can't do it or that they don't have the same potential to achieve.
Story_ID: 27578
Speaker 1: Okay so 1988 you got your Bachelors of Science Degree in Electrical Engineering, University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas]. So what, what happened, what were your prospects?
Speaker 2: So right after, right after I, I graduated--well prior to graduating I interviewed at some companies. And I also wanted to take a missions trip to Bolivia and so that kind of limited my options.
Speaker 1: Now is this a Methodist mission or something?
Speaker 2: No, it was with a company called New Tribes Mission. And they--this particular mission trip was to help a missionary family build a house in the jungle in Bolivia. It was--we had to fly into Cochabamba to--nearest city was, yeah Cochabamba, then we had to--
Speaker 1: So you, you did it, you took it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I took the, yeah I took the missions trip before I started working.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was, it was kind of a factor in would a company, that a prospective company let me go on a missions trip prior to working for them, could they wait that long. It was just a summer. So right after graduating I went to a mission trip near Cochabamba, Bolivia. But it was actually in a village called Manupari, Bolivia, which we had to fly into Cochabamba and--
Speaker 1: How do you spell Cochabamba?
Speaker 2: I think it's C-O-C-H.
Speaker 1: A or--
Speaker 2: Probably A, B-A-M-B-A.
Speaker 1: That sounds right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: And then to a village in, Manupari village, M-A-N-U-P-A-R-I. So we had to take a small plane from Cochabamba three hundred miles over the Andes Mountains and land into this jungle airstrip. I mean looking back, it was kind of an environmental engineering experience because you know there weren't, there wasn't electricity, there wasn't phones. But the question was how do you get clean water, you know how do you take care of sanitation. But we built a house out of mud and, and wooden branches. So we would basically mix straw with the mud, kind of stomp on it and wheelbarrow it. So it was a little, it was a different kind of engineering, kind of more civil engineering, environmental engineering. Helped, if I remember correctly, helped build a sanitation system. We had to do our laundry in the river. The river eventually flowed into the Amazon River and one of the missionary's kids bought, I mean caught a piranha in the river. So there were piranha in the river. We ate alligator, when there were alligators. We went hunting for anaconda, snakes. So but anyway the company that allowed me to do that was Allied Signal Aerospace Company. They're located in Kansas City [Kansas]. They used to be Bendix, became Allied Signal Aerospace Company. They then were--became part of Honeywell, which I believe they're a part of Honeywell now.
Story_ID: 27579
Speaker 1: So I--this was a company [Allied Signal Aerospace Company], company that was a prime contractor for the Department of Energy. Allied Signal Aerospace Company made non-nuclear components for nuclear weapons. And in order to work for them you had to get a security, a security clearance with the government, a Q Clearance, which was the highest that you could get. And so they, they--the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigations] went back and did a background check on me. And so then they had to find, you know they found out about my drug use and--
Speaker 2: From junior high school?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah so they went back and interviewed people, people that knew me. And one of the reasons why the, the government did it is because they, they don't want to have people working for them that are vulnerable to extortion and, and bribes. And so it took me a little longer to get my--like I think because of that. But the, they decided to make me a Purchase Material Quality Engineer. So we would visit and audit suppliers that were outside of our company and looking at the processes for making non-nuclear electromechanical components. It was a realization that your education doesn't stop at college. It, it really just begins. When you work for an engineering company, there's so many new things that you're exposed to. The, the best thing a college can do is prepare you to learn how to learn, you know effectively and efficiently on your own and to, you know, learn basically new languages, new technical languages. As an electrical engineer, I had not been exposed to you know mechanical drawings before, just electrical drawings. Which a place now like where I work at now, Marquette University [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], I guess I shouldn't jump ahead, but they do a better job of exposing students to all the engineering disciplines as freshman so that they can see how it all fits together. So that was a educational experience and we worked with Sandia National Labs and we would visit companies. So, about that time, that was in '88 [1988]. That was when companies were starting to have big lay-offs. A lot of companies were downsizing, engineering companies. And I started seeing some of my friends being laid off and I was thinking you know, well is this what I really want to do? And it, and I realized that I wanted to be more of a creator and designer and I decided I would go back to graduate school.
Story_ID: 27580
Speaker 1: This-- what year is this then?
Speaker 2: This is--I went back to graduate school in '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I do want to say in 1988 I had thought about graduate school when I was getting out. To go into graduate school right away and a professor at University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas], Victor Frost, told me that he had a research assistant position if I wanted to go to graduate school. But I decided I'd, I'd go work first, which in hindsight probably was the best thing for me. But then in, around 1990 when I was considering going back to graduate school, I went and visited University of Kansas, talked to a new professor that was doing artificial intelligence research. He had just come from Purdue University, his name was Costas Tsatsoulis, and he contacted me later. I applied for school and since my GPA [Grade Point Average] was under a 3.0 because of you know my start off with my freshman experience, I think my overall GPA was under 3.0, but my engineering GPA was probably more closer to 3.0. But some of those, some of those mentors and professors that I mentioned, Richard Moore, Ken [Kenneth] Demarest, Harvey Domlan, wrote letters of recommendation that I be admitted, which you know, I tell students now get to know your professors, not only to help you with your current situation, but to get recommendation letters for jobs and graduate school later. So I was admitted. I, I left Allied Signal and moved back to Lawrence, Kansas and worked, started working on my Master's. So after I worked on my Master's for a year--
Speaker 1: So this is, this is where?
Speaker 2: At University of Kansas, yeah I'm sorry. I went back to get my Master's at University of Kansas. And I decided I wanted to do more into software and then specifically I got into artificial intelligence. So at University of Kansas they had merged the electrical engineering and computer science programs, so it was a, a good fit for me because I was electrical engineering by background, but my interest was more in computer science, computer engineering. So I started working as a research assistant and plus I applied for the Patricia Roberts Harris Fellowship and it was an African American who worked in the government. She--so I got that fellowship and so one of the things that helped me too that I would advise students these days is not to get into a lot of debt right after college. So I was able to still live on the, you know a graduate student income and work on my Master's.
Story_ID: 27581
Speaker 1: So I was at a SCORMEBE [Student Council  for Recruiting, Motivating, Educating Black Engineers], but you know or slash minority engineering program, a Lawrence Banquet, or was it just a general engineering--but there was a African American man that was getting honored by University of Kansas for engineering. His name was Michael Shinn. Michael Shinn had played football for University of Kansas. He was roommates with Gayle Sayers when Gayle Sayers played at University of Kansas. Michael Shinn, Mike Shinn had a great career with GE [General Electric] and I was--and during his speech, this acceptance speech for this award, he was talking about how, I think his grandparents were farmers in Kansas and then, you know black farmers and how they always taught him to always reach back and help other people. And so he, he actually practiced that that evening cause he asked me well what was I doing this summer and I said I wasn't sure, you know I didn't know. And he said why don't you come work at GE? So he had me send my resume and got a position in Waukesha, Wisconsin at GE Medical Systems which is now GE Healthcare, just for the summer.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Shinn's last name?
Speaker 1: S-H-I-N-N.
Speaker 2: Okay that's the way I wrote it, but I didn't, okay, alright.
Speaker 1: And so he ended up getting me a job in manufacturing, in x-ray manufacturing at GE Medical Systems that summer. And I went back and I had a good time and told him I was interested. They had a program called the Edison Engineering Program I was interested in. Let them know I was interested in that. And I went back and then it's interesting, I won't get into details about the timing, but it was about the time I wanted to get married to my wife, Anitra, but I was still in college and mom said well you should have a job. It turned out they offered me a full time position to work at GE Medical Systems and to be in the Edison Engineering Program, which gave me a job, moved to Wisconsin and they said well you can transfer and go to University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee [Wisconsin] or Marquette University [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and finish your Master's and GE will pay for it. So I transferred to work on my Master's at Marquette. And went through the Edison Engineering Program, had--it was a great eye opening experience for me. GE is a global company. Back in '92 [1992] when I started working for them, Jack Welch, which is one of the most famous CEOs [corporate executive officer] of GE especially, but overall one of the most well known CEOs. We got to go to corporate leadership training in Crotonville, New York. You know I started studying Japanese at Marquette cause we had Japanese engineers. We had a partner or division in Japan and I had a private tutor for a while cause I wanted to go work in Japan. But I, I learned Japanese. And it was interesting because growing up, my mom didn't really want me to learn Korean but I ended up learning Japanese and I could speak with her cause she could speak Japanese. But eye opening experience. Again, I saw the kind of schools that GE normally recruits from, and that's when I kind of learned, you know the kind of the tier system of schools, engineering schools. So and then I finished my--one of, one of the things that we got to do in the Edison Engineering Program is we got to take some of our classes at GE, and I got credit at Marquette, and I took some of my classes at Marquette. But some of our--being in the Edison Engineering Program was almost like having another job on top of going to graduate school because we had projects that were geared towards the products that GE Healthcare made, which like x-ray systems, positron admission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, computer tomography. And it was really--I, I want to say working there was like a electrical engineer's playground because this is where you see all the abstract, theoretical concepts being applied and used to make real engineering systems that benefitted people, you know medically and you know health-wise. And you know made a profit. And it was, it was a, a great experience. If, you know, if anyone ever gets a chance to work at that, that place, you know interested in both electrical engineering and health care, it's, you know, world class.
Story_ID: 27582
Speaker 1: So you were able to finish your Master's in 1995, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at Marquette [University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]. So yeah at the time I finished my Master's at Marquette in '95 [1995], my advisor was James Heinen. And I knew at that point I was--some of my friends at GE were, that were engineers, they were going to [University of] Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] in Executive MBA [Master of Business Administration] programs and getting their MBAs. So I was considering that. But I, I knew I still wanted to take more software engineering classes. I wanted to take more classes. And I talked to my advisor at Marquette, James, Dr. James Heinen, and he said "Well why don't you get a Ph.D.? Why don't you just keep working, take classes and then take a year off and write your dissertation?" And that was a real pivotal moment in my life because no one had ever said "Why don't you get a Ph.D.?" And so I thought about it, prayed about it, investigated it. I started talking to people that had their Ph.D.s. Because I found that a lot of people that don't have their Ph.D.s say it's not necessary. You become too specialized. But one of the things that I saw at GE was different executives had Ph.D.s. Jack Welch had his Ph.D. in chemical engineering. Some of the other executives had Ph.D.s in engineering at GE. And also around that time in the mid '90s [1990s] was you know I think the World Wide Web had recently come about and browsers like Mosaic. The, the Dot Com Boom was happening. People were going to Silicon Valley and starting these tech startups, becoming instant millionaires. And I was looking at that and I was like where are the African Americans? Why aren't we going out there and starting these tech startups? And I was thinking about what, wondering what I could do in order to make a difference. And so the idea that Dr. Heinen gave me to get a Ph.D., and talking to people that I knew that had Ph.D.s, including my brother, he had his Ph.D. in electrical engineering. I, I thought well you know if I became a professor, get a Ph.D. so I could become a professor, I could help train students in order for them to become you know, educated in computing and they could have the knowledge, the technical knowledge to be one of these startups. And so I decided I would start in, inquiring about graduate school again getting my Ph.D.
Story_ID: 27583
Speaker 1: Marquette [University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] made the offer for me to come here, or at least my advisor was suggesting that I do it. And then I talked to my wife, who's from Kansas City, Missouri, Anitra, and she said well if we were going to be poor graduate students again, let's go back to Kansas City, you know, to where our family is. So I went back and visited University of Kansas and talked to the Dean, Carl Lock, and the Associate Dean Tom Mulinowsi (ph.), as well as Florence Boldridge, the Minority Engineering Program Director. They were delighted that I was interested in it. You know I knew I was going to do it full time and so would, there would be an expense involved. We had to have my son John, my son John was born in Milwaukee in '94 [1994]. We were married in '92 [1992], John was born in '94 [1994] and then we were expecting our second daughter, Adrianna. And so I remember sitting down with Dean Mulinowsi and he said "Well, what do you need, how much do you need?" I told him a number and he said, "Okay you got it, what else do you need to come here and get your Ph.D.?"
Speaker 2: It sound like you were surprised that you could get it.
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: It sounds like that you were surprised that you could get it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was surprised that, yeah cause you know. I should have said a higher number. But, but they you know, Carl Lock the dean and the Associate Dean Mulinowsi, they really wanted me to come back and they were very supportive. And not since Bill [William] Hogan who was a African American professor in electrical engineering there, had a seen a Af--a American born you know, person of African descent in, as a professor at University of Kansas. So I think that was one of the motivations. They were, you know they wanted me to get a Ph.D., they knew I wanted to become a professor and they were kind of, I think they were interested in me being a professor at Kansas. So, so I talked to, I talked to some of my managers at GE [General Electric] about it, some African American. I remember one in particular, African American manager and he was saying well why don't you go to Stanford [University, Stanford, Kansas], or why don't you go to [University of California at] Berkeley [Berkeley, California]? And again for me at that time it was important for my wife to have a support system, cause we--she was away from her parents when we lived in Wisconsin and it was a ideal opportunity for her as well to get back close to her family, you know so they could--the kids could see their grandparents more often. And so--and then also I realized the advisor I'd worked for while I'd started my master's at Kansas, Costas Tsatoulis, he was glad to have me back and working on, working on artificial intelligence projects. And so I knew it was a supportive environment for my family as well as for myself to get a Ph.D. cause you know usually when people see you know you have doctor or Ph.D. at the end of your name, they don't necessarily say, "Well, where'd you get it from?" And so I knew the goal for me was to get the Ph.D. and I, you know also talked to different mentors, academic mentors like Ken [Kenneth] Demarest and Bill Hogan. And so we moved from Milwaukee back to, to Kansas, to Lawrence, Kansas and I started my Ph.D. While I was at Ph.D. [at the University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas], after the first year, well while I was there the first year I applied for the GEM [Graduate Engineering Degrees for Minorities] Consortium Fellowship, GEM. The GEM consortium was started by a man named Howard Adams who got a consortium of Fortune 500 companies and universities to help increase the number of underrepresented minorities to get their Master's and Ph.D.s in engineering and science. And so initially when I applied I didn't get it. And I told Mike [Michael] Shinn who was still at GE, and Mike Shinn used his influence to convince the people at GE to be my corporate sponsor through the, through the GE Foundation, which it paid, it guaranteed, you know, my academic support for tuition and fees and a stipend for the rest of my Ph.D. pursuit.
Story_ID: 27584
Speaker 1: I was able to get a research internship the first summer at GE's [General Electric] Corporate Research and Development Center in Crotonville, no Schenectady, New York which was timely because my wife and I, we had run out of money and it was difficult because I had to live in New York while she stayed back in Kansas because my daughter Adrianna had been born in '96 [1996]. So I got there in '95 [1995] cause she was born in '96 [1996], so she, Anitra didn't want to change doctors and she still wanted to be close to her family. It was especially difficult cause on one particular evening that summer, there was a tornado in Lawrence [Kansas] and a house that we were living in, that we actually bought in Lawrence, didn't have a basement. And so she had to take the kids, get the kids from the babysitter, cause she was working part-time, and you know put them in the bathtub while the storm was going on. But it was a challenging time in '96 [1996] as well because that was the year my mom passed away and I almost quit my Ph.D. Because number one I said well, if it ever got too much financially cause I was married with you know two kids at that time, I was always willing to go back to work and keep my family first cause in my life you know, my faith with God, my family and then whatever else. But especially when my mom--hit those particularly hard cause it was around the, the winter break, Christmas break. Around Thanksgiving I had heard that she was feeling sick, or that she was sick. She had visited my sister and her family in Sacramento [California]. And I think some of the other family from Los Angeles [California] visited and saw her too. And so I really felt like I needed to go see her. And we had this big---we were doing this CICE Project where we were trying to build an expert system, AI [Artificial Intelligence] System to classify CICE. And we were supposed to have people from the, I believe it was the Navy, come and we were supposed to interview them and but, but I also felt like I, I wanted to go see my, my mom and so I talked to my advisor. He, he said I could go and a friend of ours worked, Rob [Robert] and Karen Hopkins, she worked at an airline. And so she got us a ticket so we could go see my mom. My mom seemed like she was fine. Got back and then like a day or two later my brother called me and said she's dead. You know mama's dead. And it was crushing for me cause I never had anyone that close to me pass away. And here I am, you know in the middle of graduate school, making less money than what I was making in industry, you know, supporting a family. And my mom, you know, just passed away. And so I was thinking about quitting. And I remember my oldest brother writing me a letter and saying in the letter you know, "Mom, mama wouldn't want you to quit. And you know I think you should keep going." And you know my oldest brother Robert had his Ph.D. And he sent me a check for three hundred dollars and he said, you know, "Use this to, you know, get a babysitter so you can study for your qualifying exam." And you know it took me a while, but I--that letter really encouraged me and picked me up enough to continue on and persevere. And I decided I would keep going.
Story_ID: 27585
Speaker 1: Well tell us about your dissertation. What, what was it about and for your Ph.D. This is--you got your Ph.D. in 1999.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And your area of research was distributed artificial intelligence and intelligent agents, right? Okay.
Speaker 2: So the title of my dissertation was called 'Learning Ontologies in a Multi-Agent System.' So an intelligent agent is either a software or a robotic agent that has different AI [artificial intelligence] capabilities such as reasoning, learning, communication. And what I envisioned, particularly at the time the Internet boom was happening and there were search engines like Yahoo, was ways of having intelligent software agents that could represent how people use the Internet to find things that they wanted. And how these software agents that represented groups of individuals the way they categorized what they liked in the Internet or what they use in the Internet, how these agents could teach each other concepts that their users knew about. And so and ontology is a representation of an agent's knowledge or even a person's knowledge, and all the concepts and the interrelationships between those concepts. And so I developed a way for software agents to use machine learning techniques to learn the concepts that people categorize and bookmark hierarchies, like directories. And so I used some search engine data and implemented these algorithms for not only the machine learning, but the communication between the software agents. And it was interesting--so I worked with Dr. Costas Tsatsoulis on this. It was interesting that when I was getting ready to apply for positions, think I interviewed at about five places and more contact me, you know to, to get a professor position. But one of them, one of the universities asked me to start an Internet company using my research and it would be like a partnership between the college of engineering and the business school. So I sometimes wonder what would have happened had I done that because I think at the time I--of course my idea was novel because in order to get a Ph.D., your idea has to be novel and it has to contribute to knowledge. But the, the idea be--between, behind it was at that time when people were researching this particular problem, they, they solved the problem by saying everyone share a common, you know, global ontology, all the agents. And I was--realized that people, I recognized that people had different representations, different ontologies. Sometimes they would talk about the same concept but use different terminology and so forth.
Speaker 1: Now for first thing, what was the, can you spell the name of your advisor.
Speaker 2: Yes, Costas, C-O-S-T-A-S, Tsatsoulis, T-S-A, sat, T-S-A-T-S-O-U-L-I-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright and, and, and now if you could explain what ontology means in the, in computer science world.
Speaker 2: So an ontology is a representation of what an agent knows about its world or universe, the concepts and the interrelationships between those concepts.
Speaker 1: Okay now agent and by agent you mean a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so an agent is, an agent could be a, you know a person, it could be a software agent, a software entity, it could be a robotic entity. But I was working with software entities as it, as they relate to working on behalf of people as intelligent agents and representing what people knew and did in, with the Internet and Web browsing and Web searching.
Speaker 1: So would a agent be like a Web page or something, or, or, or--
Speaker 2: No, well let's see. Well of course like a robotic car could be you know, would be an agent. You know in some respects apps have become--
Speaker 1: Agents.
Speaker 2: Agents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because they do intelligent things on behalf of people.
Story_ID: 27586
Speaker 1: Okay so say, say it's a camera app on your phone or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Would that, that be a agent that would interact with the rest of your phone to do things?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, but if the, if the agent, if the camera app also took into consideration personal things about you, your preferences and then maybe learn things and improve its performance based on how it interacts with you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then if that camera app also communicated maybe with other camera apps.
Speaker 1: I want to say maybe like a, say you have a, a NFL [National Football League] app on your phone and the app knows that you're a Cleveland Browns fan.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then it would pull that kind of information together for you and try to sell you Cleveland Brown jerseys and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, so some of it is, yeah, yeah I think that's kind of a, a part of it.
Speaker 1: Okay there's news about the Browns players. It would feed that kind of news to you, or a former Brown player, anybody that's associated with--
Speaker 2: Yeah that, that could be part of it. Anything that has some kind of reasoning capabilities, some learning capabilities, communication capabilities. And so artificial intelligence is responsible for a lot of the things that we have today. But once they become so commonplace, they're no longer thought of as artificial intelligence. So it's kind of like the next level of intelligence that you give some computing device or some software application. So I mean just before you know twenty years ago, being able to go to like Amazon and then have Amazon track your preferences and then suggest knew things, those used to be AI topics. You know how can the Amazon website learn your preferences and then suggest out of all of its thousands and millions of things, things that you would be interested in. So that's a, you know that's an example. But probably one of the best examples of a you know, intelligent, robotic agent now would be, you know the driverless cars that Google, Google has that started out at Stanford [University, Stanford, California] where an agent has sensors to take in information about the surroundings, its environment, then have some kind of reasoning capability and decision making capability, control capability. And then it has some kind of effectors or actuators to act on the environment to change it. And so in, in terms of the driverless car, it's being able to sense through laser range finders and radars and computer vision systems, where it's at, you know on the road and then using it's algorithms, computing algorithms to determine what to do next and then use its effectors or actuators to brake the car, accelerate it and so forth. For me the software agent at that time, was, had the ability to sense what other agents knew about or were interested in through examples. And then it would have the ability to learn and to reason about what concepts the other agent knew that were similar to its concepts and be able to, you know, verify and confirm that through communication and through learning.
Speaker 1: Okay, on a particular project that you did for your Ph.D., there, what were the agents we're talking about?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, so these agents, the system was called DOGIE, Distributed Ontology Group Integration Environment, something like that. And the agent was able to take what a user searched the Web for and categorize, like in directories. And they're called bookmarks. And they would put them in, in categories. Back then search engines, some search engines like Yahoo, had ontologies. So it's like the category was you know, let's say for example celebrities, sports and then you have a bunch of sports celebrities. Those were, those sports celebrities were instances of the concept, you know, sports, which was a, you know a sub-concept of celebrities. And so it was really how do agents define meaning and learn meaning as it relates to what other agents know about. So my agents would learn what a particular user knew about the Web and then the agent would communicate with other agents by example, by sending examples. The, the receiving agents would use inference engine, a reasoning engine, to determine whether they were talking about the same concepts or similar concepts, and then try to verify that. So, so that was what my agents did.
Story_ID: 27587
Speaker 1: So you earned your Ph.D. in 1999. Now was your, was your--now you wrote a, you, you published about DOGIE [Distributed Ontology Group Integration], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what was it a, what was it used? You know, did, did people cite it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Actually the, the publication I wrote that got the most citations was called "Learning to Share Meaning in a Multi-Agent System". I believe that was published in--I can't remember when it was published, but it was published in the 'Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems Journal.'
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah I think it's published in 2002 [sic, 2004] what we have here, is that about right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can't remember, but yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: So, so one of the at that time--well actually since then, part of the, the vision of the Web was to make it a semantic Web. So right now the Web content is mostly human readable. So you can search, search for something and you get Web pages in return. But for a software agent to understand what a Web page, Web page says, it either has to do something called natural language understanding, or it has to look for ways that are kind of workarounds from actually being able to understand you know, ambiguous language. There was work that was done to make the Web more structured and more readable by machines, and that's kind of ongoing. But since '99 [1999] when I published my Web, I mean my, my dissertation, you know science and engineering has made, you know, so much progress, but there's still, you know a lot to be done. So what I focused on before was software agents, but what I do now is focusing on the intelligent agents, but with a, a body, a robot basically.
Speaker 1: So would that be more machine learning or something?
Speaker 2: No, it, it would--well so what I do now is humanoid robotics combined with artificial intelligence.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So artificial intelligence includes machine learning, includes reasoning and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you finished your, your Ph.D. at University of Kansas, now did--you did some teaching I, I would assume too at the University of Kansas while you were working on your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: No, since I had the GEM [Graduate Engineering Degrees for Minorities] Fellowship, it freed me just to focus on my research.
Story_ID: 27588
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa].
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, so I applied for like I said before, I think five different positions. One of my first offers came from Iowa State [University, Ames, Iowa] and then after that when University of Missouri-Kansas City [Kansas City, Missouri] was interested, well made me an offer. University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] wanted me to work there. University of Nebraska-Lincoln [Lincoln, Nebraska] was the place that wanted me to start an Internet company. And Iowa, University of Iowa, I think they might have found out that Iowa State was going to hire me and they offered me a position. And I decided on University of Iowa because well and actually some of the places I applied to were close to Kansas City [Missouri] because my, my mother-in-law had multiple sclerosis and my, my wife wanted to be a day's drive. So I had offers to interview at places that were farther away, but we had that requirement to stay close. And University of Iowa, I was attracted to them because you know they were a Big Ten research institution, as well as they had a, a renowned college of medicine that worked closely with their college of engineering. And so my background with GE [General Electric] Medical Systems, I really wanted to apply AI [Artificial Technology] techniques to health care. It was interesting because when, back when I was deciding which college to, to go to or university to go to for my Ph.D., and one of my friends and mentors, Derrick Rollins, he's a, he's a faculty member at Iowa State. He helped me get the interview at Iowa State in computer science there and they made me an offer. And I, I really wanted to go there. But it was interesting when I was choosing the university to get my Ph.D., he was thinking that I needed to go to a bigger name school than University of Kansas for engineering if I wanted to go to a big school, a research school when I graduated. So it's kind of ironic that his school Iowa State, as well as University of Iowa, major research institutions, wanted me to come work there. So again, what I try to tell students is you know it's, it's important where you go, but it's more important what you do wherever you go. And so as I said before talent can come from anywhere. So one of the reasons I, another reason why I chose Iowa cause it was a little, it was a little less rural than Iowa State, but both were great institutions. I was also attracted to Iowa State because of George Washington Carver went to Iowa State. And he was a faculty member at Iowa State, and he was one of the role models that my dad had given to me as a child. And George Washington Carver even became a more of a role model even when I was working on my Ph.D. because I read about him and one of the things he would do was he would go out to the garden or to the field and ask God to show him another thing about the peanut or the sweet, sweet potato. And that's essentially what I, I did for my Ph.D. research was to ask God to, to reveal things for me about how the, the way the world worked about knowledge. So that was another draw of Iowa State. But--
Story_ID: 27589
Speaker 1: Did you feel that you were--things were revealed to, to you as a--I mean in a way that's not you know, scien--scientific method?
Speaker 2: Well so it's interesting because you know ideas can come from anywhere. And you could say it was by chance or you could say there was some other influence. I, you know I personally believe that you know one of the verses I, from the Bible that I learned from Proverbs was "the Lord gives wisdom; out of His mouth comes knowledge and understanding." And as a Christian, you know I viewed the world and the universe being built by and created by a designer, an intelligent designer. And all knowledge you know, comes from that source. And so for me there's not really a conflict between science and my faith because I think there's you know, science uses empirical evidence to prove things which that's what I use as a scientist and, and as an engineer. You know you can't put love into a test tube per se, and measure it scientifically. I guess some people, I guess it depends on what definition of love is. So all the, all the blessings, all the knowledge I get, I think the original source is God. I think that's--he reveals knowledge to people whether they believe in God or not. Just like he causes the rain to fall and people whether they believe God causes the rain to fall on them or not. So--
Speaker 1: But, but you know what I'm asking though, cause George Washington Carver used to say that he would go out into the fields and God would actually tell him which plants would do what. And I mean it's different from doing a scientific test to find out. I mean he may have done both, but I'm just saying that that's what he--that's the implication when people say that, that they're getting a revelation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's something they're getting without going through a process.
Speaker 2: No I, I think I, well so I, I guess I interpret it different than you and maybe I should read more closely his writings. But--
Speaker 1: Well that's what I took it to mean. I mean a revelation is something that's revealed to you without any--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well so I never read that he said that they were you know like revelations that just came out of nowhere. Because he knew about science. He, he knew you know botany, he knew agriculture.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So if a revelation came, it was in the context of the science that he knew. The revelation being just a new thought or a new idea that maybe he could verify or prove.
Speaker 1: That's different from, from what we normally see as a, you know a religious rev--revelation. I mean when people talk about religious revelations, they're talking about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Something actually just being revealed without any investigation.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no I don't think--yeah I don't think that he believed that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't, I don't think that's what I'm trying to say I believe either.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. I'm just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I appreciate you clarifying that. What I do believe is that you know God can open up my mind so that I'm attentive and alert to new insight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I see it, when I think it, when I reason it, and that may explain some of why I think I've been able to achieve what I achieved because kind of going back to my book. I don't put limits on what I can or can't do because I believe that you know, there's a, a creator that created me with unlimited potential. And that's the thing that I try to share with my students, to not limit themselves because I see our society systematically has you know, lowered expectations on certain groups of people. And people have to figure out a way to think beyond what other people expect they can or can't do.
Story_ID: 27590
Speaker 1: Okay. So now you went to the University of Iowa, was that, what, 2000 or--
Speaker 2: That was in '99 [1999].
Speaker 1: '99 [1999].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: August of '99 [1999].
Speaker 1: Alright so '99 [1999], and, and so you were there I take it for, until 2004, is that right, correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so did, did you get a chance to interact with the medical facility?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I had some great mentors. One was Tom [Thomas] Casavant, he was electrical engineering, electrical and computer engineering professor. But he had collaborations in the College of Medicine. He was doing a lot with bioinformatics and computational biology. So he was applying parallel computing and different computer algorithms in the human genome project. And so he connected me with Ed [Edwin] Stone, who was a Howard Hughes Investigator, who was an ophthalmologist and did genomics research. And he was working on finding the, the disease gene that caused age-related macular degeneration. And so one of the things as we talked, you know here, here I am you know, a computer engineer talking to someone who's an ophthalmologist. As we talked, and as I got to learn more about what he did and he learned more about what I did, we realized that in trying to pinpoint the location of a gene that causes blindness, you need the, the genotype, the genotypes as well as the phenotypes. And phenotypes are the traits or the characteristics of the disease that, you know, manifests themselves like you know maybe certain red blood vessels or something in the eye or--and what--the connection that we found was different researchers saw different variations of the disease, age-related macular degeneration or AMD. And those were variations in the phenotypes, but, but they didn't have names for them. And they didn't categorize them as subtypes. And so my research related to having agents with diverse ontologies or diverse ways of conceptualizing different concepts, we found that related to that real world problem, that real world, world disease. And so I proposed using these AI [artificial technology] techniques that came from my dissertation research and applying it to allowing doctors to collaboratively use intelligent agents to categorize new phenotypes for age related macu--macular degeneration. And I proposed a, a, a proposal to the National Institutes of Health, the National Eye Institute in order to get funding to pursue that research and I tried, didn't get it the first time. Tried again, didn't get it the second time. Wrote a, a letter of rebuttal and convinced them to, to give me this grant. It was approximately seven hundred and seventy thousand dollar three year grant that supported two graduate students and a postdoc. And we applied the system we had collaborate, international collaborators who were ophthalmologists, and we came up with a system called Eye Docs that allowed us to do this and we--these intelligent agents used machine learning similar to what we had used for my, what I used for my dissertation research. And we were able to publish a paper in a premier ophthalmology publication that related to that, that research. And that was a--that was at a time when I began transitioning and I ended up going to another institution. One of the things I, I neglected to say when I graduated from University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas], it was the first time that there was a African American that had gotten a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Kansas.
Story_ID: 27591
Speaker 1: Now do you think--what impact do you think your research had on, on the medical field before you left the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa]?
Speaker 2: So it continued a little on--I continued it when I went to my new institution, but I haven't kept up with it as much but I know that I did see a paper where they located a gene that caused AMD [age-related macular degeneration]. So I think somehow my, the know that, you know our team contributed had a impact. And it's possible, you know some of that came from the researchers at Iowa. So I haven't kept as up to date on that, that line of research.
Speaker 1: So, so you think it sped up the re--research process?
Speaker 2: I, I think it added insight. And I think potentially just a general idea that if we better define, better define in a collaborative way certain disease phenotypes, whether they be AMD or cancer, we can not only help in the statistical analysis in determining the location of the gene, but also determining the best treatments for the variations of the diseases. So for example someone may have a certain type of cancer when in fact it may have several subtypes of that cancer. One treatment may work for some of those subtypes, but not all of them. But if you're putting them all in a broad category of that cancer, you, you may be missing one of the variations that are important to, to know about so you can apply a specific treatment. So I think in general that approach, you know could help.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is--I, I guess--correct me if I'm wrong, but thinking that what you, what you were working on provides a short cut I guess to the sharing of ideas in the scientific community. I mean there, there's so much information out here, but people don't know, right? What else is out here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so this was a--in a way what you're saying is correct. What it allows is various experts on disease to be able to individually and collaboratively define new variations of a disease to, to more accurately determine you know, the position in the genome, as well as determining you know, better treatments. So in essence it's a--part of it's a communication problem, and this is an example of using intelligent software to alleviate that problem and to I guess better focus particular meaning as people are, you know, investigating disease.
Story_ID: 27592
Speaker 1: Alright, so, well, tell us about Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia]. Now you went to Spelman in 2004 and how, how did that move come about?
Speaker 2: So it was in 2003 my wife and I, we were reading the book 'The Purpose Driven Life.' And I realized that my main purpose is to teach, and part of that teaching involves empowering or enabling young people to reach their full potential academically, vocationally, economically and spiritually. Cause one of the things that drove me to become a professor was the lack of African Americans in Silicon Valley starting their own technology companies. And one of the things I discovered at University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] was after five years, I'd only taught two black students, one was African American, the other one was from Ghana. And I realized after reading that book that if I were to help black students, I needed to go where black students were and I'd always kind of envisioned myself working at a historically black college or university, an HBCU [historically black colleges and universities] during my retirement years. But I, I just felt a strong sense of urgency to, to do that now because that was, that was what I had wanted to do when I first saw the, the need. And so I interviewed at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], interviewed at Spelman College. Had an informal interview with Dean J.K. Haynes at Morehouse College. And a position opened at Spelman College. And so, being in the engineering field, not only are African Americans or Hispanics underrepresented in the engineering field, computing field, but women are underrepresented. And so going to college for engineering, there weren't that many women in my classes. And so it was a unique idea for me to even consider going to Spelman which is all women. But my wife reminded me, she said you know I've two--I have a son and two daughters and she said don't you want you know our daughters to go to a place where you have faculty that are really trying to help them reach their full potential? And when Spelman made the offer I was, you know, we decided to go. It was, it was challenging cause when my mom [Yuson Kim Williams] passed away, my dad [John Morgan Williams] would come live with my wife and I, either when we were in Lawrence [Kansas] or in Iowa, and sometimes he'd go back to my brother in California, Morgan. And then her mom had gotten multiple sclerosis and so some--she would come stay with us until she had to get twenty-four hour care. But she passed away before we made our move. But she had moved back to Kansas City [Missouri], my wife's mom. And so that was the time we were--we moved to Spelman. My youngest child, Rosa was born in '99 [1999], the year I graduated.
Story_ID: 27593
Speaker 1: So we moved to Atlanta [Georgia] and one of the, one of the young ladies that saw me during my interview talk at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], she ended up going to work at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] that summer with Dr. Ayanna Howard who was at NASA at the time. And so she came back and she, she was excited that I was coming cause she contacted me. Her name was Arian Moore Austin. She contacted me that summer before I came to Spelman and she said, "Dr. Williams, you know I heard you talk when you came to Spelman. What are some good books on artificial intelligence, or AI that I can read?" And she--and I told her and I said you know, "I guess you found out that I'm coming to Spelamn." She said "No, I didn't know, that's great." And she said she wanted to work, you know, do research with me when I got there. And when, when I was at Iowa towards the end of my time at Iowa, I had got a Sony Aibo four legged robot. It looks like a puppy and was--I had seen it earlier in my career at [University of] Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] at an autonomous agents and multi-agent system. Autonomous agent is basically an intelligent agent, autonomous meaning without human intervention, doing things on its own. And I'd seen it at a--they were doing an exhibit--exhibition of having these robots play soccer and they had started a robot competition years earlier called Robocup which allowed different universities from around the world to compete in robot soccer. So I had written a small proposal to the Provost Office at Iowa to get one, did some research using one, one of my students got a Master's thesis using genetic algorithms to teach robots how to improve their walking gate, these four legged robots. And so when I interviewed at Spelman, I said I want to get some of these robots and I want to start a team to compete in Robocup. Not thinking, I was just thinking you know the--I wasn't thinking it was going to be anything special, I just thought you know this would be something great for the students to, to learn and be involved in. And so I, I started announcing and asking for volunteers in my classes, asking them what they--if they wanted to do research with these robots and artificial intelligence. And this student, Brandy Kinlaw, she had already been doing some things with the Lego Mindstorms robots with a faculty member at Spelman and Arian Moore Austin, then a couple other students were in a undergraduate research program and they got assigned to me. They were Ebony O'Neil and Karina Lyles. And then let's see, Ebony Smith, she was a junior and Shanese Nobles, she was a senior. And I talked to them about competing in the Robocup competition. They had never heard of it. And the Robocup US Open was going to be held at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] that year. Actually I got there in 2004, it was going to be held that spring in 2005.
Speaker 2: That's right there in town, right in town.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then the International Robocup was going to be held in Osaka, Japan. And I said okay let's prepare a presentation to the president of Spelman, Beverly Daniel Tatum, to see if she would support us competing if we qualify for the Robocup in Japan. And she loved the idea and she said you know she would support it and you know help us raise money to attend if we qualified.
Story_ID: 27594
Speaker 1: So first time teams to qualify had to have a technical report that showed how it would do robot localization, so how the robot would find where it's at in the soccer field, it's environment. How it would do computer vision. How it would do, you know, motion. And, and then also a video of it demonstrating kicks and passes and being able to find the, the ball and the goal and things like that. So when I first got there, someone from Carnegie Melon [University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] had contacted me and said that he'd heard Spelman had the best Computer Science Department of all the HBCUs. And we developed a collaboration where he had a particular robot platform and we started using and started teaching to our students. And so we used that platform on the Sony Aibo robot to qualify and to compete in the Robocup. And it--so we ended up competing in the US Open at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia]. Our first match was against Georgia Tech. And so here we have Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia], these African American young ladies from a historically black college which is an undergraduate liberal arts college versus a graduate college. And--
Speaker 2: So there were a lot of in--firsts in this, cause this is the first--go on--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah so this was the first time you know a group of African American women, you know competed in the Robocup. We competed in the US Open, so that was the first time. We--
Speaker 2: What was, what was--wasn't it also the first all female?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was the first all women's team. And there, there hasn't been another one. And so you know nowadays there's robotics competitions for high schoolers. This one is a robotics competition for universities and colleges, you know, around the world. So there's a difference between high school versus college, university. But in particular, we're competing against graduate schools. So Spelman doesn't have a graduate school; it's just an undergraduate liberal arts school.
Story_ID: 27595
Speaker 1: So here we are competing against Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] and I think they were getting a little concerned because their robots weren't working that good and this was our first time. And I think one of--one time our, our robot kind of blocked a goal accidentally. And it's, it's hard sometimes to, to communicate people the difficulty of having robots play soccer because we take as humans, we take for granted you know if we can see how easy it is to locate a ball or a bottle or something. But for a robot to be able to do that, you know you need the video cameras are coming in at you know thirty frames per second and then you need you know, math algorithms to segment out the different objects in the image, which you know our--the human eye does some really complex things with the brain in order to decipher what, what's in front of what, what it sees. And to get a robot, I mean yeah a robot to do it using computer vision, is really challenging. And so--but that's just one thing. Another is just finding where the ball is on the field, being able to know which direction it's pointing.
Speaker 2: So you got to translate vision and action or--
Speaker 1: Yeah the action, the motion.
Speaker 2: How do--and you do that through--
Speaker 1: So, so that's the other thing that is--makes this unique and makes it you know autonomous is there's no, there's no human intervention. There's no remote control. So the robots do it on their own. So the, the students are writing you know, computer code to communicate the instructions to the hardware what they want it to do. And essentially a robot is like a PC [personal computer] with you know, legs and head and so forth, or some kind of body. So, so the--I believe we had at least one other match. I, I'd have to look at my notes to remember. But I know--
Speaker 2: So did you beat Georgia Tech?
Speaker 1: No we, we ended up losing one to zero.
Speaker 2: That's pretty good.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's a respectable soccer game.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah that was you know our students were very happy. And we--
Speaker 2: Now there's something you told us somewhere about Georgia Tech complained that one of their robots blocked the goal or something? But isn't that the goal of the robots to block the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, I, I don't think I, I don't think I said that. But I, no I said our robots accidentally, yeah, yeah. So I think at one point our robot didn't move and so it was in the way, so it blocked the goal that way. And I guess in the world of robotics, especially research, things don't always happen the way you plan it out. It turned out in the next match we went against Columbia University [New York, New York]. It was a team that was combined between Columbia University and Brooklyn College [New York, New York]. And in that match, we scored a goal against Columbia University and they were, they were really concerned and cause it was one to zero. They came back and scored, so it was tied. And then in the final minutes they, they scored another one. But our, our team you know which we called the Spelmon-- Spelbots, you know for short for Spelman robotics, was--we were ecstatic cause we scored and you know we were ready to, you know go to the Robo-- the International Robocup. So we put in our application for the International Robocup and the, the committee, the Technical Committee, judged us as qualified to compete in the International Robocup. They only allowed twenty-four teams from around the world to compete. Five qualified including Georgia Tech, but Georgia Tech ended up not going, so the, the four US teams were Carnegie Melon University [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], University of Texas Austin [Austin, Texas], and University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. So these are, you know all engineering schools, graduate schools, and then Spelman College.
Speaker 2: So let me just rewind this a minute here. You're saying that the Spelman girls, I mean women, competed against grad students.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: At these other schools.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah so graduate students, in some cases post-docs. And so it was a, it was a major accomplishment. And you know part of I think was you know the vision for us to compete, you know because no one had done it before. But also the thing that I stressed with them was courage, which you know went back to my, you know personal model. "Success is never final, failure is seldom fatal, but it's courage that counts." Cause in the world of robotics, you have lots of failures, you know things don't always happen like you program them to because you're in a real world environment where things break down.
Story_ID: 27596
Speaker 1: So we had made the presentation to Beverly Tate--President Beverly Tatum to see if she would, could get us support. And she, she was in attendance there, my family was in attendance when we went to the U.S. Open. And she told us that Coca-Cola, the Coca-Cola Foundation had decided to give Spelman fifty thousand dollars, which was more than enough for competing and to buy some new robots. And we ended up, Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] ended up hiring a documentary film crew was led by Brian Simmons, who used to work at Turner Studios. And he makes documentaries. But he had hired a film, he had a film crew that went with us and had a documentary of the whole trip that has been shown on public television, you know in Atlanta [Georgia]. But Turner Studios ended up donating their production studio for the post production. And it's a, it's a, I think it's a great story if kids can see it because one of the things that make me so happy about Spelbots is these are role models that young people can relate to. You know part of the issue with underrepresented students is they don't, they lack role models in science and engineering that look like them. African Americans don't lack role models in you know entertainment or athletics, or even politics. But in engineering and science it's, it's hard for African Americans to name someone on a level of a Bill Gates or a Steve Jobs. So we, we went to Osaka, Japan and competed in Robocup. We didn't win any of our matches, but I told the students you know in five years we were going to win it. And it was, it was a first step, it was a step to you know try to help break down some barriers in science and engineering.
Story_ID: 27597
Speaker 1: That was in 2005, right, when you went to the international competition? And how many, I mean how--when are the international competitions? Are they every four years or something or every so many years?
Speaker 2: No, they're every, they're every year. So the next year we went to Bremen, Germany and competed. The next year, 2007, we competed--it was at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], but we just did the, the four legged robot technical challenge. We tied for second in the passing event. And that was a freshman, Whitney O'Banner that was the main contributor on that software. 2008 [2008] we qualified. We had two freshman, Janesa Keels and Jasmine Miller who helped us along with Whitney to qualify for the four legged robot competition in Sugo, China. We ended up not going because of travel concerns. And then the next year in 2009, was the first year that we got the two legged humanoid robots and the league that we competed in was called the standard platform league. They had went from four legged robots where everyone buys their, the same robot and the, the challenge is in programming the AI and so forth in the software. So that year we competed in the Robocup Japan Open and we had five matches against Fukuoka Institute of Technology cause at that time not very many people had the two legged humanoid robots. We were able to get them through a Title Three grant from the government as just part of our--upgrading our computer science curriculum. And we competed against Fukuoka Institute of Technology in Osaka, Japan. Here we are--think it's five years later, or less, and we tied them in the championship match. And it turned out we had to go to a penalty kick shootout and we came this close, this close to beating them. And I don't know what happened, but on the last penalty kick that we had, we thought we were going to make it and one of the judges picked up our robot just before it was about to kick. So we thought that was odd.
Speaker 1: Was that a, a--
Speaker 2: We don't know if that was intentional or not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they said that we ran out of time. But I think what happened is they started the clock too early. So we went to the judges, no, we went to the awards ceremony and you know I heard them calling off the team names and then when they talked about--when it was time for our match, they didn't call our name, you know that we had tied in the championship match. So we were real puzzled and when we went back to the person that organized the, the match for the, you know the humanoid robots. And he, he got upset and raised his voice at me and you know, our social provost for research at the time, Lily McNair was there and the students were there and he's almost like yelling at me. And, and then so we went to the overall organizer and they reluctantly eventually gave us a certificate that said that we tied in the championship match, you know.
Speaker 1: Well what was he yelling about? What was he saying? What was his--
Speaker 2: Well it was, it was interesting because one of the students, Jasmine had been studying Japanese and she said that they were making fun of us. You know the announcer. He was the local organizer. And, but it was in Japanese. And he was saying, you know I don't even really recall what he was saying or if I could understand what he was saying. But it was clearly not appropriate.
Speaker 1: But it was, was his point then that you should not have been able to receive your recognition because you're a African American team of women from the United States?
Speaker 2: Well I don't know that that's why he did it, but it, it--to see women doing things like that--well it's a different culture. So I, I can't tell you exactly why he did that. But it's a, it's a different culture. And then on top of that being African American. And what I told the students was you know, take this is as a learning moment, there's still global racism and sexism and you're trailblazers, you know for young women that are going to come after you. And, and this wasn't the first time, you know, that something like this had happened. When we went to Bremen, Germany to compete. It was around the time the, the soccer World Cup is.
Story_ID: 27598
Speaker 1: In fact Robocup, the goal of Robocup is to have robots that can beat the, the human World Cup soccer champions by the year 2050.
Speaker 2: So full size robots?
Speaker 1: Yeah, full size robots. We're here at Marquette [University, Milwaukee, Michigan], we're building teen age sized robots and then we're going to get to the adult size soon. And the idea is that as you're building these technologies, you can transfer these technologies and these theories to apply with real humans to assist with, with robots that can assist humans in you know like the elderly or disabled and so forth. But they chose soccer as the primary competition because everyone in the world understands soccer. But the, they also have, they also have--well most everyone else in the world understands soccer, more so than like American football for example, or American baseball. So let's see what was I gonna say. So anyway--they have other leagues, they have like a Robocup at home which is having robots to do tasks that a, a person would do in the home. They have some search and rescue. So robot that will go in like a burning building and find people and rescue them. In fact the United States has really increased its emphasis on robots that can work alongside people, alongside people and perform complex tasks so that the next time there's some national emergency where you need a robot to do something complex, you don't have to send a human, you can have a robot do the task.
Story_ID: 27599
Speaker 1: Okay, now what happened in Bremen [Germany]?
Speaker 2: So our students [from Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], so at the time the, the World Cup was happening in Germany, it wasn't in Bremen, Germany but they had a big screen set up. And there was a lot of festivities happening. And our students wanted to go bowling, so they told me about this after it happened, but they went to a bowling alley. They rode the elevator and they noticed on the, the ceiling was a swastika on the ceiling. They, they got out the elevator, went to go in and there were people bowling, the bowling alley was open. And they wouldn't let our students go in and go bowling. And so I, again I told our students you know there's still global racism and sexism that you're part of, you know trailblazers are, are making a difference. And you're going to do that, you know by using your minds and using technology.
Story_ID: 27600
Speaker 1: Now you were at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] through the year--
Speaker 2: 2012.
Speaker 1: 2012, okay. I know that the Spelbots [the Spelman College robotics team] are still, still going on.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a, a--had the name of someone who was in charge of it here. Let's see the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I just left Spelman in 2012 and came to Marquette University [Milwaukee, Wisconsin]. One of the things I want to talk about is some of the STEMs, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math programs that we started at Spelman, that I helped start at Spelman. One of course was the Spelbots where we involved students doing undergraduate research projects that related not only to our robot soccer competitions, but also to meeting societal needs related to things such as health care because one of the things I wanted students to see not only at Spelman but nationally, is that you can make a difference and impact society, society in a positive way using technology. So at a place like Spelman you'll get people that, students that want to make a difference in society and they've, they've been told you can do that by being a doctor or a lawyer. And, and other things as well. But not a lot of them have been told you can use computer science, computer engineering to make a difference for--in society in a positive way. And so from the Spelbots we started a collaboration with Carnegie Melon [University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] called CARE, Computer and Robotics Education for African American Students. So this included teaching--getting some other HBC[U]s [historically black colleges and universities] involved. I believe it was Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], and University of District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.], involved in these same kind of robotics we were doing. We also expanded the existing Spelman College Computer Science Olympiad. And we started a middle school outreach program to teach students using these robots that we were using, the four legged Sony Aibos as well as some computer animation, using Alice, which was a 3D animation software developed at Carnegie Melon. So we got a, a grant from National Science Foundation, believe it was around four hundred thousand dollars to do that.
Story_ID: 27601
Speaker 1: One of the other parts of my vision for spreading you know this kind of robotics and computer education to HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], was to form an alliance with other HBCUs and research institutions to provide them with opportunities to do research and education with these, with robotics. And so I was the primary founder with several cofounders from HBCUs and research institutions for the ARTSI Alliance, Advancing Research, Advancing Robotics Technology for Societal Impact, R-T, A-R-T-S-I. And--
Speaker 2: That was established in 2008, is that right?
Speaker 1: That sounds about right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that involved research institutions such as Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] with Ayanna Howard, Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] with Chad Jenkins, Carnegie Melon, University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] with Monica Anderson, I might be missing some, Duke University [Durham, North Carolina] with Jeff [Jeffrey] Forbes. And several HBCUs including Spelman, Hampton University, Norfolk State [University, Norfolk, Virginia], FAMU [Florida A and M University, Tallahassee, Florida], University of Arkansas Pine Bluff [Pine Bluff, Arkansas]. I think when we first started there were around eight research universities and eleven HBCUs, and they've expanded. We got a $2 million grant from National Science Foundation. We also got funding support from Motorola, Boeing, Seagate, Google, to name some of the companies. Then Spelbots [Spelman College's robotics team, Atlanta, Georgia], I wrote a grant with the National Science Foundation for Spelbots which was around $400,000 also I believe. And we also--and that was to expand our outreach nationally to support us doing outreach events in San Francisco, Oakland [California] area. We've done Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Is that when you, you took the Spelbots to Stanford [University, Stanford, California]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, no that was--
Speaker 2: Another trip?
Speaker 1: That was another trip, that was before I got the funding.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Los Angeles [California], Chicago [Illinois], Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia], and of course Atlanta [Georgia]. And then another grant that I helped us get while I was at Spelman was called the Aspire Grant, Advancing Spelman's Participation in Informatics Research and Education. And Spelman had applied for this HBCU undergraduate program grant prior to me getting there and the most recent one they tried, they didn't get. And one of the things that I saw when I was at [University of] Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] was these institutions being involved in informatics, bioinformatics, computational genomics. And they were getting, you know, millions of dollars of funding and making progress on human genome research and so forth and disease gene discovery. And I wanted to bring that to Spelman and HBCUs. And so that was one of the things that I, I recommended as one of the co-principal investigators, is we incorporate collaborative informatics research teams among different faculty which support student research, developing informatics curriculum modules that we could incorporate into existing classes as well as create new informatics based courses. Because you know, we're living in a society based on information and the, the processing, organizing, analyzing and storage of information and using it, you know in ways that can benefit people and improve processes.
Story_ID: 27602
Speaker 1: You're talking about the ARTSI [Advancing Robotics Technology for Social Impact] Alliance and then we, we're--as we're heading towards the, the you know the research grants at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, those are the research grants. One thing I wanted to say, you mentioned Stanford [University, Stanford, California]. We had got invited to do a presentation at the Institute for Gender Research at Stanford and on the way there, we--after that, while we were out there we stopped off at Google, cause Google was the company that was recruiting at Spelman. And then we also stopped off at Apple. We went to Google in the morning for breakfast and a tour, and then we went to Apple at lunch time. And my friend that had been--that had been recruiting at App-- at Spelman, his name was Scott Gilfoil. We were sitting with him and some other people from Apple and the Spelman students, and the Spelbot students. And he says to me don't look now, but here comes Steve Jobs. So Steve Jobs you know, the cofounder of Apple walked in with another guy named Johnny Ives and I was like who's Johnny Ives? Well Johnny Ives is the--was Steve Jobs' right hand man's chief industrial designer who you know created the actual design of the iPhone and the outside of it and the iMac and, and so I knew you're not supposed to go up to Steve Jobs directly and bother him. But I took kind of a, a clue from a friend of mine who wanted to get Tiger Woods' autograph one time. Instead of going up to Tiger Woods to get a autograph, he went up to his caddy and started talking to him and you know later Tiger Woods came up and he was able to get his son Tiger Woods' autograph. So I went up to Johnny Ives and said you know I, you know I love your designs and so forth. And Steve Jobs comes up to us and I introduced myself, tell him, you know from Spelman College. You know and Apple supports our robotics team. And he said do you have engineering there? I said well we have a dual engineering program with like Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] and University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]. He said can you help us hire black engineers? He said do you know how many black engineers we have at Apple? And before I could say anything, he, he said one. So and he said in his own intense way, in his own language, which I won't repeat. He said that essentially they needed to do better at hiring black engineers and if I had any ideas, send him an email at sjobs@apple.com. So you know I told my friend there and a couple friends, another lady is, she's African American woman who's now a vice president at Apple. Her name's Denise Young Smith. But they're both very supportive of what we were doing at Spelman. And especially as it relates to trying to increase diversity at Apple. So I go home, I think about it, I pray about it and I compose Steve Jobs this long email telling him what I do, why I do it, even sent him a picture of my family and, and then I talked to him about what I thought Apple needed to do from the top down, you know how they needed to get a more diverse board and so forth. And, and I told--but I started out by saying some of the things I thought they were doing. You know, some of the efforts they were doing you know at Atlanta University Center, you know Spelman, Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and so forth, Clark Atlanta [University, Atlanta, Georgia]. What they were doing at the retail stores to try to increase diversity. But I told him also what I thought they needed to do, you know as it relates to recruiting black students and you know be mindful of their situations and their families and so forth. So I--about a week later I got an email, well actually there was a call from my friend that worked there and he said something like you know, "You're not gonna believe this, but Steve Jobs loved your email and he wants you to work for Apple. And you know to help, you know get more black engineers." And so he even sent me an email that Steve Jobs had sent to their Director for Human Resources, his comments about you know what I told him Apple was doing as it relates to getting more underrepresented students. And the fact that he wanted to hire me. And so I was able to work it out so that I would take a sabbatical at Apple.
Story_ID: 27603
Speaker 1: So I met him [Steve Jobs] in 2007 I believe and then 2008 through 2009 was the sabbatical. And Apple made me the first Senior Engineering Diversity Manager and Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] allowed me to you know, work there while also maintaining what I was doing at Spelman with the Spelbots and the ARTSI Alliance. So it was a real busy year cause they--Apple let me tele--not telecommute, but let me commute. So I would travel to Apple or to other sites where they recruited at. And I worked--the first semester I worked at observing what they did and the second semester worked at recruiting from non-traditional places that they, they hadn't really recruited at, at HBCUs [historical black colleges and universities] and women's colleges. And I'm happy to say that a lot of the students that I helped get there are now full time employees, which to get, to work as a engineer at Apple is very challenging because you know I can't remember how many millions of dollars of cash they have now in the bank, you know with no debt. But essentially they can hire anyone they want to, or they have enough money to hire basically anyone they want to. And one of the things that Steve Jobs talked about was that was the limiting factor for them, and that was the key thing that they needed to do was to focus on hiring the, the best people. And I was glad that I was able to help them to hire the best people who happen to be African American.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so you, you were there from 2000, this is 2009?
Speaker 1: Two-thousand-eight [2008] to 2009--
Speaker 2: Two-thousand-eight [2008] to 2009.
Speaker 1: --I think. I'm, you know I'm getting older now.
Story_ID: 27604
Speaker 1: Now did you write your book when you were there [at Apple]?
Speaker 2: I wrote my book, my book was published in 2009.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you wrote it before you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well it was around--I can't remember how much overlapped, but I wrote it along with Ed [Edward] Gilbreath.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Alright well tell us something about the book. What, what is it--the, the--you gave us a clue with the title of the book, 'Out of the Box.'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You actually slept in a box at one time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so out of the--it's called 'Out of the Box: Building Robots, Transforming Lives.' And it was published by Moody Publishers along with the Institute for Black Family Development. And it's really the story of how I was able to overcome you know, some of life's obstacles, having a mentally ill mother and coming from a low income family. And really my journey in STEM [Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics], you know science, as well as my faith journey, my relationship with God and through Jesus Christ. But it also talks about how I started the Spelbots [Spelman College's robotics team, Atlanta, Georgia], why and about more about the students and what we achieved in that first year with the Spelbots. But 'Out of the Box' also not only did I literally come out of a box, cardboard box that I was sleeping in as a baby, but the idea of the book is to help young people to not let other people put them in a box, or keep them in a box of low expectations. Not keeping ourselves in a box of fear of failure and being able to take risks and have courage. And then not putting God in a box of limiting what God can do in a person's life.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. So how's the reception to the book been?
Speaker 2: It's, it's, it's been good. The last time I spoke publicly, I sold out all the books that I, I brought there. And I think it resonated with, with people who had considered dreams such as getting a Ph.D., lot, lot of the people came back and told me you know how they decided to pursue their Ph.D. again and, you know, pick it up. I, you know I sell personalized copies at www.andrewbwilliams.com. But I have some more ideas for books because I've been able to see you know what it takes to get kids ex--excited about science and engineering and, and I, I often get parents that ask me how they can, you know get their sons or daughters. And I, I want to be able to share more about that but I do write a blog on that website.
Story_ID: 27605
Speaker 1: You, you wrote about your, your meeting with Steve Jobs in 2011 in an article.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wrote about meeting Steve Jobs in an urbanfaith.com article. But not only meeting him but I, I, I try to keep in touch with him. And you know send him like my Christmas newsletter, family Christmas newsletter, talk to him about experience I had with FaceTime and being able to use it to stay in touch--tell my, my youngest daughter bedtime stories even while I was traveling and being able to see her at the same time. And also one of the students, Janesa Keels (ph.) had been with the Spelbots [Spelman College's robotics team, Atlanta, Georgia] and I had been her mentor since she was a freshman at Spelman and she was having--she did a three two program with Columbia University [New York, New York]. But she had been having a hard time getting a internship at Apple when in fact in 2010, Jasmine Miller and Janesa Keels, they entered the AT and T Big Mobile on Campus competition, which was to build a mobile app, and it was other college students. And they ended up winning it, the competition by doing a app called HBC Buddy. The year before a team from Harvard won, and the year, the first year a team from Stanford. And when I was at Apple, one of the things I was able to do was to get Janesa Keels training in IOS [information operating system] development for the iPhone, and then also Jasmine Miller and they went on and won this competition. But she wasn't able to get a internship, it was very competitive. And I sent Steve Jobs an email in March, the year that he passed away. And I said you know I had been praying for him and his family. And by the way I think you should hire this young lady, and this is what she's done and, and I really think she would be a great fit for Apple. And so she tells me a week later that she had gotten a phone call from Apple and the recruiter said well I got your resume from Steve Jobs. And you know we want to interview you, and she ended up getting a, a internship and now as of this past summer, she started working full time as an Apple engineer doing IOS advanced technology development, which she was the second Apple engineer from Spelman, the first one being Whitney O'Banner who was, you know, also a captain of our Spelbots team like Janesa. Another young lady, Andrea Roberson, is now in a technical role at Google. But she was at one time a captain of our Spelbots team. And one of the things that you know companies liked about the Spelbots was it kind of set up a situation which is in the real world where you're trying to tackle a complex problem, a real world problem in a team setting. And you have to develop leadership, communication skills as well as technical skills in order to, you know, solve the problem. So that, that's actually one of the things that make me even happiest about the Spelbots was because it goes back to my dream of wanting to see more African Americans in Silicon Valley and here, you know, I have some concrete you know, evidence and results with seeing African Americans, particularly young women, going to work as engineers in Silicon Valley, as well as being able to meet, you know Silicon Valley icon and, and see his--maybe not so public interest and concern for more diversity, more blacks in engineering in Silicon Valley himself.
Story_ID: 27606
Speaker 1: Well now you left Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] in 2012, right? So what, what happened? What, what, why did you leave?
Speaker 2: So, so one--the, the program manager that I had hired through my National Science Foundation Grant, Angela Church, was a Marquette [University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] alum as--and so we shared that and we had met at a Marquette alumni event called Marquette Circles in Atlanta, Georgia. And she used to work for Coca Cola. So she said well why don't you do something with Marquette? And she brought that up with John Pauly at a ethnic alumni event. And John Pauly said that he had been thinking the same thing. I don't know if she meant you know, me coming to work at Marquette, but they recruited me to, to come back to Marquette. And the reason why I considered it was because I always preached to my students you know, do things to reach your full potential. Do things that, that are going to help you grow. And then also I you know, preached to them you should really consider going to graduate school you know, become professors so that you can train the next generation. And one thing that I realized after having been at University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] in a research role, being an undergraduate institution you can do research but not on the same level as being at an institution that has a graduate program. And so Marquette wanted to make me a full professor with tenure and the John P. Rainer Distinguished Chair. They, they had a lot of other benefits, not just for me, but for my family as well as they built a brand new engineering building. And I, I foresaw a place that I can continue the same kind of passion and effort to increase diversity in the engineering field, but at a majority institution, a majority--it turns out a private Jesuit institution with a graduate school where I could bring students from like a Spelman or a Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or a Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] to come and get their Ph.D. And then go work at, you know, a [University of] Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] or a [University of] Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] or wherever, MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], or you know a Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] or a FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]. And it was going to give me the opportunity to focus on research. But one of the things that I found that it gave me such a great appreciation for undergraduate research that here at Marquette University I've had students who are helping me to build a teenage size humanoid robot from scratch. I, I've been focusing on human robot interaction and building a socially intelligent robot that can assist students who may have a disability and in particular, one of the main projects I've been working on right now is developing a humanoid health coach that will help children deal with childhood, childhood obesity by improving their nutrition choices as well as their exercise activity. And so I'm, I'm using knowledge and insights from developmental, psychology, developmental AI [artificial intelligence] and robotics and human robot interaction to, to build this new system.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this, this is all under the title of HEIR, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so the, the name of my research lab is called Humanoid Engineering and Intelligent Robotics Lab, or HEIR, H-E-I-R.
Story_ID: 27607
Speaker 1: So at Marquette [University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] now you said earlier you're working on developing a full size, yeah, teenage soccer robots now. You're developing full size ones for the--
Speaker 2: So at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] we had humanoid robots that we bought from Aldebaran Robotics and we programmed the AI [artificial intelligence] and computer vision and so forth. And they were more what they call kid size, about two feet tall. Robocup has a league for soccer, the kid size as well as teenager size, and then adult size. So what we're building at Marquette right now with undergraduates, we're building a teen size robot which is four foot tall, and we're building it from scratch. And so our students are modeling the robot using SolidWorks on the computer, and then using a 3D printer in order to printout the, the components and we're using different kinds of sensors and motors and using the robot operating system in order to, to write programs that are going to be doing the computer vision, the human robot interaction and so forth, the localization and local motion. So we're excited about that. We're, we're getting ready to do experiments with students on a human robot interaction for the humanoid health coach for childhood obesity. And so we're looking at incorporating that with wearable technology that can monitor the activity of the students, and then give adaptive advice for--personalized advice for the students on ways to improve their eating and their exercise, demonstrating exercises, doing exercise with them, doing different kind of activities and, and so we're excited about that.
Speaker 1: The United States doesn't seem to be as concerned about humanoid robots as say the Japanese are. They actually make robots that actually look like human beings, they're really doing a lot of experimentation and making a--like a face with the hair and everything and the interactions and the personal, you know, the robot's ability to read the face of a human being like a dog does to determine what it ought to do and that sort of thing. Is that, is that--well how do you feel about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, so a humanoid robot versus a android robot. A android is one that actually looks like a human, you know the skin and the features and so forth. A humanoid is a robot that roughly has the parts of a human like a head, you know arms and legs you know, a trunk, torso. So recently the United States has been more interested in having robots that can work alongside humans and perform complex tasks. And in many cases those would be you know, a humanoid. For example, when the nuclear reactor in Japan broke down and it was dangerous for humans to go in, that's when they, you know people realized it'd be nice if we had a humanoid robot that could go in there, open up doors, climb the stairs, maybe even drive the car to get there. And then once they see the problem, do some complex task under the supervision of a human maybe remotely, to fix those things. And so the United States has a National Robotics Initiative which is geared towards that. Not only for you know, search and rescue things, but like manufacturing, space exploration. A lot of people don't know right now that Robotnaut Two, which is half of a humanoid, is right now up in the International Space Station. It was built by NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]. It was built by NASA and General Motors. General Motors being interested in it because it can perform some complex tasks that are, are kind of dangerous and repetitive for humans do like in the manufacturing setting. But in the past, United States researchers have been more interested in robots that can do dangerous, dirty and dull tasks, you know like manufacturing, whatever. But--
Story_ID: 27608
Speaker 1: Maybe even the Fire Department or something could send ro--robots to put out a fire and search a building.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah. And so robots like that, they're just robots. They don't have to look like a human. Japan has taken a lead on that because of the, the aging population they have and the concern that they don't have enough young people to take care of the elderly. And so they're trying to build more realistic looking, human looking robots in order to, to complete those tasks. Me--in my new line of research, I'm very interested in humanoids that can understand intent and gestures of humans in order to react in a socially intelligent way. So, so one of the questions sometimes people ask is why, you know a humanoid robot? And it's because humans know how to interact with humans. You don't have to teach them. It's almost like if a person has an iPhone, one of the compliments people give the iPhone is it's intuitively easy to use, you know for a phone. And that's really the goal of what I want to do is I want to build an intuitively easy to interact with humanoid robot that can interact with kids in order to you know, teach them in a personalized way and help improve their health. I chose childhood obesity because obesity is, it's been a national epidemic in the United States, but now recently it's said to cause death globally more so than hunger does. And, and personally I chose obesity because my mom had diabetes and high blood pressure and obesity can result in diabetes and high blood pressure. And if you can intervene, develop an intervention for children when they're young, it's going to prolong their life and hopefully bring down the amount of cases of you know, full blown diabetes they have as adults. And one of the things that we know with our humanoid robots, you know kids are engaged by them. They tend to think they're human-like, so they interact with them and so we're looking at you know, how you know we can build these humanoid robots that can engage and communicate in a effective manner with kids to help them be healthier.
Story_ID: 27609
Speaker 1: In Japan you know they, they're trying to develop robots to fill a, a shortage in workers. You know we don't seem to have that shortage here. So is there, is there any concern about job displacement, like in Detroit [Michigan] with the robotic assembly line? You know taking over from the humans and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah so there's a company started by Rodney Brooks from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and he makes a robot called the Baxter Robot. And it's a manufacturing robot that will--that it's supposed to be able to be programmed by demonstration instead of writing computer program. And one of the things that they advertise is that instead of becoming, instead of you being the laborer, you're going to be the supervisor of this robot because you're the one that's gonna be programming it by demonstration. So that's one line of I guess, I guess one line of thought. But my, my concern and part of my passion is to get as many underrepresented students, especially African American students, who will study computer engineering, computer science, so that they can be the designers--for that matter, mechanical engineering or chemical engineering. So that they can be the designers of these robots, so they will be employed by the high tech companies that produce these robots and products by them. I, I guess I'm a, you know, a science fiction fan, but also I believe a lot of the things that hap--that we see in science fiction is going to come about. You know, Will Smith's movie 'I, Robot,' we're gonna, we're gonna have robots in every home. And we want those robots that will behave ethically and safely and that will treat everyone the same. And so we want you know, representation from all, you know, ethnic backgrounds, racial backgrounds, gender, be the ones that are designing and creating the policies, you know to make these robots safe and you know just so to speak.
Speaker 1: Now do, do, do you think that there's going to be a need in the future for people who have developed skills through gaming to control you know, motion and that sort of thing with a--you know I, I can imagine because of the drone, you know effectiveness in the U.S. Army and defense that, that people that can control, can, can remotely control something like a drone or robot to perfection would be, you know, would be able to get a good job doing it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I think you know we have a new generation that has little fear of you know, technology. And they use you know, fascinating, incredible technology every day. I mean something like the iPhone or android phone is incredible technology that could take us to the moon, you know, ten times over compared to what we used, you know back in the '60s [1960's] to get to the moon. But the concern and the message to students is don't just be a user of this you know, great technology, be a creator of it. So let your, let a person's interest in video games, like it did for me, get you involved in wanting to be able to design the next technology or the next video game that might, you know, teach math more effectively, you know or science more effectively. But yes it is true that you know, you could use some of those skills to like control a drone. But hopefully the drone is, is using yes to protect our, our country but maybe even you know, help find clean water or something like that as well.
Story_ID: 27610
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there, is there any major move that you wish you could undo or do over?
Speaker 2: No. There's no place I wish I could undo or do over. Only thing is I wish I would have tried out for the JV [junior varsity] basketball team at KU [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas] when I had the opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Likewise if you look back at everything to this point in your career, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Right now I believe my legacy is helping you know, African Americans, women achieve great things in computer science and engineering in the universe setting and in the real world, and prepare them to do great things in, in the real world. The Spelbots [Spelman College's robotics team, Atlanta, Georgia] was kind of a--was a unique program that led the way in letting young African Americans see students like themselves doing great things on an international level. But the contributions that I've made in science as it relates to my research and being a role model for others to do the same thing has been great. I mean being the first African American to get a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at University of Kansas [KU, Lawrence, Kansas] was great. We think it was the, the first African American period, you know to get a engineering Ph.D. at KU, possibly, you know American born person of African descent. You know having the first African American all women Robocup team to compete internationally and to qualify not only with the four legged robots, but the humanoid robots. And then me becoming as far as I know, the first African American Distinguished Chair at Marquette University [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] is something that, you know I'm proud of and also thank God for. And just thank God for the president, you know Father Pillars at Marquette, the provost John Pauly and the Dean of Engineering, Robert Bishop, who believed, you know in my department who believed that I could be someone who could make great contributions in research and education here at Marquette. Also very thankful for our President Beverly Daniel Tatum at Spelman. She was just a outstanding supporter for the Spelbots and, and one of the things that I'm, I'm pleased with also is that I was able to create things that are still going on, you know the ARTSI [Advancing Robotic Technology for Social Impact] Alliance is still going on, it's being kind of being morphed into a new organization for African Americans in computer science to be led by Dr. Juan Gilbert, Clemson University [Clemson, South Carolina]. And also you know the Spelbots program continue to happen. And also it's, it's spurned on other groups and organizations such as Black Girls Code run by Kimberly Bryant. And you know just the, the, the media press that we've gotten from you know, 'Ebony Magazine,' 'Jet Magazine,' 'Black Enterprise,' CNN [Cable News Network], CBS [Commercial Broadcasting System] through the Turner Studios and Spelman. A documentary has put some role models out into the media because they're, they're such a dearth of role models in the media for young African Americans to see and, and young African American ladies to see themselves doing you know, high tech kinds of science and engineering, and the benefits that come from it. You know a person with a Ph.D. you know I've been told makes, you know at least a million dollars more than someone that doesn't over the course of their lifetime. And kids need to know that there's a financial benefit. One of our students at Marquette [University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] who is going to work at a, a major computer software company, she's going to make six figures just with a bachelor's degree. And our, our young people need to know, hey, you don't have to deal drugs, you don't have to, you know, work at McDonald's. You, you, you know you don't have to be a NBA [National Basketball Association] player, you can make six figures and beyond, you can make seven figures with technology and, you know, computer science and computer engineering if you get the stock. You start a company or you get the stock from a big company like Apple and Google, you're going to be a millionaire. But it's going to take hard work, but it's worth it and, you know, here's role models and hopefully I can be a role model to show kids you know you can achieve in STEM, science, technology, engineering and math.
Story_ID: 27611
Speaker 1: Well tell us something about your family. Now you, you mentioned you got married back in 2000--
Speaker 2: '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: '9-'92 [1992] rather, '92 [1992]. And you have, you have children?
Speaker 2: Yeah. So my, my wife and I, we've been married--it will be twenty-one years this month. Anitra, she's, she's the reason for all of my accomplishments since I've been married because I tell people she's smarter than me. She always advises and counsels me, she's my, my greatest defender and support and cheerleader. And she's done a, a wonderful job raising our children. We home schooled them for about four years and she did the primary work and, and she's in graduate school now working on her Master's. And my son is computer science freshman here at Marquette [University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]. And my--John, and Adrianna is a junior at Shorewood High School, and Rosa's a eighth grader in Shorewood Middle School. And they're great students, athletes, musicians, artists, and future scientists and computer engineer, science, robotics. I think they're going to do greater things than I am.
Story_ID: 27612
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a positive role model in academia and in life. Someone who lived what he believed and shared it, shared it with others and shared what I know about success to others. And also someone that has done great things not only academia, but also in entrepreneurship which hopefully in the next phase of my life with provide a lot more jobs and economic opportunities for underrepresented and low income people.
