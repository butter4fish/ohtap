Speaker 2: Sure.  Janice Gertrude Hutchinson, J-A-N-I-C-E, G-E-R-T-R-U-D-E, H-U-T-C-H-I-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Sure, September 22, 1947.  I was born in Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: And, ma'am, what is your occupation?

Speaker 2: Today is July 26, 2008.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?  You don't have to give your address.
Speaker 2: Sure.  We are in my home.
Speaker 1: In--
Speaker 2: Oh, in Bethesda, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: We are in Bethesda, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That lends authenticity to oral history.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Story_ID: 117134
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five light-weight 'People' magazine-ish type questions that management requires me to ask of everyone.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: First one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food?  That's an interesting question.  Um--I like, I especially like fried fish and fried chicken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite--
Speaker 2: And Indian food.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Probably blue.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year....
Speaker 2: I like the fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: And, the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Acknowledge God in all thy ways and He will lead thy paths.  Lean not on thine own understanding.  And I'm paraphrasing Proverbs [3:5-6].
Story_ID: 117135
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  We'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Dorothy, D-O-R-O-T-H-Y, Gertrude, G-E-R-T-R-U-D-E--her married name was Hutchinson; her maiden name was Howell, H-O-W-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born December 20, 1911, in Paducah, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: What do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace that side of the family?
Speaker 2: That's a wonderful question.  My mother's father or grandfather on the paternal side was an immigrant man from Lithuania.  She is, there is family folklore that one of her parents or grandparents was sired by Alben Barkley, who was the Vice President of the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you said that one of her--
Speaker 2: One of her parents or grandparents was rumored to be sired by Alben Barkley, A-L-B-E-N, space, B-A-R-K-L-E-Y who was --
Speaker 1: That's what they named the Barkley Band after, Lake Barkley, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I believe so.  He was vice president.  He was from that area of Kentucky.  That's correct.  She has a brother.  She had a brother who was said to closely resemble Alben Barkley, the fellow I showed you in the picture with the cigarette in his mouth, actually; he supposedly bears a close resemblance to Alben Barkley.  Her mother has some sort of mix of Native American, I guess, and black so...
Speaker 1: Okay.  For those, for people watching this who don't know about the Barkley Band, the Barkley Band was one of the essential structures of the Tennessee Valley Authority, that...
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  The TVA.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the TVA, so it's an FDR [Franklin Delano Roosevelt]-era, you know, construction and Alben Barkley, I guess, would have been pretty past middle age when they named it for him and stuf--, you know, if he was still alive, I guess, you know, so--it gives some perspective on when he was alive.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay. So probably your mother's parents, I guess, would have been, one of her parents would have been related to Alben Barkley.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Story_ID: 117136
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that's the story.  Now, is there any other, can you go back further to the 1800s or Civil War or slavery on that side of the family?
Speaker 2: No.  No history like that on my mother's family whatsoever.  My mother [Dorothy Howell Hutchinson] was one of seven or eight children and she drove the family to Chicago [Illinois] when she was fourteen years old, when her father who was then a plantation owner in Kentucky, went into bankruptcy.  My mother was the second oldest child.  She had a twin brother, but at fourteen she drove the entire family to Chicago and she was always the family leader.
Speaker 1: This was about 1925, then I guess?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, that's right.  She was always the leader in her family.
Speaker 1: Now this is before the Great Depression and also a time that cars didn't work that well (laughter) so that was quite a journey.
Speaker 2: Well, she was thrilled with the advent of the automatic transmission.  She loved that.  She used to talk about that, but she was quite a driver.
Speaker 1: So, her father had a plantation, you said, her parents.
Speaker 2: Her parents were major landowners in the Paducah area of Kentucky.  They had acres and acres of land.
Speaker 1: Now, these are black folks, right?
Speaker 2: Well, they were black folks--the pictures I've seen show them as very light-skinned black folks, very light-skinned.  I'm not sure to what extent it was recognized that they were actually black people.  My mother, too, was very fair, and all of her siblings.  My grandparents were dead, I think, when I was born.  My grandmother, I might have overlapped her three years.  My mother was thirty-six when my twin brother and I were born.  My father was fifty-two or fifty-three, so I had much older parents, and never really knew grandparents, but the pictures show them as very, very light-skinned people, and my mother and all of her siblings are extremely fair.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you think that, I guess the talk in your family kind of suggests that maybe because you have white ancestors on your mother's side, is it suggested that they kind of protected their offspring...
Speaker 2: Yes, on my mother's side--that they protected their offspring?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in terms of property rights and such; you know, 'cuz that's often the story we hear, where if there's a white ancestor sometimes they just forget about the, you know, there's no contact.  Sometimes the white ancestor will set them up with ---
Speaker 2: Right, I had attempted to explore that some because it is an unusual story and I recognized in childhood that that was an unusual story.  It's very different from the history, the little history that I know of my father's family but, yeah, they were apparently big landowners in Kentucky.
Speaker 1: It usually takes a lot of effort for black people, people coming out of slavery to own something and being even free in Kentucky before slavery didn't guarantee you much.
Speaker 2: Right, well her father was some sort of businessman, and I don't know how they acquired all of this land, but your hypothesis might be correct.
Speaker 1: Yup, so maybe some investigation, you know, into that, at some point.
Speaker 2: I've thought about that I do have family members who have tried to explore that actually.
Story_ID: 117137
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, your mother [Dorothy Howell Hutchinson], did she talk about growing up?  She grew up on this big spread of land, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And all of a sudden there was a bankruptcy and then--
Speaker 2: Her father went into bankruptcy.  He and his brother were in business, something happened and they were suddenly in bankruptcy, lost everything and literally the family packed up all that they owned when my mother was fourteen, she and her twin brother, but she was the one who drove into Chicago [Illinois].  She had an older brother, actually, who was two years older than she, but my mother was the one who drove them to Chicago at the age of fourteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You can go directly from Paducah [Kentucky] to Chicago, I think, I guess, now I-65.  I don't know what it was then.  It'll take you right there.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did she have relatives in Chicago and all?  She drove out--
Speaker 2: No, no.  They set out to a new land and to start a new life, completely.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did they do in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Apparently, my grandfather, her father, started a grocery store from which he used to sell vegetables and the children all went to school, I guess grammar school and high school.  My mother got as far as the third year of high school.  She did not finish high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know where she attended?
Speaker 2: You know, I used to know that.  I would guess Phillips [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] or Dunbar [Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois] but I'm not sure.  She had a sister who went to Englewood [Technical Prep Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]; I recall that, but they all went to school and worked.  That's what they did.
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably Phillips High School, I would think in those days.
Speaker 2: Could've been, could've been.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what kind of work did your mother do?
Speaker 2: I think my mother basically, when she worked, she did not work in her marriage to my father until we went to, until my brother and I went away to college.  She was a full time mother and housewife.  She did, at Christmas time, she would work at the post office.  She would put in some hours, I guess in December, to make some extra money.  My father [James Hutchinson] was a Pullman porter.
Story_ID: 117138
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's go to your father then, and then we'll put 'em together.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: James, J-A-M-E-S, Joseph, J-O-S-E-P-H, Hutchinson, H-U-T-C-H-I-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I know he was born in June 1893.  I don't know the date.  I don't recall the date.
Speaker 1: So, he was considerably older than your mother.
Speaker 2: Considerably.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and--where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born somewhere in Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Had he been in Chicago [Illinois] a long time when they met?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories about your father's side of the family and about the ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: My father claimed that his father murdered a white man in Alabama and had to flee.  They fled to a place--the man took his wife and then three small children to a place called Noonan, Georgia, where he had, he eventually acquired several acres, I guess, of land and raised a family in Georgia.  He had to flee.  I guess he was going to be arrested or something.  I don't know much about that.
Speaker 1: Or worse, if he killed a white man in Alabama.
Speaker 2: While, like I said, the story is according to my father, he fled from Alabama.
Speaker 1: So, he went to Noonan, Georgia and established a--
Speaker 2: He raised a family.  I guess he basically was a farmer.  My father describes a very hard childhood.  His father sounds like a very difficult, he was a very difficult person.  He required the mother and all the children to give him whatever money they would acquire.  He used to beat the kids.  That's pretty much all I know about him.  His parents had eleven children, I think.  They had a lot of kids.
Story_ID: 117139
Speaker 1: At some point, my father [James Hutchinson] migrated to Chicago [Illinois], where he became a Pullman porter.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he knew he used to go to meetings with people like A. Philip Randolph.
Speaker 2: So he was at the beginning stages of the Sleeping Car Porters Union?
Speaker 1: That's right.  They were forming the Sleeping--the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters [BSCP], right.
Speaker 2: Do you have any stories to tell about A. Philip Randolph a little bit?
Speaker 1: Oh, he used to come home and regale us with stories of the meetings of the Brotherhood and A. Philip Randolph said this and A. Philip Randolph did that, etc etc.  We were children, though; we were little kids.  It didn't mean much to us.  I don't have any stories I can recall to share.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My father was gone probably three to four days out of the week as a Pullman porter.  He was travelling to other cities.
Speaker 2: Did he ever talk about what the work was like?
Speaker 1: He said he didn't get much rest as a Pullman porter.  He often talked about the fact that there were black doctors and lawyers who were also working as Pullman porters because they couldn't get any other work.  They really could not have a life within their professions.
Speaker 2: Somebody a couple days ago was telling me about lawyers who were Redcaps [porters] and that's when they, they went to law school despite the fact that many lawyers that they knew never could find work, even in black neighborhoods.
Speaker 1: Right.  My father said this was guaranteed income at that time.  That salary was about the best salary a black man could command.  That was considered a very good salary.
Speaker 2: Umm, yeah.  They all talk about the sleep deprivation, though.
Speaker 1: When my father was at home, he was in the bed almost the entire time.  There were times my brother and I would come home from school and we would never see him, but you must remember he was a much older man and not very active, ever, that I could recall.  In contrast to my mother who worked day and night and day all the time, she did everything in the house.  She patched the roof, she mowed the lawn.  She did everything.  We rarely saw him do anything.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Pullman porter thing was, it's a sleep deprivation type of job.  I mean, they work, the work isn't difficult from I've heard, but you can't go to sleep.
Speaker 1: Well, he said he was often sleep-deprived, but he'd be home two or three days and he'd be in the bed.  He just was not a very active person even if he was off.  He was not very active.
Speaker 2: It's interesting that, you know, as I wonder, you know, when you see him on that end of sleep, you know, and you don't see him on the other end, awake for days at a time.  It's, they all say that...they couldn't sleep.
Speaker 1: Well, we used to, a few times we travelled on his routes when he was our Pullman porter.  We travelled a great deal when I was growing up.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, how did your parents meet?  Is there a story?
Speaker 1: I have no idea.  I've asked my, I used to ask my mother that.  I was very close to my mother [Dorothy Howell Hutchinson].  She said he was just someone the family knew, her family, the Howell family knew him somehow, and she began to date him.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That age difference is not that odd, I don't think, I would guess.
Speaker 1: I don't know.  It seems like a lot.  It seems like a big gap.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So...
Speaker 1: But she told me, she did tell me that he was one of the few black men that she knew who was, you know, really about something and, you know, hard worker and that sort of thing, and I think he saw her as a younger woman who could kind of take care of him.
Story_ID: 117140
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell me about your parents' personalities and talents and dispositions, and who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I am hopeful that I take after my mother [Dorothy Howell Hutchinson] and I say that proudly and with confidence.  She was actually a much more outgoing person than I am, but she was an incredibly vivacious woman.  She was beautiful and I think I showed you a picture earlier.  She was a very pretty woman.  She and her sisters were, had some sort of a reputation on the south side of Chicago [Illinois] as three of the most beautiful black women on the south side of Chicago.  She was a wonderful cook.  People used to meet her and remarked that they had heard of her, her culinary talents both baking and cooking.  She was hard to beat in the kitchen.  I have not acquired that excellence.  She was a very gracious person.  She had a really fantastic smile.  Our house was always full of people.  She was welcoming to people.  She was always trying to help other people.  She had a big heart.  My brother and I can bring home friends from school, or there would be an occasional child whose parents were not doing well, and we could bring them home and she would welcome them.  We had a neighbor.  The man who lived across the street from us, his wife died, leaving him with nine children and he seemed completely unable to function as a single parent, and he had a son.  His youngest child was a son and it was like the kids were never bathed and really cared for.  My mother would have a son come over.  He was my brother's and my contemporary, and she would take off his dirty clothes which looked like he hadn't changed his clothes in months. I mean these clothes really needed to be burned but she would make him get into a bathtub.  She'd run bath water for him.  She'd clean him up.  She would bathe him.  If possible, she would wash his clothes.  Otherwise, she would give him some of my brother's clothes, clean fresh clothes.  She just had a tremendously big heart.  There's nothing you could ask of her that she wouldn't try to help you with.  Even though she was full time wife and mother, she slept very little.  She was always up, busy doing things, volunteering at the church, volunteering at the school; always a very selfless, totally giving, giving, giving person, very hardworking, set a great example for my brother and I.  They made us, both of my parents insisted we get up early in the morning.  We were not allowed to lay around and sleep.  They insisted that we go to church.  They insisted that we work.  We had paper routes.  We were recycling when we were five.  We used to take my brother's little red wagon around the neighborhood and collect papers and take them to the recycle place when we were little kids, and then older my mother would take us out into the Illinois countryside and we'd buy crates of eggs and go around the neighborhood and sell a dozen, two dozen of eggs, just knocking on peoples' doors.  We did that 'til we were in high school, so they (my mother especially) taught us to work.  She was always with us.  We used to come home at lunch time.  We went to Catholic schools growing up and we could come home and she'd have a hot lunch for us.  She always had dinner for us.  She was always there for us.  I had terrible earaches as a child.  She would stay up all night long, you know, taking care of me.  She got little rest.  Twice when my father [James Hutchinson] was away on the road, as he used to say, people tried to break into the house, couldn't get passed my mother.  She'd pull out the gun and she'd threaten to shoot people and they would back off.  They would leave.
Speaker 1: So, they actually got in the house and she --
Speaker 2: Well, she said one fellow, one night, had gotten a ladder.  We had a bungalow-style house and I guess you need a ladder to get up to the dining room window off of the driveway.  There was a side drive to the house back to the garage and some guy had gotten a ladder and she said his leg was coming through the window and she told him, "You come through that window any further, I'm gonna blow your leg right off."  She said the leg slowly disappeared out the window.  She could hear him, I guess, trying to come in.  You know, she's a woman.  There were two small children and she protected us and kept us safe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All the time--
Story_ID: 117141
Speaker 1: Now where did you live in Chicago [Illinois]?  What community?
Speaker 2: Morgan Park, far south side, 112th and Laflin St.
Speaker 1: Now, that's actually an old black community.  There are black folks out there for a long, long time in Morgan Park now.
Speaker 2: My father [James Hutchinson] owned the house.  He had already bought this house when they were married, when they got married.
Speaker 1: Guess that seemed like a very tight community, too.  I know people in the northern part that also know each other.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a small community. It was so far out of Chicago, though, they used to call it the country even though it was within the city limits.  It's not like you were in the suburbs.  You were in the country.  People had goats and sheep, not sheep but goats and chickens, etc running around.  You know.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I have an early childhood memory of being in a hospital in Chicago with my foot tied to the side of the bed and screaming for my mother [Dorothy Howell Hutchinson].  I must have been two or three years old and apparently I was hospitalized around that time for something.  I have early childhood memories of various sorts, but that's a really early one.
Speaker 1: That's about the earliest one?
Speaker 2: That's the earliest one that I can really think of was wailing for my parents; especially my mother.  I didn't like being left in the hospital, so that's one that particularly stands out.  I have, you know, early memories of spankings, discipline was the order in the house.  My mother was the law and the order in our house (laughter).  We had pretty strict boundaries and limits.
Speaker 1: So, your mother administered the spankings and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  She did everything.
Speaker 1: But your father, he had that, he was raised by his father and he was really rough--
Speaker 2: My father spanked me three times.  He never spanked my brother.  My father, again, had a, was a very difficult person.  My mother was outgoing and warm and welcoming and had many, many friends.  My father had hardly any friends.  He was widely regarded as a very, very difficult person.  He did not like women in some sense. He was quite the misogynist.  He did not think women should have gotten to vote and he didn't mind saying that.  Several months before he died, he told me what I had always know and that is that my brother should have gone to medical school and why wasn't I married and several kids, and it's funny, he died two or three months after he told me that.  I always knew he felt like that but that's the first time I heard him say that.  I felt he strongly favored my brother, and often would make open comments and that's the way my mother's family also perceived him.  He, I don't know the origins of his disdain for women, except I think it has something to do with his mother and her inability to protect him and the other children from his father.  I think the fact that his--he had a brother who was murdered by a woman, his daughter was murdered.  He had a daughter who was twenty-five, I think, when my brother and I were born, by previous relationship.  She was murdered by her husband.  He always said it was her fault.  I mean, this is his daughter (laughter).  She and her husband were separated and the guy had been stalking her and put six bullets into her heart one night after she had gone out on a date.  She had come home fairly early, about ten o'clock, I guess.  Her separated husband confronted her and just shot her in cold blood and my father drug me to the trial.  I had to sit there; I mean, I must have been four years old at the time.  I really didn't know what was going on, but I always that was curious that he blamed her for her, you know, for her death.  But he, I think, had a lot of demons or something that made him very difficult.  People did not like to be around him.  He was very negative, angry person.
Story_ID: 117142
Speaker 1: We always ask this question; well, before I ask that tell me about your brothers and sisters.  How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: I have one twin brother.  He's ten minutes older than I am.
Speaker 1: And that's it?
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was quick.  (laughter).  So, you were growing up, you know, with your brother simultaneously, the same age.
Speaker 2: That's right.  As I said, an older half-sister was murdered when I was younger, but my mother [Dorothy Howell Hutchinson] had a twin brother and she had two younger siblings, two years younger than she and her twin brother, who were also twins, boy/girl twins.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you say you grew up in a bungalow, a classic Chicago [Illinois] bungalow?
Speaker 2: Classic Chicago bungalow, deep back yard, side driveway, back to the garage, two car garage, big yard, cherry trees in the yard.  My brother would pick cherries and my mom would make cherry pie.  We had rabbits and chickens as pets out in the yard, you know.  The usual, I guess.
Speaker 1: We always ask this, and this may spur more than I hoped, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of the--
Speaker 2: Of the neighborhood?
Speaker 1: Growing up.
Speaker 2: Oh, well...
Speaker 1: Yeah, neighborhood and growing up.
Speaker 2: We were two of the few children on the block.  Most of the people were older people like my father [James Hutchinson], actually.  Most of them had grown children, except for the neighbor I described previously, who had children, the youngest of which was our age growing up. There were no kids on the block.  There were individual single family houses.  It was just a regular neighborhood.  At one end of the block was a man and his wife who owned one of the black-owned radio stations in the United States at that time.
Speaker 1: Who was that?  That was a--
Speaker 2: Magdalene and she was much younger than her husband.  I want to say their last name was Williams.  The wife was Magdalene; I never forgot that name.  Her husband was a much older man, but he was a prominent wealthy black guy who owned radio stations.  He owned at least one or two radio stations in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Oh...I think I know who you're talking about.
Speaker 2: He had a beautiful house...
Speaker 1: This was prior to WVON, this was prior--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: This--
Speaker 2: Yeah, definitely prior to WVON.
Speaker 1: In our interview with [HM] Carl Davis, he talked about this man that he worked for [Al Benson, WGES], the black man that owned the radio station there in Chicago [sic, Benson was a D.J.; Dr. John Dyer owned WGES].
Speaker 2: It could well be and I just can't recall the guy's name.  We saw him rarely.  We saw him occasionally.
Speaker 1: Whoever is watching this now, if they refer to Carl Davis' interview, they can find out who it is.
Speaker 2: Ummm.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was just the kind of unremarkable neighborhood rather sparsely populated.  My brother and I went to the local Catholic school from kindergarten through--
Story_ID: 117143
Speaker 1: So, what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Holy Name of Mary [School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was it?
Speaker 2: It was a few blocks from the house.  It was there in Morgan Park.  It was predominantly black, although there a few white and Asian kids there.  We were taught by nuns.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your first day of school?
Speaker 2: No.  I remember the nuns and all of their antics...
Speaker 1: So, what were they like?
Speaker 2: Oh, they were--that's a history unto itself.  I mean, you could, the nuns were allowed to spank us.  I was never spanked.  I was too terrified of the nuns, but they would get large rulers and paddles and you'd have to hold out your hand; if you were a male child, they'd pull your pants down in front of the class and put you across their knee and whop you and do things like have you stay after school and scrub the floor with a toothbrush.  They were remarkable.  It was, most of them, though, were good-hearted.  We were taught by and order of black nuns that are based here in Baltimore [Maryland].  They're still in Baltimore, the Oblate Sisters of Providence.  They teach at St. Augustine High School here in the district [Washington, D.C.], at least they used to.  They were strict, strict disciplinarians, very strict disciplinarians.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were there throughout grade school.
Speaker 2: Throughout grade school.  We were home with our mother before we started kindergarten.  We stayed at the same school through eighth grade.  Right.
Speaker 1: Did you have--were there any favorite sisters there of the teachers that you had?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I had Sister Trinita in seventh grade.  I used to be able to spiel off all of their names, but generally speaking, you know, they were well regarded and liked by all of us.  We had a kindergarten teacher we didn't like; maybe she was first grade, Sister Regina.  We thought she was overly punitive; on the other hand, she had fifty-some kids in her first grade class.  There were six sets of twins in the first grade class, so she had her hands full and they did not have teacher's aids, so law and order was the time, you know, and my mother was at school at least once a week; on general principle she was at the school at least once a week (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, was your brother always in the same class with you?
Speaker 2: Yes, all through grammar school because there was only one class per grade.  It was a small Catholic school.
Speaker 1: So they didn't divide, this order didn't divide the males and females up...
Speaker 2: No, that came in the high school years.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: We were supposed to, my brother was scheduled to go to Brother Rice [High School, Chicago, Illinois] there in Chicago, and I was supposed to go to Longwood Academy [Academy of Our Lady, Chicago, Illinois].  Last minute, my mother basically decided she wasn't ready to separate us as twins, so we went to Morgan Park High School [Chicago, Illinois], where we were deliberately separated.  We were both excellent students, and the high school was all white and they suspected that we were cheating on our exam, so they deliberately separated us throughout high school, even though we had the exact same classes throughout high school.  I don't recall that, maybe once, we both studied Latin for four years of high school, so we may have had one Latin class together, but that was it.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  Morgan Park has traditionally been one of the best high schools in Chicago, even today.
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, it was--I mean, there were twenty-some black kids in our graduating class of about 350.  It was predominantly white, heavily Jewish.  There were not many black students at all.
Speaker 1: Now, it's mostly black students but it's still considered one of the best schools.
Speaker 2: It's changed, it's transitioned, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 117144
Speaker 1: So, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I've always loved to read.  Reading for me is comforting, it's relaxing.  I had friends in books, stayed to myself a lot as a child, but I've always loved to read.  I've loved the literature.  I used to write.  At one point, I, well, I do a little more writing now.  I used to write poetry but, I guess English class where I could read, read, read was always my thing.
Speaker 1: Did you read a lot at home?
Speaker 2: Oh, all the time, all the time.  At one point, I had read every book in the, every book for kids in the Morgan Park Library.  I read constantly.  My impetus for being a doctor actually came when I was about five years old.  I had bad asthma as a child and my parents would take me to an allergist every Saturday, where I'd get two, three, four shots which I hated, but the one soothing thing for me was that she had all these little books, 'Highlights for Children,' so all the little kids would come into her office, and this was a white female physician, by the way, and we had all these books and I just loved, that part of going to the appointments I loved, because we didn't have 'Highlights for Children' at home.  We had other literature, but these were little children's books and I loved to play with them and read in them and it was just wonderful, and I remember being there one day and thinking to myself, "I'm going to be a doctor like this doctor that I had when I grow up."  My mother [Dorothy Howell Hutchinson] really liked this woman as a physician.  My mother had wanted to be a doctor, but hadn't been able to go to school because of her family circumstances, and she had become very ill as a child.  We also had a good family friend, Dr. Plumber (ph.), who was a black doctor there in Chicago, who you could walk into his office anytime he would see you and say to you to just pay him whatever you could.  He didn't have a set fee and he'd take whatever you gave him.  If you gave him two bucks, if you gave him five bucks, he was fine.  He was just, it's what a doctor should be and can be.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he's sort of a role model.
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very much so; yeah, between he and this woman doctor, this allergist I remember actually thinking when I was in her office one day this is what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna be like her.  She was a European woman, I wanna say from Germany, perhaps, but every Saturday I was there for my hated allergy shots, which never did me any good. (laughter).  I still had terrible asthma attacks.
Speaker 1: Umm.  Now, what kind of books did you read normally?  What was that?
Speaker 2: I love mysteries, Nancy Drew mysteries.  There was some other mystery writer that I liked to read.  I loved biographies.  I would read anything.  It didn't matter what it was, you know, if I'd go someplace and there were newspapers or books around, I would just pick them up and start reading them.
Speaker 1: Did you get the [Chicago] Defender at home?
Speaker 2: It wasn't delivered regularly but I would see it occasionally, not very often, occasionally.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about Jet and Ebony?
Speaker 2: Occasionally; it was not delivered to our house, but I, you know, would see them occasionally.  I can't say that I had a regular diet of them.  I certainly was aware of them.
Speaker 1: Were there any newspapers delivered to the house or magazines?
Speaker 2: I don't recall.  I know my parents always had the daily newspapers; the [Chicago] Sun Times, the Tribune, Chicago Tribune--
Story_ID: 117145
Speaker 1: What about television and radio?  Did you, were they important?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a TV in the house and in the evenings, we, my brother and I had a ton of homework.  In the Catholic school, you know, we'd have six to eight hours of homework as children, as small children, especially if the nuns were mad at the class about something we had endless homework (laughter) and you had to do it.  There was no not doing it; plus, our parents supported this ethic, so, you know, we had to do this so the TVs would often be on in the background.  My brother liked things like the 'Three Stooges' and that kind of thing.  I just thought that was ridiculous stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.
Speaker 2: Yeah, me too, that's what I thought, but no, we were able to work with TV very much as background but our mother [Dorothy Howell Hutchinson] was always with us in the evening and even when we were sitting at the table doing endless homework she was always in the room with us.  She would be reading the paper or, she was just always with us, very supportive.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about movies?  Did you go to the movies?
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.  We went to movies, usually taken by other families.  Our parents were not movie-goers.  Our parents didn't go out much.  We didn't eat out much.  We ate out rarely.  My father [James Hutchinson] hated to eat out.  My mother, fortunately, was a great cook, but my brother and I loved to go out to eat, because we never got to go out to eat when we were kids.  That was a real special treat.  I mean, these are old-fashioned black folks who eat every meal at home, so--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, fast food era didn't come along until a little later and it became really popular, I guess til about '60 [1960].
Speaker 2: Well, you know there was McDonald's around, you know.  And again, if we went out to a museum or something with friends, they would stop.  My parents never did.  Never, ever.
Story_ID: 117146
Speaker 1: Now is there any, do you have any idea of when you first discovered psychiatry as a--did you think about it as a kid at all as a possibility?
Speaker 2: No--no, no, no.  I've always loved children.  I love the world of kids.  Whenever I was around family kids or friends' kids, we would immediately bond.  I always enjoy the company of children and I think--
Speaker 1: So, being a pediatrician--was something--did you think about that?
Speaker 2: That was the first specialty that I did.  You know, it was just assumed by everyone I would do pediatrics.  I had always wanted to be a doctor, like I said, since I was five.  Actually, I was in college and one of my best friends said to me one day when I was a third-year college student, "You need to think about psychiatry, Jan.  You're a good listener."
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: That's where that idea first came from, but before that I just knew I wanted to be a medical doctor.  I wanted to take care of other people and go off and be Albert Schweitzer in some foreign land.  I read his books over and over and over again.  I was enthralled to be able to do this.  That's who I thought I would be growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay, well...now at Morgan Park were there any particular teachers there that took an interest in you or that you admired?
Speaker 2: You know, at Morgan Park, Mr. Cannia [ph.] was an older white gentleman.  All of our teachers were white actually, but he seemed particularly attracted to my brother and I.  We were very good students.  Some of the white students were not unpleasant to us when we first came, but they were somewhat rude at times, but they began to ask us to help them with their work eventually, and some, I walked into an honors class, which would be the equivalent of an AP [advanced placement] class now, and the teacher looked at me and said, "Are you sure you belong in here?".  I was the only black student.  My brother was in the other AP class, or honors class, and I said, "Yeah" and the students came to accept that my brother and I were very good students.  We were fully competent and fully able and our grades were almost always better than theirs, so they came to have respect.  We scored well on standardized exams, so some of their skepticism by the time we were second and third and certainly fourth-year students began to fall away.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you said that there was a rumor that you all were cheating or something in the school.
Speaker 2: When we first came, they tested the black students who applied and there was only my brother and one other female and myself.  All of us had gone to the same Catholic school who passed the reading exam, and they gave us another special test and they watched us carefully and said we couldn't put our heads up during the exam or they'd throw us out of the room.  And we all did extremely well and that's how we wound up in honors classes and the appropriate class assignments that we should have had.
Story_ID: 117147
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you involved in student activities?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah; very--very, very, very involved with the student newspaper, debate team, not particularly athletics.  My brother was the athlete.  I was not ever athletic.
Speaker 1: What did he play?
Speaker 2: He played, he was first string varsity football.  Football was his major sport.  I, both of us, National Honor Society, that kind of stuff, we were both of us part of, so I used to have a string of activities, list of activities, you know the Latin Club, you know, that kind of stuff, stuff you do in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you run for class office or anything?
Speaker 2: I never did.  I don't recall that I did.  My brother may have done that.  I don't recall that I did.  I just don't remember.  I don't remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, at time of graduation had you already, had you picked out a college?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I knew I wanted to go to Stanford [University, Stanford, California].  That was the school I picked.
Speaker 1: Now why Stanford, and how did, you know...'cuz you're in Chicago [Illinois].  It seemed like it'd be more natural to pick a school closer, but why Stanford?
Speaker 2: There was a female student two years ahead of me, white girl, who was going to Stanford.  She was, I think she did engineering at Stanford and I just really admired and respected this student and I looked into Stanford.  I looked into the east-coast Ivy League schools, which is where my brother went, actually.  I looked at Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Radcliffe Harvard, and as I looked at it I was told that there were roaches in the girls' dorm.  That was it for me.  I was done with that.  I have a real bug phobia, so I discarded those application papers and pursued my interest in Stanford.  My mother had told me I couldn't go that far away, though.  But the day before the application was due, we were together in the car going somewhere and she said, "Where do you really want to go?" And I said, "Well, you know, I really want to go to Stanford.  I think I can get in and--", and she said okay. She gave me the money.  I had finished the application.  We Fed-Expressed it to Stanford.  I don't know that they got it the same day or the day after the deadline or what, but I was amazed and surprised they accepted me.  My brother was accepted at Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire], and he went east, I went west.  The day we finished college, we finished on the same day within hours of each other, but we could not attend each other's graduations (laughter) because we were at opposite coasts, you know, so--
Speaker 1: What did your parents do?  How did they--
Speaker 2: My mother [Dorothy Howell Hutchinson] came to my graduation.  I don't remember what my father [James Hutchinson] did.  He either went to my brother's graduation or didn't go to either one.  I don't recall what he did exactly, but we graduated both of out teams were--then the Indians--that's not politically correct now.  Both teams have changed their name.  Dartmouth and Stanford are no longer the Indians.  They have new names.  Stanford is the Cardinals.  I don't know what Dartmouth is.
Speaker 1: I don't know about Dartmouth.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure what Dartmouth is right now.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  They'd both be Indians.
Speaker 2: They were both Indians.  We graduated, I think, within an hour or so of each other.
Story_ID: 117148
Speaker 1: Your father [James Hutchinson] would have been, what, in his mid-seventies, I guess by then.
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm. He died at eighty-two.  My mother [Dorothy Howell Hutchinson] died at fifty-nine, but my mother's family has a very strong history of GI [gastrointestinal] cancers.  She and her younger sister died of the exact disease at the exact same age.  She had two other siblings with GI cancers as well, same cell type, actually.  So, she died--my mother died my second year of medical school, which was very devastating for me, very devastating, but you know, she died when I was pretty young.  I was twenty-three and my father died at eighty-two.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, when you graduated from high school [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois] in '65 [1965], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.  That's right.
Speaker 1: And you started the fall of '65 [1965] at Stanford [University, Stanford, California].  Now, coming from Chicago [Illinois], now had you had a chance to travel much?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  We travelled.  We had been to the Seattle [Washington] Worlds' Fair [Century 21 Exposition] when I was thirteen, we had been in Montana.  We travelled every year, several times a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were well travelled.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you went to Stanford.  You weren't completely shocked or anything by anything.
Speaker 2: Well, it's a very different setting from Morgan Park and Chicago.  I was eighteen years old.  I was required to be there on my eighteenth birthday.  It was my very first plane ride.  My mother accompanied me.  My father took my brother to school around a similar time.  My mother stayed with me several days.  She cried when she left me, the usual story.  You know.  I had two roommates.  We had a three-room suite.  I mean, it was an exciting time.  I was one of twenty-three black students in a class of twelve hundred.  There were a few more black students that they did not realize were black from their pictures, but we all knew they were black (laughter).  So--it was a great time, though.  It was a great time.
Speaker 1: So, your major at Stanford was--
Speaker 2: Sociology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had the same major as my twin, actually.  We were both sociology.
Speaker 1: Why sociology?  Did you have it in your mind that you were going to be a doctor?
Speaker 2: I always knew I was going to be a doctor and I think I came within one course of finishing a biology major.  I always knew I was going to go to medical school; that was never a question.  I wound up with a sociology major because I was at the Stanford in Germany campus and I had not declared a major, and our major professor in Germany was a sociologist and I really liked the guy.  I really enjoyed his classes, so I just declared a sociology major.  I had really planned to declare an English major because I love to read books.  I just love to read books.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Stanford in Germany; what year did you--
Speaker 2: I think I was there in '67 [1967].  It was sophomore/junior year.  I was there for two quarters.  Stanford has little Stanfords around Europe, and now they have them in some other countries.  It is not an exchange program.  You actually go with seventy, eighty other students.  The professors come from Stanford.  Your language studies, though, are with native professors in the country that you're in.
Story_ID: 117149
Speaker 1: Now, what was Stanford [University, Stanford, California] like in '65 [1965], now '65 [1965] is like, I guess, the Black Power era, I guess, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, you know our class was a big deal because we were Stanford's biggest class of blacks at that time.  I think the class ahead of us had ten black students.  The class ahead of that probably had three or four.  So, we were kind of a big deal.  It was interesting, though, the white students and white people upon finding that we were--you were a black student they would always ask if you were a transfer, like from a junior college or someplace, (laughter), and were you on scholarship.  Those were the two most common questions we got, all of us.
Speaker 1: So, did you have a scholarship?
Speaker 2: I did have a scholarship.  It didn't pay for everything, forgot what portion my parents paid, but I did have a scholarship and through the beneficence of a wonderful friend and mentor named Lyle Nelson, whose daughter was one of my freshman classmates, I always had tuition scholarship the whole time I was at Stanford.  He was really a wonderful mentor and friend, he and the Nelson family, and I'm still friends with his daughter, Gayle, who lives in Portland, Oregon.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, they were from, they were at Stanford.
Speaker 2: Lyle Nelson was a vice-president at Stanford.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: He had gone there from the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and he was a kind-hearted real, true benefactor for a number of students, and he was protective of me and my efforts and I was a frequent guest in the Nelson household.  I have never shown him in his lifetime the gratitude and the respect that I should have, and I regret that.  He was just a fabulous, fabulous person and a great, great mentor to me.  He'd paved my way there at Stanford, and in many ways--certainly financially.  He was always very supportive and always saw that I had the support that I needed.  But, you know, just he and his wife and his daughters, two daughters that were just great friends to me, always.  Always, always, always.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was fortunate.
Speaker 1: And were there any particular professors that you remember that were helpful?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, yeah, Donald Kennedy was a Nobel Prize Winner.  He was a former head of the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] here in [Washington] D.C.  Wrote one of my letters of recommendation, the Dean of the Medical School wrote one of my letters of recommendation for me.  I had, again, I had great support; Dr. Scott was the sociologist, PhD Sociologist, when I was in Germany, very positive, very supportive person.  I mean, who else--there were a number of biology and chemistry professors that I had.  I can't recall any other names, though.
Speaker 1: Now, what was this, did the black students have an organization when you were there?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was a black student--it was formed while I was there, basically by the black students in the class, the class behind mine actually, I said but it incorporated all of the black students and helped to organize the black students on the campus.
Speaker 1: Were the black students close (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Some were, some weren't.  You know, we were there from all over the United States, very good students, you know, certainly competitive with the other students, no question about that.  But, there were cliques of students.  There were some students who were more "black-power-oriented."  The Black Panthers were rising at Oakland at the time.  Eldridge Cleaver, Bobby Seale, Kathleen Cleaver, came to the campus at one point to talk.  I saw Martin Luther King during the time that I was there.  I saw him maybe nine months before he died.  The auditorium was packed.  We all knew who he was.  I remembered looking at [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and listening to him, thinking, "Gee, I wonder how much longer he has to live."
Story_ID: 116678
Speaker 1: So, okay, so it's Stanford [University, Stanford, California] and--so, at one point, you have it in your mind you're going to go to medical school.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: When we finished the last tape, you were talking about Dr. [Martin Luther] King speaking on campus and some of the social things going on with the black students.
Speaker 2: That's right.  The Black Panthers would come over sometimes and, you know, they would sometimes have a presence when some of the students were mesmerized by them.  I was not.  I was probably too conservative and too Catholic, to be honest with you.  I belonged to the Newman Group there at Stanford.  That's the Catholic organization for college students.
Speaker 1: A student outreach group...
Speaker 2: Well, it was, they did a number of things as part of being there.  Most of the black students, myself included, would go to East Palo Alto [California] and tutor black kids in the, black and Latino kids in the schools there.  We did do, you know, things like that and try to provide some service in the community.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so---now--so when you applied to medical schools, did you have a proper pre-med background?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I had all the requirements.  Like I said, I had all but finished a biology major.  I basically did two majors, biology and sociology.  Oh yeah, yeah.  I was, I was--
Speaker 1: I was wondering, you know, majoring in sociology if you would have all the credits.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, absolutely.  All the chemistry, physics, biology, all of that.  Yeah, I was ready.  I was ready.
Speaker 1: So, you wound up going to the University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: To medical school, and how was that decision made?
Speaker 2: I met, I went out to winter carnival at Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire] my junior year, and my date was a guy who was going to be going to the University of Cincinnati Medical School.  It was a very unfortunate scenario and I hadn't really heard of the medical school in Cincinnati, I didn't know anyone in Cincinnati, but I decided what the heck, I'll apply.  I'll at least know someone there and I applied, had a great interview, was accepted right away.  I had full scholarships while I was at medical school.  I think I only owed two thousand dollars as an out-of-state student.  They accepted me with full scholarship.  I had enough money to live on for the year.  I arrived there at the medical school, though.  I hadn't heard from my friend for maybe seven or eight months.  This guy was my brother's classmate at Dartmouth.  I arrived in medical school, the first day I was there, and found out he had committed suicide his freshman year of medical school. I also had one other bizarre experience my first day of orientation, and that is I had almost a premonition that something deeply horrible was going to happen to me, dreadful, in medical school, and it did.  The second year my mother died, but I never forgot that I had had some premonition of terror or horror.
Speaker 1: What form did this premonition take?
Speaker 2: It's hard to explain; occasionally, like most people, I guess, you have premonitory experiences and I found out that day a relative had died in Chicago [Illinois]; my uncle's wife had died and I found out about Phil, this guy, his name was Phil Lucas, who committed suicide, but something came over me about halfway through the orientation that day, a very deep sense of dread and doom that I would be facing as a medical student.  It was very deeply, deeply disturbing to me and I came to understand later what it was about.  About a year before my mother died, I started having dreams that she was going to die, so I came to understand what that sense of doom, dread, terror was, but at the time I was mystified by it.  I hadn't felt anything like that before in my life, but I--
Speaker 1: Was she sick?
Speaker 2: Well, she eventually was sick.  She eventually was complaining of pain in her side, the cancer, she had pancreatic CA that metastasized to her liver but, at the time that I had this premonition, no, as far as I know she wasn't sick.  She probably had occult disease at the time, but as I can recall was not symptomatic at all.  She used to come visit me in medical school.
Speaker 1: Pancreatic cancer works pretty fast.
Speaker 2: It's a silent cancer.  She, I think they gave her three months to live when she was diagnosed because she had widespread metastasis and the liver was already ravaged, so it was a miracle that she lived for five months.
Story_ID: 116679
Speaker 1: But that defined, in many ways, certainly my second year of medical school and much of my medical school life was defined by her.
Speaker 2: How did your mother's death change you in medical school [University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio]?
Speaker 1: Well, it was, I actually left medical school of sorts.  I just told the dean my mother was sick and she was sick unto death, and I had all these great plans for my mother and it was clear to me they were not going to happen because she was going to be dead.  I cried for about three days after the doctor gave me the diagnosis, gave it to my brother and I together.  On the third day or so, I got myself together and I thought, you know, things are not gonna happen the way I planned.  This is the only time I have left to do anything for my mother and I better get it done now.  So, I went to the dean and I said, "Look, I have a terrible problem.  I can't continue."  He said, "Well, Jan, let's see what we can work out here" and what we worked out was that every Thursday night, my parents had given me a car as a graduation present for college.  Thursday nights I would drive back to Chicago [Illinois].  Let me start over again.  Friday mornings we always had exams.  I'd take my exams, immediately get in my car, drive to Chicago, stay with my mother all week, take care of her, cook for her, bathe her, do whatever I could for her, drive back to Cincinnati Thursday afternoon, Thursday night take my exams, Friday morning double back to Chicago.  I did that from January 'til May.  She died May 8.  That was most of my second year of medical school, and that's how I dealt with that.
Speaker 2: So, you studied while you were in Chicago?
Speaker 1: I studied what?
Speaker 2: You studied when you were in Chicago?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would have books and my classmates were wonderful.  They were wonderful to me.  They knew what was going on.  They made notes.  They gave me their notes.  Of course, I had all my books and I did the best I could and somehow, through God's good grace, that was the only way I passed those exams and was able, at the same time, to care for my mother and deal with my father, which was difficult.  That was difficult in the same household; but, you know, I was happy I had the opportunity to do that and that I had decided to go to medical school close enough to home to be able to do that.  It was, you know, about a three or four hour drive.  It wasn't that long.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: You know, I can drive, like my mother, so--
Speaker 2: That's a pretty fast drive from Cincinnati to Chicago in three to four hours--
Speaker 1: I did it in three-and-a-half hours, yeah, yeah...
Speaker 2: You're going pretty fast.
Speaker 1: I inherited that from my mother.
Speaker 2: You're moving pretty fast.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm from Dayton, so--I know that drive.
Speaker 1: Yeah, (laughter) so you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: You were moving.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, oh yeah.  Time well spent, though.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I dealt with it by when she died, I had some more difficulties with my father, who expected me to leave medical school and come and take care of him and, anyway, that, we won't go into that.  I returned to medical school and I worked like a beaver.  I was on call every other, every third night anyway, and on an off night I would sometimes moonlight doing physicals at another hospital.  I just dealt with it by working, working, working, working all the time to deal with the depression and a major deep, deep loss.  My brother was finishing an MBA [Master of Business Administration degree], and had gotten married, so, you know, we were also in touch.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did he stay out of--on the east coast or did he come back--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he stayed at Tuck [School of Business].  Tuck is the B-school of Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire].  Yeah, he stayed where he was for two years.
Story_ID: 116680
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: Okay, so-so your last--so that's your second year in medical school [University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio], and what happened the third year?
Speaker 2: Uh--y'know, rolled on through the rest of the way and, again, felt very, very, very deeply fortunate.  There were eight blacks that started in my class, four of us finished on time.  One student had to leave and the others finished a year or two later.
Speaker 1: You were saying before we started the interview that the black community of Cincinnati, that you had a lot of interaction with some of the black doctors of Cincinnati and a positive kind of experience.
Speaker 2: I did.  Well, first of all there was one black female doctor in Cincinnati who was my advisor in the med school.  We are still friends today.  We became very close when I was a medical student through residency, but the other black doctors were not very hospitable to me as a black female.  They often referred to all of us as the "guys."  They didn't seem to want to acknowledge there was a woman.  They would say things like women take up the place of men in medical school, so I can't say they were exactly in my corner.  Every time I saw one of them, they reminded me that I was superfluously there.  They would tell us things that, when they went to medical school, and of course they all went to Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], because those were the only places that accepted black students in their generation.  That's where you went if you wanted to go to medical school and you were black.  They used to talk about basically how much smarter they were than we could possibly be in our cohort of blacks (laughter) so, you know, it was a challenging time, you know, but we all tolerated that and we were great friends to each other and we were supportive to each other.  I felt a lot of support among my black and most of my white classmates as well, you know, so, we bonded.  There were only five women in the class.  We didn't bond very much at all (laughter).  I think we got together once in four years and we had dinner together, and I think that's when we were junior medical students.
Speaker 1: Why do you think the women didn't bond together that much?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  We were all single except for one of us, who had a very supportive husband.  I think we were just so overwhelmed with work.  Medical school is not an intensity of intellect, I don't think.  I think it's an intensity of time.  It really takes up all of your time and we just didn't have time to socialize.  That's the only thing I could think, but we didn't have any animosity towards each other.
Speaker 1: So, medical school is not conducive to study groups like law school, etc.
Speaker 2: We all had study groups.  We had dissecting anatomy groups and there were four students to an anatomy group, four students to an autopsy group, and each of us, I don't think any of us was ever with another woman.  We were always with three guys.  So that was our circle.  That was our circle for study.  That was our circle for breaks.  I mean, that was our circle, whether the guys were married or single.  We were together, you know.
Speaker 1: So, do you think that either consciously or unconsciously the women were trying to--uh, 'cuz this happens to black folks at a work place sometimes.  They avoid congregating with one another to appear like they're, you know--
Speaker 2: The black students were close.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The eight black students and then, you know, like I said some of us had some trouble.  The attrition from white medical schools is high for black students, you know, for a lot of reasons.  But, we were always the black students as a group and I was usually the black female, but we were close all the time, but somehow the few of us who were female in the class, the five of us who were female in the class of 120.  I mean, we were friendly when we saw each other, we spoke.  We, I'm not in touch with any of them.  I'm in touch with both black and white classmates from med school who are guys, but not in touch with any of the females at all.  I have no idea what happened to any of them.
Story_ID: 116681
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, anything happen before graduation that--was there ever a time when you thought you weren't gonna make it or wanted to stop?
Speaker 2: My mother's [Dorothy Howell Hutchinson's] death was a great challenge.  It was a deep challenge, both in medical school and in life.  It was a very profound challenge, but I, my senior year, I went to Liberia and worked at JFK Hospital [John F. Kennedy Medical Center] in Monrovia [Liberia], and I also worked what's called upcountry at a hospital called Phebe [Hospital, Bong County, Liberia]; you know, when you're in those situations where there are few medical resources you do everything.  I fainted my first day on the wards, on the pediatric ward in Liberia.  We were rounding on a hundred kids.  About halfway through kid number fifty or so, I just hit the floor.  I think I was just dehydrated.  The same thing happened when I went to work in Thailand in a refugee camp.  I fainted my first day in camp.  I think I was just dehydrated.  I don't seem to tolerate heat very well.  I guess I just don't keep up with the fluids well enough, but anyway.  So, I was in Liberia for a couple months or so, starting my Albert Schweitzer international healthcare work.
Speaker 1: What was Liberia like?  Did you have any conception of what it would be like in Liberia or in Africa, period, that you--
Speaker 2: Not really, no, no.  [President William R.] Tolbert [Jr.] was still in office.  He died shortly thereafter.  He was overthrown.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was murdered--
Speaker 2: He was murdered viciously.
Speaker 1: Publicly and viciously, yeah.
Speaker 2: I made friends with a family there, the Stewarts, with whom I'm still friendly and close and going to the wedding of one of their grandchildren in a couple of weeks down in North Carolina.  I met a number of doctors there who trained in the United States, guys who were surgeons, I came to appreciate the United States and all of the benefits and the wonders of our life.  I was stunned by Africa, though.  I've never, ever been any place that beautiful.  When I was in Europe, and I was in Europe for six months as a student, I visited twelve countries including Hungary and Czechoslovakia, all of the Scandinavian countries.  I never saw anything like what I saw in Africa, still haven't.
Speaker 1: You mean Liberia itself?
Speaker 2: In Liberia; well, in every African country I've been to since, but, I mean it was just stunning.  I mean, it was breathtaking.  I didn't, I mean, I can remember thinking to myself this must be the world as God first made it.  That's how it hit me.  I was going, we had a bus ride into a village that had a doctor once a month and I was going with a pharmacist on a big bus with some volunteers and we were going to provide the monthly medical services to pregnant women and sick children, and old men and I saw diseases, typhoid fever, malaria, things I've never seen in the United States, leprosy.  At one point, I was little concerned I was going to come back and develop leprosy, but you're the doctor, (laughter) that's a chance you take, you know.  It goes with the territory.  But, it was a fabulous, fabulous experience.  I learned to eat Liberian food; what they called chop, African chop, highly spiced food, saw hundreds of kids a day, had babies die in my hands and my arms, had interpreters, of course.  It was a challenge; in some ways, very stressful, very stressful, but a tremendous, tremendous experience.  So, that was my senior year of medical school.
Story_ID: 116682
Speaker 1: I matched.  I got my first choice in the match for a hospital.  I matched at Montefiore Hospital [Albert Einstein College of Medicine Montefiore Medical Center] in New York [New York], although I had interviewed at Boston Children's [Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts], which was the premier children's hospital at that time.  I ranked them second.  I ranked Montefiore first, because one of my best friends, and she's still one of my best friends, was a pediatrics resident at Montefiore.  She is, Marsha Yeargin [Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp] is the first black female at Emory's Medical School.  She is a world authority on autism, and I was maid of honor at her wedding and I am her son's godmother, but I decided to go where at least I knew someone for the rigors of residency, and I waffled a little bit about whether or not I should start on pediatrics or start off with the psychiatry thing, but I came down on the side of pediatrics and that's what I--
Speaker 2: So, you studied psychiatry in medical school as well as--
Speaker 1: Well, in medical school you're exposed to all the disciplines.
Speaker 2: All the disciplines--okay.
Speaker 1: You're exposed to everything, yeah.
Speaker 2: I didn't know how that worked, if you, you know.  I thought that psychiatry was a specialty that you, you're exposed to all of them in general and then you pursue them.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you decide before the match.  You have to decide on a specialty area and, you know, you rank order your hospitals and cities, or whatever, where you want to train in that specialty.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So, it was between pediatrics and psychiatry, and you chose--
Speaker 1: I chose to start off in pediatrics.  New York was also very stressful.  I was still very much grieving the loss of my mother.  I was not used to, I'm not sure how to say this.  The Einstein-Montefiore system was a great challenge.  They, too, were not happy to see black residents but, I mean, you know this is the world that we live in and these are the challenges we face, so I did my work.  I did my work, you know, and got through it.  I decided after the first year, though, I would go try psychiatry.  I did a year's psychiatry back in Cincinnati and then decided the first line to a child is really the pediatrician.  Many kids are never gonna get to see the child psychiatrist, so I went back to Chicago [Illinois] at that point to Rush [University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois] and finished my pediatrics residency.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then, got a master's in public health at the University of Illinois [Chicago, Illinois], 'cuz I was always interested in public service.  I was never interested in a private practice at all; never, ever.
Speaker 2: Okay, so a residency is where you actually practice.
Speaker 1: You learn, you learn your discipline.  You basically just learn the fundamentals of your discipline, because I'm gonna tell you it takes you many years to really gain quality expertise as a physician.  It takes a long time, 'cuz everybody's different and medicine is changing so rapidly.
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: You know, it's really hard.
Story_ID: 116683
Speaker 1: How has, say, pediatrics changed since you were in school?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's changed remarkably.  The medications have changed, how we regard certain illnesses has changed.  We don't look at a red ear, for example, the same way that we used to and infectious diseases has changed a great deal.  There are many new treatments for children that were not available, or that have changed; I should say have changed.  Pediatrics is really a lot of child psychiatry, so they have now developed a new subspecialty called behavioral pediatrics, because so much of pediatrics is child psychiatry, and a number of pediatricians actually go on to study child psychiatry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, how did they mesh together?
Speaker 2: Well, the mental and physical, mental what we call psychiatric and physical medicine have a great overlay in general.  There is new evidence now that probably most diseases, many diseases, be they mental or physical, have their origins in childhood, probably have their origins in your genetic makeup.  There is some evidence that you can, there are some clues as to whether or not you might have Alzheimer's [Disease], even in your teenage years, okay?  You know, what can I say, physical and mental medicine are much more entwined than people like to acknowledge or even suspected.  With the advances in neuroimaging and genetics, we know much more about diseases than we used to.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your ideas and your behavior, your personality, may all be linked to your physical, your state of physical health or disposition at a certain point.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, all of that.  It was in the seventeenth century that the first doctor who identified sugar in the urine said he thought that it was caused by depression.  In this day and age, we have new fascinating evidence that depression may well lead to diabetes.  If you are depressed, you are twice as likely than a non-depressed person to develop diabetes.  There is an association with schizophrenia, between schizophrenia and obesity.  There is an association between depression, major association between depression and cardiac disease, so there are all of these relationships that are just now being really clarified, that have probably been there all along.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it's really fascinating stuff.
Story_ID: 116684
Speaker 1: All right.  So, you're back in Chicago [Illinois] at Rush [University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois] as a resident, was it in psychiatry or--
Speaker 2: I finished pediatrics in Chicago, eventually wound up I was adjunct faculty in Rush Medical School [Rush Medical College, Chicago, Illinois].  I used to sit on the admissions committee there.
Speaker 1: So this is the early '80s [1980s] now?
Speaker 2: '80s [1980s] yes, yeah.  I worked the AMA [American Medical Association] for a while, for about four years at their Public Health Division.  I worked in the Commissioned Corps of the [United States] Public Health Service for about four years.  During that time, I have accumulated a lot of leave.  I went to work in a refugee camp about an hour-and-a-half outside of Bangkok [Thailand] with Cambodian and Laotian and Vietnamese refugees.  I had a team of six medical students and two residents and we took care--we saw a hundred kids a day, at least.  I had interpreters from all these other nationalities and I came to appreciate better why people have trouble differentiating black people, because I was unable to differentiate Cambodians from Laotians from Vietnamese and I was told that they were obviously different, so that was a good experience for me to, you know, step into another culture and to understand where some other people are coming from.  Just like when I was in Africa, I, the first time in my life, had second degree burns on my face from exposure to the sun.  I never could understand why white people were so upset about sunburn and used all this sunblock.  I spent thirty minutes in the sun with some African kids on a basketball court and the next morning I had blisters everywhere and it was incredibly painful, and I never, ever said I didn't understand about sunburn again.  So, I was able to cross cultures in some ways.
Story_ID: 116685
Speaker 1: Now, how long were you in Thailand?
Speaker 2: Only about a little less than two months I was in Thailand.
Speaker 1: This was about 1981 or so?
Speaker 2: It might have been a little later.  It was before, let me think about this actually, '81, '82, [1981, 1982], I'm not sure, early '80s [1980s].  I was gonna say before 1985.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure exactly when though.
Speaker 1: But when you came back, you came back to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes I did.
Speaker 1: And where did you work in Chicago?
Speaker 2: At the time I went I was leaving the [U.S. Public Health Service] Commissioned Corps, so I must have been going to work at the AMA [American Medical Association] and starting a part time child psychiatry fellowship program at the University of Illinois [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, you kind of summarized what you were doing at AMA, but tell us about that again.
Speaker 2: I was basically a public health doctor, worked on a lot of child abuse issues, teenage pregnancies, helped produce a book on good touching versus bad touching in children.  I edited a book like that.  You know, I had numbers of meetings and planning organizations and things around public health issues, particularly as they related to children and teenagers.  I developed an interest in HIV when the antibody was first discovered in '82 [1982].  I used to tell everybody who would listen that it was going to be devastating to kids because kids don't have immune systems.  I was always interested in HIV, so I did some HIV work at the AMA as well.
Speaker 1: You say that children's immune systems are not developed enough to be able to handle that.
Speaker 2: Well, when you're born you really don't have an immune system.  All you have are the antibodies that your mother has given you.  The blood that is flowing through your body when you are first born is your mother's blood.  That's why when you transfuse an infant, you transfuse the mother's blood because that's what has been flowing through the fetus.
Speaker 1: Does it change over time?
Speaker 2: There are some changes.
Speaker 1: Or could you always get a transfusion from your mother?
Speaker 2: Initially, you can get a transfusion of cord blood or of the mother's blood.  There are changes that occur along the way that might make that more complicated.  The antibodies that you have, you have no antibodies of your own.  The antibodies that you have when you're born are all from your mother, but after a while, they begin to wane and so you start getting immunizations to help supply you with some defenses to diseases, and eventually your body begins, in the first week of life even, begins to start making antibodies and there is a development of other cells that are there to fight disease and, eventually, by the time you're a teenager, you gain some immunologic parity with adults.
Story_ID: 116686
Speaker 1: So your job at AMA [American Medical Association] was basically research and--
Speaker 2: Well, it was a lot of education, a lot of preventive medicine.  I also took patient calls, patients would call with questions about diseases and other problems.  I worked with other doctors on specific projects, like the one I just described, safe touching, developing guidelines for treating kids who are abused, who are sexually abused, worked on teenage pregnancy prevention programs with other organizations, set up conference, helped to set up a major HIV conference.
Speaker 1: HIV was--that was pretty much new in the '80s [1980s], and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the AMA did its first major HIV conference in 1985, I think, '85, '85 [1985, 1986], something like that.
Speaker 1: And there is a lot of mythology about what it was and how you could catch it and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: That's right, but we were working to, I was one of the first and few black doctors at the AMA at that time.  I think I was called a senior scientist.  I think I was the only black doctor at the AMA, actually.  That was another kind of challenge, but, you know, that's just life, so--
Speaker 1: Now, did you think at that time that it was really gonna hit the black community hard when --
Speaker 2: I was more focused on what it was gonna do to kids.  I thought it was gonna devastate the child and adolescent population.  No, I did not think of it particularly in the context of black people at all.  I knew that, I understood that it went beyond gay men, I was clear about that, but I was not expecting it to devastate black people the way that it has.  No, I expected it to devastate child populations the way that it has.  This city, Washington, D.C., has the highest incidents of HIV infection among adolescents, for example; very high incidents.  Also, very high incidents in the prison populations, prison populations in general, I might add. That's another very vulnerable group.
Speaker 1: Probably drugs and probably an increase in homosexual activity, too.
Speaker 2: Drugs and selling sex for drugs, all of that, all of that.  You know, people just living outside of societal norms, you know, maybe disenfranchised, lonely, desperate people.
Story_ID: 116687
Speaker 1: Okay. So, I guess the '80s [1980s], what was it, '86 [1986] that you moved to D.C., to Washington?
Speaker 2: Around there, something like that.  I moved here to finish a, I finished a child psychiatry, I finished my psychiatry training at St. Elizabeth's [Hospital, Washington, D.C.] one year, and that made me board eligible in adult and child psychiatry, and I subsequently got boarded in both of those in addition to pediatrics boards.  I eventually became, after a couple of years out of residency, I became medical director and Administrator for Children's Mental Health Services here in the District [District of Columbia Department of Mental Health].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that's, now tell us about that.  Now what--
Speaker 2: Huge challenge.  Very dysfunctional system, no resources.  A lot of contentiousness among agencies and among personalities, so [Washington] D.C. is a place where everybody considers themselves an Indian chief, so you have a lot of big egos, and that created numerous problems.  It was a time of [HM] Marion Barry as mayor, and there were problems there.
Speaker 1: For instance, give us an example of how this Indian chief mentality would impair, you know--
Speaker 2: It was very--for example, we established several of the people I worked with, established really creative and innovative programs, special program for homeless children, for example, a special mobile crisis outreach with the police was established by a black female psychologist here.  I helped.  I said, "I'll take this job if you let us start, officially start a school-based mental health clinic."  All of these programs, Juvenile Intervention Program, for kids who have committed one or two offenses.  Once there was a change politically, none of these programs were funded because they were not that person--they were not that mayor's programs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So for instance, when, Barry was in office when you got here.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then when he met his crisis in '91 [1991], I guess it was, and--
Speaker 2: Well, these programs were largely developed and maintained when Sharon Pratt Kelly [HM Sharon Pratt] was in office.  When Mr. Barry came back into office [1995], many of these programs were dismantled and no longer supported.  They evaporated, and then the mood of the [U.S.] Congress towards Mr. Barry became very negative, so there were really no resources.  There was greater infighting.  Agency heads couldn't agree on anything.  It was just a terrible climate for which the population suffered the most; the people whose services we were supposed to be providing were the real losers in all of this; so, these programs collapsed and I eventually left when it became clear to me that I didn't think there was anything else I could do to make a difference at that level.  And, I was willing to allow, you know, pave the way for another person to come with better ideas, fresher ideas, maybe a different personality to make some things happen.  The feedback I've gotten is that that did not happen, that has not happened.  It still has not happened and so the system is still largely, in terms of services that are to mental health, medical services, services to the poor and indigent, are still very inadequate, and that's extremely unfortunate.  I think people want to do the right thing.  They want to do really good things, but sometimes that's more complex than it should be.  I think Congress is now paving the way to provide the support that's necessary to make some things happen and that's a good thing, you know, so the District is able to pay some people what they really deserve and provide also, the budgetary and the administrative support that's necessary.  When I came into the District system, you could not fire a person because of unions and these other kind of things.  Now, you can terminate people.  You can hire good people, and all of those things, you know, make a big difference, a different level of support from the city council [Council of the District of Columbia], so hopefully some things will get done.
Story_ID: 116688
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what are some of the--well I think we all know that there is too much violence amongst youth, and that's an issue that's been approached a number of different ways.  These seem to be increasing; you know, increase a level of violence amongst youth, teachers complained that they can't, it's hard to maintain order in the classroom as part of the violent behavior here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's terrible.  You know, I can't tell if parents are just disenfranchised or depressed, or absorbed in their own lives.  I don't know.  Many parents don't seem to understand, though, that without their support and participation it becomes almost impossible to raise their child.  That's an unbelievable challenge.  I talked to a parent of a child recently, whose school was written up in the 'Washington Post' as being an awful school, awful practices, no support for the teachers.  Kids are walking in and out of class and a parent was complaining to me that the principal wasn't doing enough about these things, and I said to the parent, "What are you doing about these things?  This is your child and you're sitting right here."  He's walking in and out of class, and that's just what the child said that they were doing, not listening, not doing work, you know, so unfortunately we were lost with externalizing problems and not owning enough of a problem ourselves to find a solution.  We were looking around, you know, (laughter) for other answers and--
Speaker 1: I know, there has been increasing use of drugs to control youth behavior, hyperactivity, for one, and I know in my own family at one time I was surprised to find my nieces and nephews taking, what is it--
Speaker 2: Ritalin.
Speaker 1: Ritalin, yeah.  I didn't--I, you know.  I have two children.  I never had that problem but I don't know what--they're all taking Ritalin.  So, is that--they have concerned parents that are actually around, but I hear there's some widespread use of that to control behavior.
Speaker 2: Umm-hmmm.  I think ADHD [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder] is what you are alluding to.  It unfortunately has become a catch-all diagnosis and there are things diagnosed as ADHD that are not ADHD, but are some other major problem, which need to be addressed in a different kind of way.  And, at the same time there are kids with ADHD who are not treated.  I have a friend, as a matter of fact here, whose son was diagnosed and this friend refused to have her child medicated, and he has had a long and rocky road, because he has been so out of control.  When that is a proper diagnosis and now, again, we have neuroimaging and gene studies to show that it is a real diagnosis, that there are brain abnormalities which can be treated with medication.  If that is the correct diagnosis the medicine can be incredibly useful.  Kids with ADHD untreated are more likely to fail a grade, much more likely to fail a grade, are much more likely to use drugs, are much more likely to smoke cigarettes before other kids because cigarettes are actually calming and relaxing, and they slow a person down actually, and they help, cigarettes help you to focus your attention, all of the things that you're treating with simulant medication.  So, we know much more--
Speaker 1: So, nicotine will fix that and move it--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Again, the research is there.  The nicotine receptors are affected by cigarette smoking, yup.  So, if you're an untreated person, or an untreated child with ADHD, you're much more likely to smoke cigarettes, use drugs, have car accidents, I can go on and on and on, with your vulnerabilities.  Can't keep a job, can't keep a marriage, can't keep a relationship.  There are just many, many problems.
Story_ID: 116689
Speaker 1: Is there any--now, is this--it seems like there are so many people diagnosed like that [ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)] now.  Have those people always been with us and just weren't diagnosed, or--
Speaker 2: Well certainly, I think as we were growing up there were many people undiagnosed, but honestly there's a tremendous stigma against mental illness.  You know, people would rather have cancer or diabetes or something else than have a bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, or one of these other disorders.  The head of a major autism association said on national TV the other day that people don't understand that autism is not a mental disorder, it's a medical disorder.  I thought to myself, oh my goodness!  Mental disorders are medical disorders.  There are gene abnormalities.  There are brain deficits which are demonstrable.  These are illnesses of the physical body that emanate many times from one's gene pool, certainly it appears as though the environment turns on certain genes under certain stressors, that's true, but we are, all of these illnesses, be they medical or mental, are, I mean all illnesses, whether they're physical or psychiatric, are medical illnesses.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is in contrast to the way people used to think about psychological problems or mental problems.  I think in the past it was assumed, I mean, just, maybe ten, fifteen years ago, almost exclusively, if you had a mental problem you needed somebody to talk to.
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Straighten you out, you know.  Rather than--long time.  Go over your history and Freudian psychology, that's the thing you talk to and find out, hey, what's buggin' you, and unravel there--
Speaker 2: And I think that there are certain situational kinds of problems that are not mental illnesses for whom some talk therapy is just fine.
Speaker 1: Ummm.  But there are some illnesses where it doesn't matter who talks to you--
Speaker 2: There are many illnesses (laughter) that are beyond the conversation.
Speaker 1: It's like you can't talk someone out of cancer or something, you can't talk them out of kidney disease.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  That's the level of mental illness that we're talking about at this time.  That's exactly the level at which we are talking.  You know, if you have a problem with mania or you are having a problem with psychosis or you are seeing things and hearing things and your reality is something other than our reality, then you are likely to be causing a whole lot of problems out here.
Speaker 1: Nobody is going to talk to you, I mean out of--
Speaker 2: You don't talk people out of hallucinations.  You don't talk people out of deep suicidal depressions, not usually, not usually.  You know, these are more complex problems than people have been willing to acknowledge, which makes the work of the psychiatrist who is a medical doctor much more difficult and much more challenging and, again, we're back to the stigma of mental illness, so people don't get the help that they need because they're fearful of being labeled "crazy", you know, and again for many people that's worse than the diabetic condition or cancerous condition.
Speaker 1: Now both of the disciplines that you focus on, pediatrics and psychiatry, kind of come together when we start talking about when does schizophrenia and bipolar disorder begin.  I mean, we were discussing that before--
Speaker 2: You know, it's interesting.  There are studies of kids of people with schizophrenia who were taped in childhood and if you look at these tapes of these people in childhood, you could see that they are different from the other kids.  Now, obviously all children are different in some ways and one child is more hyperactive, one child is more impulsive; I mean, you know, the nuances of personality are all there in childhood, but these kids have marked differences in relatedness and have many more problems in childhood, for which they are oftentimes consequence.  For example, kids with bipolar illnesses are often kids who wind up with high suspension rates.  Kids with ADHD untreated have high suspension rates, usually for fighting, for being inappropriate in some way in the classroom, not being able to build relationships that support the work of a child.  When you can't function in your environment you have a problem.  When you cannot function on a day-to-day basis, you can't hold a job, most of the people you see out here on the streets who are homeless, a very high percentage of studies show, have a mental illness.  Most of us want to have food, clothing, and shelter (laughter) on a discrete regular basis.  When you're out there in the streets living on a sidewalk or on a bench someplace, it would suggest that there's something not quite right mentally, you know, not that you're a lazy shiftless person which is oftentimes how people of this persuasion are regarded.
Speaker 1: Yeah, people see, or the person doesn't have enough motivation.
Speaker 2: Well, amotivation is part of a schizophrenia.  It can be one of the manifestations.  I believe people just can't work.  They don't have the ability to get out of bed, go to a job; I mean, we're talking about what we call executive planning of the ability to execute activities of daily living, all of which lives up here in your frontal lobe.  So, if you have dysfunctional or nonfunctional frontal lobe, you cannot think and plan and execute the routine activities of the day.  It doesn't work like that.

Speaker 1: Okay.  How would manic-well, bipolar disorder manifest itself as a, in a young person?
Speaker 2: Well, for example, in the book that I've co-authored [Cassandra Joubert, Linda Thompson Adams, and Jan Hutchinson, 'Losing Control: Loving a Black Child with Bipolar Disorder' (Advantage Media Group, 2008)], the lead author, Dr. [Cassandra] Joubert, talks about a progression with her young daughter.  Like many children with this illness, her daughter was extremely hyperactive, inattentive, had sleep problems early on, was diagnosed as ADHD [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder] and was treated with stimulant medication, which actually helped her in the classroom.  Many of these kids also do have ADHD, but later on when she was ten or eleven, she started inviting her little male classmates over to the house to have sex.  That's not normal behavior for a ten or eleven-year-old girl, and thought nothing of it.  This child was raised in this very middle class, protected household.  By the time she was twelve or thirteen, she was thinking of killing herself.  She was having suicidal ideation and, at some point, had attempted to stab a teacher.  She began to attack her mother.  She began to engage in behaviors that were dangerous and risky.  So, there was an unfolding and unraveling over the years of symptoms we associate with bipolar disorder.  She was not diagnosed until she was around fifteen or so, and even then she was on her way to jail because of some infraction that she had incurred at school and when someone thought, well wait a minute, maybe we need to have a doctor see her.  Maybe this is a mental problem and not a "bad kid" problem, and she was diagnosed on a psychiatric inpatient unit as bipolar, and from that point forward, she was treated with complexities and varieties of treatments that exist for bipolar illness that include some medication; however, again because of our gene makeup, we are more responsive to some medicines than to others so she's twenty-one now and has just had a medication combination that seems to be maintaining her over some time, so that she was able to finish high school.  She is now able to work, I think, twenty-three hours a week.  She has dropped her use of drugs.  It's interesting people with bipolar illness have a very high incidence of the use of street drugs for reasons we don't quite understand although there are many theories about that.  She's in probationary status now, but she actually has more of a life like other people than she's been able to have and that's because there's been some juggling and increasing and decreasing of medication.  She has an extraordinary mother, who was as therapeutic as any other intervention possible, as far as I'm concerned, and she has other supports now once people know her diagnosis.  She's, she was put in special schooling and she has a whole different kind of support system done that is now allowing her to function at the level that she confronted, which may not seem huge to us; you know, no drugs, (unclear) drugs, working twenty-three hours a week, but this is a big accomplishment.  This just makes her much more functional.  She can have a day-to-day life that the rest of us take for granted, you know.  She's able to work and maybe she will eventually get back to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were discussing the young lady who's featured in a book that you coauthored.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in a book I just coauthored called, 'Losing Control:  Raising a Black Bipolar Child' [sic, 'Losing Control: Loving a Black Child with Bipolar Disorder'].  The lead author is Cassandra Joubert.  I have, am the author of the medical section of the book and Linda Thompson Adams writes the section on policy, health policy.
Speaker 1: Are there any particular cultural, I guess, things that are manifested that make raising a black bipolar child different from raising a white one?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting question.  There are health disparities in mental illness as well as in physical medicine, so if you are a black person and you go to the emergency room with one of these kinds of mental issues, you are more likely to be misdiagnosed, you are more likely to receive high doses of medication, you are more likely to be diagnosed with a psychotic or behavioral disorder, especially if you are a child, as opposed to what we call a depressive affective disorder [mood disorder/affective disorder].  You are more likely to be diagnosed with one of these other things.  So, anyway, that's a, that's a real problem, that's an issue.  So, I think the issue among people of color is one we seem to have a heavier burden of stigma that prevents us from being diagnosed as soon as we should be as with every other disease, almost.  We don't quite seem to get to the doctor, and then we don't really accept the treatment.
Story_ID: 116691
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let's just catch up with your career now.  We had you in Washington, D.C., I guess in '86 [1986], at St. Elizabeth's [Hospital], I think...
Speaker 1: For one year, yeah.
Speaker 2: For one year...okay.  Then what did you do?
Speaker 1: Uh, I worked for the District [of Columbia Department of Mental Health] a couple of years and after a couple of years, became Medical Director of Children's Mental Health Services and then I also became...
Speaker 2: Now, that's when you were incurring political problems with trying to get programs...
Speaker 1: Well, once I moved into more administrative things, medical director, and administrator for children's mental health, yeah, there's a lot of politics involved and challenges to get services out to people, out to the kids and their families.  That was a great challenge, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, you teach now.  I know you probably started teaching a while ago, but you're currently teaching at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 1: I teach, do some research, run the psychiatry residency training program.  That means I'm responsible for the education of new doctors, the programmatic things that go into building new psychiatrists.
Speaker 2: At Howard Medical School?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My position exists in every other medical school and some medical centers as well, where I'm responsible for the training and education of new doctors and new discipline.  Every discipline has a program director, you know.
Speaker 2: Now, you've written how many books now?
Speaker 1: Hah, I've written some--
Speaker 2: A lot of them were coauthored, right?
Speaker 1: I've written a number of chapters, chapters on battered women.  I used to work in a battered women's shelter, volunteer there, and I've written some things about that and that experience for women of color, especially.  I've written, obviously, for medical journals about violence in kids.  I've written about crack, exposure to crack in utero, I've written about problems of impulsivity and aggression in kids, I've written about suicide in African Americans.
Speaker 2: Now, that's something that was on the rise.  I don't know if it's leveled off, but at one time we rarely heard of African Americans committing suicide at any age.  I don't know if it was going on, but we--I never heard about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then, it seems like in the late '80s [1980s], early '90s [1990s], there was a rash of teen suicide, adolescent suicide.
Speaker 1: There has been a surge in adolescent suicide, especially among African-American adolescent males.  Males in general commit suicide three times as often as females, although females attempt suicide up to eight times as more often than males, but men tend to use more lethal methods to kill themselves than do females.  A female is more likely to overdose, which is more often a recoverable event.  So, yeah, again, trying to address issues that are not so common, not so common to recognize these issues among people of color.  People of color are more likely to kill each other, so I think we have ways of hurting ourselves, proportionately higher incidents of substance abuse, although among the kids, white, suburban and rural kids have a much higher incidence of substance abuse than do black kids in the cities.  Most people don't realize that.  So, these are some of the issues at hand.  One of the--
Story_ID: 116692
Speaker 1: So let me just say-pause on that for a minute--black youth, then, I guess, tend to be more involved in the drug trade as a criminal activity rather than as an abuser of a drug.
Speaker 2: That's right.  We begin as runners, as holders of drugs, and then as sellers of drugs unlike white youth, who begin at earlier ages using drugs, generally speaking.  There has been some changes in drug habits among kids in cities though, among black kids.  We're seeing more black kids now using PCP [Phencyclidine], for example.  Occasionally, you'll see one with cocaine or inhaling glue, but those used to be rare and unusual events.  I got a call from the emergency room.  We have a child who is using this, this, this, and this.  I knew right away this was 99 percent of the time a white child who lives in a suburban rural area, and even now that's the most likely scenario, but we are seeing a higher incidence of some different kind of substance abuse among kids in the city, black kids.
Speaker 1: There used to be, I don't know where it stands now, but likewise when I heard the [1999] Columbine [High School, Columbine, Colorado] killings and the psychotic kind of behavior that lots of people got shot, beyond thinking it's at the post office (laughter).  I think that, you know, it's white people, but in recent years we have had some black people who manifested that kind of psychotic behavior where they shoot a lot of people and that sort of thing.  Is this increasing amongst blacks or does culture account for those differences, or sociological conditions or what?
Speaker 2: That's a really complex question.  That's a very difficult question.  The minority always follows the majority eventually.  You know, the incidents of women incarcerated has been skyrocketing in the last ten years.  There used to be very few women in jail.  That is changing dramatically.  Many more women now are being arrested for felony-level offenses and the same theme, I think, in any other kind of behavior.  We sometimes think that behaviors are restricted to one or the other group.  That's a huge fallacy.  It's mythology.
Speaker 1: So, you're saying that as women become more like men, they get in trouble more, or is that--
Speaker 2: Well, somehow, again it's a complex, it's a complexity of human nature, I think.  Somehow gaining parity also means gaining the ability to engage in the vicissitudes of the majority.  Lung cancer used to be way more common in men, because only men smoked, but once women got the right [social permission] to smoke, now we're seeing more and more and more and more lung cancer among women, you know.  In terms of the inmate situation, women incarcerated has typically been associated with sexual abuse of these women in early life.  Now, does it mean that more women are being sexually abused?  I'm not sure, exactly.  Are more women being abused in general?  Again, I'm not quite sure about that, but there has certainly been a surge.  It used to be when I talked to a teenager about selling drugs it was always a guy; not so any more.  There are more and more women; girls are out here selling drugs, okay?  The social order shifts, I think, for a lot of reasons; you know, racially, socioeconomically, gender-wise, there is a lot of reason for this transition and this flow that's way beyond our discussion today.
Story_ID: 116693
Speaker 1: Now, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African-American community today?
Speaker 2: My hopes and concerns:  I hope [HM President] Barack Obama will win this election (laughter).  I hope that we, like him as a people, will focus more on solutions than complaints.  We did not create this social order.  It is what it is.  I think we need to figure out some ways to better navigate the social order and better control the things that we can control.  Certainly, we still have a thousand insults a day if we're moving in the larger society.  I was in a restaurant here in Bethesda [Maryland] a few weeks ago and I'm standing at the counter, not behind the counter as the cashier, I'm in the position of someone walking into the restaurant and this couple comes in and the wife immediately comes up to me and says, "Can we have a seat?"  I'm looking at her and her husband recognized immediately that I, too, am a customer here.  I, too, am a consumer.  I'm not standing here to seat you.  That's not why I'm in this restaurant, but that's her initial--I can't control that.  I can't do anything about this, so the husband apologizes profusely.  I said, "Hey, you know, it's okay." Why would I get all involved with that?  That's what she knows and that's how she's programmed.  I can't fix that for her.  But, I can take care of my space and be appropriate and just move on to the next thing and not be trapped into her stuff.  Okay?  I think we all have to become as black people, more productive in many ways.  I think we have to become more solution-oriented, I think we have to address issues in our communities that we don't wish to deal with, like the terrible sexism that exists among black people.  I always knew Barack Obama had a better chance than Hillary Clinton, 'cuz he's a man, and that's gonna trump, and there's a number of studies that show that gender regularly trumps race, and maybe I feel that more strongly 'cuz I am both, you know.  Maybe that's a particular perception I had, but I had lots of conversations with male friends about this and we were emailing each other and sending articles back and forth and, but you know, even the surveys they took suggested that, like the surveys that show that age is trumping both race and gender.  More people are concerned about John McCain's age than they are, at least than they say they are, about race or gender.  You know, so there are some conversations.  We need to have more, everybody needs to have more of a conversation about sex.  You know, what does that mean?  What are the roles for men and for women?  What are we gonna do about the continued assault on our children and our kids out here?  Domestic violence, all of the more generic kinds of issues.  That's what I think about.  I want to seem more solution-oriented and to fulfill more of our potential
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: God-given potential.
Story_ID: 116694
Speaker 1: When you look back over everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you'd do differently now if you could?
Speaker 2: Oh boy!  It's hard to second guess here.  I think people make the best decisions that they can at the time and you hope for the best.  Somebody asked that of Mary Kay Letourneau, who went to jail for six or seven years for having sex with a teenaged boy, and she thought very carefully and she said, "You know what?  I did the best I could.  I did the best I could."  And I thought about that answer and I thought, "That's probably each of our conditions."  We're doing what we think is the best that we can at that point in time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All of us have a retrospect-o-scope, you know, and we think, "Oh, we should have done this, should have done that."  You never know the outcome, though.  You have to figure, at least at this point, I accept and figure that God has us right where he wants us at X point in time.  We're living in the time we're supposed to be living in.  We are by and large hopefully doing the work that we're supposed to be doing.  If we're not, we're having problems in some kind of way with that work, that we're in the relationships we are supposed to be in or, if we're not in the relationships we're supposed to be in, we're having major problems with those relationships, you know.  I think that there is a plan and purpose for every life and we have to be attuned to the higher power to sort that out and to follow that path.
Speaker 1: I think you delivered a paper on Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] campus I was reading at CV about religion and, or spirituality and psychiatry.
Speaker 2: Ummm-hmmm.
Speaker 1: What was the core of that message?  Was it something that--
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's more around spirituality and medicine, you know, just understanding that how our immune system functions, how every aspect of our physical lives relates to our spiritual lives.  It's, again, the studies show very optimistic people have fewer kinds of certain kinds of diseases, recover faster from very serious illnesses, miraculously sometimes.  I think the spirit is incredibly important in terms of our life condition and in terms of our conduct of our day-to-day life and how, to what extent you are attuned to your spirit, your spiritual self.
Story_ID: 116695
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have any children yourself?
Speaker 2: I have no biological children nor have helped to raise a niece or nephew.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, who do you name when you consider your family?  Your niece and nephew and--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I have a wonderful family, extended family, friends, very good friends.  I consider my twin brother is ever present, even though he's in another city, although he was involved in New Orleans [Louisiana], [Hurricane] Katrina.  He had been here for a long time until recently, but I guess I feel like the people with whose live I'm entwined on a regular basis are family; that's the family for me.
Speaker 1: Now is there anything that we need to touch on before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't really think so.  I think, let me just say this about being Director of Children's Mental Health.  One of the exciting things to me was being able to start a school-based mental clinic.  It's not something I talk about much or think about much, but we did a lot of things in District [of Columbia] government that I thought were creative and innovative.  A lot of people did a lot of things and I think we have to keep on going with those kinds of things and not abandon our kids to the streets and to the pimps and to the drug dealers and all of these kind of people, 'cuz those people are out there 24/7, and we get tired and we go rest and drop the guard sometimes.  I think we can do a lot better in terms of that, but that's the only other thing I would say.
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  People are often quoted who are asked that question, or people are asked the question a little bit differently, I guess, and the answer always is, it's not what you do that makes people remember you positively, it's how you make people feel is what captures you in time.  You know how I would like to be remembered?  I would like very much to be remembered as somebody who tried to follow a God-given path to make a difference for lives of subsequent generations and for the people around me, and I think that that's what all of us, both of you gentlemen are doing right now.  I think that's what Julie Richardson's [THM founder Julieanna Richardson] legacy in a large part is.  You know, to make a difference.  Each of us has the job in life, I think, to improve, to change, and to enhance the lives of the people around us and the people who come behind us, and in our lives to honor the people who have gone before us; I mean, I don't think we think enough about the Harriet Tubmans and the Sojourner Truths, and all of those people, people on slave ships, all of those people who've come before us.  So, I'd like to hopefully think that I have a God-given, God-inspired legacy of having made some kind of difference that I have fulfilled the promise, the dream, the purpose for which I was put here.  That's what I worry most about is am I fulfilling that plan, or am I just off on my own ticket someplace?  Am I out of touch and out of tune?  But, I'm just not here as part of serendipity.  None of us is. You know, and I think that is something we all struggle with in one way or the other every day.  Are we fulfilling our God-driven destiny, our God-driven purpose in life, and if we are, you know, the legacy will be a positive one, and if we're not it will be a more negative destructive one.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much.  Thank you for what you offer in your legacy, both of you, again.  You know, this is a tremendous project.
