Story_ID: 12725
Speaker 1: I remember, you know, that you were born in Albany, Georgia, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well actually it was a little town right outside of Albany.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Sylvester.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sylvester, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Mmm, right.
Speaker 1: And if you could tell us your mother and father's name.
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Cora, Cora Lee, my father's name was Jimmy Lee and my name is Bobby Lee so I am the son of Cora Lee and Jimmy Lee (laughs).
Speaker 1: Rush though.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)  Rush.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously)  --And all have the middle name Lee,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right,  yeah, right.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) What, what is--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)  I don't know.  You know, it was just kind of a  coincidence I guess, yeah.
Speaker 1: And do you know--let's take your mother Cora Lee.  Do you know much about where she was bor- raised and her family?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was raised in the South.  She was raised in [near] Sylvester--Daugherty County, Georgia.Born on a farm, raised primarily on a farm (unclear) I guess since the age of which she could realize--make some decisions about her life or begin to even contemplate making decisions about her life, she wanted to leave.  You know, and so she was a very driven, ambitious person who really tried to do all that she could to better, not only her life, but the life of her children.  You know, so she single-handedly brought five children from Georgia to Chicago in seek--search of a better life.
Speaker 1: And how many--now you're--you are one of five kids.  Where do you fit and what are your, your, brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Actually, my mother when she got here there were, there were three other children, ok.  So I'm the middle person.  The middle child.  , and , I have two--three--two older brothers, one older sister.  And I have, there was-- I got two--one sister who's younger, the youngest.  The youngest is a girl. And , I have two other brothers.  The one brother who is deceased who died at age fif--fourteen.
Speaker 1: Can you give me their names in order?
Speaker 2: Ok, the oldest is Freddie, Fred. The next one is Willie.  My sister's name is Geraldine then I'm after Geraldine.  Then my brother who is next to me in age is Rex.  Then I have a brother Marlon, a brother Kenny, a brother Dennis who's deceased and a sister Judy.
Speaker 1: Now your father.  Tell us about your father.
Speaker 2: Well, my father is or was--he passed in February [2000], but he was, a person who was quite religious.  He was a a man who could not--who thought a lot of himself, had a lot of pride in his own self-worth--and therefore he was always in conflict with the Southern government system--the police, the authorities, the white authorities there because he was a person who felt as though he was just as good as the next person. And so he could not--He didn't think--He absolutely rejected all attempts, and all indications of white superiority.  You know, and as a result he was, he found most of his life, found himself fighting against the system.  Until ultimately, you know, as he'd gotten older in age the system kind of broke him down. And he had a number of jobs mostly working for himself.  And as--a cab driver--as a laborer, and then as a--in, in the later years he sold ice cream and snowcones,.  and he, he--again just--all of his life until his dying day--did not compromise--his own sense of who he was as a man and as a black man. And, so he was in his own way a very, very strong and powerful and really a role model for me.
Story_ID: 12726
Speaker 1: Do you have any early memories of growing up?  You know, in Georgia?  What, what that was like?  Any memories you'd like to share with us?
Speaker 2: Well you know, I, I--Georgia was a fun time for me--as I recall.  You know, I, I--we moved to Chicago when I was, I think I was seven years old. [ca. 1953]  So, I mean, the world was still a mystery and still a--you know, some-. I was fascinated, you know, with my surroundings and--. You know, we were poor.  But I always remembered, you know,  my mother [Cora Lee Rush] and my dad [Jimmy Lee Rush] trying to improve themselves.  That's just the thing that I've-- You know, they were always in business.  My mother taught school for a while in Georgia.  And I always remember them seeking to either start a business or working in a business.  My mother was a beautician. So, you know, she was always somebody who was trying to better her life.  And so was my dad. So I'm--you know, those were the kind of things that really remind me a lot of, well, of what I experienced in Georgia.  You know, we had fun times. Georgia was--the weather is very, very hot, something like today but only hotter.  You know, the dry heat.  And--you know I, I, I, I learned to read and, and it's been one of my life long passions, so, you know, when I look-- I was in Georgia back for my father's funeral back in (cough) February [2000].  And it kind of rekindled some of those feelings that I had about it.  I mean, I always loved it as a, as a place.  , we didn't have a lot but we had a community.
Story_ID: 12727
Speaker 1: I remember, you know, the community life, and it was a good place.  It was just--You know, it's--A lot of my foundation, most of my foundation anyway.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It was a--It was a small town rural community.  Right?
Speaker 1: Not-- Albany [Georgia] is a, is a moderately populated city, you know.  It's not a, it's not a rural city necessarily,.  You know, Albany was the  place where Dr. King had one of his major demonstrations and protests, centered around Albany.  And I recall the statement to the effect, I might be paraphrasing it. "These crackers down in Albany is a different kind of cracker."  (Laughs)  You know, 'cause he had to--He, he had to--Albany did not necessarily bend and fold for him.  And so it--It was the system that was an apartheid system.  Even today it's still to a certain extent an apartheid system that exists there but, the harshness of the conditions there and the limitations on blacks forced my mother to come to Chicago and bring us all to Chicago in search of a better life.
Speaker 2: Did she ever share with you, maybe not at seven.
Speaker 1: But I mean when you were older, some of the things that they experienced?  Because both--It sounds like both of your parents were like "This is not happening."
Speaker 2: Yeah. No, I remember most--Most--The thing that my mother said about Georgia is that she had--, she had--four boys, okay.  And she did not want her boys to be raised in the South.  So that really was her driving motivation to bring us to Chicago because she just--and I, and I really appreciate that.  Even when I went back there this past February [2000] as I indicated earlier, I could see why.  And I'm more--I'm grateful. Although there are some in my family who are there who are doing quite well.  But I'm just grateful for the fact that she decided that she wanted to bring us to Chicago in search of a better life.  Because I--I've had more experiences here in Chicago that's--I'm sure I would not have had, had she remained in Albany.
Speaker 1: So now what was the motiva-- at seven, do you--Was there family here?  Or, I mean, I know a lot of blacks were moving up North but was there family?  Do you know why they ended up choosing Chicago?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there are a lot of reasons.  Family?  We didn't have family here.  My mother did have a very, very close friend who had moved here.  And , you know, it's the letters that come back.  And it's "You know, you oughta come up.  You know, life is good here."  You know.  So that--that word of mouth--you know, that seeking more of the American dream, that certainly motivated a lot of folk--and they got that through a lot of different kinds of mediums. I mean you know, there's the Chicago Defender--played a key role.  Jet magazine played a key role in terms of motivating people to, to leave the South in search of a better life.  So, you know, the whole-- I mean, we were a part of the [Second] Great Migration, you know.  And, you know, 50,000 blacks left the South coming to Chicago in search of a better life. As a part of the whole epi--epoch there.  So--I-- you know, I think most of it was word of mouth.  You know, someone having the courage to leave and plant their future in a different place and then having some--a  modicum of success.  And then calling back and saying well you know, "Hey, this is what it's all about."  Or writing a letter and saying, "This is what it's all about and this is kind of life that I'm living now and you oughta come on up.  I got a extra room, you know, or I'll find some place, you can sleep on the couch, you know, for a while until you get your own apartment."  As a matter of fact, when we came to Chicago we were moving in with a family that, that was here already, you know, and I remember, I think we shared about two rooms in that large apartment on the Near North Side for about the first three months that we were here.  You know, until my mother was able to secure us a, an apartment.  So it's that kind of thing, you know.  And I think that that's probably a strength that we have lost somewhat as a, as a community.  That extended family kind of caring for each other.  And really seeking out and willing to make some sacrifices.  So that those of us who we love and those of us who are--find themselves in similar positions, and, you know, give them a helping hand. That's--you know, that doesn't exist too much any more.
Story_ID: 12728
Speaker 1: When you came to Chicago, what were the eyes of Chicago and the--You know, the eyes of the young Bobby Rush?
Speaker 2: WelI probably--I'm told that I was fairly shy.  And I guess to a certain extent I am a shy person. Not introverted but--introspective.  And again I said, I love--I love to read.  And so I'm always not too far from some provocative reading material, political is probably the nature. And--I think that's really what--you know, that allowed me to make a transition here in Chicago, at a certain level with a certain attitude, because basically I didn't think that it was anybody out there--you know, I didn't feel so (pause) diminished in my own self outlook or self-esteem that I had to, you know--I didn't--I didn't--I didn't have an inferiority complex that--handcuffed me or that crippled me in any way in terms of trying to--do what I thought I needed to do and could do even as a young person.  And again, my mother [Cora Lee Rush] was very, very important because she made sure that me and my brothers were involved in positive endeavors.  You know, the church, Boy Scouts--you know and she not only led us to these places but she also worked, you know, my mother was a den mother in Boy Scouts.  So she just didn't send her kids off to the, to the Boy Scout meetings or Cub Scout meetings.  She actually, in fact, took us there because she was involved in it also. And I think that that helped us tremendously in terms of making the transition from the rural South to Chicago.  And the Near North Side at the time was a very-- It was, it was a community that was--that was comforting. And it made us--You know, we had friends, we had close friends. And I still have friends even today from people who came from the same neighborhood, on the Near North Side.  So it was a very, very warm community, a small community.  We had some problems but you know, we, everybody like kind of just existed together, lived together, shared together. And so it was, you know, we had-- and it wasn't just blacks.  We had--You know I grew up in a community with, with whites, you know, with Italians, and Jews and Hispanics, you know.  My graduating class--we had Asians in my graduating class,  Hispanics, whites we had the whole--You know. I mean, when I graduated from grade school.  So we had, you know, it was like an amalgam with different kinds of people.  You know, Appalachian whites--all around the Near North Side, you know.  So it was a good, good, nurturing environment--that allowed us to engage in sports and other kinds of activities, recreation activities as young people that had a strong adult population that supervised, sometimes at arm's length but still supervised, most of our activities.  We had a lot of individuals who were struggling to accomplish goals and objectives in their own-- careers, you know, and either in business or community, you had successful small business people who were black, you know.  So you had all that you needed, you know?  And you really had a lot going on in that little small area there.  You know, so we had role models and heroes.  You know, Jerry Butler, 'Iceman' Butler, Curtis Mayfield, Major Lance, you know all came from that community. So we had a lot of role models.  You know a lot of people who took time out.  Adults who took time out and spent time with us as children, you know.  And a lot of our activities over there was centered around Seward park and--because that's where, you know, we spent a lot of times, you know, playing basketball and baseball and running track.  And, so we had heroes and sheroes there that really, you know, helped us to look at ourselves as being--capable individuals.  People who could accomplish on their own.  Even though we all understood what racism was all about.
Speaker 1: Now, that's what-- Now, what were you born?  Can I just ask this--What was the date--what is your birth date?
Speaker 2: November 23, 1946.
Speaker 1: 1946.  So, you came here in 1953?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) '53.
Speaker 1: Right.  And so the area you're talking about: What are the, what were some of the streets?
Speaker 2: Well we had--It was the Near North Side .  So the neighborhood probably started--I guess Clark Street was maybe the northern boundaries. Halsted Street was probably the southern boundaries. In our neighborhood North Avenue--No, no that's not right.  I've got to get this straight.  Hals--Clark Street would be--would have been the eastern boundaries.  Halsted would have been the western boundaries. North Avenue would probably be the northern boundaries and Chicago Avenue really would be the southern boundaries. Mm, In, in that little area right there.
Story_ID: 12729
Speaker 1: So now, where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to Benjamin Franklin [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]. At the time when I was there--boy, lets see.  I was there--I was at--I drove over there, (pause) , it must have been two days ago.  Sunday I believe it was. Sunday or maybe Monday.  And it's--I caught--I found myself in the neighborhood and I looked up and I didn't recognize the block, 'cause it has changed, it's been--you know you're talking about gentrification.  Goethe and Wells is where I'm talking about.  It's, it's--At Goethe and Wells. I went to Benjamin Franklin.  And the school was located on Schiller--No, Evergreen and Wells, okay.  Evergreen and--Yeah Evergreen and Wells.  And so, as I drove over there, I saw--I saw these, this baseball field that we used to play on as youngsters over there.  And I saw Franklin.  And at the time there were two Franklins.  One were called--One was called big Franklin and Little Franklin.  Big Franklin was for the children who had, you know, conduct problem, slow learners, and things like that.  And Little Franklin was for the normal children.  So I graduated from Little Franklin, okay (laugh)--and--But I wanted to see whether or not--whether or not--What happened to Big Franklin.  And then--So they'd torn Big Franklin down.  And the only thing that remained is Little Franklin and the chimney stack from Big Franklin.  You know, and that's the onl--really and the building on the corner.  That's the only thing that's there from the time when I was there And tha-- It really kind of galls me to see those,  places and residents and those institutions and those buildings that you grew up and came, came to love.  And now they're all gone.  And now it's nothing but townhouses.  Out of, out of you know--with these enormous, humongous price tags on them.  And, you know, it's kind of, it's kind of depressing to see all that--all that stuff gone.  'Cause we had such a wonderful time as youngsters in that little small community.  It was just--, I mean, you know, I couldn't think of a better place for a child to grow up than in that small community.  'Cause everything was there.
Story_ID: 12730
Speaker 1: What were you, sort of--your thoughts about? What did you want to do?  Or what did you think of yourself being? Or--.
Speaker 2: Well I've--since I was young, I've always admired--well, I've, I had some heroes.  And  I, I didn't have--they weren't necessarily--well they weren't, they weren't black because I--The first black that I actually read about in a book was George Washington Carver.  And I think he was the only black in a library at the sch-, the sch-, at [Benjamin] Franklin [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] at that time.  And so, you know, I found myself looking at whites who came from poor backgrounds who came from modest backgrounds and, and was able to succeed.  And then, you know, Abraham Lincoln was one of them.  I liked to read about the mountain men--Kit Carson, Jim Bridger and Jim Bowie and those folks.  Because they seemed to have --, you know, they went out and made things happen in their world.  You know, they had--accepted certain challenges and they lived up to them.  And they tried to, tried to overcome the odds.  And they weren't necessarily--established and they didn't follow an established pattern to their success.  So I kind of, you know-- I liked those--And I, I recall for a long time, you know, thinking that I was born in the wrong time, the wrong period.  Because everybody--Everything had been discovered.  You know?  And so, you know--Because I was a history buff and I liked to read about history and things like that.  So, you know, I figured "What--What--You know what is there for me to do?"  Because all those folks had already done most of the things that was considered remarkable at that time.  So...
Speaker 1: So you wanted to be a pioneer right?
Speaker 2: Basically.  Yeah, basically.  You know?  I have that pioneering spirit.  I still do to a great extent.

Speaker 1: I'm Congressman Bobby L. Rush.  Today's date is the--.
Speaker 2: 18th.
Speaker 1: --18th of January and I'm the--I represent the First Congressional District in Illinois.
Speaker 2: Okay, and it's 2001, January 2001.
Speaker 1: 2001.
Story_ID: 12732
Speaker 1: 2001 right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Three hundred and eighty two years since slavery started.
Speaker 2: Is that true?
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1619.  First slaves were brought to America in 1619.  The reason I know I, I went back and researched it because I spoke at a Martin Luther King, Jr. commemorative session yesterday and program yesterday at Loyola University and I said that we had been in, had been slave, enslaved for 400 years and so I was challenged by one of the black professors there.  So you know I had to go back and check my facts so it has, it's, it hasn't been four hundred years it's been two hundred, I mean three hundred and eighty two years.
Speaker 2: (Unidentified observer:) That's interesting.
Speaker 1: So--.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So they, they have records of when the first slave was brought here?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in James, it was Jamestown, 1619.  The Dutch brought, the Dutch.
Story_ID: 12733
Speaker 1: I'd like to take you back to your, let's say end of elementary, junior high you know years and I'd like you just to sort of share some reflections about that, you know that time.
Speaker 2: Well during those years I basically was so into sports and sports heroes, you know, Oscar Robinson and at the high school level here in Chicago, Darius 'Pete' Cunningham and Tim Robinson.  And you know high school heroes in terms of athletics, college heroes, professional sports heroes, most of my life during those years was, was consumed by those kind of efforts you know.  And some entertainers, you know Jerry Butler, Curtis Mayfield because they were [Near North Side] neighborhood fellows that we looked up to you know.  There were some others who didn't reach the level of success that Jerry and Curtis and Major Lance and others.  But they're, you know we were all, either we on the basketball courts honing our skills you know competing with each other or we were on the corners doo-wopping you know trying to blend our voices in and trying to get a contract and trying to write songs and things like that and you know.  So those, that's where we were, a lot of the emphasis during my high school and my--through my early high school years.  That's where we really developed, devoted a lot of our time to.
Story_ID: 12734
Speaker 1: I went to a number of high schools in the city of Chicago.  My mother [Cora Lee Rush] moved around a lot because we, you know, she was, we were, she was poor, we were poor.  She tried to raise five children and she was a single mom and so sometimes we were, we had to move, you know, on, on more than one occasion.  So I went to Wells High School, Marshall, Crane, even spent a semester at Farragut and a couple of semesters at Englewood so I moved around quite a lot. You know.  But you know as I look back on it now it was really a blessing in disguise because I know a lot of people throughout the city of Chicago.  I know every crook and cranny of this city and--I--it's been very, very helpful to me, my relationships that I developed throughout the City of Chicago during those years.  And we have, I have a lot, a network of friends and associates who I either went to grade school with or went to high school with.  And some of us we, we remain very, very close even till this day.  And they've been very, very helpful to me and I, as I have been to them, as we became adults and pursued our various walks of life. So--God has a way of, of, of doing things that you might not understand at a certain point but they all come out quite well in the end.
Speaker 2: Now what I was curious about when you were talking about now when you were--I mean how, how much older is Jerry Butler and Curtis Mayfield to you?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) They might not want to admit it.  Well you know of course Curtis is deceased now but Jerry is oh, let's say probably about five or six years older than I am.  Jerry's Butler, Jerry's brother and I were very, very close, Billy Butler.  Mattie was a little younger, his sister was a little younger but we all was in the same age group and so we had to, we s-, did a lot of things together.
Speaker 2: You know what I find very interesting is you know that area there--.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: --around, you know and how a lot of musical talent came out of that area.
Speaker 1: Oh sure.
Speaker 2: And it's a time that's almost passé in Chicago in many ways and I'm wondering why, you know, why would you say that talent, you know, why do you think that was a breeding ground? cause Chicago was you know before, this is before Motown really.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I'm wondering you know why you think that you know it was sort of a breeding ground?
Speaker 1: Well I think that because the Near North Side was a, a small enough community and most of us, most of our families had immigrated from the South and so we kind of brought the talent from our southern heritage, our Southern culture and we kind of all settled right you know, most, a lot of us settled on the Near North Side.  That's not to say that talent wasn't in other places but Jerry you know Jerry was from Mississippi and Curtis was from Mississippi and you know so, and they all had the experiences in the churches in the South.  And so when you had those little small--laboratory, if you will, of, of--community type laboratory, then you, you know you, you, you can hone and you can compete and you can develop your, your skills and your talents a lot better in that kind of environment.  So I think that, that the, the, the fact that the North Side, the Near North Side at that time around the Cabrini area was small enough so that we could be in a relationship with each other and therefore we could borrow and we could you know combine and we could hone and develop our talents a lot more.  There was one place on the North Side that Major Lance and Jerry Butler and Curtis Mayfield and many others that they practiced at.  You could go into Seward Park almost on any afternoon during those days and you could hear The Impressions and you could hear others you know all throughout the place practicing you know, competing and, and, and, and honing their skills.  So I mean this is just one location and where else could you have that you know.  So that was part of the reason that we had a lot of talent emerging from that, from that area and not just musically but there were other kinds, Ramsey Lewis.  Ramsey Lewis was from that area also.  Ramsey Lewis was a member of the Boy Scout troop that I, that I was a member also of, you know he was years ahead of me.  But Jesse White, [Illinois] secretary of state, he came from that area and so you had athlete, athletics dominating, you had entertainment dominating and then we had, of course we had some successful business people come from that area also.  There was a small cocooning kind of community experience where we could all kind, we can all, we, we, we could, we supported each other, relate to each other, most of us knew each other so there was that kind of interrelationship.  We'll, we recreated at the same, at the, one of the two places that we were all, you know we went to the same high schools, grade schools.  You know either, either you went to Jenner, Schiller, Big Franklin or Little Franklin you know you went to those schools or McNair you know.  Most of them went to Wells High School you know or Cooley [High School] which was at one time was Washburn you know.  So you know it was a community.  It really was a community.
Speaker 2: And what type of black person was gravitating towards that community because here you have you know the South Side, a very strong vestibule and the West Side.  So I'm wondering who was this, you know who were people that were gravitating to that Near North Side?
Speaker 1: Well I think before they built the [public housing] high rises you had a, a, a--people who would come from the South who would look for a better life but who also had some skills and had some, a foundation you know.  You know my mother when we moved to Chicago, you know my mother was a beautician for most of her life although she taught school at an early age but she, most of her life she was a beautician.  And so she you know gravitated toward you know opening up a beauty shop and working in a beauty shop so you had those kinds of people who had those kinds of skills.  So--and I would say that you had small business people you know who lived in the area who opened businesses up in the area so there was an upwardly mobile, forward thinking kind of person who basically resided in that, in that area and they were self-reliant to a great extent you know.  They didn't, you know most of them didn't rely on the public dole and so you know they came in with the thought of creating businesses or getting good jobs and working at good jobs.  And they produced you know they wanted their children to, to be productive you know in school and you know and, and things like that.  I mean I had a, a Boy Scout troop, the troop that I mentioned before, Troup 73 and my scoutmaster I mean he was phenomenal.  I, I mentioned him the other day to someone and this guy was telling me, I didn't even know that he had any association with my Boy Scout leader.  But he you know he, he also knew about Mr. Outerbridge.  And Mr. Outerbridge I mean he was Ramsey Lewis' scoutmaster (unclear) Jerry's scoutmaster.  I mean we all came from up through his tutelage to a great extent.  I mean Mr. Matthews over at, at the, one of the churches there.  You know he helped us out tremendously and, and, and this guy, we were talking and the first time I marched, the first time that I came to the south side was in the Bud Billiken Parade.  We marched down King Drive.  That was my Boy Scout troop, Mr. Outerbridge.  I mean he took us all over the place, exposed us to different things you know.  And I never will forget you know the times when I would march in the Bud Billiken parade as a younger.  You know me and that--I had a silver bugle, we had a drum and bugle corp. and I had a silver bugle.  And you know and I just was awed by all these people and all these, all this great happening in the Bud Billikin parade.  And that's why even today I mean I don't, I don't miss the Bud Billikin parade, you know try to encourage youngsters and have youngsters in the Bud Billikin parade cause it meant so much to me.  But we had adults who were for the most part who were caring and concerned and we had a community that was small enough that we were all in relationship to each other, you know.  A few days ago I met another guy whose sister owned the record show down the street from my mother's beauty shop, you know.  And I didn't know him them but you know he recalled and I certainly recall what that, that meant to us.  I mean it was a black woman who owned the local record shop right on the corner you know or the middle of the block at the time.  And, and when he mentioned, you heard her name and the record, I mean it just brought back all kinds of good memories because it played a certain--when we wanted to get to the latest records that's where we went to, to get the little 45s and things like that you know and we did have our music.  It was a very nurturing community.  Not to say we didn't have problems but we all knew each other.  We all were in relationship with each other and we had very little, few of the problems that we have to the extent that we have them today in the City of Chicago.
Speaker 2: Now you talked about Mr., you know this Outerbridge.
Speaker 1: Mr. Outerbridge, yeah.
Speaker 2: What did he teach you as a young person that sort of stays with you today?
Speaker 1: Well he taught me first of all to believe in myself.  He gave me opportunities to show that I had the intelligence to accomplish things.  You know I'm saddened by the assault on the Boy Scouts.  I understand the issues around the homosexual issues there, I understand it to a certain extent.  But I also know that the Boy Scouts provide an opportunity for youngsters of no means or very little means to really accomplish goals and, and to raise their level of, of, of appreciation for themselves you know because you don't just, you know they set these goals out for you, you know (unclear) and then you got to, you know it's all, you know you, there's certain levels that you got to really achieve and that's very, very important especially my mother, my mother when we were in Chicago, she had five children.  She was a single mom with five children, all right and she needed to have some kind of outlet for us, some kind of you know--and the boy scouts did that for me and, and my brother, you know.  I remember competing in the--we had a, a competition about the Lincoln, the Gettysburg Address you know and I practiced for that you know and my brother practiced for it.  And we just kind of, you know I mean it was just these kind of--going to camp, summer camps you know.  I mean I was a transplant from the south and to be exposed, to have someone to nurture us like, like Mr. Outerbridge did and expose us to things.  So I guess what he really taught me was to, to commit a life of service to others.  That's really what, you know and I, I got his picture.  Where is--Robin we got Mr. Outerbridge's picture.  Where is he at cause I want to, I think this is important for me.
Speaker 2: Well we can get it later.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to, yeah you know and--.
Speaker 2: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 1: O-U-T-E-R-B-R-I-D-G-E, Outerbridge yeah, yeah.  And so, and he definitely inspired me.  He became a surrogate father and you know he was committed you know.  Even, I mean not just to me but I guess Mr. Outerbridge touched the lives of over a thousand young men through the boy scout program.

Speaker 1: Now what I was curious about when you were talking about now when you were in--I mean how, how much older is Jerry Butler and Curtis Mayfield to you?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) They might not want to admit it, well you know of course Curtis is deceased now but Jerry is oh, let's say probably about five or six years older than I am.  Jerry's Butler, Jerry's brother and I were very, very close, Billy Butler.  Mattie was a little younger, his sister was a little younger but we all was in the same age group and so we had to, we s-, did a lot of things together.
Speaker 1: You know what I find very interesting is you know that area there--.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --around, you know and how a lot of musical talent came out of that area.
Speaker 2: Oh sure.
Speaker 1: And it's a time that's almost passé in Chicago in many ways and I'm wondering why, you know, why would you say that talent, you know, why do you think that was a breeding ground? cause Chicago was you know before, this is before Motown really.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I'm wondering you know why you think that you know it was sort of a breeding ground?
Speaker 2: Well I think that because the Near North Side was a, a small enough community and most of us, most of our families had immigrated from the South and so we kind of brought the talent from our southern heritage, our Southern culture and we kind of all settled right you know, most, a lot of us settled on the Near North Side.  That's not to say that talent wasn't in other places but Jerry you know Jerry was from Mississippi and Curtis was from Mississippi and you know so, and they all had the experiences in the churches in the South.  And so when you had those little small--laboratory, if you will, of, of--community type laboratory, then you, you know you, you, you can hone and you can compete and you can develop your, your skills and your talents a lot better in that kind of environment.  So I think that, that the, the, the fact that the North Side, the Near North Side at that time around the Cabrini area was small enough so that we could be in a relationship with each other and therefore we could borrow and we could you know combine and we could hone and develop our talents a lot more.  There was one place on the North Side that Major Lance and Jerry Butler and Curtis Mayfield and many others that they practiced at.  You could go into Seward Park almost on any afternoon during those days and you could hear The Impressions and you could hear others you know all throughout the place practicing you know, competing and, and, and, and honing their skills.  So I mean this is just one location and where else could you have that you know.  So that was part of the reason that we had a lot of talent emerging from that, from that area and not just musically but there were other kinds--Well, Ramsey Lewis.  Ramsey Lewis was from that area also.  Ramsey Lewis was a member of the Boy Scout troop that I, that I was a member also of, you know he was years ahead of me.  But Jesse White, [Illinois] secretary of state, he came from that area and so you had athlete, athletics dominating, you had entertainment dominating and then we had some, of course we had some successful business people come from that area also. But it was a small cocooning kind of community experience where we could all kind--we can all, we, we, we could, we supported each other, relate to each other, most of us knew each other so there was that kind of interrelationship.  We'll, we recreated at the same, at the, one of the two places that we were all, you know we went to the same high schools, grade schools.  You know either, either you went to Jenner, Schiller, Big Franklin or Little Franklin you know you went to those schools --or McNair you know.  Most of them went to Wells High School you know or Cooley [High School] which was at one time was Washburn you know.  So you know it was a community.  It really was a community.
Speaker 1: And what--? How did that--? What type of black person was gravitating towards that community because here you have you know the South Side, a very strong vestibule and the West Side.  So I'm wondering who was this, you know who were people that were gravitating to that Near North Side?
Speaker 2: Well I think before they built the [public housing] high rises you had a, a, a--people who would come from the South who would look for a better life but who also had some skills and had some, a foundation you know.  You know my mother when we moved to Chicago, you know my mother was a beautician for most of her life although she taught school at an early age but she, most of her life she was a beautician.  And so she you know gravitated toward you know opening up a beauty shop and working in a beauty shop so you had those kinds of people who had those kinds of skills.  So--and I would say that you had small business people you know who lived in the area who opened businesses up in the area so there was an upwardly mobile, forward thinking kind of person who basically resided in that, in that area and they were self-reliant to a great extent you know.  They didn't, you know most of them didn't rely on the public dole and so you know they came in with the thought of creating businesses or getting good jobs and working at good jobs.  And they produced you know they wanted their children to, to be productive you know in school and you know and, and things like that.
Story_ID: 12736
Speaker 1: I had a, a Boy Scout troop, the troop that I mentioned before, Troup 73 and my Scoutmaster I mean he was phenomenal.  I, I mentioned him the other day to someone and this guy was telling me--I didn't even know that he had any association with my Boy Scout leader.  But he you know he, he also knew about Mr. [Alex] Outerbridge.  And Mr. Outerbridge I mean he was Ramsey Lewis' scoutmaster, he was mine, Jerry's scoutmaster.  I mean we all came from--up through his tutelage to a great extent.  I mean Mr. Matthews over at, at the, one of the churches there--you know we had--he helped us out tremendously and, and, and this guy, we were talking and the first time I marched, the first time that I came to the South Side was in the Bud Billiken Parade.  We marched down King Drive.  That was my Boy Scout troop, Mr. Outerbridge.  I mean he took us all over the place, exposed us to different things--you know.  And I never will forget you know the times when I would march in the Bud Billiken parade as a younger.  You know me and that--I had a silver bugle, we had a drum and bugle corp. and I had a silver bugle.  And you know and I just was awed by all these people and all these, all this great happening in the Bud Billiken parade.  And that's why even today I mean I don't, I don't miss the Bud Billiken parade, you know try to encourage youngsters and have youngsters in the Bud Billiken parade cause it meant so much to me.  But we had adults who were for the most part who were caring and concerned and we had a community that was small enough that we were all in relationship to each other, you know.

It was a very nurturing--community.  Not to say we didn't have problems but we all knew each other.  We all were in relationship with each other and we had very little, few of the problems that we have to the extent that we have them today in the City of Chicago.

You know I'm saddened by the assault on the Boy Scouts.  I understand the issues around the homosexual issues there, I understand it to a certain extent.  But I also know that the Boy Scouts provide an opportunity for youngsters of no means or very little means to really accomplish goals and, and to raise their level of, of, of appreciation for themselves you know because you don't just, you know they set these goals out for you, you know, 'Webelo' [higher rank in Cub Scouts], and then you got to, you know it's all, you know you, there's certain levels that you got to really achieve and that's very, very important especially my mother, my mother when we were in Chicago, she had five children.  She was a single mom with five children, all right and she needed to have some kind of outlet for us, some kind of you know--and the Boy Scouts did that for me and, and my brother, you know.

Story_ID: 12737
Speaker 1: What were the things sort of motivating you?  Did you want to, you know you sang, now that's even interesting.  You know you said you were singing doo-wop on the corner.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you have aspirations or did you, you know was it even--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.  Well, you know again you know I wanted to, to be an outstanding athlete, basketball player for the most part.  I played a little football.  I couldn't sing that well and I tried to train my voice to sing but I couldn't sing that well and it was obvious to me.  Well at least my friends made it obvious to me in terms of their reaction.  You know I thought I was doing quite well but I, I, but I, I really leaned toward--since I can remember I've always wanted to be involved in law or government or politics since I can, since I was a young person.  I've always had that, those kind of aspirations.  I can remember I think I was eight years old and well there was a barber shop on Division Street and my mother's beauty shop was in the rear of this barber shop and this, it was called Futz (ph.) Barber Shop, Mr. Futz was the owner of it you know.  And he was an older man kind of tall and heavy set and there were a number of people who, other barbers there.  And so I walked in there I think one day after school and they, they asked me all the older guys, "Boy what you gonna be when you grow up?"  And I thought for a minute, I said, "I'm going to be president of the United States."  And that kind of, that, that kind of feedback that they gave me kind of really enforced the fact that I wanted to be in government.  I wanted to be a, a lawyer or something like that because I mean I just, you know they hollered, they patted me on the back and things like that.  So I, you know it, it, that kind of positive, those kind of positive, that kind of positive feedback really had an impression on me and I haven't forgotten that today, that how important that positive feedback is for our young people in terms of inspiring, inspiring them to proceed.  So to me that's very, very key.  I mean so much.  It meant a lot to me then and it means a lot to me right now to give our young people that positive--let them believe that there's something they can accomplish, give them some goals and objectives.  Let them know, let them have hope, we got to instill some hope or keep hope alive in our, among our young people.  So I've always aspired to be a leader, I've always aspired to be in law.  I've never been you know I had my chance to go to law school and I didn't take it.  But you know I'm in government and I, and you know I'm also in the clergy, I'm  clergy, I'm a preacher now so I just, I didn't go to law school and I don't regret not going to law school.
Story_ID: 12738
Speaker 1: Here are basically a poor community at a time that blacks still weren't necessarily doing that good.  But you paint a very rosy picture. Is your picture rosy because those are memories or is your picture rosy because you think qualitatively life was different?
Speaker 2: Qualitatively life was different, you know.  I mean you know the 50s [1950s] economically things were you know was, was different.  I mean we--but again life was different in those days because you didn't have the kind of life or death crises immediately staring you in the face.  You know I can recall the first friend of mine who was killed by, through violence, all right.  And I mean but that was the only time that I had recognized or that I experienced a friend being killed through violence in terms of it you know of another teenager shooting this person, you know.  And this is, again this is my only--but nowadays our children witness this you know three or four times between, during you know the time they're young and the time they become an adult you know.  They might have not only friends but family members, two or three family members killed through gun violence.  So you know qualitatively times were different back in those days.  Life was a little, lot less complicated I believe especially for, for the young people than they are today and I believe that we--although that's not to say we were, certainly we weren't angels and certainly we did a lot of things and we you know--. The biggest fear among some of us was the fact that you know we might get sent to a place they called Montefiore [Moses Montefiore Chicago Public School] and Montefiore was you know a school for children who were dysfunctional in, in regular school you know and so they were sent, you know if they had some issues with their conduct or you know they'd be sent to Montefiore you know and--. So that was, yeah but that was, that was ominous.  It was you know something that we couldn't, we couldn't, we couldn't really--you know a lot of us kind of dreaded going to Montefiore.  And I talk about the, the grade school, Big Franklin and Little Franklin.  Big Franklin was a school where you know the socially challenged children went to.  Little Franklin was the school where we, where the you know where you didn't have those same issues, you know.  So it was, it was that kind of a, it was a, a time when there was more of a--the--where the outcomes of, of bad decisions were less final in terms of life or death than they are now.  And it was a time where your, where your, I think you had, you were exposed to a more nurturing environment and so therefore qualitatively I believe that life was better.  Quantitatively it's better now in some respects because we have more of things, we certainly live longer but I think the quality of life is something that we've sacrificed.

Speaker 1: You go to Wells High School [Chicago, Illinois]  What high school did you--?
Speaker 2: I started out at Wells.
Speaker 1: But where did you end up (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I ended up at, at Englewood--no at Marshall High School.
Speaker 1: Okay and where is Marshall at?
Speaker 2: On the West Side.
Speaker 1: Oh it's on the--okay.
Speaker 2: Right, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And you at that point, explain to me what you do at that point?  Oh you dropped out of high school?
Speaker 2: Dropped out.
Speaker 1: Right, so you're--?
Speaker 2: Dropped out of Wells, I mean out of Marshall and then I went into the service.
Speaker 1: And how old were you at this point and what year was it?
Speaker 2: Seventeen, 1963.  I, I, I dropped out of Marshall High School and enlisted in the service on December the 1st, 1963 and my seventeenth birthday was November the 23rd, 1963.  So I couldn't wait till my seventeenth birthday in order--as a matter of fact I had signed up, passed the test and everything else and I, but I couldn't raise my hand and get sworn in until my seventeenth birthday.  So I, I left for Fort Knox, Kentucky on December the 3rd, of nine--no December 2nd of 1963, you know.  And when I went there you know the one thing I promised my mother because she had to sign for me to go into the service.  I promised my mother that I would graduate, I would get, have my GED [General Education Diploma] by June of that year when my high school class was supposed to have graduated and I did.  And by that September of that year I had a semester of junior college under my belt even though I was in the service at the same time.  So I had to go to the service to kind of, you know first of all economically it wasn't--you know we were struggling economically.  And at that time the service offered, offered an opportunity for you to you know have some income you know three squares and things like that and you know and, and it give me, gave me an opportunity to really get a focus to my life because I had started drifting you know, pool halls and you know hanging out all times of the day and night and drinking white port and Kool-aid and you know all that kind of stuff, silver satin and all that kind of stuff.  So you know and, and I was kind of losing focus and my mother challenged me.  I'll never forget, I had an altercation with my older brother and it got real ugly and I just, at that point in time I kind of caught myself, what am I doing? you know?  And I decided to enlist in the service you know at that point.
Story_ID: 12740
Speaker 1: So I was asking you know how did you, I mean how did you find out about the service, you know?
Speaker 2: Well there were, you know those kind of things you really focused on it because of your peer, peer group.  And at the time there were about three or four of us that hung out together a lot [in Chicago, Illinois] and we were all talking about going to the service.  And basically within I guess sixty days all of us went to different branches of the service.  We had one who went to, two of them went to the marines, I went to the army and I, I'm not sure whether, I can't remember where the other one went to but you know so we all enlisted around the same time you know in the service.  So it was like you know "I'm going to go--" you know, "let's go and enlist" and "let's go and do this" and "I'm going into the service."  So it was all like kind of our peer group.  But in my instance, in my case rather it made all the, more sense to me because I was drifting you know a lot.  I mean I was hanging out on the street you know and I was just not doing the things that would make my mother proud.  And, and so I just you know again knew, and I knew that and I felt it.  And when I had this, this confrontation with my brother, my older brother who was basically right you know and, because he wanted to--he came over to the house because my mother asked him to come over and chastise me you know.  And so we kind of knocked each other around a little bit and then I, it just hit me, "You know, well, what are you doing?" Because I felt really horrible.  I will never forget that.  I felt very, very bad that I wasn't living up to the expectation of my mom and I was letting her down.  And so all of this came around, came together around the same time and I, I decided to go into the service and I convinced her that I should go in the service and she said you know she would sign for me.
Speaker 1: Now, you--why did you choose the army?
Speaker 2: I'm not really sure why I chose the army.  I really don't know.  It wasn't--I, I just don't know why I chose the army, maybe because, because it was convenient, more convenient you know.  I just don't know why I chose the army.
Speaker 1: Now Fort Knox--was it in Tennessee?
Speaker 2: Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Oh Kentucky, okay.  So here, this is a whole--you're shipped off to Fort Knox.  It's not like you're on a buddy program with any of your other friends.
Speaker 2: No.  No they weren't, they weren't with me.
Speaker 1: And so how was that experience?  You know you're basically--even though you were raised, born in Georgia.  You know you--.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: I don't know if you were going back and forth but basically you know you had lived in a Northern environment.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So how was that whole--?
Speaker 2: Well it wasn't--you know--the, the army has a culture into itself.  It dominated everything so I mean it wasn't like I was exposed to a Southern culture there too much I mean other than the Southerners who were in the army, so--and they (unclear), they were a part of the army culture so that was kind of, I mean I adjusted to it quite quickly.  And you know the roles--in, you know had assumed responsibilities.  You know my training NCO, they gave me more and more, gave me a lot of responsibilities during those times, during the time when I was in basic training because basically I guess I was more inclined to assume leadership positions, you know and I went there with the, with the, my, my mind made up that I was going to be a leader you know and that I wasn't just going to, you know it wasn't--I mean I had aspirations even in the service.  I had ambitions and, and, and aspirations to accomplish and do something because I was always driven by this fact that I wanted to, to please my mom.  I've always, that you know, that's always been, even when I didn't do, didn't please her I always had that desire.  I wanted to always please my mother.  That's, that's the one thing that always stuck with me.  Even today I think about you know, am I pleasing my mother.
Story_ID: 12741
Speaker 1: Now what about the service did you find a little not tasteful?  I mean there are things--you know it's a very disciplined environment.
Speaker 2: Right. Racism.  You know I first was made very, very--well not made very, very aware but I first you know confronted racism in, in the service and, and I responded to it and they responded to me you know.  And, and, for-, and really I didn't really deal with it as such until I was, I re-enlisted in the service.  I got an early discharge and I re-enlisted.  You know it was a technique that you could use to get a transfer and so I was transferred here to Chicago.  And that's when I really ran into the racism here in Chicago on the South Side right there at The Point, in Jackson Park, there was a missile base there. And I was stationed there for three years okay, and that's when I really ran into the racism.  And I think it was because the, the heightened civil rights era and the fact that I you know I challenged the army system you know one with the mustache.  You know at that time you couldn't have a, if you were in the service you, they wouldn't allow you to wear your mustache and I thought that that was racist because most black men wore a mustache and the white man didn't wear a mustache.  So I would rebel and wear my mustache and I mean I kind of pushed the envelope you know.  I joined SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee while I was there so I was the black power advocate on the base you know.  And I, so I attracted a lot of, of--resistance you know and anger and, from my, from my barrack commander and also from you know some of the noncommissioned officers from the leadership there.  And I would walk, I would come in working and report for duty with my uniform on and then I'd have my black power badge button on you know that kind of thing.  So they, they kind of frowned on that, not kind of they really did.  But I earned a lot of respect from my fellow army associates and also you know from some of the black NCOs there.  But I never will forget a commander, Lieutenant Rogers, John B. Rogers, he's from Alabama and he was stationed on the South Side of the city of Chicago and he thought that black folks needed to stay in their place you know.  And so he and I went round and round and round.  He tried to get me out, transfer me out of there you know but ironically I was the battery clerk and then I became the training NCO and so I kind of knew how to do certain things and, and so he wasn't successful in doing it.  So ultimately he got called, he had a duty chain.  He got called, I think he went to Vietnam or something like that and he, but he never could get rid of me, you know.
Speaker 1: Now you were in Fort Knox how long?
Speaker 2: I was in Fort Knox for six months for--.
Speaker 1: Six months?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then you, that's when you re-enlisted?
Speaker 2: No, I went to, I went to Fort Sill, Oklahoma for--Fort Knox was for basic training and, and also what they call advanced individual training.  Then I got stationed permanently at Fort Sill, Oklahoma which was a good time for me, you know.  And then I re-enlisted from Fort Sill, Oklahoma to Chicago because I was, I wanted to come back to Chicago--(unclear)
Speaker 1: simultaneously). So is this '64 [1964] or '65 [1965] when you're back in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is it right around that time?
Speaker 2: Sixty, yeah '64 [1964] or '65 [1965] right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you wanted to come back because you missed being here.  You were, it was--?
Speaker 2: My love was here.
Speaker 1: Your love was here?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. (laughter)
Speaker 2: At, at that time yeah, my, yeah I, I wanted to come, yeah sure yeah so I just wanted to come back here.
Speaker 1: Okay. And--So what I don't understand is how you got involved with SNCC.  You know was that, was it the time--you got involved in SNCC here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: In Chicago, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was happening?  You come back you know you're a service man, you know.  I mean you know I'm sure you're, you got a love here, you know.  You--.
Speaker 2: I'm married.
Speaker 1: You got married?
Speaker 2: I got married in '66 [1966] so, but I came back because--.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was her name?
Speaker 2: Sandra.
Speaker 1: Sandra, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.

Speaker 1: What are you involved with at this point [ca. 1965]?  You know I mean you know are you getting involved in community--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh I'm getting involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  I'm, you know I'm--I'm--fortunately because I was stationed in Chicago which was a kind of duty station where it was almost like a job, you reported for regularly at 7:30 in the morning and then at, unless you had extra duties like KP or guard duty or something like that at 4:30 you were off.  So you signed out and you went home.  You know I lived off base, things like that, so you know in my own apartment.  So it was like a job you know.  And when I was off, I was off so I got involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  I mean I met a friend through a friend and who was a part of SNCC and so I started hanging around with him you know and hanging around in, in the--with civil rights protesters and civil rights, members of civil rights organizations, CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], Bob Lucas.  I remember going to my first political convention with Bob Lucas and that was a CORE convention in I think it was 1966 in Columbus, Ohio you know.  And so I got exposed to those type of people that was involved in you know, and you know were doing what the civil rights you know people do, have a lot of meetings and do a lot of protesting.
Speaker 1: Now SNCC actually was started in the South right?
Speaker 2: Yeah it was started in the South, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so but it was more of a young person's group.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The membership was young.
Speaker 2: It was, it was Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: John Lewis, Julian Bond, right, Bob Moses, Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], [H.] Rap Brown, all of them came out, Cleve Walker, all of them came out of SNCC yeah.  Marion Berry was a, came through SNCC.  Oh there were a number of them, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Have you guys had a reunion?
Speaker 2: The last time we were all together, most of us were together was at Stokely's-- there was a memorial service for Stokley Carmichael and this had to have been three or four years ago you know so we were all together there at, at his memorial service.  That's the last time we all got together for an actual reunion type thing.
Speaker 1: Well I have one point of clarification you know 'cause a lot of us you know who are younger think of the civil rights as one sort of monolithic thing.  Julian Bond in his interview talked about SNCC being more, you know his focus was on the Southern Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now I know that Stokely took over SNCC right and then--.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --that's when Julian left.  But at what point in time were you involved in SNCC and it's you know--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) I was, I got involved when it was, when it became, it was moving  North, when the entire Civil Rights Movement was moving North, okay?  When Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] came [to Chicago in 1966] and, and became open housing and started dealing with Northern issues, issues of police brutality and those kind of things.  That's when I, I got involved in it during that phase, not during the southern phase when it was more like desegregating lunch counters and you know registering people, getting people the right to vote, ending the poll taxes and things like that you know.  I got involved in what I call the northern phase of the civil rights movement.
Speaker 1: And so that phase was like you said more on you know opening up housing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And labor, was labor a part of that yet?
Speaker 2: Labor was always a part of it, right, right.
Speaker 1: And so what were the issues you were dealing with here you know in Chicago and where were the headquarters you know here at and--?
Speaker 2: Well the headquarters was at 43rd and King Drive and we were--43rd and Calumet, between Calumet and King Drive.  But we were primarily dealing with the--you know in Chicago the Civil Rights Movement was open housing, you know ending of segregation, moving into different communities a lot of people moving to--but it was really dominated by the political culture of Chicago.  So if you were involved in the Civil Rights Movement you were an anti-Democratic machine you know.  And a lot of things although we were I guess the, what they call the 'Willis wagons' [cheap trailers used for schools in black neighborhoods] and trying to make the board of education more reflective of the black student population and getting control, but it all rested on the politics you know.  The mayor [Richard J. Daley] controlled the school board, the mayor controlled the police departments. The city council buttressed the segregated communities you know and the all white communities.  And so all, everything rest-, in Chicago more than any place else, it rested on the--breaking up the Democratic [Party] machine.  So a lot of the civil rights activities, the underpinnings or the underlying efforts and thrust was to engage politically in order to defeat the Daley machine.
Speaker 1: Now where was the main SNCC offices cause SNCC, the main headquarters was still--?
Speaker 2: In Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Atlanta.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then Marion Berry went, he went to DC to open up the office I think there.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Is what I think he said.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were the other major sort of centers for (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well I--the only other SNCC other than Washington, D.C., Chicago--I'm not sure whether or not SNCC actually, I can't recall any other Northern city where they were, where they was actually--Detroit I believe that there was a Detroit SNCC operation there. But that you know, I don't know.
Story_ID: 12743
Speaker 1: What were some of the theories coming out you know of this SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] movement as it moved North?  I'm saying did the discussion take on a different tone or whatever?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: It does (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right, more black power, more--I mean, when I say more it was predominantly black power.  Stokely [Carmichael, later Kwame Ture] started talking about "black is beautiful", black power, controlling the black community you know.  So you know during that time SNCC had expelled all the whites from the organization and things like--so it, it became more nationalistic and that was a part of what we were-- engaged in.  That's a part of what we were participating in, working our way through the, that kind of a process you know and it took a lot of time.  And then you know all of our efforts during those days, I mean a lot of our efforts was--you know, there was internal struggles and battles for power and that kind of stuff so that, that certainly took up a lot of the time also.
Speaker 1: Now was Stokely the clear leader of SNCC at that point?
Speaker 2: At, at, at one point in time, yeah Stokely was (unclear).
Speaker 1: And what was his background and where did he come from and why do you, you know, what is, what are your views about him and his--?
Speaker 2: Well Stokely came from the West Indies, yeah from the West Indies I believe.  He's out of New York.  I believe it was out of New York.  And he was a very charismatic person, you know.  He was a hero to a lot of us.  He was smart.  At the time, he represented youthful rebellion against the, the leadership, the old style leadership of Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and others who we thought you know at the time--I mean we're young you know, and--. I tell you, I understand it now more than I understood it then because that's how a lot of young people view me and others of my generation now you know.  So he, he rebelled, you know he led the rebellion against the old generation type leadership okay, to a great extent.  And I thought that he was very, very important for the time that he was providing leadership.  You know at that time you had a lot of urban rebellions and things like that and between Stokely and [H.] Rap [Brown] they became to symbolize a lot of that.  Stokely ultimately started being more involved in African/African American pursuits, interests.  I think he started the African, All African People's Party and he ultimately moved to Africa and lived in Africa until, and ultimately died in Africa.  But he came back to, to the States a few months before he, before he ultimately passed in order to get medical treatment.  But he, he was a very dedicated man and I guess to me represented a young person who was committed and dedicated and that's what I got out of, got from Stokely and tried to inculcate that into my attitude about what I was doing.
Speaker 1: And he coined the term black power didn't he?  Was that true?
Speaker 2: Well he, yeah he, he's given credit for, for--yeah he coined the term on a march with Dr. King, started a chant, "Black power, black power, black power!" you know.  And I guess probably you know the influences at that time was Malcolm [X] and Dr. King you know and some of us leaned more toward Malcolm because he represented more of a Northern perspective.  You know he was dealing with the issues that we were really concerned--police brutality--. And you know we had the right to vote here so it wasn't that kind of thing you know.  And you know he was, his attitude was you know black--self respect you know which were some of the things that you know appealed to us as young people you know.  Not turning the other cheek but you know standing up and being a man and that kind of thing.  So those messages resonated with, with a lot of us.
Speaker 1: Now you were, now your, are you still in the service at this point or at some point in the process--?
Speaker 2: No, I was discharged on April 20th, 1968, which was about two weeks after Dr. King was killed.  And I was, it wasn't--and I was honorably discharged which again I believe that God does intervene in certain things because I had been AWOL [Absent Without Leave] since the, the evening of Dr. King's murder you know.  I was out on the streets you know and they didn't know where I was and so I didn't know whether or not I was going to be discharged or not.  But the army decided that they wanted to get rid of me, okay and so they gave me an honorable discharge and that's why I was you know, that was it, you know.  But I you know, I was out on the streets.  I was on the West Side [of Chicago] when the, during the riots of '68 [1968].
Story_ID: 12744
Speaker 1: Well yeah, it's 1968 I get, I get discharged from the service but prior to, during that time from sixty, the end of '66 [1966] all the way up until '68 [1968] I'm still involved in the civil rights movement.  I mean I'm going to the service during the day and at night I'm a protester, I'm a member of the civil--I mean I'm a member of SNCC, going to community meetings and things like that and being involved in the actual determinations about where we go and how we get there and those kinds of things in terms of the community.  And, and, but I get, I get discharged on April the 4th of '68 [1968], April the 20th of 1968 and prior to me being discharged about a month, I guess maybe two or three months prior to me being discharged I--because Stokley was coming to Chicago to speak at a national, the NAACP youth division rally in Maywood, Illinois.  I along with Robert Brown, Bob Brown here (unclear) with Stokley's people, with Stokley's leaders here in, in Chicago, we go out to Maywood and we you know in order to check things out and set up the rally and work with the people who had invited Stokley.  And the time that I, at that time Fred Hampton was the leader of the NAACP youth division so that's where I first met Fred was during this visit of Stokley's and preparing for this visit of Stokley's.  And so we, we had--Stokley came and we went out there for that, for that visit and we began to develop a relationship with Fred Hampton.  And about six months after that then Stokley leaves SNCC, is invited to join the Black Panther Party as a member of the central committee and he meets with us here in Chicago and asks us to also join the Panther Party cause SNCC was, SNCC was on the decline at that period of time so that he could have a base of operation inside the panther party, and we did you know.  And I went out to, right up in June of'68 [1968] I mean I was discharged in April.  June of '68, [1968], I'm out in Oakland, California meeting with Eldridge (unclear), Eldridge Cleaver, Huey Newton, Bobby Seales and David Hilliard asking them to allow, to authorize us to have a chapter of the Black Panther Party  here in Chicago, you know.  So that's how that transition takes place.
Speaker 2: So now this, what is the  Black Panther Party represent?  What, one is of attraction to you and what does it represent that you know SNCC didn't represent?  You know SNCC was sort of you know you said losing (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, SNCC like a loose, I mean like a loose amalgam of youthful energy and ideas.  The Panthers represented discipline and organization all right, and a coherent philosophy.  And it was a direct, it, it, it confronted issues that I thought was, was relevant.  Police brutality you know had not been confronted on the level that it had been during the Panther Party.  And I mean I, I respected the discipline of the Panther Party and how--.
Speaker 2: Can you speak to me a little bit more about that discipline?
Speaker 1: Well the fact is, is that you know you had one, you had a ten point platforming program.  It started up from that you know so you could articulate exactly what you were about you know through the ten point platforming program.
Speaker 2: What was the--?
Speaker 1: We want freedom, we want the power to determine the destiny of the black community, we want full employment for black people, we want the end to the brutality and murdering of, of black people, you know it was, you know we want community control of economic development in our community, we want (unclear), just we had ten you know just--and, and in order to be a Panther you had to under, you had to learn that and be able to recite that.  We had political education classes.  You know there was a militaristic discipline that you had there in terms of you know--and because I had service experience then that, that appealed to me that you know that type of discipline.  And, and it also appealed to me because the Panther Party represented you know you just couldn't be a Panther, you had to study.  You know you had to, to understand different theories of, of revolution and you had to study you know people's movements and things like that.  I mean I learned so much in the Panther party.  It's you know it's, it's really a foundation for who I am today to a great extent.  You know I mean Huey Newton was a, was a genius you know.  He was a theoretician, he was a philosopher.  I mean I learned about not only Carl Marx but Hegel, I learned about so many philosophers you know and, and I was kind of attracted to that to a certain extent because I loved to read and that's been, its always been a lifelong passion of mine.  So Nietzche, Hegel, I mean there's a book called "The Pedagogy of the Oppressed" [by Paulo Freire], "Frantz Fanon "The Wretched of the Earth" and those kind of, all those books appealed to me, (unclear) "The Autobiography of Malcolm X."  So you know we had a chance to study and deliberate on those kind of issues and, and those kind of discussions.  You know Marx, Lenin, you know and those things you know really, really gave me an insight that you had to have body and mind working coherently in order to be effective you know.  And certainly the Panther Party emphasized not only the development of the body but also the development of the mind and, and you know it gave me a foundation.
Speaker 2: Now when you had that first meeting out in, the meeting with Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton--?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: --what was that like?  I mean was it--?
Speaker 1: I was intimidated to a certain extent you know.  I thought they were kind of arrogant you know a lot arrogant.  You know as a matter of fact they, they did not authorize me to, to organize the chapter in Illinois.  They told me that they already had a chapter in Illinois and, and they, they had authorized a guy by the name of Drew Ferguson to, to have a chapter, Panther Party here in Chicago.  But I was from Chicago so I knew what Chicago was, but I didn't know what Drew and them were doing.  You know they didn't do anything.  And so although I did not, I left there with a, with--they did give me some papers and some buttons to come back with and I got you know a few hundred buttons, a few hundred papers and I brought those, you know the Panther Party papers I brought those back.  But I just didn't, wasn't deterred by what they said cause I knew what was going on.  So we in fact opened up an office and I know these guys who were masquerading as Panthers, they didn't have an office.  Nobody knew how to reach them, know where to find them. And so we, I opened up an office.  I went to my friend--Sammy Rayner who was a former alderman and established, you know has the Rayner Funeral Home, I went to him and asked him to lease this office for us and he did you know at 2350 West Madison and we got a phone and you know and, and we opened up the Panther Party headquarters there and stared functioning as Panthers you know.  We would get the papers there because they were sending us papers back and forth because you know they wanted to sell as many papers they could.  They didn't care who sold the papers as long as they you know got the money for them so we were selling papers.
Story_ID: 12745
Speaker 1: Yeah, we came back and we had the, so we set up an office.  I met Fred Hampton at--I think Stokely [Carmichael, later Kwame Ture] came to speak at a place called the Afro Arts Museum which ultimately became the headquarters of the El Rukn street gang at 39th and Drexel.  It used to--prior to the El Rukns taking it over it was called the Afro Arts Theater and they had a, a rally and Stokely came to speak.  Well I asked, I called Fred and asked Fred to meet us there after the rally and (unclear) and meet Bob Brown and I and we met and we asked him to join with us to organize a chapter of the Black Panther party and he decided to become a member of the Black Panther Party.  And so we had the office open, Fred Hampton had become a member and we had the other SNCC people who was, who, who originally were members of SNCC they joined the Panther party also, so we had a functioning little cadre of people here in Chicago.  Still didn't have, not had the authorization from [the national leadership of the BPP in] Oakland, California.  Well it just so happens that around the first of December of '68 [1968] there were two Panthers on a plane, Landon Williams and Masah (ph.) Hewitt, Raymond Masah Hewitt and they were on their way from New York to Oakland.  And they got into this discussion about whether or not this was the same between New York and Oakland and Oakland and Cuba.  And so in their naïveté they decided to ask the stewardess.  Well when they asked the stewardess during this time you know planes were being hijacked and sent to Cuba and all that.  So they went and asked her and she freaked and she called, I mean she went up to the, to the, to the cockpit and told the captain.  The captain landed the plane in Chicago rather than going to California.  It landed in Chicago, took them off the plane, handcuffed them, put them in jail, all right, in Cook County Jail.  They had one phone call, they called Oakland to tell them that they were in Chicago in jail.  Oakland had one phone number of anybody in Chicago, not the guys who they said was members of the Panthers.  They had our phone number of our headquarters okay, so they had to call us to get these guys out of jail to get you know--so that's how we became an official chapter of the Black Panther party because the--we were the only ones they, who they could contact because we had the, we had the only office, the only operation here and so that's, from that time on we became a recognized chapter of the, of the Black Panther party.
Story_ID: 12746
Speaker 1: What happened with the whole Fred Hampton and the, you know the Chicago Seven and--?
Speaker 2: Well Fred was a, Fred Hampton was a charismatic, dynamic, courageous, effective, talented spokesman and individual.  He was, he had a, had trained himself to speak in the mode of a Baptist preacher so he could move a crowd and he could articulate so well and he could move a crowd and he could simplify complex, complicated ideas and bring them down to a level where the common person could identify with him and be motivated by him.  And so, Fred emerged as one of the most dynamic leaders in the, in the [Black] Panther Party based on his leadership or his ability to speak and move people.  And so, and the Illinois chapter was becoming so effective through the various programs.  We, you know, we used to say that Oakland [California, headquaters of the national leadership] had a lot of theory but Chicago had all the practice okay, and Oakland would come up with these, some of these great ideas and stuff but we were implementing in Chicago.  And so we created a vast network of Breakfast for Children programs and we created the, a, a, a very, very strong free medical clinic, actually had a medical clinic here in Chicago on 16th and Avers where the only requirement for people to get service there--through trained professionals, I mean when we talk about medical we just had, we had doctors who during their day were, had their own practice but in the evening they would come over to the free medical clinic.  You know we had doctors who were on staff at different hospitals but then they would also be staff in our medical clinics, you know including Quentin, Quentin Young and--there, there were a number of others who I still have very close relationships with.  But they would come over and so we had the medical clinic, we had free food programs and various other kinds of programs.  So we became a real threat to the power structure here in the city and all across the country and so they, the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] targeted us.  They dispatched a lot of informants into the organization, they raided our office on, on a number of occasions and ultimately they set up a plan to murder Fred and myself. And on December the 4th, 1969, they did in fact come onto the West Side in an apartment where Fred was staying at.  I was supposed to have been in that apartment. And they shot that apartment up, killed Fred and a guy out of, a Panther out of Peoria by the name of Mark Clark.  They wounded seven Panthers in, in that apartment and so he, he was ultimately killed by--because they used an informant, a guy who ultimately killed himself, committed suicide by running in, out on the expressway, a few years after that, guy by the name of William O'Neal who was the informant for the FBI, but they, they killed Fred Hampton and Mark Clark on December the 4th, 1969.
Speaker 1: And what role did you play in the, I mean were the two of you the most, the most--known?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were.  Right, we were.  Fred, I was actually the, what they called a deputy minister of defense for a while and then I ultimately became the Illinois chairman.  I was deputy minister of defense because I had the military experience okay, and Fred was the deputy chairman.  And during that time Huey [Newton] had defined the state of America, of black America as being at war.  So at that time the deputy minister of defense was actually the, the, the wartime leader per se and then the deputy chairman during the, the peacetime era and the deputy chairman would emerge.  And so I was the minister of defense and Fred was the chief spokesman for the party and also the spiritual leader of the party, really and truly he was.  I was more of a theoretician and a person who could, could implement a lot of the things to, cause--but Fred would be able to move the masses in, in a much more effective way you know.
Speaker 1: So were you stockpiling guns and things like that during that time?
Speaker 2: Oh we had guns, I mean yeah.  We had--I wouldn't say we were stockpiling them, you know but, yeah but we had guns, yeah sure, yeah we had guns.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) (Unclear) Okay, and then--.
Speaker 2: But only for self defensive purposes.
Speaker 1: And then, but at the same time what's interesting the whole thing was growing, empowering and self-help in many ways?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.  You know we wanted to make a difference.  We wanted to make sure that, you know we, again out of that era of the Panther party I mean look at something like sickle cell anemia which most of us know about today.  Well during that time nobody really knew about sickle cell anemia.  Doctor's didn't know how to diagnose it because they had not been trained about it.  So the Panther party understood the contradiction between here you have a disease like sickle cell anemia that mostly affected black people and a medical profession that did not recognize, nor, recognize it (unclear) so therefore they could not diagnose it right.  And so we started an effort to test people for sickle cell anemia to raise the contradiction around sickle cell anemia and we in fact were very successful you know because now it's a recognizable disease, most people know about it.  There were, at one time there were a plethora of organizations finally just to deal with it but it all came out because of the Panther party's educational and conscious raising the campaign to teach people about sickle cell anemia.  You know, the Breakfast for Children program, you know we embarrassed America with the Breakfast for Children program.  You know we embarrassed America with the Breakfast for Children program because we felt as though our community should be self reliant enough to make sure that our children were fed before they went home, went to school to, went to school in order to be educated but that wasn't happening.  So we decided to you know rather than pontificate over it, work on the problem.  So we developed the Breakfast for Children program.  We fed thousands of children, you know.  The medical clinic came about, around the same thing, free food give away and this was all about organizing our community into an effective force, you know.  A lot of the model was borrowed, borrowed from Saul Alinsky you know and also from the Daley machine, political machine, you know--earning the loyalty of your community by providing services to the community.
Story_ID: 12747
Speaker 1: Now did you, after Fred Hampton's and Mark Clark's death, that had some affect on you right and on the--?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I mean you know, like--yeah, there was a lot of soul searching going on and it had, it had a--and I think that it certainly transformed me because I had never been, you know I had always frowned on being out front. I'd always frowned on being a spokesman and I was kind of thrust into that you know after Fred was killed.  And so I, I went through a lot of changes as, as it relates to that.  The direction of the [Black Panther] Party, you know, the chapter here [Chicago, Illinois]-- which way was it going to go? you know.  Eldridge Cleaver had a lot of influence during the time Huey Newton was in prison, was in, at prison, and I think he was in some prison for about three or four years for the killing of a police officer in Oakland, California.  And so during that time Eldridge Cleaver emerged as the key spokesman, the dominant figure in the Panther party and Eldridge was a person who was very, very inflammatory in terms of his speeches, in terms of how he would try to influence the organization you know and confrontations with police departments you know certainly increased during that period of time.  And, and when Huey got out he wanted the party to go into a different direction so he began to start emphasizing service programs and started emphasizing more community service and rather, and organizing politically rather than focusing on these conflicts with the police department.  He became, Eldridge led us into a military direction and Huey wanted to bring us more back into what he, out of, out of what he called the twilight zone back into an era where we were blending in with the community more, wasn't--the community would view us as being responsible as opposed to be irresponsible, providing services and, and approaches that the community could relate to, utilizing the electoral system more effective, effectively, yeah, and aggressively.  So those kinds of things was, was where the party began to, the direction that the party began to go into after 1972 when Huey got out of prison.  Bobby Seale ran for Mayor of Oakland, California back in I think '74 [1974] or '76 [1976] something like that.

Speaker 1: --We're gonna do is we'll slate the interview, and I just need to have you start out by stating your name and spelling it for us.  But let me just start out by saying, my name is Julieanna Richardson, and I'm the interviewer.  And Scott Stearns is the videographer, and observing is Carolyn Rush, your wife, and Debra Johnson--Debra Johnson.  And I'd like to have you start out by stating your name and spelling it for us.
Speaker 2: Okay, my name is Bobby L. Rush [HistoryMaker Bobby Rush], B-O-B-B-Y, L., R-U-S-H, Rush.
Speaker 1: And today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is 5/14--5/15/14 [May 15, 2014].
Speaker 1: And our location?
Speaker 2: Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: And we're at the office of The HistoryMakers, is that right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Office of the History, the--we're at the office of The HistoryMakers located on the, in the South Loop area, South Side of the City of Chicago, the great South Side.
Story_ID: 671668
Speaker 1: So, I want to, you know, I was talking about this, but I'm really taking us back now to 1969.  And I'd like you to talk about, from your view, what actually happened?
Speaker 2: Well, Fred Hampton, the most courageous, most powerful, most talented young man that I have seen or worked with, that I am, that I know about, and particularly at the age at which he was killed.  He was twenty-one when he was killed.  So Fred Hampton was already--had innate gifts that far exceeded most young men his age.  He was really a leader of men, very powerful speaker, very articulate.  But also, very courageous, had the courage of a lion.  And if I would pick one animal, one of God's creation that most symbolized or had the same attributes as Fred, I would say the lion.  And he was one with the power of words and through his voice, through his passion, was able to move people, and he was a real threat to the establishment because of his undying love for black people and his--not just black people for all people, especially those who were poor, and o-, and oppressed.  Fred--I guess his passion stimulated us--evolved or immersed out of his love for people, those who were disadvantaged.  He developed a voice to speak because he had this sense that someone had to speak for the voiceless.  And so he--he developed this speaking gift and this, he was able to speak just so brilliantly.
Story_ID: 671669
Speaker 1: The '60s [1960s] was full of young people blossoming into, not only adulthood but also to a sense of history and destiny, who, because of the Civil Rights Movement and the anti-war movement and the social justice movement around the world, they became very much aware of their own powers and their own abilities to make things happen.  And they--we set out to change the world in the generational leadership in the '60s [1960s].  And so I started out as a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.  And a fellow by the name of Bob Brown and I, we were like the official Chicago [Illinois] chapter of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
Speaker 2: Now, was Jim Forman, [HistoryMaker] James Forman, had he--who recruited you then or was it just--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, we were with Stokely--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture].
Speaker 1: Bob was, Stokely was the, one of the chairmen of SNCC.  He--I think he succeeded [HistoryMaker] John Lewis, I believe.  And Stokely--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So this is after Stokely had sort of taken over SNCC?
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is after Stokely, after Black Power and all of that, after the split with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And we were the local chapter here.  And Stokely had been asked by Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton] and Bobby Seale to become a part of the Black Panther Party, to be on the Central Committee of the Black Panther Party, which was a young organization at the time but emerging on the scene.  And Stokely had agreed, but Stokely wanted to have a base of operation outside of Oakland, California.  So he asked Bob and I to follow him into the Panther Party.  In order to do that, then I had to go to California to ask for the authority to set up the chapter here, the Illinois chapter.  I had to be authorized by the Central Committee.
Story_ID: 671670
Speaker 1: So I went out one day in June of, I think it might have been '68 [1968] or so, and met with Eldridge [Eldridge Cleaver] and Bobby Seale.  Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton] was in prison.  June Hilliard, David Hilliard, Kathleen, I remember meeting with Kathleen and I--
Speaker 2: Kathleen Cleaver?
Speaker 1: Kathleen Cleaver, Eldridge's wife at the time.  And I was met at the airport by a fellow by the name of Don Cox [Donald L. Cox], D.C.  And I stayed with D.C. and so D.C. kind of took me around to meet with all these people.  And I went out there for the purpose of being, getting authorization, the official authorization to create an Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party.  And I never will forget, I was denied.  They said, "Well, you're too late.  We already got a chapter there in Chicago [Illinois], a fellow named, by the name of Drew Ferguson."  And I was very much aware of Drew Ferguson and the so-called Panthers in Chicago, and they were just a fellow, a group of, small group of individuals who weren't really committed to the--organizing their community.  They were more committed to profiling, you know, wearing the beret and marching around in a militaristic kind of way.  They, they weren't willing to roll up their sleeves and really challenge anything and organize and create programs.  And so I knew what these fellows represented and what they were really doing in Chicago.  But the one thing that made a difference for me was that they said, "Okay, well, you can't authorize, you can't set up, organize a chapter here in Illinois, in Chicago, but what you can do is sell our newspapers."  So they gave me a couple big bundles of newspapers and a bag of buttons with the Panther on it.  And so I brought those back, and I knew that Drew Ferguson didn't have an office.  And nobody knew how to reach him.  And so although they said I wasn't authorized, I'm not a fellow who takes no very well, and especially when I know what I'm talking about, I know what's going on. So I proceeded to gather up support to open an office.  And I remember riding on the bus, on the Madison Street bus, going from Homan Avenue to downtown.  And I just happened to be looking out the bus, watching people, and I saw this former bank next to this funeral home.  And it had a big for rent sign.  So I got off at the next stop, walked back and talked to the guy, the man who owned the record shop on the first floor.  And he, a white guy, and he told me what he, what would be required.  And so we didn't have, I didn't have any money.  And so I called my friend, Alderman Sammy Rayner [A.A. "Sammy" Rayner], who I really admired, had a lot of respect for.  He was very progressive.  And I asked Sammy to pay the, give us some money for the down payment for the rental of the office.  He did.  I asked him to turn the gas on in his name.  He did.  I think I might have asked him for the money to turn on the telephone which we had.  And so we had an office.  We had people who started coming to the office.  We had a phone with a phone number.  This was in, probably the first month, month and a half, and obviously, the phone bill hadn't come out or at least, you know, they hadn't turned the phone off.
Story_ID: 671671
Speaker 1: So December of that year--this was all in about October of 1968.  By December of that year, there were, there was two Panthers on an airplane coming from New York [New York], going back--they had spoken at a rally in New York, and they were heading back to California.  And so they got in this discussion--just a, you know, friendly discussion, debate about whether or not it was closer to go from New York to California or New York to Cuba.  And in the heat of their discussion--now, you gotta understand, these are times, this is a time when a lot of hijackings were going on, planes being hijacked and going to Cuba.  So that was almost a weekly occurrence.  And so in the midst of this heated--not heated, or animated discussion between these two Panthers on the plane, they decided they were gonna get a third party to answer the question, and they asked one of the flight attendants, the stewardess--at that time, they called them stewardesses--whether that was closer or the same distance going from New York to California as from New York to Cuba.  And when they asked her that question, the--I am told the lady turned beet red, calmly walked to the, where the captain is, in the front of the plane, and told the captains about these two strange black men talking about going to Cuba.  And he, rather than going straight to San Francisco [California], he stopped in Chicago [Illinois].  The FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] met the plane, took these two Panthers off the plane and escorted them to the Cook County Jail [Chicago, Illinois].  Now, they were in Chicago in the Cook County Jail, a long way from California, and they could make one phone call, all right.  They called Oakland [California].  Oakland had my phone number, the office that we had set up, didn't have Drew Ferguson's number, had our number because that was the only, because they wanted to get their monies and they wanted to keep in communication by selling the newspapers, right?  So they had all the information.  So they called us and asked us to look into the, look into this matter and see about these two Panthers who were in jail.  So that's how we really became an official chapter of the Black Panther Party because we had the sense enough to open up an office and get a phone.  And we developed a relationship.  That was the tipping point.
Story_ID: 671672
Speaker 1: So how do you meet Fr- Fred Hampton?  Where does that, where does that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Fred, I met Fred--Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] came in to speak at a, at a rally for the NAACP youth committee [NAACP Youth Council], which was located in Maywood [Illinois].  And Fred Hampton was the youth director of the Maywood chapter of the NAACP.  And they sponsored this rally.  And when Stokely came in, I went with Stokely out to, for their rally, and that's where I really met Fred, and we became good friends.  And, so when we decided to organize the chapter, Bob [Bob Brown] and I--Bob did not, he was a kind of a guy who didn't wanna have any kind of upfront role.  He always wanted to be behind the scenes.  So he, he--we decided to call Fred up and ask Fred to join us.  And I never will forget that afternoon.  I called Fred--I had called Fred a couple of days earlier, and he told me to get back to him.  And it was, I was at the old Afro-Arts Theater at 39th [Street]--this is Phil Cohran [HistoryMaker Philip Cohran].  And he had organized this theater right at 39th and--at Oakwood Boulevard--no, 39th and Lake Park [Avenue] in Chicago [Illinois].  And it later became the, known as the fort, the Jeff--the Blackstone Rangers headquarters, El Rukn headquarters (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: The same building.  And it was about five o'clock that Saturday afternoon.  There was a concert there.  Phil Cohran was doing a concert, and I never will forget going into one of the phone booths and--out in the corridor, and calling Fred up about five o'clock that afternoon, on a Saturday afternoon.  And I asked him, I said, "Well, what are you gonna do, man?  You gonna meet with us or not?"  He said, "Yeah, I'm gonna meet with you."  So I was just so elated.  I went back and told Bob, "We got him.  He, he's gonna meet with us.  He's gonna help us to organize the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party."  And the rest is history.  He became the deputy chairman.  I was the deputy minister of defense for the Illinois chapter.  And so that's how I met Fred, and I still, even today, marvel at his genius and marvel at his power.  And it's not a day that goes by that I don't reflect on Fred Hampton and his contribution, and even at the age of twenty-one years old, his impact on the--American history and politics and social--the movement for social justice.  You know, he is someone who paid a major price.  He--he made the ultimate sacrifice, but he had so much love that--for his people, that somehow Fred still lives on today and in the minds and in the hearts of so many people who knew him and those who wanted to know him.  He was just a tremendous young man, at twenty-one years old, such a major, major impact, a brilliant strategist and just a remarkable young man.
Story_ID: 671673
Speaker 1: What were you doing then, as a group once you set up your office?  What are you doing as, as a group?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we--the things that they talked about in Oakland [California], we did in Chicago [Illinois].  They talked about breakfast for children program in Oakland.  We had 'em in Chicago.  We had, you know, just hundreds of children every morning before they went to school, in church basements, storefronts, we had them coming and eating a hot breakfast.  And the whole theory about that is that we knew that a child cannot learn if they're hungry.  It's just impossible.  The body doesn't function, the brain doesn't function well without nourishment.  And so, and in this country, there were too many people, young people, especially young, urban minorities, young blacks going to school hungry.  And we wanted to raise the contradiction that in this wealthy society, why would we have young people, young children going to school hungry.  And so we developed, not just a complaint about it, but we conscientiously developed programs around it.  We had a commitment to deal with the hunger here in America, especially as it related to young people.  So we would go out, weeks before or a night before and talk to business people in the community.  I remember Joe Louis Milk Company [Chicago, Illinois].  They would make sure that we had enough milk and there were so many other people who, you know, who contributed to make sure there was bread and eggs and sausage and bacon provided 'cause we was just feeding these children.  And there was nothing required of them.  We didn't ask, they weren't--we didn't ask them to become a member of the Black Panther Party.  They was six, seven, eight, nine, ten years old.  But we, that became a centerpiece.  So we spent a lot of time around those kind of programs.  We (unclear) putting up free, a free health center, you know.  And, Julieanna [Julieanna Richardson], I just wanted, I was so proud just to be a part of that because out of that health center, the Spurgeon "Jake" Winters free health center [Spurgeon "Jake" Winters People's Free Medical Care Center, Chicago, Illinois] on West 16th Street, out of that experience, we've had five members of the Illinois chapter who are, who went on to become physicians.  One, (unclear) who was in California, a former member of the Black Panther Party, she was the third, I think she was the first black woman to become an orthopedic surgeon, right.  And she's still out there as a doctor in California.  And we had--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Do you remember her name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know her name, but I'm not sure she wants that information shared, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay, sure.
Speaker 2: But, yeah, I'm in contact with her (cough).  We've had the medical director of the City of New Orleans [Louisiana] come out of the chapter.  We've had one now who is a nurse practitioner, not a doctor, in the nursing.  But we've had five physicians to come out of that.  One, the former head of the Oak Forest Hospital [Oak Forest Health Center, Oak Forest, Illinois] and, so we've had just so many powerful people to emerge out of the Illinois chapter.  And so that health center did change, gave people a pathway to the future. And I'm just, so we, we were working on those programs. And then we also, you know, raised a lot of contradictions around the schools.  I mean we were having these problems in--from what I remember, you know, I recall, after the assassination of Fred Hampton--and it was an assassination, clear.  It was probably the one, the first political assassination or one of the few political assassinations in this country.  And all of the local government, the Chicago Police Department, the county government, the federal government, they all were in collusion.  They all conspired to kill Fred, and, but I remember as a result of Fred's death, we organized a school strike in Chicago, high school students.  And I remember, we had twenty-five thousand youngsters from all over the city, marching down State Street in response because of--to Fred's murder and the surrounding events in the, in the schools.
Story_ID: 671674
Speaker 1: So, and the whole city was politicized.  Twenty-five--after Fred's assassination, twenty-five thousand people made their way over to that apartment and, because the police, in their haste, after they came in at four o'clock in the morning, shot and killed Fred [Fred Hampton], I mean--and the way--just to take a moment and talk about it, the police had an informant on the inside, William O'Neal.  And he was a paid informant for the, for the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], and he had given them a diagram because the FBI originally was gonna raid the apartment.  But then they backed off and turned it over to Edward V. Hanrahan [Edward Hanrahan], the Cook County state's attorney at the time.  And Hanrahan was the heir apparent to Richard J. Daley, and he thought that by him coming in, attacking that apartment, and killing Panthers [Black Panther Party] and arresting Panthers, that he would be the next mayor of the City of Chicago [Illinois].  And so Hanrahan came at four o'clock in the morning, his police came at four o'clock in the morning, knocked on the door.  Some went to the front and some went to the back.  Those on the front door knocked on the door.  Mark Clark from Peoria [Illinois] was there, and Mark, he was on guard that day--at that time.  We had people, we always had a Panther on security then at night 'cause we expected a raid at any point in time.  So Mark answered, "Who is it?" And there was a voice on the other side saying, "Tommy."  And Mark said, "Tommy who?"  And the voice said, "Tommy gun," and that's when they fired a shot, started, the shooting started, one bullet and shot Mark in the heart.  He died instantly.  Well, and the first shot, then that signaled the ones in the back to come in.  They came in, machine guns and shooting just wildly.  Fred was laying in his bed, asleep.  We later found out that he had been sedated by Seconal, they said they had a--the, the--it was later, our attorneys at the time, saw that Fred had as Seconal--after our own autopsy--he had enough Seconal in his body, that they said would disenable an elephant.  So Fred was sedated with Seconal.  He had no way to defend himself at all.  They shot him in the head, killed him.  Killed--they shot other Panthers, seven Panthers were arrested, and they wounded other Panthers.  And so, but in their haste--well, this is four o'clock in the morning, dark outside, December in Chicago, cold, they neglected to seal the apartment off.  They had no patrolmen, no police out there to, guarding the apartment.  They just ran out of the neighborhood, and they ran and killed Fred, Mark, two Panthers, wounded seven and ran back out.  They were trying to get out of the neighborhood so they forgot to seal the apartment, and they forgot to put police guards around the apartment.  The apartment was left wide open.  Our attorneys went in and got the door that, that the first bullets had entered through.  We got, had that door and we were able to go in to see exactly what happened.  And so as a result of that, later that morning, people started coming in.  And we started taking 'em on a tour of the apartment.  And so, again, twenty-five thousand people, our count was in excess of twenty-five thousand people came walking through that apartment at 2337 West Monroe [Street].  And when you looked, when you walked through that apartment, you knew that this could not have been a shootout, which the police asserted, that it had to be a--that there was, they--there was a shoot in, not a shootout.  A grand jury investigation later determined that there might have possibly been one round shot from the inside and ninety-nine rounds shot from the outside where the police are.  So it clearly was an assassination, all right.
Story_ID: 671675
Speaker 1: That--December the 4th, 1969 was the day that really marks, it's a day of history as it relates to the black community, Democratic politics in this city [Chicago, Illinois] and the politics of the nation.  And I say that because as a result of Fred Hampton's murder by Edward Hanrahan, and he was an operative of the or a leader in the Democratic hierarchy, the black community at that point in time completely severed its automatic relationship that had existed in terms of its support to the Democratic Party.  We were, in the next election for state's attorney, we were able to defeat Edward Hanrahan and elect a Republican, Bernard Carey, as the state, state's attorney and ultimately, Fred's murder led to the election of Harold Washington because that relationship had been severed on December the 4th, 1969, with the assassination of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark.  And there's just so much associated with that, you know.  I was talking with a friend of mine last week, and he was a member of the Disciples [Gangster Disciples] at the time.  And the Panthers [Black Panther Party] and Fred was in the center of trying to bring unity and a more social awareness to some of the street gangs who did not have a political philosophy, who did not have a political understanding or who were more, who were (unclear) in their consciousness as opposed to being progressive or revolutionary in their consciousness.  And we tried to bring some of these folks together, and that became a threat to the power structure because they didn't wanna see the Stones [Blackstone Rangers] and the Vice Lords and the Disciples and the Satan's Lovers [sic. Satan Lovers], they didn't wanna see all these people coming together on behalf of their community and--because they were organized and they had some discipline, and they didn't wanna see that kind of force enter into the body politic.  They wanted to use us for their own selfish ends.  A lot of, a number of Daley's [Richard J. Daley] operatives came to us and tried to get us to support their candidate on Election Day.  But they didn't want us to be independent, an independent force for ourselves in terms of this city.  And, frankly, that's the way it is even today.
Story_ID: 671676
Speaker 1: This whole thing of, you know--that's why I wanted them to name that harbor [Margaret T. Burroughs Beach, Chicago, Illinois], and I haven't forgotten that, that (unclear) nice, the new harbor after [HistoryMaker] Margaret Burroughs.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: All right, I raised a lot, you know, I haven't forgot it.  It's just that other things were coming by and next thing you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't know that, okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wanted, you know, and then, not a harbor named for a black person in this city--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Margaret Burroughs was on the park district [Chicago Park District] for a long time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right, she was on the park district--
Speaker 1: And she's a big part of our history.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So why not name that harbor after Margaret Burroughs, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I--that's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: They have (unclear) head on, and I didn't really push it like, you know, 'cause you can't do everything.  And so, but now that this whole thrust about Obama's library [Barack Obama Presidential Center] and where it's gonna go and the fact, it's gonna be in Chicago [Illinois], it might be at time--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Opportune time to do something.
Speaker 1: Do something about it, you see (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: But there has, see, the problem that I find is we don't do enough planning.  And so when the opportunity--because that's what I was telling 'cause really, you know, there's money.  He's try--you know, there's money for tourism.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, you--and the thing is, is that the best--
Story_ID: 671677
Speaker 1: Now, you were not, you were a lucky person 'cause you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Blessed.
Speaker 1: --were not there that night.
Speaker 2: Blessed.  I was supposed to have been in that apartment, me and--we had, that Wednesday, no, Fred [Fred Hampton] was killed on a Wednesday [sic. Thursday].  That Tuesday night, we had a meeting.  This was during a retreat.  This all occurred during a retreat, Illinois chapter [of the Black Panther Party] retreat.  We had brought, we had all the local branches in Illinois to come together, you know, as a chapter, and then we had local branches.  And we had, you know, that's how Mark [Mark Clark] wound up in Chicago [Illinois].  He was with the Peoria [Illinois] branch.  We had the Rockford [Illinois] branch come here.  We had the Quad Cities branch.  We had the, the Champaign-Urbana [Illinois] branch.  We had the Cairo [Illinois] branch, all these folks, we had 'em come into Chicago for a retreat.  And that evening, that Tuesday night, we had our regular political education plan.  And so, and the central staff was gonna meet also that Tuesday night.  So we had really planned on spending the night in that apartment at 2337 [2337 West Monroe Street], but because we were all there, there wasn't enough room.  So we decided, well, there was gonna be some people--Fred actually lived there.  Doc Satchel [Ronald "Doc" Satchel] lived there.  He was on the central staff and the leadership group.  And so he and a few others, they decided that they would stay in that apartment--well, that's where they lived at all along.  And we went back to our homes.  I was, my apartment was right there in the Ickes [Harold L. Ickes Homes, Chicago, Illinois], I had, public housing right there at 22nd [Street] and State Street.  So I went to my home.  That's the reason why I wasn't there in that apartment that night.  And so, but the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigations] had given the state's attorneys, Edward Hanrahan, the information that we were all gonna be in that apartment.  So, again, you know, I wasn't there because I--the Lord just didn't--it wasn't my time, you know.  And I really say that I wasn't lucky, I was just blessed because I wasn't there in that apartment. I had something else--He had something else for me to do, so.
Story_ID: 671678
Speaker 1: So (cough), how long did it take you, I mean were you, I mean there had to be a sense of disbelief and, I mean though the Panthers said that they lived on the verge, you know, of things, but I mean one thing to sort of be gunned down.  But is it the thing that--I'm just trying to understand where your head is at, you know, if you are conscious or is it because there's such a outpouring of, of--outpouring from the black community and outrage that, you know, you're in the midst of that.
Speaker 2: Well, I, you know, we were, we were in the--I was, first of all, my immediate response was anger.  And we had planned on retaliating against the police.  But we got so caught up in the community's overwhelming response that that didn't make a lot of sense at the time because we started getting all the--through the media, we started attracting all this support from all over the place.  So that didn't, it didn't make a lot of sense at the time.  And so, but our first response was total anger.  Some operated from fear, a sense of fear and some of them, they left the party.  We lost a lot of members during that time.  But those of us who remained, you know, we became more resolved to honor Fred, to make sure his memory remained alive, to continue the work of the Panther Party [Black Panther Party].  We all expected to be killed, and there are a number of Panthers who were killed after Fred Hampton, who were killed, a number who were imprisoned before him, during the time he was in prison and after the time he was in prison.  A number of Panthers went to jail.  So it was all a part of our reality.  I never believed that I would live to be thirty years old.  You know, it was not, I--and, and we were, our lives exist--in Chicago [Illinois], our lives exist, or our existence was almost seasonal.  We knew that, or at least I felt, that when the summer, spring and summer months (background noise)--
Speaker 1: Hold on one second.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: You said you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I--what I meant by seasonal, living seasonally, you know, in Chicago, the winter is--I mean one thing, there's one kind of life we live in the wintertime in Chicago, and there's another kind of life we live in the summertime in Chicago.  Well, that rhythm, those seasonal changes, I felt that we were more safe or we were safer in the wintertime in Chicago than in summertime.  So, something innately said, okay, when it got to be summer, then you kind of get poised because, you know, that was the time that you were more apt to be shot down in summer than you were--the same way today.  You know, most people say that the violence occurs in the summertime.  And that's kind of how, those of us who live in the, in the black community are forced to survive, forced to live, you know.  When it's wintertime, although it's cold, you know that your chances of being shot down and killed are less.  And so I, again, I never fully expected to survive.  But I mean, death was always an immediate reality for us, you know.  You know, we even started, you know, to live--to die for the people, and, you know, to sacrifice your life for the people, ultimate sacrifice.  And so those kinds, that kind of thing was something that was not only that we, we espoused, but we expected it, you know.  We really expected to be killed and not to live into (unclear).  I never, I'm just so amazed and, and, that I'm alive today, and that's why I'm, I dedicate my life to Christ and do the things I do because, you know, I wasn't, you know, He saved me back in, on December the 5th, the day after Fred, they came to my apartment in the Hilliard [Raymond Hilliard Homes; Hilliard Towers Apartments, Chicago, Illinois] and shot my door down, and--expecting that I would be there.  And they had a warrant issued for my arrest after Fred was killed, and I was under--I went underground.  And so, and they wanted me--they wanted Fred dead, and they wanted me dead also (background noise).
Story_ID: 671679
Speaker 1: When you went underground, wasn't that when [HistoryMaker] Father George Clements, is that when he--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, the way I went--when I went underground, I was running for my life.  And we got in contact with Father Clements and asked him to hide me out at Holy Angels [Holy Angels Church, Chicago, Illinois].  So my first night or two, running from the police, I hid out at, in the rectory there at Holy Angels under the protection of Father George Clements.  And then I left there and went to the Near North Side [Chicago, Illinois] and wound up spending three or four days on Astor Street in, on the Gold Coast [Chicago, Illinois] in an apartment there.  I was living up in the attic, in a townhouse, right up in the attic.  Right among all the rich and wealthy people, here was this Panther hiding out in the neighborhood because that was a place that we knew that they would not raid quickly.  And so I was on the run for a few days, about three or four days after Fred [Fred Hampton] was killed.  I finally turned myself in on, to Reverend Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] on his stage at Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois].  At that time, it was Breadbasket [Operation Breadbasket], on that Saturday.  So at Operation Breadbasket, on that Saturday, and [HistoryMaker] Renault Robinson and [HistoryMaker] Howard Saffold and Kermit Coleman escorted me from my hideout to the headquarters of Operation Breadbasket, and I turned myself--before the public, to Reverend Jackson and was escorted into jail after that and bailed out the same day.  So that's, they saved my life when I went to PUSH.
Speaker 1: So, who negotiated that?  Was Reverend Jackson very instru- who negotiated?  Do you know, behind the scenes--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I--Kermit Coleman was really the one who put all that together.  He was our lawyer, and he was our messenger.  He, he and Renault and Howard, you know, they were all very close to one another.  So that's how that--and, you know, they were in contact with Reverend Jackson and so it was, primarily, it was Kermit and the other members of the Panther Party [Black Panther Party], Kermit Coleman.
Speaker 1: And now, what does--now, is Kermit Coleman, where does James Montgomery [HistoryMaker James D. Montgomery], where does he come in?  What is his--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, Jim, James Montgomery is an old friend.  My brother and Jim, Jim Montgomery were very close at one time.  They were, you know, and he was, he still is just a stellar lawyer, outstanding, exemplary lawyer.  And he was one of our lawyers.  And he, he--after Fred was killed, he represented a couple of the Panthers who had been charged, Doc Satchel [Ronald "Doc" Satchel] and others, who had been charged, criminally charged.  And Kermit was, I mean not Kermit, but Jim Montgomery was their attorney.  And I forget the name of the individual persons that he represented, but those who survived the raid on December the 4th, Jim Montgomery represented some of those.  And he was also representing me in some of--later on, in some of my--he continued to represent the Panther Party.  So he was the one that people would call in the middle of night, and say, "Jim, I need a lawyer because they've locked me up.  So will you come on down," and he would come down and see about us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now, what are you, how long is this period?  You know, 'cause we're talking about nineteen sxity--'70 [1970], you know, after the killing.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what period of time are you, you know, is it a month that you're, you know, underground, you know, or is it--
Speaker 2: No, I'm under--I went underground for--Fred was killed on a Wednesday.  I turned myself in on the Saturday.
Speaker 1: Okay, so a week?
Speaker 2: A week.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: No, less than a week.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, less than a week.
Story_ID: 671680
Speaker 1: First of all, you said the numbers went down.  I want to understand what were the numbers?  What were your membership numbers--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: At our height, we had about five hundred members in the Panther Party [Black Panther Party].  After the murder of Fred [Fred Hampton] and--well, there was a series of raids that, you know, during this period of time, right.  The first raid was in June of 1970--we were organized as a chapter here in Chicago [Illinois] in October of 1968.  Fred was, went to jail in May of 1969--no, he was released from jail in May of 1969.  He had an old charge on him, and he had been convicted of it.  They said, robbing, of armed robbery.  They said that he robbed a Good Humor ice cream truck driver, took seventy-one dollars' worth of merchandise, ice cream from the Good Humor ice cream truck driver and gave it out to the children in the community, in Maywood [Illinois] at the time.  So he had been convicted of that and sentenced to five years in jail as a result of that.  And he was on appeal bond.  And this was in May of 1969.  And so between May of 1969 and December, 1969, that was when Fred was killed.  So when, this all happened within a very, very short period of time.  You know, when you think about it, all this was packed into a very, very short sequence of, time sequence, very, very short.
Speaker 1: And who--so this is happening, and it's happening in Chicago, but there's also a larger stage.  Things are happening all over.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, but the work that is being done here, it almost seems like its own world in some respects, even though it has national notoriety, and you gain national notoriety as a result of that.  But can you correct me?
Speaker 2: Well, no, you're right.  Chicago has always been a microcosm of, of the national (unclear), always--when things happen in Chicago, for whatever reason, maybe it's because it's the middle of the country, it always have national reverberations and repercussions.  You know, Harold Washington's election, well, that created a big movement for other cities to have black mayors.  And, you know, you know, Carol Braun [HistoryMaker Carol Moseley Braun] being the first black United States--female U.S. senator since, black--first black female in history, you know, Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] being the president of the United States.  You know, Chicago has always had this national import surrounding it, you know, and the nation keeps its eye on Chicago for some reason.  And so the things that we do here, kind of effects the entire nation.
Speaker 1: So you, so what happens in '70 [1970]--'70 [1970], is that where the medical clinic [Spurgeon "Jake" Winters People's Free Medical Care Center, Chicago, Illinois] and the free breakfast program, you continue it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, all that, you know, we, we--
Speaker 1: It continued?
Speaker 2: It continued, well, there was--
Speaker 1: It was already happening.
Speaker 2: No, the health center did not get organized until after Fred was killed.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's what I have.
Speaker 2: But the breakfast program and all the other programs, the free sickle cell anemia programs, those kind of programs continued, you know, the bus and the (unclear) prison program, you know, all these programs in the Panther Party, which was meant to serve people and organize people, they continued.  And they--
Speaker 1: So is this, so you say the numbers are less.  How do you continue the program because your notoriety goes up, right?
Speaker 2: Well, we, you know, you, you--what we say in the (unclear)--we call 'em the armchair revolutionaries left when the real bullets started to fly.  But you had a solid core of Panthers who were committed.  And these were really, and this was really the essence and the center of the Panther Party, not so much the, the attention grabbers and the ones who were not committed, the arm-chair revolutionaries or the paper Panthers, you know.  We call 'em paper Panthers, you know.  They, some of them were afraid, and they deserted us.  But that solid core remained, and remained for a long period of time.  I officially left the Panther Party in 1974.
Story_ID: 671681
Speaker 1: But what I'm trying to understand is what is your life like between '70 [1970] and '74 [1974]?  What are the things, like, you know, you have a young son at that point, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, I have two children at that point.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we were undergoing a lot of change.  Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton] had been released from prison in '72 [1972].  And Huey, when he was released from prison, that created a whole, big change in the party.  He and Eldridge [Eldridge Cleaver] had the ideological battle going on, all right.  Huey was more into thoughtful organizing, and Eldridge was more into, you know, just radical shooting, off the pig, the rhetoric, you know, where Huey wanted to be a, wanted us to become more part of the community in terms of organizing the community.  And so that was going on, it was laid out in Chicago [Illinois] somewhat.  But we were engaged and, you know, running programs, creating programs, funding programs, most of us were, and we were engaged in--even supporting folks for electoral politics, you know.  Bobby Seale in 1973 ran for mayor of Oakland, California, all right.  And so we were using all these contradictions to try to move the party forward.  And so we were struggling.  Some of us even went back to school.  I went back to school in '72 [1972] or '71 [1971] and graduated, got my bachelor's from Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] in '72 [1972] during this period of time.  So we were, becoming more mature--we were maturing as an organization, but still had the verve and vigor and the philosophy and the intensity.  The police was still harassing us or arresting us, imprisoning us, and we was, it was still our--we were still their number one enemy, and we were their number one enemy, you know, they were ours, and, you know, we--so we had a real focus on police brutality and murder in the black community.  So we were, you know, we were living a very agitated, intense existence during that time and still absolutely committed to the betterment of our community.  After Fred Hampton was killed, we organized--we started developing coalitions with other ethnic groups.  We had, the first rain--what we called the Rainbow Coalition, that name Rainbow Coalition was developed by a fellow in the Panther Party [Black Panther Party] by the name of Bob Lee, who was--from Houston, Texas, and he relocated to Chicago.  And he was a, what we called a field secretary for the Panther Party.  And he, and his responsibility was the North Side [Chicago, Illinois] and the Uptown [Chicago, Illinois] area.  And so he worked to develop a coalition with the, some Appalachian whites in Uptown, the Young Patriots [Young Patriots Organization] which was a youth organization in the Uptown community on the North Side.  And he developed a relationship with the Young Lords [Young Lords Organization], a Latino organization on the, in the Humboldt Park [Chicago, Illinois] area.  And he called that, those relationships, he called that coalition the Rainbow Coalition.  This was back in the early '70s [1970s].  And we started developing more of a relationship with a faction of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC], and they became the white, our allies.  And our position had always been, we didn't let no white folks join the Panther Party.  We said, if you were white, if you wanted to be, help us, then you go and organize in your own community.  So we need revolutionaries, we need folk who understood what, and adhering to what we wanted them--how we thought about things.  We wanted you to be in your community.  Not, don't come--we don't need you to organize in the black community.  You go and organize in the white community.  And there were a group of young whites who did that, you know, Slim Coleman [Walter "Slim" Coleman], who right now is a Methodist minister, but he created a national committee to combat fascism which was an allied organization with the Panther Party, you know.  And so, Helen Shiller, former alderman in the city, in Chicago, she was a part of that thrust, all right.  So, and so we were doing real serious organizing.
Speaker 1: You know, that's fascinating because that's, those are the people that show up in the Harold Washington--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and came, you know, come to prominence during--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --it's, you know, it's in that period of time that you were talking about.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 671682
Speaker 1: The other thing I have a question about, what is the relationship between the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] and the Nation and between, let's say the, you know, Jeff Fort's organization [Blackstone Rangers]?  So what--are those lines clear or not clear?
Speaker 2: In my mind, they're clear.  We had, with the Nation of Islam, we--first of all, Malcolm X, we know, we considered ourselves disciples of Malcolm X, you know.  I, even today, I consider myself as a pupil of Malcolm X.  And so, not with--but the Nation, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, we're, you know, we didn't necessarily agree with their philosophy, and why?  Because they wouldn't, they didn't wanna organize in the community.  They didn't wanna do the political thing that--we thought that was necessary.  And we had some aversions, and some--and there are a lot of major disagreements with what we call cultural nationalists, those who emphasize culture more than consciousness or they emphasized a cultural consciousness that lacked a nationalist consciousness, you know, or revolutionary consciousness.  And so we had a lot of disagreements and they were, you know, and sometimes they were pretty intense.  We had two Panthers who were killed, Bunchy--Alprentice "Bunchy" Carter [Bunchy Carter] and John Huggins, Ericka Huggins' husband was killed in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] because of the conflict between Ron, Maulana "Ron" Karenga [HistoryMaker Maulana Karenga] and the US Organization.  You know, that was a, you know, those are, and the confrontations back then.  So we had these confrontations between what we called cultural nationalists and revolutionary, what we called ourselves, in terms of being the revolutionary vanguard.  And, but looking back on those, you know, I somewhat--you know, that was when some of the things that, the outcomes that were, was based on a lot of immature decision making and youthful enthusiasm--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and exuberance, you know, as I look back on those days.
Speaker 1: Right, I mean because everyone is young.  I mean even, I think, you know, at the time, you know, you're in your mid to--mid-twenties--
Speaker 2: Twenties, yeah.
Speaker 1: To, to later twenties.
Story_ID: 671683
Speaker 1: --the party at that point, 'cause, you know, this is a time that we start seeing the, you know, the program--Great Society program--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, well, no--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I mean is there money, you know, 'cause money is starting to come in, you know, like money is coming and Jeff Fort's organization [Blackstone Rangers] is starting to see some money--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and so I was wondering, you know, the Panthers [Black Panther Party] ever, you know, had any of that in terms of any kind of grants, you know--
Speaker 2: No, we didn't, no, we did not receive grants, but we began to understand how to, you know, we, we always knew ourselves as being--we said that we're not, we refuted this thing about you not being in the system because that conflicted with our, was a contradiction to our Marxist and Leninist and our world view, all right, because we considered ourselves--our philosophy in essence was dialectical materialism.  So we understood that in order to have--if you're looking at things from a dialectical perspective, it was thesis, a thesis, an antithesis and then a synthesis.  You couldn't be outside of that process.  You had to be a part of either the thesis or antithesis in order to become a part of a new synthesis.  That means that opposites, there was always a struggle between opposites, and then when opposites would, would clash, compete or collude with one another, then out of that collision, will come a new synthesis, a new thing.  And that's how we viewed it.  So you couldn't be outside of the system, 'cause in reality, you didn't exist outside of the system anyway, so you just used the contradiction within the system, you highlighted the contradiction within the system, and out of that force, out of those forces of speaking truth to power and gain it and come back and say, then you would emerge--out of that would become a new system.  I mean, so, it was, what--the difference between nonviolence and violence was that, in one sense, especially in a theoretical sense, they were accomplishing the same thing, only we did not understand at the time or I did not understand, and, obviously, a lot of us didn't, the power of nonviolence because that was not something that we could really, our sense of self and our sense of our own manhood, and we could not allow--we didn't have the maturity to become nonviolent.  So we wanted to, you know, our, our modus operandi, if you hit me, I'm gonna hit you back, all right.  And, you know, I remember what Huey [Huey P. Newton], of course, from Huey Newton, he, "Pig, you got your gun, and I got mine.  You shoot at me, I'm shooting back."  You know, that's, you know, our young and youthful, male macho-ism, our defining who we were as proud, young black men, just didn't--to us, would not allow us to be nonviolent.
Speaker 1: Well, you--I mean it was, at that point, it felt old fashioned, and you were sort of taking, you know, control and saying--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You know, nothing, but nothing concedes to--what is it (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, no, nothing concedes--power doesn't concede nothing without a demand, or something--but I, you know, and you have to understand, the Civil Rights Movement was really a southern, and it grew out of an agra- agrarian or agricultural culture.  It was a southern movement.  In the North, you couldn't--you didn't have the same thing.  We already had, so to speak, public accommodations.  We already had the, could register to vote in the North, all right.  We had elected officials, and things like--black elected officials.  So we never, you know, we didn't have those same kind of contradictions.  And so our, our problem in the North was that we had to confront, you know, the segregation in a different kind of way.  We had to--racism was more--less interpersonal racism, at least on our side, and more institutional racism, you know, in the North.  And so we had to fight the institutional racism.  And the police, it wasn't the sheriff.  It was the Chicago Police Department, right, who we had, who we had to really fight.  And, and unlike in the South, our communities were high, were highly--were very dense, pretty much well organized, and the police was, would come in and invade us.  And we viewed the police as an occupying army, all right, where in the South, that kind of rhetoric, those kind of understandings did not exist there because it was individualized, personalized racism, racists, you know.  It wasn't hidden in the institutional life of, of the black community.
Story_ID: 671684
Speaker 1: And so, you know, a lot of the Panther [Black Panther Party] was bol- it was bold, it was angry.  It was take charge, but, on the other hand, it was doing all this thing for the community, you know, but, and it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were, we were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I mean it was educated in that approach.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, because we viewed ourselves as being a part of a worldwide revolutionary movement.  We, we wanted, just--we had a very thoughtful process of decision-making.  We had leadership that was pretty mature in their--and advanced in their ideology or philosophy.  I mean Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton] was, the genius of Huey was he was a theoretician that was very accomplished, and his theory was based both on study and practice.  And Huey, you know, when he was killed, Huey had his Ph.D. from University of California at, I think, Santa Barbara [sic. University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California].  So he, I mean he had an earned Ph.D., not a--this wasn't an honorary.  He had a, he earned his doctorate in philosophy from there.  And so, and Huey taught us.  I mean I learned so much during those years in the Panther Party about different philosophies, and different great thinkers.  And I remember one of the things that, the highlight of my years in the Panther Party was I accompanied Huey to Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut] where there was a colloquy between Huey Newton and Erik Erikson.  And Erik Erikson was the premier psychoanalyst.  He was heir apparent to Freud [Sigmund Freud].  And he and Huey developed this relationship, and they developed this colloquy on the development of, of the human race.  And I mean it was, I mean just to sit there and witness Huey, young lion, against an old lion, and they were engaged in this, this discourse, this academic discourse, this colloquy on some of the great thoughts and some of the great ideas about the development of how human beings develop.  And so, and Huey was eating him up (laughter), all right, in my opinion, all right.  And so my point in terms of--you know, we weren't just a bunch of bombastic, black men and women who were angry.  No, we were serious, social thinkers, you know.  And that's because of the nature of the Panther Party.  We said that you had to--if you, theory, in order for theory to be real, accepted, social practice is a criterion for the truth.  That's what we believed in, social practice is the cri-, so, you couldn't have a, you couldn't have your theory without practice.  You had to have theory and practice.  Practice illuminates theory and theory illuminates practice.  That's a, those are the things that we believed.  Those were at the core of the Panther Party.  If you said it, then you gotta--if you believe it, you gotta act on it.  And if you act on it, then that strengthens your belief in it.  You couldn't just talk about it.  You gotta act on it.  Social practice is the criterion for the truth.
Story_ID: 671685
Speaker 1: Now, what caused you to go to Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] then, and where is that, you know, because what is--is that your parents [Cora Lee Rush and Jimmy Rush]?  Is that--what caused--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was convenience.  Roosevelt had a program that would allow me to get a degree in a short period of time using some of my, what they call life experiences as a part of it.  I had to do some serious work there.  I had to do, spend my time doing classroom work and homework.  But I got credit for some of my life experiences.  And I graduated from Roosevelt in about, I think--
Speaker 1: I have 1973--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --is that true?
Speaker 2: --I got there in, it was about fifteen months, I got a bachelor's [degree] with honors from Roosevelt.  You had--(unclear) you know, one of--the Panthers [Black Panther Party] were always undergoing changes.  And we, you know, at one time, like when Angela [HistoryMaker Angela Davis] first came around the Panther Party, Angela Davis, they didn't really want Angela in the Panther Party.  Eldridge [Eldridge Cleaver] and all of 'em, because she was bourgeois and highly trained.  And so Huey [Huey P. Newton] said, "Nah, that's wrong.  You--we need people with bourgeois skills."  And so, and that was gonna be the wave of the future for the Panther Party, people who had this training, had the skills, who could really do some things.  And so I decided that, you know, one of the things I should do is go and get my degree.  And that's the reason why I went to Roosevelt.
Story_ID: 671686
Speaker 1: Why do you leave the Panther Party [Black Panther Party] though?
Speaker 2: Why?
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Did I leave?
Speaker 1: Why did you leave?
Speaker 2: Why did I leave?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, it, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-four [1974] I have here.
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-four [1974], it--most of them, I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, who--who's the leader, who's the, who is the party at this point 'cause you, earlier I asked you names, and you didn't wanna say it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The party was, at that time, I think we had about fifty members during that time.  I started really, well, we started engaging in electoral politics, and on the West Coast, Elaine Brown ran for the city council [Oakland City Council].  Bobby Seale ran for mayor, you know.  And if you remember, back in 1968, Eldridge [Eldridge Cleaver] ran for president of the United States under the Peace and Freedom Party ticket, you know.  So we were always there, right there working in a political way, organizing, electoral political way.  But we became fully engaged in electoral politics back in 1972 when Bobby ran for mayor of Oakland [California].  Well, all that was in order for them to pull that election off, they pulled everybody into Oakland, from all across the country.  It became the base of operation.  People from all across the country centered there in Oakland.  I was going to Oakland, but at the time I was in school here, and I wanted to finish my school at Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois].  And so, you know, we--one of the things that happened to me is I, I--and this is back in '73 [1973] or '74 [1974]--it might have been a little earlier, Ralph Metcalfe, the former congressman, you know, one of my predecessors in [U.S.] Congress from the 1st District [1st Congressional District], he had a friend, a dentist who had been brutalized by the--or roughed up by the Chicago Police Department.  And Metcalfe became outraged about that.  And Metcalfe called a rally against police brutality on a Sunday afternoon in one of the churches on King Drive [Martin Luther King Jr. Drive], Mount Pisgah [Mount Pisgah Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], I think it is, right there on King Drive.  And it was about three thousand people showed up at that rally on a Sunday afternoon.  I went there, and I was amazed.  Here, a congressman, an elected official, can call a rally, and you've got all these people showing up.  And we were being killed on the street, and, you know, at that time, you know, we couldn't get any kind of support--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Right.
Speaker 2: So I said, there's something to this electoral stuff.  And so I decided at that point in time to go and make the political sides and, ultimately, to run for office myself, even though it was going on in Oakland all at the same time.  And part of my history, my mother [Cora Lee Rush] was a Republican, precinct captain.  My brother was a Republican ward--committeeman on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].  So electoral politics wasn't that distant from me.  Progressive politics wasn't that distant from me.  I mean I had friends who were--at that time, who were running for office and in office.  And I was part of the progressive political movement here in Chicago [Illinois].  So it wasn't that remote for me, but I decided to take a leap in terms of seriously preparing to run for electoral office and during that, during that period of time.
Story_ID: 671687
Speaker 1: So we had our programs, and I, you know, I have to say this.  I, this has occurred to me more than one time.  We had an office at 4233 South Indiana Avenue, and we would have breakfast for around, at that office, and a month ago, I, a gentleman, who works--he's a police officer--no, he's a fireman.  He was working security that night at the Jewel supermarket [Jewel-Osco] that I--and I happened to go in to buy some bread or something.  I'm not sure what it was, do some grocery shopping.  And he said, "How are you doing?  I wanna thank you so much 'cause I was one of those little kids who you fed, you know, on Indiana.  I used to live right there on, on Giles [Avenue], and used to--and I wanna, just wanna thank you so much."  You know, and I've had that.  Occasionally, I would get people like that.  So I mean that just give you so much reinforcement when you, seeing people who you've helped back then.  They come up and tell you how you helped them, and how you--they used to eat at the breakfast for children programs or this kind of, you know, how you--the impact you had on their lives.  And I just, and so it's real, positive reinforcement that those years were, were productive on some level--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, productive (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and it was value to other folks, right.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 671688
Speaker 1: And, you know, the other thing is that a lot of the other parts of the par- Panther Party [Black Panther Party], there's a mixed story, you know, people who, you know, went on to productive lives, people who are--I'm told that there's still some Panthers in jail.
Speaker 2: There's still some Panthers in jail, and primarily, those are the ones who were--and there's still some Panthers who are, who are in exile, in Cuba for the most part.  And we've got one who's in, I think he's in Tanzania, whose cousin is a member of [U.S.] Congress, and I've often told his cousin, "You know, you and I ought to get together and, and go to Eric Holder [HistoryMaker Eric H. Holder, Jr.] and get Pete O'Neal back into the states, all right, because he wants to come back."  But there are many, there are a few Panthers who are in jail.  And most of these, a lot of them weren't, they were more adhering to the Eldridge's [Eldridge Cleaver] line of thought, you know.  They were really, you know, committing--they were, that was the criminal element.  And they didn't, 'cause that is why--it did have a criminal element now to it, those who were just, what we called lumpenproletariat who were some, some, just go out and rob or, you know, and that kind of thing.  And so, but we kind of repudiated those people 'cause they weren't, their philosophy was not, it was the gangster philosophy and not in the philosophy of, of really trying to bring about change, you know.
Story_ID: 671689
Speaker 1: But, why do you leave the, the Panther Party [Black Panther Party] in--
Speaker 2: Well, we disbanding, basically, I was in, you know--I never will forget.  There was a guy by the name of Fitzpatrick [ph.], wrote an article in the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times] back in '73 [1973], '74 [1974], called me the last Panther standing or something like that.  I, I basically left the Panther Party because it became something that I could not, I wasn't proud of.  You know, it became--Huey [Huey P. Newton] made a turn and led the Panthers down a path of being more, nothing but a gangster, gang kind of organization, you know.  We stopped dealing more with programs and started dealing with other kinds of things, you know, drugs started to come into the Panther Party and that part of the legacy, I just did not want to be a part of.  And, and so I, I moved beyond the Panther Party.  And I, here and after the order came to relocate to Oakland [California], that really broke us up.  You know, some people left to go to Oakland.  Some people left the party all- altogether.  And so we kind of--the effects of the police, the arrests, the imprisonment, all, the funding, the amount of money taken to do bail, bonds, and, you know, to be bonding people out of jail, and that kind of--that had a tremendous effect on us.  The infiltration of the Panther Party by the, by the--J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], and all the--you know, that had a tremendous effect on the Panther Party.  And so, you could only survive so long on youthful enthusiasm, especially when you're going up against an organized form like the U.S. government, like the FBI, like the local law enforcement agencies.  So it was only a matter of time.
Story_ID: 671690
Speaker 1: A year later, you run for alderman.  Can you talk about who your, you know, who--well Daley [Richard J. Daley] is in office.  But who's in office, and, you know, at that point, and who are you running against?
Speaker 2: Well, in 1974 I went back to Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois].  I went to Roosevelt, got my degree in '72 [1972], and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Seventy-three [1973], I have.
Speaker 2: Seventy--yeah, '73 [1973], I got my degree.  I went to University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  I started working on a master's in political science there.  And so in '75 [1975], I decided I was gonna run for the city council [Chicago City Council].  The reason why I, you know, I couldn't get a job.  I had tried to get a job.  I was a college graduate.  I had tried to get a job after I left the Panther Party [Black Panther Party], went to a lot of pro-black organizations.  They wouldn't hire me 'cause I was [HistoryMaker] Bobby Rush--
Speaker 1: The Panther.
Speaker 2: The Panther, they wouldn't hire me.  So I was out, I had a family, two children and a wife [Sandra Milan], and I needed a job.  And so I decided that, I said, I--one day I was just thinking, well, what do you, you know, what is that you got that would help you to be, you know, be successful in other things?  And I said, well, you do have a name, you know, people do know you.  So I decided to--I said, where does that really have a lot of value?  And I said, in politics, so I decided to run for office, alderman of the 2nd Ward.  I ran against, at that in 1975, I ran against a guy by the name of William Barnett who was a part of the old Daley machine in the heir to Dawson [William L. Dawson], was purportedly one of Dawson's children, but.  And Barnett was an established Democratic operative.  The 2nd Ward, at the time was--and the 2nd Ward has a history that is so rich in terms of black political history in the city and the nation as I've indicated.  Dawson is probably one of the most, was one of the most effective black politicians in the history of our nation.  But he is little known and even less appreciated, but.  So Barnett was his, one of his heirs to his seat as the ward committeeman, and Barnett was the alderman.  And so I ran against him in 1975.  Another fellow by the name of [HistoryMaker] Larry Bullock ran at the time, and I was, came in number two against Barnett at the time and almost forced him into a runoff.  Then I ran again in 1978 for state representative and lost that race too.  And then up comes this uprising in 1982 for the mayoral race.  And I decided to again run for office.  And at that time, I was successful.  Harold [Harold Washington] endorsed me over Barnett, and I became alderman.  It was then another runoff with Barnett, me and Barnett in the runoff, and became alderman of the 2nd Ward, which I--and I served there for nine years before being elected to the [U.S.] Congress.

Speaker 1: So let's talk about the Harold Washington campaign and that whole thing because Harold, he had run--he had also run earlier, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he ran in 1976.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I supported him and he lost that race.  I think it was--no, the Williams--to, it was 1977 to Bilandic [Michael Bilandic], Daley's, the old man, old man Daley, William, I mean Richard J. Daley, to his successor.  And, but Harold ran in 1977 [sic.] and lost that race.
Speaker 1: So that's what, so when do you get to know Harold Washington and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and under what cir- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I, I met him, I think it must have been '71 [1971].  He was a state rep when I met him.
Speaker 1: Okay, because--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He was a state representative.
Speaker 1: Because he came out of machine politics, didn't he?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he came out of machine politics.  He was a part of the machine.  And Harold was, but Harold was a brilliant politician.  He could work both sides, you know.  He was liberal enough, he knew the nomenclature of liberal politics, the language, and, and--but he was organizational enough to know how you have to be organized in order to get the votes.  So he--organize your vote in order to win the election.  So he was the, you know, he had the, an independent politics and also in machine politics.  You know, Harold was a graduate of Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois] also.  And so, but I got to know him even while I was in the Panther Party [Black Panther Party].  And he knew me and so we, we all, you know, we always clicked together.  We, you know, never was--he understood some of the verve and vitality and some of the youthful thrust of the Panther Party.  He didn't necessarily identify with the--he thought our reckless abandon in terms of taking on the police and talking about armed violence and self-defense and things like that.  He did necessarily go along with that.  But he understood and appreciated some of our, the opposition and how we were opposed to, to the--what was really the status quo in the City of Chicago [Illinois] 'cause he was, in some sense, opposed to that same status quo, although he was, in some sense, he was a part of it.

Speaker 1: So, talk about the Harold Washington election, the activities and the organizing leading up to the election and, you know, what role, or even if you just sort of describe that.  Now what is--
Speaker 2: Well, oh, that was a classic uprising.  Again, the foundation had been laid with the assassination of Fred Hampton in 1969.  So here in 1982, Harold--I mean Jane Byrne, mayor of the City of Chicago [Illinois], the black community is totally alien- so in a sense of alienation.  So they said that she don't represent them, even though she rode in on the backs of the black, black community.  But she did not represent us at all.  As a matter of fact, there was some school issues with Chicago public education and she took a position that was diametrically opposed to the interests of the black community, the stated interests of the black community, the things that the black community were clamoring for.  She took a position diametrically opposed to those positions.  So here, the black community and the, and the--decided that, some of the leadership, well, we're gonna have someone to oppose.  We had been trying to get a black mayor in this city for a long, long time.  I remember in 1975, some eight years before Harold was sworn in, you know, there was Richard Newhouse [Richard H. Newhouse, Jr.], state senator, and he ran for mayor of the City of Chicago.  We had, I mean this had become a part of our agenda, a goal and objective of the black community for a long time.  And so in '83 [1983], you had, in the mayoral election in '83 [1983], you had Jane Byrne and Richard Michael Daley [Richard M. Daley] running.  So the white community's vote was gonna be split, and the objective was, what can, maybe this is the time that--if we can unify the black community, maybe we can sweep between these two people.  And that's what happened.  Harold solidified the black community around his election.  And he did that in a pretty brilliant way.  He said, "If we," you know, because the community was clamoring for a black mayor, "Well, I'll do it, but in order for me to do it, you gotta show me that you're serious, and how you show me that you're serious, you gotta register so many thousands of people."  Well, that was a charge that we readily accepted, so the apparatus and the implementation of the strategy to register those people.  We registered not only--and this was, not only--Harold's objective was register fifty thousand.  We registered a hundred thousand people.  But I have to say that the people who were encouraging Harold to run, especially some of the business people, [HistoryMaker] Edward Gardner, they were putting their--he put the, Ed Gardner put his money behind that thrust.  He financed the voter registration campaign.  And then he kind of helped us, new, getting the materials and things that we need to support the logistics and get all that together.  You know, we, you know, and commercials.  And so there was a big movement generated around voter registration for the aim of electing Harold Washington mayor or so that we can entice Harold Washington to declare his candidacy for mayor and then raising money, the same kind of movement coming from the little people in the barbershops and the pool halls, and, you know, the small people, the average citizen in the black community.  Harold became our focus and we united around the thought that he could win the election.
Story_ID: 671693
Speaker 1: And then Harold announced that he was gonna run, and I never will forget, Slim Coleman [Walter "Slim" Coleman] and--and Helen Shiller and those former members of the organizations that was created around the Panther Party [Black Panther Party], they had a printing press, Justice Graphics [Justice Graphics, Inc.], that was located in the Uptown [Chicago, Illinois] community.  And they printed up some buttons, some blue buttons, simple design, just a blue button, Washington, with a sunburst.  And those became our ammunition.  And everybody in the black community was clamoring to put on one of those buttons.  And you'd see people going, going to work in the downtown, in the department stores and the government offices and in city, county and state, and all over in the neighborhoods, everybody would have their blue buttons on.  And that blue button became the symbol of the victory for Harold Washington.  And that--history was made primarily out of the ingenuity and the convictions out of the simple process of wearing a blue button.  That galvanized people.  That sent--we were all messengers with a blue button on our lapels, you know, that we were for Harold Washington.  And then there was a debate between Daley and Jane Byrne and Harold Washington.  And Harold Washington completely eviscerated both Richard Michael Daley [Richard M. Daley] and Jane Byrne in that debate.  And at that, during that debate, was what convinced a lot of people who was sitting on the fence, especially, a lot of the middle class blacks who were sitting on the fence, that Harold could hold his own and that he was brilliant and that he was very articulate, and he would represent them well.  And that's when the movement really took off, after that first debate where Harold just--every, the media, the headlines were, "Who is this Harold Washington?" 'Cause they didn't know that there was a man named Harold Washington who had those kinds of skills and abilities and that command of language.  And so they were astounded and they were, started scammering--scampering rather, around trying to figure out who this was.  He, he shocked them all, but we knew who Harold was, and we knew that Harold had the capacity to lead.  And when--the greatest mayor that this city's ever had because he was able to turn this city around.  And he died, certainly died too prematurely, but he was able to--he laid the groundwork for the future.  Now, his legacy still remains to be completed, you know, but we are, we are--you know, to me, we're living in a present time that is almost like a reflection of what happened in 1982, a real reflection of, you know, the lack of legitimate support from the mayor, the alienation that we feel, the fact that our communities are ignored wholesale, and the type of disrespect of our--especially around the education system, that we're experiencing the same issues that were the primary motivation--that was the impetus for 1983 and the election of Harold Washington.  Those same issues exist even more so today than they were back in 1983.  The question is whether or not we're gonna respond to the inequities and to the charge of history, whether or not we're gonna move as a community again.  I don't know.
