Speaker 1: This HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] interview is being conducted with Mr. Melvin H. King [HistoryMaker Melvin King] at the South End Technology Center [South End Technology Center @ Tent City, Boston, Massachusetts] created by Mr. King at 575 Columbus Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.
Speaker 2: 359.
Speaker 1: 359 Columbus Avenue.  Thanks.  I don't know where I got that from.  The date is December 8, the year 2005.  The interviewer is [HistoryMaker] Robert C. Hayden and the videographer is Mr. Neculai Burghelea.  Mr. HistoryMaker, would you give me your full name and would you spell your full name for me?
Speaker 2: Well, my full name is Melvin, M-E-L-V-I-N, Herbert, H-E-R-B-E-R-T, King, K-I-N-G.  Now, the middle name is really Hugs, H-U-G-S.
Speaker 1: Can you explain that?  H--
Speaker 2: I adopted Hugs as my middle name.
Speaker 1: Oh, you adopted, okay.  Okay.  Why Hugs?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's, it's summed up best by a road sign in Tennessee, interesting given this discussion.  On the way to the Alex Haley farm [Clinton, Tennessee] for a conference, passed a sign that said, "A hug is a great gift.  One size fits all and it's easy to exchange."  And so it kind of encapsulated a view that I've had over the past twenty-five years about the value of hugs in our society and culture and if you look at some of the things that are around in my other office, I have a, a drawing of hugs with bears and in the languages of about twenty different countries.
Speaker 1: Good, thank you.  Mr. King, in what year were you born and where were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born in 1928 right here in Boston, Mass [Boston, Massachusetts], in the South End area of Boston, the area where I continue to live.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have a very diverse career.  We're gonna explore all the dimensions of your career, but at this moment, how would you describe your occupation, your, your professional life at this point?
Speaker 2: It's mostly fun to be where I am and to do the things that I think are important to do.  For most of my work life, I've really only done what I've liked and wanted to do and this is an opportunity that really reflects that, that view.  So professionally, I'm not sure how to call myself.  At various points, I'm--I say I'm a community developer, at other points I'm a politician.  Sometimes I'm an educator.  Most times, I'm a learner.
Speaker 1: Good.  We're gonna explore all those dimensions.  I remember my first day at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] with you in Community Fellows Program [Mel King Community Fellows] and you introduced yourself and you said I'm a community developer.  So--good.  We're gonna, gonna explore those.

Speaker 1: Mel [HistoryMaker Melvin King], in these interviews, we begin by talking about your family background so that all of the individuals who look at your interview over the years will have a context in which to understand your growing up years and your values and the things that you did as an adult.  So I wanna start with your mother [Urcilla Earle King].  I wanna start with your mother.  Would you give me her name and when she was born and where?
Speaker 2: I can tell you where she was born.  I'm not sure I can tell you when she was born.  She was born in Guyana [British Guiana; Guyana].  At that point, it was called British Guiana and she was born in a part of Guyana called Berbice.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that for--
Speaker 2: B-E-R-B-I-C-E.  And that's where she grew up until she went to Canada, to Nova Scotia, to a place called Glace Bay [Canada] where she met my father [Watts King] and where they were married.
Speaker 1: Why did she go to Canada?
Speaker 2: Well, like a lot of folks, question of opportunity where she worked doing household, domestic work which was one of the things that a lot of the folks who were in the islands or who were a part of the British colonial system did.  Some came--went back to England, others--back to England--others went to England and others went to Canada, places that were easily accessible to them.
Speaker 1: Do you know about how old she was when she went to Canada?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say she must've been eighteen, nineteen.
Speaker 1: Then, her growing up years were in Guyana.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did she share with you any stories or information about her growing up years in Guyana?
Speaker 2: Most of the stories were around school, the rigidity of the British system, the fact that they really learned to read, write, and compute, who was responsible for them once they left the front steps if they had steps.  So that's pretty much the kinds of things that she talked about.  She talked about the foods and she had learned to cook, prepare.
Speaker 1: Do you remember her cooking?
Speaker 2: Big time.
Speaker 1: We'll come back to that 'cause I'll talk about your cooking too.
Story_ID: 395453
Speaker 1: Do you have any information about her parents, your maternal grandparents?  Did she [King's mother, Urcilla Earle King] ever talk to you about her parentage?
Speaker 2: The--not much about her mother, but her father came from Trinidad, actually understanding that there was this little triangle, Trinidad, Barbados, and Guyana [British Guiana; Guyana], and so her, well her father originally came from Trinidad and his father was Trinidad.  I don't know in the slavery lineage where they came and whether they were at that point which is a little different from my father.  But they--her parents, at least the--on her father's side, she said came from Trinidad.
Story_ID: 395454
Speaker 1: You said she [King's mother, Urcilla Earle King] went to Canada maybe eighteen, nineteen years of age.  How long did she live in Canada and did she talk to you about her life there?
Speaker 2: Not much about her life in, in Canada.  It's interesting 'cause we did go back and get the wedding information, church, where--as a matter of fact, a few years ago with Joyce [Joyce King], we went up and tried to find the church and a little background on them.  I really don't have a lot about the experience that she had.
Speaker 1: This church is located where in Canada again?
Speaker 2: In Glace Bay [Canada].
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: G-L-A-C-E.
Speaker 1: And what part of Canada is that?  What is that near?
Speaker 2: It's Nova--in Nova Scotia [Canada].
Speaker 1: Oh, Nova Scotia.  It's in Nova Scotia--oh, Nova Sco--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, up in--
Speaker 1: Oh, you said that, right.
Speaker 2: --where--Cape Breton [Cape Breton Island, Canada].
Speaker 1: Um-hm. When did your mother pass?
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975].
Story_ID: 395455
Speaker 1: How do you remember your mother [Urcilla Earle King], her personality?  What was she like?  How do you remember her?
Speaker 2: She--well, first of all, she was--and somehow it's kind of tough to use the term--a very creative person and she was an advocate for her children.  And she did everything that she could, given resources, to provide us with the best.  Clothes, we--she would take us down, not to the stores in the neighborhood, but to the place where they made the clothes down on Kneeland Street [Boston, Massachusetts], 75 Kneeland Street, and she would go through the racks and, you know, talk to the people.  She knew the material and we would--we would be sharp, particularly Easter, and change in seasons to make sure we had what was appropriate.  In the beginning of our growing up, because there were so many of us, she didn't have much time for herself, but as we grew up, not only did she have time for herself, but she got involved in the church and participated in some community activities, but mostly in the Church of All Nations [Boston, Massachusetts], so much so that when it was taken for urban renewal and the discussion was whether they should relocate out of the South End [Boston, Massachusetts], she with others insisted that they remain.  And there was a pool room right near the church and they rented the upper level of it, and we always used to kid her, says, well you go to church in a pool room.  And she really worked in that situation to make sure that the church was built and the Church of All Nations which is downtown across from the Wang Theatre [Boston, Massachusetts], is--it's a round church, she called it a pillbox, is the result of her efforts and others, of course.  And in recognition of it, the ornaments in the altar when you go in are in her name.
Story_ID: 395456
Speaker 1: I grew up learning to cook, particularly bake.  'Cause what we had to do since we didn't have the electric mixers and things, was to cream the butter and sugar and mix it and so I learned to do that, and then all of the things that went into baking, et cetera, so I'd watch and learn how to--how to do that.  So it was good at one level, but on the other hand, all my friends were going out to play and I had to do this in order to go out to play.  And it was every Saturday and, of course, since we didn't have school on Saturday, they would be either out in the street or up at the ballpark and I couldn't go until I finished doing that kind of work.  In terms of cleaning the house and things like that, we had to do that and learning to wash windows and I'd sit out on the ledge, she'd [King's mother, Urcilla Earle King] hold my legs just to make sure, and then she'd point to every spot that I left on the window, so I got so I could make windows shine without a streak or a spot.  It's interesting because later, I realized that when I was doing kitchen boy work at the camp, I did some counseling at later, the lessons that I had received in making sure that everything was done right came in very, very handy.  And later when I was running a little automobile cleaning business, I can also think back and see how the lessons and the demands that were made made a difference in my work habits and approach.
Story_ID: 395457
Speaker 1: Just for the record 'cause I'm not sure we got it on the tape, your mother's first name and maiden name? I'm not sure I--
Speaker 2: It's an interesting part.  Her name on the baptismal is Urcilla, U-R-C-I-L-L-A, and the last name is E-A-R-L-E, Urcilla Earle [Urcilla Earle King].  And we grew up calling her Miriam and what happened is, my Uncle Conrad's [ph.] wife was Miriam [ph.].  And I don't know how it took place, but my cousins, all older, used to come to the house or we went there, they--somehow the name, Aunt Miriam, kept coming up.  And so we grew up calling my mother, Aunt Miriam, until we got a little older and realized that was cuckoo because it came because of the influence of my cousins.  I had cousins that were all older than we were and so we just in our youth, infancy growing up, began to adopt whatever they called.  And so they called my father Uncle Watts [Watts King] and so we called him Uncle Watts.  And later, we realized, again as we said, that we had been totally influenced by the ways that my cousins had called our parents.
Story_ID: 395458
Speaker 1: Well, this leads me to your father.  Would you give me your father's full name, when he was born and where he was born?
Speaker 2: Watts Richard King.  When?  I don't remember.  I have it somewhere.  He was born in Barbados and he died December 4, 1941, and was buried on Pearl Harbor day.  So it's been easier for me to remember those days because of the historical significance to it.  He grew up in Barbados and had a number of brothers and sisters.  My mother [Urcilla Earle King] had eleven brothers and sisters and I think he had seven, eight brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: Did he share stories with you about his growing up years in Barbados?
Speaker 2: Well, he, he talked quite a bit about his education and, again, schooling and the control that the school system had over them.  And it was like the--his parents relinquished the power over him and all the--it wasn't just he.  That's the way it was, similar to my mother; however, with him, it seemed much more pronounced and so he talked, talked about that.  Again, he talked about--'cause there's always this comparison with the kind of education that we were getting.  He was big on spelling and could spell and read.  And, and so you could see in the newspapers and things that came in that reading, writing, things like that were very much demanded of him.  He was big into history.  He talked about history.  He talked about the relationships between Barbados, the colonies, England, Canada, and the kinds of things that he learned in, in school.  He talked about the church, the Anglican church or Church of England at some point.  He talked about the relationship to England, not always in some positive way, but he did, did talk about that.  He talked about playing cricket as a young person 'cause that was the sport that and activity that they played in.  And he also talked about the foods.  He talked about sugar cane.  He talked about mangoes, guava, plantains.  He talked about taking care of the goats.
Story_ID: 395459
Speaker 1: What do you know about his parents, your father's [Watts King] parents?
Speaker 2: Well, I know more, again, about his, his father who on the plantation was a leader.  I can't remember the term, but there was someone who worked on that plantation who I guess was a foreman.  I think that's as close as--and had a lot of responsibility, and so we learned about that.  I also learned that he had a couple of families and so there was one family that my father was part of and there's another family that we learned about much later when we went to Barbados in trying to find out who was connected to which family, et cetera.  So--but we did learn pretty much about how he played a role as a foreman on the particular plantation.
Story_ID: 395460
Speaker 1: When did your father [Watts King] leave Barbados to go to Nova Scotia [Canada]?  How old was he roughly?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm not sure.  I'm not sure when he left to go there.  I do know that his work there, he was a coal miner.
Speaker 1: Coal miner?
Speaker 2: Coal miner, yeah.  And--'cause that's one of the draws that got particularly the men to go to Nova Scotia 'cause it was an opportunity to work in the coal mines.  So he worked in the coal mines.  Matter of fact, when we went to visit, we went to see the mine place where he worked.  And it appears as if he was pretty involved in the work in a way that he was part of whatever organized efforts they had to get better conditions there.  And so in his description, 'cause he used to tell a lot of stories about it, about the dangers, the risks in going into the mines, going below, and kind of things they had to try and insist on by way of conditions to do that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How long--
Story_ID: 395461
Speaker 1: He met and married your mother [Urcilla Earle King] there.  How long did he work in the coal mines in Nova Scotia [Canada]?  How long, period of time did he stay there, do you know?
Speaker 2: Well, long enough so that my oldest brother was born.
Speaker 1: And his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Walter [Walter King]. And Walter, as you see in the photo, was born there.  And so I'd say he had to be in Nova Scotia and in the mines three, four years.
Speaker 1: The picture that we're gonna look at later, that was taken in Nova Scotia?
Speaker 2: In Nova Scotia (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I see.  Okay.  From Nova Scotia, they moved to where?
Speaker 2: Well, they went back to Barbados, Christ Church [Barbados], and on the boat, on the way back, my older sister was born.
Speaker 1: Her name?
Speaker 2: They called her Shorey [Violet King] because she was born on the boat.  So they went back to Barbados, they lived there for a while.  There's some other thing about my father [Watts King] that I think is important.  First of all, before he went to Nova Scotia, he'd worked in Panama.  He also worked in Venezuela in the gold mines.  He did some work in Cuba and he did know a little Spanish, and he used to talk about his work in those different places.  So they went back and my Aunt Wilhelmina [ph.], I think you should understand if you listen to the names, Urcilla, Wilhelmina, all had some Dutch--'cause the Dutch had an influence over those islands and over Barbados, yeah, Guyana in particular.
Story_ID: 395083
Speaker 1: You were talking about family back in Barbados and names and I want to just continue with that.
Speaker 2: Oh.  Well, the thing that I wanted to get to with respect to my grandfather is that there are families that we met when we went to Barbados about ten years ago to hold a reunion, and in the hotel we were staying, there were people that we were connected to and then they began telling us about the other side.  So one name is Brathwaite and there are Brathwaites here, Brathwaites in Cambridge [Massachusetts].  And so it turns out that we--because my grandfather had and it turned out more than two families, then we began to see where we were connected to people here.  It was interesting to be in the hotel and once people found out--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --they said, oh, so-and-so, and they'd go get one of the persons working there and she would talk about the relationship.
Story_ID: 395084
Speaker 1: When did your mother [Urcilla Earle King] and father [Watts King] come to Boston [Massachusetts] and why did they come to this city?
Speaker 2: Well, my Aunt Mina, Wilhelmina [Wilhelmina King (ph.)], was in Boston.  She was doing domestic work.  She's my father's older sister and she sent for him and the family--and his family, thinking that he'd be able to get more work here and so he came with my mother.  They left my older brother [Walter King] and sister [Violet King] in Barbados with their grandparents.  And, and then in I guess 19- they came in 1920, '21 [1921], and my older brother, Roy [Everton King], was born in 1922.  And they settled here in the South End [Boston, Massachusetts] on Cobb Street and then later moved to Seneca Street where I was born six years later.
Story_ID: 395085
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories of growing up here in the South End [Boston, Massachusetts]?  How far back do you remember as a child?
Speaker 2: I can remember at least kindergarten and some pre-kindergarten.  I think kindergarten's kind of the place where I could focus most in that because you have older brother and a older sister, and my sister, Florence [Florence King], was a year ahead of me.  Roy or Everton [Everton King] was six years older.  And when they came home from school, they came home and had to explain what was going on in school, what they did and so, you know, you listen and you learn.  And the work that my sister was doing in kindergarten 'cause she was ahead of me, when she came home, then I looked at it and tried to mimic it, copy it, yeah.  And then I went off to kindergarten.  Now then, kindergarten was half a day and you came back from school and you were around the house or on the steps.  So what I then started doing was going back to the school after lunch with the other older boys and girls who were in first grade, second grade, et cetera, and I began playing in the school yard with them.  And then they would--the teachers in the school yard would chase me back home because I couldn't go back into school 'cause I wasn't in first grade.
Speaker 1: What school are we talking about, the name?
Speaker 2: This was Andrews School [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Andrew?
Speaker 2: Andrews, A-N-D-R-E-W-S, in the South End on--between Rochester [Street] and Genesee Streets.  It's no longer there.  So that was a major part of how I spent the day, kindergarten, came home, ate, then I'd go back over.  And it was easy to do because, first of all, we didn't have a lot of automobiles on the streets and we were--and the streets were small, so even as a five year old or a six year old, I could navigate the, the neighborhood.
Story_ID: 395086
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit more about the immediate neighborhood around your home on Seneca [Street], Cobb [Street] and/or Seneca, and then the neighborhood just out- outside here in the suburb.  How do you remember the neighborhood [South End, Boston, Massachusetts] as a youngster?
Speaker 2: Well, I have to tell you that--and I'm sure others say the same--however, this was the most dynamic neighborhood, street that you'll ever imagine.  Life was on this street.  And, okay, there were--'cause I have to talk about the neighborhood and the street and the schools at the same time.  I lived in a neighborhood where there were thirty-two different racial cultural ethnic groups.  In the tenement that I lived in, there was a black family on the first floor, we were on the second floor, there was a Polish family on the third floor, there was, let's see, Mr. Potter [ph.], he was a black person on the next floor, and then there was a Portuguese family or Cape Verdean, although mostly we called them Portuguese.  So I lived on a place where there were five, five floors.  Next door, my aunt [Wilhelmina King (ph.)] lived, above her Jewish family, above them an Italian family.  Next door to them, Greek, Polish, Italian, all right?  And it was like that up and down the street across from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This was all Seneca?
Speaker 2: This was Seneca Street.  Across, Italian, English, a little further down the street Turkish, there was Chinese, you name it, they lived on the--on that street.  And there were Armenians and what happened is that a lot of activities took place on this street, and particularly during the spring and summer and fall where then, we had these wind up Victrolas and they would bring one out, set it up on the sidewalk, and there were a couple of guys who danced.  And we also--they brought out boxing gloves and we boxed.  We played ball in the street, stick ball, all kinds of games in the street.  But everything took place right out there.  During the--we had--then, there were horses and the horses that were used for delivery, et cetera, well they always dropped their manure on the street.  And it was very interesting because my mother [Urcilla Earle King], other folks would go pick it up and use it for fertilizing the plants, flowers they were growing.  The older guys would come out with shovels and brooms and buckets of water and they would sweep it up, push it down the sewer because they were gonna play stick ball or squash as they--as they called it or two-hand tag with football.  So that didn't matter what time of the year, what the conditions were, if there was snow, they wanted to play, they shoveled the snow, cleaned the street so that they could do all the kinds of things that they wanted.  They didn't let weather conditions stop them from the activity of the street.  Well, another thing is that I remember where there were these Armenian sisters, twins, and they got married the same day, and their wedding party was in the street, just to look out the window and see the dance, people, et cetera, that's how it was on Seneca Street.
Speaker 1: When we get to talk about your involvement in, in politics and the Rainbow Party [Rainbow Coalition Party] that you started here, you had your rainbow very early in life.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's a--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you had it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) a major piece of--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --growing--of growing up.
Story_ID: 395087
Speaker 1: You were in Andrews School [Boston, Massachusetts] five, six, seven, eight, nine years of age.  What was your father's [Watts King] work?  What was he doing at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, all of the life that I knew him, he worked as a longshoreman for Domino, at Domino Sugar and at Revere [Revere Copper Company].  He used to walk across the bridge to the, the waterfront where the boat was and they came in, they unloaded them there.  So he was part of the union.  He was secretary to his local.  That's what he did.  He did a lot of odd jobs.  For example, occasionally he worked at the--there was a junk shop where they sorted parts, tools, and he would go sometimes and get some work there.  He also was very good at making things out of leather.  And for many of the men who had hernia or problems with their backs, he would make the kind of truss and thing for them.  He soled our shoes.  He had all the cobbler's tools; he did that kind of thing.  He cut our hair which is where sitting right in front of him, he told me stories about Panama, Venezuela, Cuba, you know, growing up all the kinds of things, about the union which he was a part of.  So--
Speaker 1: Where did this union meet?
Speaker 2: Well, some of the meetings for some of the leadership were held in our apartment.
Speaker 1: How many rooms did--how many rooms did you have (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, we had this--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you had a lot of brothers and sisters.  How many rooms did you have?
Speaker 2: We had four rooms, four, four and a half rooms.  And so they met and this one listened, and I remember when he died, I was thirteen, and going through his papers and seeing the notes that he kept, and I was very impressed with the fact that he played this role.
Speaker 1: Do you still have those notes?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  One of my--I don't know, my--other members of the family might have.
Story_ID: 395088
Speaker 1: (Background noise) I wanna come back to your father [Watts King], but while we're at it, tell me about your other brothers and sisters.  You had mentioned Walter [Walter King] and Everton Roy [Everton King] and Shorey [Violet King] and Florence [Florence King], that's four.  Now you had another four siblings.  Would you give me their names and, and the years they were born?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Or their ages?  'Cause I know it's--
Speaker 2: Bad on dates--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, I think I can give ages and then we can figure it out.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  There was Vernon [Vernon King]?
Speaker 2: Well, Everton or Roy was born first year in 1922 and Florence was next.  She's a year older than I am.  Everton is deceased, Florence is still alive.  And then I was born in '28 [1928].  I think Vernon was born in '27 [1927].  Let's see, Richard [Richard King] was born '30 [1930].  Then, Lloyd [Lloyd King], then Olga [Olga King].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And remaining are Florence, myself, Richard, Vernon, Lloyd, Olga.
Story_ID: 395089
Speaker 1: You describe your family life, what things were like with you and your siblings and your parents?  Were there special holidays, special events that you'll always remember celebrating with your family or things of that nature?  I know the church, of course, was very prominent in your--in your upbringing, but beyond the church activities, what other kind of things in the home, in the--in the house did you do as a family?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the day began with preparation for school and work.  Work, my father [Watts King] began making sure he had his breakfast and he carried his lunch which was coffee and a sandwich, whatever.  And we sat and we had cereal and cocoa and toast, and sometimes it was cocoa and toast, and sometimes it was what they called Cambridge tea, which was milk, hot water, and a little sugar, and then we were off to school.  The--we came home from school and if there were things we were supposed to do around the house, take care of our little stuff, had to learn to sew our own socks if there were holes in them, even make little patches in our clothes.  And then we could go out and play.  So the days went like that.  During the summer, we all got sent to camp, South Athol [Massachusetts], and so--
Speaker 1: South--
Speaker 2: South Athol.
Speaker 1: Would you spell that?  Athol?
Speaker 2: It's A-T-H-O-L.  It's part of the Goodwill Industries [Goodwill Industries International, Inc.].  They had this church--they had this camp and so we'd, we'd do that.  Other things were very ritualistic.  In the summer after school or--we were given castor oil to clean us out.  In September before we went back to school, we had it.  Actually, I shouldn't say summer, in the spring during the April vacation, okay?  A lot of the things happened around the school, school vacation in terms of things like, as I said, castor oil, we had to do that.  We had cod liver oil every morning, et cetera.
Story_ID: 395090
Speaker 1: So I think the things that, you know, I obviously remember most are the meals and the holidays, the meals.  As I said, we had the cocoa and the toast breakfast.  We came home for lunch and that's when we had the big meal.  For--at night for supper, we had cereal, Cream of Wheat, Ralston, Wheatena or cornflakes with fruit because my mother [Urcilla Earle King] didn't believe that you ate heavily at night.  Except my father [Watts King] when he came home from work, he had the big meal, but we had cereal, as I said.  The holidays were great in that we had obviously the big meal and a lot of preparation.  Now, I talked about my mother being very creative.  We used to get surplus food from the city, state, wherever it came from.  A lot of the people who got it didn't want it and so they would give it to my mother, and particularly the graham flour.  I never can understand even today why folks didn't see how much better it was.  But she used to take it and she was, as I said, an incredible baker, and so she would bake bread, rolls, et cetera.  So we always had homemade bread that was made.  People would give her the raisins, the dried apples, the prunes, and she could do amazing things with that, make raisin pie.  Now, I found out later that that's a recipe that she may have gotten in Nova Scotia [Canada], 'cause when we looked at a recipe book from Nova Scotia, it had raisin pie in it.  And then she would make--she would do things with prunes, prune, prune whip, you, you name it.  So we had prune pie as well, so we learned and benefited from the fact that people didn't want to or figure out how to use the--that surplus food, so for us it was a bonanza.

Speaker 1: What sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up here in the South End [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: As I said, there were many, many different kinds of folks which meant we had many, many different kinds of stores and, therefore, food.  What sticks out are the bakeries.  Across the street on Harrison Ave [Harrison Avenue] was Bikovski's Bakery [ph.].  And one thing about it was that they had these glass brick type blocks for light because a lot of the baking was done in the level below the street, and so we used to sit on it, particularly this time of the year where we could get the heat from the bakery or we'd just hang out around it.  If you went in the bakery, they had what we call cat pies.  Didn't know until I was much older that this was a way they did with the leftovers that they didn't sell, they just made what was ostensibly a big bread pudding, and they cut it up into little almost three-inch squares, and you went in for two pennies and you bought cat pie.  So we'd sit on the--on that grate or however we called it, and eat, eat the pies.  Across the street was Leo Jeffries [ph.] which was a Italian bakery and so we would go and get little nibbles from there.  Up the street was Green Freedman's and later, particularly as we got older, we understood when they baked their bread and what was the time to go and get pieces.  'Cause there was this guy that worked there and if there was stuff that was a little leftover, we were hanging out on the corner, he would give it--give it to us. But we got stuff like that for essentially pennies, very, very little, little money.  So that was a big piece of the neighborhood.  The fruit stands that were out there.  You talk about sounds, there was one guy who used some--used sleight of hand or something, he used to steal oranges.  And so when he was on the street, on Harrison Avenue, you'd hear the merchants say watch the oranges, watch the oranges.  And I don't know how he did it, but when he was down at the other end booth, he always had a couple of oranges, no matter how they watched him, he, he was able to do it.  So that was one of the, the things.  I mentioned we had a lot of street games, activities, et cetera.

Speaker 1: I was asking you, Mel [HistoryMaker Melvin King], about your elementary school years at Andrews [Andrews School, Boston, Massachusetts].  How do you remember elementary school or anything, any particular teachers that stand out in your mind that were influential or--?
Speaker 2: Well, what I remember about elementary school, the things that I'm not sure I would ordinarily share.  You know, they used to give you the stick, the rat hand they called it, if you were not behaving.  And having a sister in school who was a year older--well, I guess that didn't matter. They would tell her [Florence King] or she would talk about what I did in school or didn't do in school so when I got home, my mother [Urcilla Earle King] first and then my father [Watts King] knew, and so she reported on my activities.  But one of the things that stuck out was, I mentioned the rat hand.  This teacher, Mrs. Smith [ph.], wanted to give me the rat hand and I said that I hadn't done anything that I deserve it--to deserve it.  And so they sent this note home with my sister and my father the next day came up to school with me and, "Boy, put your hand out," and she gave me that.  I can remember it as vividly as we're talking and it really stuck, so much so that when I got in the legislature [General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts], one of the first things I wanted to work on was ending corporal punishment in the schools, right?  And so, oh man, it was like a--it just stuck with me and I still, still feel the--but that was my Pop.  He said once you leave the school--the house, you're the responsibility of the school.  Whatever they say, you gotta do.  To contrast that with his role with the union and struggling for, you know, justice and rights and, you know, talk about those things, when it came to his children in the schools, he had to make sure that we fit that old English s- structural mode, and I was like, okay.
Story_ID: 395463
Speaker 1: What kind of a student were you in elementary school [Andrews School, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) What--well, let me put it this way.  I liked reading, always did.  I liked being able to show particularly my father [Watts King] that I could read and do arithmetic, and he really encouraged it.  As a matter of fact, I was reading the newspaper when I was very young, maybe second grade I could read, read the newspaper.  And so--and that was encouraged.
Speaker 1: What papers did you read?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, they had The Record [The Boston Record] and the Traveller [Boston Evening Traveller].  When people talk about the importance of books and reading and things in the home, I'm a firm believer because I can see how, because my folks read, they had all kinds of papers in the house, he got the--there was the Globe [Boston Globe].  There was the Boston Transcript [Boston Evening Transcript], The Record, the Herald [Boston Herald], all those newspapers and then he got the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News], the black newspaper, the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier], all those papers.  And so, as a result, not only did I get exposed to what was going on in this world, I got exposed to what was going on in the South in terms of what was happening with black people.  And we also had a local newspaper here, it's the Chronicle [Boston Chronicle], and the Guardian [Boston Guardian], one of those, but we had all those papers in the house at some point, and so reading was the way it was.  So when you ask about what kind of a student, I was a student who read and could read and learned to spell.  'Cause I had to learn to spell because my father would be on my older brother [Everton King] about spelling, and so we would listen--see when you have--live in a small little apartment, he would be on my brother about spelling if he came back--on--in those days, they had on your report card, spelling as well as for a grade.  My father couldn't tolerate any of us not having good grades in the first place.  However, if we didn't do well and our spelling was okay, you know, we could coast, right?  And so he would drill my brother and I would make sure I listened.  And then when my father knew I could spell good, sometimes he would say, "Okay, you spell the word."  I may have been a third, fourth, fifth grader, my brother was in high school or junior high school, and my father was asking me to spell some of these words, and so I used to try to figure out the way I wasn't gonna spell it 'cause I didn't want my brother getting upset with me.  But anyhow, that is all to say that I spent--that I thought I was pretty good in school in terms of--now, there's two issues here.  The first is whether my grades reflected what my smarts were and with the exception of math and a few things, I didn't put the kind of energy into those that I did with, with that.  But basically I never was in any danger of not being promoted or whatever in terms of school, but I really liked reading and participating in any of the discussions about it.
Story_ID: 395464
Speaker 1: Once you finished the Andrews School [Boston, Massachusetts], what was your next school?  Where did you go to?
Speaker 2: Went to the Quincy School [Boston, Massachusetts], Quincy Schools in the part of the city which had mostly Chinese and people from the Middle East.
Speaker 1: Was this still elementary was this middle school?
Speaker 2: No, this--we went one, two, three, four, kindergarten, four to the Andrews (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Andrews.
Speaker 2: --and we went five, six to the Quincy, and then we went seventh, eighth, and ninth to the Abraham Lincoln [Abraham Lincoln School, Boston, Massachusetts], and then high school went to what became Technical High School [Boston Technical High School; John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts] from tenth, eleventh, twelfth.
Speaker 1: Move me quickly if you will, then, through the Quincy school and the, the--beyond the Quincy--Lincoln, yeah.  Just--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --'cause that get--gets you up to high school.  What--
Speaker 2: The Quincy School broadened and each--it's interesting now that I think about it.  Each one of the schools broadened your base of contact with folks who you didn't either know because you were in this little pocket in the Andrews School, the area where students came from was bigger when you went to the Quincy, and then it was even larger when you went to Abraham Lincoln, and obviously when I went to high school, it was city, citywide.  So, what can you say?  You got more skills and that's--when you--between the fourth--the fifth, sixth, and high--and elem- and, sorry, junior high and then high school, is when they started what you call tracking people.  And so if you got all A's and Bs, when you left the Quincy and went to the Lincoln, you were put in the class where you got the languages.  They started you at seventh grade where you could take Latin, French, et cetera.  And then they started you on tracks where you were gonna be in the trades where others were tracked into being into like college or professional or business.  And so that's what happened when you went through those next schools.  So I realized later that I got tracked into one class which we had shops, we took printing, then we used to have to set type.  We had a little electricity where we learned how to, to use--make bells, buzzes, wires, things of that nature.  We had a little carpentry.  Now I think about it, that's what they did 'cause then it meant the technical high school, 'cause if you got a good mark in your shops in elem- seventh, eighth grade, then you had the same kind of--you went into technical high school with--in that course whereas some of the others, I was thinking about Joyce [Joyce King] and some of the others went through the course that they then slotted them to Latin school.
Story_ID: 395465
Speaker 1: So you went to Boston Technical High [Boston Technical High School; John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts] in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-three [1943].
Speaker 1: And you were there four years?  That was--
Speaker 2: No, three.
Speaker 1: Three years--
Speaker 2: Yeah, see (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at Technical High?
Speaker 2: Tenth, eleventh, and twelfth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  What were those years like?  What was Boston Tech like for you?
Speaker 2: Well, Tech was very, very good.  In--well, two things.  One is that I liked the courses, the shops, the exposure to drafting, electrical engineering, sheet metal shop, all those different things were--we had photography, we had internal combustion engine as part of a science class.  And so they really exposed you to a lot of technology, a lot of skill stuff.  My last years there, my junior and senior year, I was in the machine shop and learned how to make tools and things, et cetera, so that was one piece of it.  The other piece was sports and it was where, you know, you go out for the basketball team, I went out for the football team, and got on the varsity in both those sports in my last years.  So that was good.  You got to play--you went around the city.  You get to play at Braves Field [Boston, Massachusetts]; that was a big thing then.  You played basketball--we played basketball at Boston Garden [Boston, Massachusetts], et cetera, so that was the thing.  You got a letter.  So all that aspect of it was, was good.  The other thing that I thought was good was that in order to play you had to maintain your grades and so there was no question about, about that.
Speaker 1: What was the ethnic cultural racial makeup of Boston Tech when you were there?
Speaker 2: Well, there were people there from everywhere in the city.  When you say racial, I mean I can name Tomzic [ph.], Markoulis [ph.], Chin [ph.], Robinson [ph.], Rizolio [ph.], Cyrus [ph.], Barella [ph.], you name it, Ambrosini [ph.], you, you name it.  I could do that.  Actually, I have a photo of my Seneca Street baseball team that I'll get you at some point 'cause I think that--but--and if we looked at the high school football team, basketball team, you'll see that they had that kind of diversity.  Technical High School as most schools in the city drew people citywide.  There were district schools; however, because we went to a citywide school, we got a lot of different folks.
Story_ID: 395466
Speaker 1: In grades ten, eleven, and twelve at Tech [Boston Technical High School; John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts], particularly grades ten and eleven, did you have any notion or inclination about what you wanted to do professionally as a career or as you became an adult?  Did you have any notions or thoughts about that at that time?
Speaker 2: I think the--I had some sense of working with youth.  I had a sense of--I did think about science, engineering.  I thought about teaching math; I liked math, which I did end up teaching.  It's a good question because I took machine shop and, you see, this is where some of the things that affected my life and my work later become very, very significant because a lot of the white youngsters who took the same course--I finished when I was seventeen--could go to and enroll in one of the co-op schools like Charlestown [Charlestown High School, Boston, Massachusetts] or East Boston [East Boston High School, Boston, Massachusetts] where they had those programs, Hyde Park [Hyde Park High School, Boston, Massachusetts], and the counselors steered them in that direction because they could go work in a factory or in a machine shop, be covered by the insurance of being a post-something student, and they got that experience which then got them into unions and things, and they did this with the automobiles and others.  And for those of us who were in this school and particularly those of us who were black, our counselors never talked to us about those kind of--kind of things, and I learned about this a lot later.  And so some of my work in the future in terms of work with youth is based on understanding how the level of racism that existed slotted folks in one direction and slotted us in, in another.  Another example was that I didn't know that I could go to Boston Teachers College [Teachers College of the City of Boston, Boston, Massachusetts] at that point for thirty bucks [dollars] a semester, so I went south to school which is just as good.  However, I didn't know that.  But some of the white youngsters were told that and they ended up--because they had this college course over there where you could learn to teach shop stuff but, again, didn't get that kind of support from the guidance counselors.  So that was one aspect of the, the school life and, yes, I did get into some scrapes at the school around disciplinary issues when we'd get accused of doing stuff that we didn't do and I would not--'cause one of things my father [Watts King] used to tell us was that you don't bother anybody or start any trouble, but you don't let anybody abuse you when you're right.  And so I carried that through and obviously in some instances with teachers and things, it didn't sit too well and a couple of times my mother [Urcilla Earle King] came to school and had to do some negotiating with folks to--and I think it's--but that experience--see, you don't know these things when you're going through it and then a little later, you realize, well, they did slot you this way, they did slot you, they could've give you this information, they didn't give you that information.  So part of what I try to work on from then on when I finished college and was working with youth was making sure they got that information about what was possible.
Story_ID: 395467
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about your entry into college.  You grad- you graduated from Boston Technical High School [John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts].  Tell me about your entry into college.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: What decisions did you have to make and where did you end up going?
Speaker 2: See, a lot of that has to do with the church.  We haven't talked about church, we haven't talked about that role, and ironically, it has to do with segregation.  Okay, at the Church of All Nations [Boston, Massachusetts], the people who came to work there came from the South because they couldn't go to schools in the South to get their divinity degree, right?  So they came and they went to BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], they went to Gordon Theological [Gordon Divinity School; Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary], Andover [Andover Theological Seminary; Andover Newton Theological School, Newton Centre, Massachusetts], Newton [Newton Theological Institution; Andover Newton Theological School, Newton Centre, Massachusetts], those places, and then they did their internship work in the--at the churches here--I'm talking about black folks who couldn't do that.  And so they encouraged us to go to school in the South because they went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia], et cetera.  Well, one of my friends, Bill Smith [ph.], was living at one of these places--I mean, living at one of the parts of the Church of All Nations, Goodwill [Goodwill Industries; Goodwill Industries International, Inc.], and there was this guy named Modell--Modese [ph.] rather who was one of these folks who had come up from south and he told him about Claflin College [sic. Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] in South Carolina, and this was in '46 [1946] when I finished.  And so he went down there on a scholarship.  They wanted me to come down.  My brother [Everton King] was in the [U.S.] military and my--and he told my mother [Urcilla Earle King] that my mouth was too big to go to South Carolina to school and that I would surely get in trouble, so she would not agree to have me go.  So I worked and did things around.  It was a great year because my mother and I became as great friends, relationship as any two people could.  And the next year, they got a new coach at Claflin and he came up and sat in my mother's kitchen and told her that he would make sure that I was cool and that he would take care of me and so she said okay, and so I went to school there on a football scholarship and--a sports scholarship 'cause I played football and basketball, baseball (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you one of the leading players in football at Tech?  Were you--
Speaker 2: No, I was just--
Speaker 1: Just--
Speaker 2: I could play, do my job (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) played football.
Speaker 2: I wasn't even on the first team.  So, anyhow, I went down and it was very, very good.  Now, I had tried to go to Northeastern [Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts] and when I went over to register, they said, well because I didn't have a language I couldn't do that.  Now, what I learned later was that some of the same white folks, boys, who had gone to Technical with me got into Northeastern and what the people told them was you can take three regular courses but you take a remedial French course or language course so you make up that requirement and then you can move on.  They didn't tell me that.  They just flat said I didn't have it so I couldn't go in--go in there.  So I tried--I looked at--as I said because of these folks who had come from the South who had been to Morehouse, who had been to Lincoln in Pennsylvania [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], so I wrote those places.  But then when they came back and said what the tuition was, even though it was only 125 bucks [dollars], there was no way in the world that I could afford to pay tuition with a family, et cetera.  So I did work that year and then I got the opportunity to go to, to Claflin.  That's when I got on the train in South Station [Boston, Massachusetts] and went down.
Story_ID: 395468
Speaker 1: Was that your first time in the South?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  First time past Providence, Rhode Island, and got to Washington, D.C., and got off the train that everybody could ride and then got into the Jim Crow train from Washington to Florence [South Carolina], and then another one from Florence to Orangeburg [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Tell me about those first days at Claflin [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  How did you feel?  What, what were you facing?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: You had football, of course, so you had something to immediately go into in addition to classes.
Speaker 2: One of the good things was that there were two other people from Boston [Massachusetts] that I went down to school with, Tom Clearly [ph.], Sylvester Mills [ph.], and two of us became roommates down there, so that, that was good.  I can remember getting into Orangeburg, taking our suitcases, riding up to the school, and Claflin is next to State College [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], and so as we were driving up and I looked and I said, oh, this--'cause State College, big, well-manicured, and the whole bit.  And we went by State and turned in to Claflin, and I said, you know, there was weeds and whatever.  It just didn't look like what colleges I had seen and been exposed to up here, so drove in, unloaded, went into the dorm floor and said I didn't have five cents, so I couldn't leave.  'Cause I was totally shattered by my image that I had of what going to a college was going to look like and then I went and I saw this place.  Well, okay, that was bad enough.  Now, we went out for football practice and the red clay that we practiced on was like this (knocks).  Matter of fact, you put your cleats on and you could hear what like horses galloping over it, it was so hard.  I said, what am I doing here?
Story_ID: 395469
Speaker 1: You were saying, Mel [HistoryMaker Melvin King], that the, the football field at Claflin [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] was like (knocks) clay.
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  Now, the reason I, I mention that is that growing up in South End [Boston, Massachusetts] and playing football in the way we started out, we played on cinders, essentially coal cinders, you know?  And we played by the railroad track over, so--and then when I went to high school [Boston Technical High School; John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts], we played at Cleveland Circle [Boston, Massachusetts] and as I said, we played our games at Braves Field [Boston, Massachusetts] which was professional--
Speaker 1: Good turf.
Speaker 2: --place.  And, and I knew about the stadiums and things that the colleges played in and et cetera, and so I had this big time imagery in my head.  And so first the school and its environment, small, and then you get out on the field, I said, you know, what is this?
Story_ID: 395470
Speaker 1: Anyhow, as I was saying, I didn't have any money, so if I wanted to go back home [Boston, Massachusetts], I couldn't; it was just like that.  And so I hung in and it was probably the most important experience I had in my life, going to school there.  Over time, I--it got me to learn about the myths that I had about the South and people in the South.  And I think one of the best things that happened was that there was a black theater there, the State Theatre [Orangeburg, South Carolina], where they had movies and stories.  There was movies about black people that were positive instead of the Stepin Fetchit, Mantan Moreland stuff that we were forced to watch here which was one of the reasons why I, I stopped going to the movies.  So I learned something about that which later becomes a major factor in the kind of work and approaches to dealing with media that I still believe is important to, to do.  So Claflin [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] was good at that, that level.  Claflin was good at the level of meeting people who were struggling to challenge in their way the kind of segregation that was there and I would tell you that nobody on the planet is as respectful of Rosa Parks and what she did as I am.  'Cause I--at first when I rode--went down there, did the thing like the rest of the black folks and then I stopped and so I used to hitchhike and--which was dangerous; it was cuckoo 'cause people would try and drive you off the road.  And, and fortunately, there were a number of people who went to Claflin from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] or Washington [D.C.] that drove down, and so I'd take the bus or the train to Philly or Washington and then ride down with them.  And so why I say I was--I was so respectful of Rosa is that I didn't say anything, I just used my alternative way of getting to places.  However, it's--she did what was the most important part--piece of it.  And so just having felt a lot of the anger from being in that situation and then seeing somebody who stands up and who does it.  And so--let me say, say this about--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --about Claflin and, and those schools.  The attempt or the sense of community that you feel not only because of the sports team, because of being around a lot of folks who were trying to make something happen, not only in their lives but who had a sense of the importance of what they were doing in terms of dealing with black people and the issues that we were under.  So I was really struck by, by that.  I was struck by having been there when some of the early issues of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] struggled to get to stop the segregated school system and some of it was done right in South Carolina with Judge Waring's [Julius Waties Waring] comments.  And so that--just being in that environment was, was very, very, very good.
Story_ID: 395471
Speaker 1: Are there any particular instructors or professors that influenced you while you were there?  Anybody who stands out in your experience?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think so.  Okay, I went to--in my junior year, I took a physics class at South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] and the professor was Mr. Pugh, P-U-G-H, and he had a very global view of the world and he'd talk about a lot of political perspective stuff as we were in his class, and exposed us to a lot with lasers and things way back then.  So it turned out that his assistant got a job with the Bureau of Standards [National Bureau of Standards; National Institute of Standards and Technology] in my senior year when I was doing my practice teaching, and he called and asked if I would come and teach the math course that his assistant was teaching, and, and be his assistant, and so I, I did that, and it was a very, very obviously good experience for me.
Speaker 1: What was your major at Claflin [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina]?  What--
Speaker 2: Math.
Speaker 1: It was math.
Speaker 2: I studied--yeah, I majored in math education.  I'd--it's interesting, I went down to do phys ed [physical education] and social work, okay, but the phys ed meant that you had to take all the biology, zoology, physiology, anatomy, and all those courses, and I said I can't understand these words.  I mean, I could read and all that but I wasn't into that.  And since I had done very well in math, I decided I would continue to get as much math and, and go, go teach.
Speaker 1: How did the football go for you?  How was your football experience?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, it was--it was fun.  It was good.  I made the team, I captained the team.  I was able to be a major part of some of the wins that we had.  I started off playing end.  I ended up playing tackle.  And I got to learn the game.  And so I have to say that for some of the folks, it was like having the coach on the field with them 'cause I could, in the huddle, could tell everybody what they were supposed to do on the play.  In--at one point, they let me call the plays on the team, not the quarterback.  So, actually in the kind of offense we had, it didn't really matter who called the plays, but generally, the quarterback who called the plays.  But for a few of the games and things, I was the one who could call the plays.
Story_ID: 395472
Speaker 1: So you finished Claflin [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] in what year?  Nineteen forty--
Speaker 2: Fifty-one [1951].
Speaker 1: Fifty-one [1951], okay.  Let me back up to '47 [1947] when Jackie Robinson came to the Brooklyn Dodgers [Los Angeles Dodgers].  Do you recall that--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that breakthrough and how'd you feel about it?
Speaker 2: Oh, well--
Speaker 1: Just reflect on that.
Speaker 2: Okay, big time.  If you go back and you look at in '45 [1945], '46 [1946], there was this big issue with one of the members of the Boston City Council insisting that the Boston [Massachusetts] baseball teams stop discriminating and hire a black player.  And so one of the players that came in town to try out was Jackie Robinson.  And one of the persons who hit ground balls to him was my brother.  They practiced right over there and--
Speaker 1: Brother--
Speaker 2: Roy [Everton King].
Speaker 1: Roy?
Speaker 2: Everton (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Roy?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So he hit ground balls to him right up there before he went over to, to practice--I mean, to try out for the team.  And so we had a sense then of what was happening, who he was, et cetera.  Well, obviously the rest is history; they didn't take him.  Branch Rickey picked him up and sent him to Montreal [Canada] and then brought him up to the majors [Major League Baseball].  Well, it was a big thing--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --at Claflin, big thing.  First of all, we used to get razzed because we were from Boston.  Not only didn't we win, but we blew that and, second, there was always this big issue between the folks who--see, a lot of the people who went to college at Claflin spent summers up in New York and in Brooklyn [New York]--in--yeah, in Brooklyn and Harlem [New York, New York], et cetera, and so they began to develop allegiances to either the Dodgers or the Yankees [New York Yankees], et cetera.  So there's always a great big (unclear) around who was going to--but now we were in school in October obviously during the World Series and when Jackie Robinson was on.  And even though we didn't have the TV, we spent a lot of time at the radio listening, et cetera.  So it had a real big impact on the (unclear) folks.  Now, I played baseball and one of the persons that went up to Cleveland [Ohio] was Larry Doby and so we used to play against the team that he played on.  So not only did I play on Claflin's baseball team that I played, there was a team called the Orangeburg Tigers and so I used to play and pitch for them as well.  So, the experience there of being involved in the life, the sports, the--we can talk about the church and music and whatnot.  It was very, very, very powerful and impactful.
Story_ID: 395473
Speaker 1: I said earlier that the--my time in the four years that I spent there was, was very, very, very powerful in terms of my personal and political development.
Speaker 2: Before we leave Claflin [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], I wanted to ask you what you did during the summers.  Did you come back to Boston [Massachusetts] or did you work here or did you go someplace else during the summers?
Speaker 1: No, I came back to Boston.  And my first year, I worked for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad which was great 'cause I used to go to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], spend the night, and some of the guys that I went to college with lived in D.C., so I'd spend time with them.  And I'd also go to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and stay overnight, and some of the folks I went to school with lived in Philadelphia.  And so I got to ride the train as a fourth cook.  Now, most people don't know that's the dishwasher but I say fourth cook, and if I don't add the rest of it, people get impressed, you know, fourth cook.  Well, one of the things on the train was, the guys used to say. "Fourth C, you better stick with us 'cause you're not gonna be able to get a job no matter how much college you get."  And look at this guy as a waiter, he finished Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], he finished Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], this one finished, they can't get jobs.  And the other side of it is that the people who were on the corner where I grew up, some of them had gotten jobs because this was when the war [World War II, WWII] was on, they had become welders and whatever, and they would say, "I don't know why you're going to school, why don't you just come and get one of these jobs with us?"  So here I was getting it from these folks that I grew up with and here were these other folks who were on the road saying don't--you know, you're wasting your time essentially.  It turned out they were both wrong.  And--but it was the kind of pressure that you had to deal with when you were in the situation with that reality.  So I did that during the summer, a couple of summers.  Then I worked on the--at a wool factory with a lot of friends I grew up with.  And, let's see, what did I do my last year?  Not sure, but I did--oh, I worked on the playgrounds as--doing youth work on the playground.

Speaker 1: Graduated from Claflin College [sic. Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] and what was the next step?  Where'd you go from there after gradu- (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to Boston Teachers College [Teachers College of the City of Boston, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: That following September?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you went there for what?  What were you--
Speaker 2: Oh, I went to get a master's [degree] in education to teach math to junior high school students.  I got married and--

Speaker 2: Yeah, as soon as I got out of school.
Speaker 1: Okay, who did you marry and how did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Joyce King.
Speaker 1: --meet your wife?
Speaker 2: September.  We'd known each other for eons.  I used to ride her on my bicycle when I was fifteen, she was thirteen and so off and on we continued our relationship.  And I came home summers, winters.  We'd been camp counselors together, so we lived in the same neighborhood [South End, Boston, Massachusetts], went to the same church, same leadership development approach, so--
Speaker 1: This would be a good time to, to talk about your family, about the--your children.  Would you tell me your, your children's names, the oldest to youngest and very briefly what they're doing today?
Speaker 2: Well, oldest is Skipper [Melvin King, Jr.], same name as mine, Jr.  He is--well, he was doing substitute teaching.  He's a--has a master's in education and is doing some work with children at the moment. Pamela [Pamela King] who you just met is--also has a master's.  She does--her master's in early childhood administration and is doing both freelance work in merchandising, is teaching courses in technology, Microsoft Office, here [South End Technology Center @ Tent City, Boston, Massachusetts]. Judith [Judith King], doctor in Chicago [Illinois], is a physician.
Speaker 1: General or a specialty?  Does she have--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she does mostly family--
Speaker 1: Family medicine?
Speaker 2: --medicine.  And she spends a lot of time learning programming, math.  She has a daughter who's a sophomore at Maryland [University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland].  The next one is Michael [Michael King].  Michael is a videographer, does what you do, and he also does some of it here and is now working to set up a studio for sound in the back.  That's what those big panels are for, does a lot of work for MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  He went to BC [Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts], didn't finish.  He also went to that school, Goddard, Vermont [Goddard College, Plainfield, Vermont].  The next one is Nancy [Nancy King] and she's--works the T as an inspector now.
Speaker 1: For the T?  The--
Speaker 2: MBTA [Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority].
Speaker 1: The public transportation authority?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's a, she's an inspector.  She also drives occasionally those trains.  And the youngest one is Jomo [Jomo King] who just went back to Atlanta [Georgia].  He does youth work.  He's taken courses at Framingham State [Framingham State University, Framingham, Massachusetts] but he's in Atlanta.  He has an eight-year-old daughter in Atlanta.  He's also a deejay.  Let's see, who'd I miss?  Nope, that's it.
Speaker 1: Nope, got 'em all.
Speaker 2: Nancy has a thirteen-year-old daughter.  Michael has a twenty--nineteen-year-old daughter who is at Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.] who's a sophomore.  He has a twenty-year-old son by another marriage and he has sixteen-year-old twins, sons.
Speaker 1: So you got at least six grandchildren.
Speaker 2: We have eight.
Speaker 1: Okay, I missed a couple. Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, Michael's--Jomo's wife has--had a son by another marriage--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so, so that's eight.
Story_ID: 395475
Speaker 1: You got your master's degree in education from Boston State College [sic. Teachers College of the City of Boston, Boston, Massachusetts].  What came after that?  Was that a one-year program or was it a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was one-year program and then I--well, while I was working on it, I did some work at the settlement house and both the Lincoln House [Boston, Massachusetts] where I grew up and at the Cambridge Community Center [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  So I used to do one right after school and the other in the evenings in order to obviously bring in some money while I was in school.  And I then finished.  During the summer, I cleaned automobiles which was another good experience for me 'cause I got into the business eventually as a result of it.  And then I started--then I did substitute teaching in the Boston [Massachusetts] schools and got appointed to Boston Trade [Boston Trade High School, Boston, Massachusetts] for the year.  Now, I mentioned automobile cleaning.  I would leave Trade and go clean automobiles.  I'd make more in a couple of hours cleaning automobiles than I made in five hours teaching.  After that year, to start the next year, I was assigned to Boston Technical High School [John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts] to teach ninth and tenth grade math.
Speaker 1: That was what year now?  I'm trying to just get--
Speaker 2: Fifty-three [1953].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-three [1953].
Speaker 2: Fifty-one [1951]--fifty-two [1952] was at Trade--at the Boston Teachers.  Fifty-two [1952], fifty-three [1953], I was working and substituting while I was at Trade and then the next year, I went to Technical High School.
Story_ID: 395476
Speaker 1: A few months in, maybe a month in at Technical High School [Boston Technical High School; John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts], the man who was the director of boys work at the Lincoln House [Boston, Massachusetts] where I was working part-time decided to go teach at a private school, so they called and asked if I wanted to make a switch from teaching and run the program at Lincoln House.
Speaker 2: Where was Lincoln House located at that point?
Speaker 1: Lincoln House was located on Emerald Street in the South End [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Near your homestead, your old homestead--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and neighborhood?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  So I thought about it and I said, well, yeah, I see a lot of the young people including my younger brother on the corners hanging out.  I thought maybe I could do something around their lives and what they were doing, so I switched over, and that was another good move for me.  So I worked in the settlement house from 1953 until nineteen seventy--'67 [1967] and then I went to the Urban League [New Urban League of Greater Boston], but I worked--
Speaker 2: Well, tell me about your work.  Was this Lincoln House part of the United South End Settlements [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: Well then, it was a stand-alone agency--
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: --and over time--well, there was Lincoln and Hale House [Boston, Massachusetts]; they were together.  And then through pressure from United Way [United Way Worldwide], they said, look, all you agencies are in the same neighborhood, South Bay Union, South End House, Harriet Tubman House, then you all ought to come together.  And so they started out calling it the Federation of South End Settlements and then finally the United South End Settlements.  However, when I worked there the first several years, it was a stand-alone agency.
Story_ID: 395477
Speaker 1: Mel [HistoryMaker Melvin King], at Lincoln House [Boston, Massachusetts], you left teaching, went to Lincoln House, what was your title position there, but more importantly, what was the nature of the work that you started to do there?  Tell us more about the work.
Speaker 2: Lincoln House, director of boys work.  Ran the gym, scheduled it, scheduled all the activities for boys from six up through adulthood.  I tried to get tutoring or other activities that would be useful, ran the camp.  I hired a director for the camp and then worked with that person to get the camp organized, took the bus, load the young people up.  So we had year-round responsibility for what was happening, particularly for boys in the settlement house.  And then the--
Speaker 1: What issues and problems were young men having in, in the South End [Boston, Massachusetts] and in this community during that time--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --that were challenging and things that you had to--
Speaker 2: Well, there were two parts.  You start with the Lincoln House and you're in the building and people come to you, and so they come because they want to take advantage of the activities, and so that's what I did.  I made sure that there was some meaningful activities that were going on.  So, sports, lead-up games.  One of the things I learned in college [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] was how to do what we call graded games and plays or sports of low organization.  You did things in sports and in games that were developmental for the young people so that they would learn, you know, how to do different things that could lead to other levels of sports activity.  So I did that pretty much as a part of the work in the gym and then looked at other things by way of activities that had the same thing going.  I had the advantage of having grown up in the settlement house and in agencies like Hale House [Boston, Massachusetts], Lincoln House, and then the Church of All Nations [Boston, Massachusetts] where we had music lessons and at Hale House we had crafts; we learned how to make kites and things.  So all the things that I thought worked for me, I built into the program at the Lincoln House.  So that was a phase.
Story_ID: 395478
Speaker 1: What became important for the agency [United South End Settlements, Boston, Massachusetts] was what was happening to the young people who were in the streets who weren't coming in?  And there was this surfacing of gangs.  There had been a guy who had worked with him and he got a job at the--as a probation officer, all right?  And so he was doing what they called detached work and then they asked me if I wanted to do that job, and so '54 [1954], '55 [1955], I moved over to work on the streets.  And I got relocated to 48 Rutland Street where we first met and ran the street what we call detached worker program there which meant I went out into the streets.  I went to poolrooms, I went any place that young people hung out.  We developed a way of making contact with them, figured out the kind of things that they wanted to do, and then worked with them to make it--make it happen.  That was the most exciting kind of work that I did.  We--'cause we had other people, understood that you had to work with them 24/7, from morning 'til night.  We woke some up, we put some to bed, it didn't matter.  Whatever the issues were, we had to deal with.  We'd be in court with them, we'd go to school with them, we did tutoring, we found them jobs, we did a lot of things with them.  The best part was in organizing them to--into teams, so we got football teams going.  And we used this role model approach 'cause I remembered in growing up that I always wanted to do what the older guys were doing.  They played sports, we played sports.  They used to sit on the steps and play penny ante poker.  We used to sit on the steps using matchbook covers as the money.  So whatever they did, we wanted to do.  So I figured out that if I could get the older guys on the corner doing things positively like football that in time we could get the others and it worked.
Story_ID: 395479
Speaker 1: So one point, we had at least four football teams in that neighborhood, one, the Century Club [ph.] which was the seniors, the Ravens [ph.], then we had the team out of (unclear) and then we had the team out of the Cathedral housing project [Cathedral Public Housing Development; Ruth Lillian Barkley Apartments, Boston, Massachusetts].  And at one point, we had folks who used to play with the Century Club coaching the other, other teams.  And I can remember an incredible event.  One of the younger teams was playing over in South Boston [Boston, Massachusetts] and most of the young people on that team were black, a couple Latino, and a fight broke out.  But the older guys from the Century Club, mostly white, always came to the games, particularly if they weren't playing the same day that the other, the younger played.  And so here it is in South Boston.  When the fight breaks out where all the white young people, adults, start merging on these young people and then the white South Enders from the Century Club went out and got in front of most of the black young people.  And one of the things that the police officer was there said, he says he'd never seen anything like that where the white people came out to support the--I said, well, you don't know the South End [Boston, Massachusetts] 'cause that's the kind of neighborhood it, it was, is in terms of the kind of relationships that we, we grew up with.  And it was a--and I, I talk about it because it was a very good example of what happens when you build the relationships, you build the models for the, the youth and you can see the kind of changes.  One of the stories I like to tell about what kind of impact is that there was a priest, Father Carr [ph.] who used to walk by one of the groups and he said--he got so he had to walk across the street 'cause he couldn't deal with the language that they were using on the corner.  But one day he walked by and he heard them talking about a single wing right, left, you know, and they were doing little mock plays on the sidewalk.  And he said, wow, and then he called me and he said, "I don't know what you've done with them," he said, "but it's a different corner now that they've gotten into this football kind of stuff."  And we'd seen that happen with the youth in the neighborhood over the years by building those kind of relationships with them.  So you talk about Lincoln House [Boston, Massachusetts], one thing, but the street work was where I really got to do the things that I think are important and where you learn what works with youth, and for me, there are two things.  The first is caring adults and the second is that the youth get a chance to build something.  They got a chance to create something.  Whether it's as I did, a box camera or a kite growing up, or as they did and as I did with my friends, we developed a basketball team, we developed a football team, they developed--they developed dancers, they were able to get jackets and things so you can see how you can work with youth in ways that, you know, creative but bring the two essential things together.
Story_ID: 395480
Speaker 1: Mel [HistoryMaker Melvin King], in the mid-'60s [1960s], '64 [1964], '65 [1965] thereabouts, you were, quote, fired from your position with the settlement house system [United South End Settlements, Boston, Massachusetts].  Why were you fired and then you were re-hired as I understand it.  Could you say a little bit more about that?
Speaker 2: Well, the--there were two struggles going on in the country, two struggles.  We're in the middle of the civil rights issue and one of the things that happened was legislation got put forward to deal with some of the economic issues.  The Office of Economic Opportunity [OEO] was formed.  I can't think of the other name that it was given.  And it had something to do with the belief that part of the struggle for civil rights had some economic basis, but also there were folks in West Virginia and other places who were having, you know, were in difficult economic straits.  And so the government came up with this program to try and deal with folks and their needs to improve their economic situation.  And it was also a way to take, as was the Vietnam War, the racial struggles in this country off the front page.  And so the idea was that the programs of--that were going to be developed had in it language called maximum feasible participation of the people who were affected and we believed that, except that the agencies, the social work agencies had a different view, and their view was that they should now control those monies and the direction of the programs.  And ABCD was set up through Logue [Edward J. Logue] who was the head of the redevelopment authority.
Speaker 1: What is ABCD?
Speaker 2: Action for Boston Community Development [Boston, Massachusetts] that--
Speaker 1: And you mentioned a mister, what was his name?  Lowe?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Logue.
Speaker 1: Logue?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ed Logue was the head of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, and he had this idea of trying to put together issues around the economic and social development with the housing approaches that he was taking.  However, at the same time, the OEO program in with the notion that the people are to decide what was to happen, and some of us believed that, and the people who ran the agencies believed differently.  And so when we met, we meaning the folks who believed that, the idea then was that an entity would be formed in which the control of those resources would be in the hands of the people in the community to make the decision.  Well, that went against the agency that I worked for and as a result, I got fired.
Story_ID: 395481
Speaker 1: The people had a big rally at church up the street and decided that they would come and picket the board meeting of the agency that I worked for.
Speaker 2: And that was called what at the time?  Was it US--
Speaker 1: United South End Settlements [Boston, Massachusetts] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Settlements.
Speaker 1: --at that time, right.  And they came--and the rally was great, but the picketing, you know, they had all these people lined up on Union Park [Boston, Massachusetts] and these people who came in, many who were not residents who had a history of supporting the agency.  And in any event, they then had to rehire me and set up a new job for me which was into some community organizing, out of which we developed what we call the Community Assembly for a Unified South End [CAUSE] which became the major mover in changing urban renewal direction and process in Boston [Massachusetts] and I might say in a lot of places in the country because we pushed to get an elected urban renewal committee so that the decisions about what was going to happen and would happen here were made by a more democratic process and not by people who, who were anointed.  This facility [South End Technology Center @ Tent City, Boston, Massachusetts], this complex is a direct result of the activities that came out of the struggle around urban renewal, which first started with our pushing for the people to decide what was going to happen with the OEO funds.
Story_ID: 395482
Speaker 1: In your work with the United South End Settlements and Lincoln House [Boston, Massachusetts] before that, did you have any contact with or interaction with the Boston Public Schools and particularly in the schools in your neighborhoods where the young people were going?  Did you--'cause you've been in the school system as a teacher and a student.  Did you have any--did you attempt to work with the school people in any--I'm asking you that because in a--we're gonna talk about your running for school committee [Boston School Committee] so I want to know whether as a youth worker, social worker, you were also looking at the schools.
Speaker 2: Well, absolutely, the schools were a major part of the work that we were doing at the agency.  Now, remember, you're working out on the corners, you see some young people are out when they should be in school.  You ask them what's going on?  Well, we're failing, I can't do this.  So we then really get into doing some analysis of the youth, the schools they're going to and some of the issues.  And we see that some of the young people are getting pushed out.  They use the language drop-outs, but we feel some of them were getting pushed out, so we started looking into what was happening with them.  And we could back up a little and say, okay, if they're having difficulty in school, then why?  And so some of what we did was to do some tutoring programs.  So, we had an incredible tutoring setup over at the--at the agency.  Then, we began to look at the fact that some of the children were put in special classes and co-worker, Gladys Guson [Gladys A. Guson], and meeting with parents and others, developed this thing called 'End Educational Entombment.'  Because once they were in those special classes, they were actually entombed 'cause they couldn't get out.  They, they, they made some assumptions about their education, about their capacity to do things and so we put that struggle together, and it was the basis for eventually Chapter 776 [The Bartley-Daly Act of 1972] which led to the city, the schools, the state having to do something very differently about those young people who they had been putting in these--in these classes.  So that was one stream.  The tutoring was the other stream.  And then the idea that--well, because we were doing tutoring, we would begin to find out that the young people as far as we were concerned were very smart, just a diversion.  You know Julius Houston [sic.]?  Julian Houston the justice, he's just written a book, okay?  He was one of the persons with the Northern Student Movement who was part of the tutoring stuff that went on in the area.  And Ellen Jackson just died and some of what motivated what she was doing was the fact that these students, Northern Student Movement, who were tutoring their children were saying, I don't know why they're having problems in school passing these exams; they're very smart.  Well, what we learned was that the young people because the teacher is looking at them as black youngsters were focusing on discipline and not on teaching so that the young people would get a third to a half of what was in the test by way of preparation whereas the young people in the other parts of the city where they were white were getting 75, 80 percent.  So if you're gonna take the exams for these exam schools, who's gonna do the best?  Obviously those who at least had the 80 percent, 75 percent exposure.  And so we began to look at stuff like that and got into talking to teachers in the school and they talked about discipline and stuff and we said, whoa, that's not the issue.  The issue is how you--the content and knowledge that you're supposed to work with the students around.
Story_ID: 395483
Speaker 1: So that was one of the reasons why I ran for school committee [Boston School Committee] because having looked at what was going on in the schools, what the impact of the process was, that I thought the one thing I could do would be to run, see if I could be in a position to make a difference in that--in that--
Speaker 2: When was your first run for school committee?
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 1: And I ran as part of a group called Citizens for Boston Public Schools.  I did that for the three times that I ran.  Paul Parks and some other folks were involved with them and came and there was Reverend Lloyd [ph.] and Richardson [Roy Richardson] around the corner who were in the group and they came and asked if I would run, and I did.
Speaker 2: How'd you do that first time around?
Speaker 1: I think I came in seventh the first time.  The last time I ran, I came in sixth, never did win.
Speaker 2: This was a citywide--
Speaker 1: Citywide, '61 [1961], '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Everybody was elected citywide.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so you ran twice?
Speaker 1: Three times.
Speaker 2: Three times.  And you didn't win any of the--
Speaker 1: Neither.
Speaker 2: Tell me a little bit about those campaigns, though.  What did you learn from them and how did your political interests continue to be maintained?
Speaker 1: Well, the, the thing that I liked best about the campaigns was the opportunity to get some of the young people involved, to get folks in the community of color, the black community in particular involved in the--in the work--in the electoral process.  My first electoral work was in supporting a candidate who was a former schoolmate or he was a friend of a former schoolmate at--when I went to Technical High School [Boston Technical High School; John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts], and so I worked with these folks and got some of the young people I was involved with in football to register and then vote for them 'cause it was in this district from Tremont Street back over to the Fenway [Fenway-Kenmore, Boston, Massachusetts].  So I had some little inclination of what the campaigning was about.  So getting the--a campaign together was the thing we had to do first, but to get people involved, and so we got John O'Bryant who became the campaign manager.
Speaker 2: Who was John O'Bryant?  What was he doing--
Speaker 1: John O'Bryant (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) at the time--
Speaker 1: John O'Bryant--
Speaker 2: --at the time?
Speaker 1: --was a neighbor in that he lived not too far.  He was a participant at the South End Boys Club and he worked with us.  We had this local team we called the--I don't know, it was a king club, and we played basketball; John played.  And John worked with us at the settlement house [Lincoln House, Boston, Massachusetts] with young people and so we formed and put together this campaign organization.  Now, you know, John later became the first black person to be on the Boston School, School Committee.
Speaker 2: He was one of the early black teachers in the Boston system along with you.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He--before you or after you?  After you?
Speaker 1: No he was--I was--he was after me.
Speaker 2: After you.
Speaker 1: There were teachers before me I think there.  I had black teacher when I was in ninth--seventh, eighth, ninth grade.
Speaker 2: You did?  Who was that?
Speaker 1: Her name was Gladys Woods [ph.].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But there--
Speaker 1: I had two.
Speaker 2: But there weren't many.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, oh--so anyhow, we put that together, got the organization, and we ran--we ran as a slate.  Let's see, there was--if I can remember 'em all, Arthur Gartland, Nat Young [Nathaniel Young]--Gartland, Young, Carney [John Carney], King [HistoryMaker Melvin King]--I'm not sure if there was four the first time, five the next time.  Gartland did win and O'Con--O'Connor [William O'Connor], yeah, and O'Connor won and they were on the committee, but O'Connor, when the issue of desegregation came and sided with Louise Day Hicks and there's a whole history of that.
Story_ID: 395484
Speaker 1: Coming back to your community support that brought you back to your position with United South End Settlements and you created CAUSE, the Community Assembly for a United South End [sic. Community Assembly for a Unified South End, Boston, Massachusetts], say a little bit more about what CAUSE did and what you were able to do with CAUSE?
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Just briefly 'cause we're gonna wind, wind down (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, CAUSE--well, first of all, the people who were making the decisions were appointed or anointed as we call them.  They were the business people, they were the home owners, they were people that the mayor had recommended or suggested, they were some of the church people, clergy, and there were no tenants on that group, and they were about making these decisions.  And so what we wanted to do was to get an elected committee and CAUSE was formed and was made mostly of tenants.  We wanted to get an elected committee so that the decisions could be made more democratically.  Now, we first also wanted to stop the process of dislocating or relocating people out of the neighborhood, and what we wanted them to do was, since they had already emptied some buildings was to fix them up and allow people to--who if you were gonna move somebody else, move them into the buildings that were fixed.
Story_ID: 395485
Speaker 1: Mel [HistoryMaker Melvin King], you were saying that for two years, you were a teacher for mathematics in, in the Boston Public Schools, and then you made a decision to leave the classroom and move out into the streets to work with youth.  Why did you make that change?  Why did you make that transition?
Speaker 2: I think the, the major reason for me is/was that there were a lot of young people who were hanging on the street corners and with some of them, there's some questions about what they could do, where they could go with their lives.  And having been a camp counselor, I kind of liked the notion of the informal/formal kind of relationship that you could have with them, more flexibility around the things you could do, the way you could relate to their, their concerns, so I felt that given even my younger brother and his peers were there, that this would be a chance for me to really work in an environment the way that dealt with things that I liked to do.
Speaker 1: What was the organization or the agency then that you became attached to in order to, to begin this kind of work?  What, what was your position and who did you work for and with?
Speaker 2: Well, I was doing two things.  First at the Cambridge Community Center [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and then at Lincoln House [Boston, Massachusetts] where I grew up, while I was teaching--well, first while I was getting my master's [degree] in education [at Teachers College of the City of Boston, Boston, Massachusetts], I was working part-time at both of those places.  I did Cambridge Community Center after school and then in the evening, two or three evenings a week, I worked at the Lincoln House.  And so I was involved in working with young people while I was going to school.  And then I started teaching at Boston Trade [Boston Trade High School, Boston, Massachusetts] for several months to finish out somebody's term who had left and then went to, next September, to Boston Technical High School [John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts].  And in both instances, I saw some of the young people who had been on the street in school and then I saw that there were several others who had been on the streets with them who were not in school, so kind of interesting what happened to them.  Well, it turned out that the person who was director of the boys program at the Lincoln House had been offered a job teaching at a private school down in the New Bedford [Massachusetts] area, and so the director of the Lincoln House overall called and asked if I would move from teaching to doing the social work aspect of it.  And I thought about it, about a minute and I said, fine.

Speaker 1: Mel [HistoryMaker Melvin King], how did the issues and problems that young people faced at the time you took this job and took this position with what our young people, boys and girls youth are facing today, is there--how--are there differences in terms of, of the situation then and now?
Speaker 2: Well, there I think are significant differences in that, one is that the young people that I worked with then were a lot closer to the young people I grew up with.  And what I mean is that we didn't have a lot of mobility, that the public transportation, none of us had automobiles or even families with automobiles, and so most of the youth that I worked with were--there may have been some with automobiles at least in their families; however, they just couldn't go everywhere and anywhere.  And one thing about the youth today is many of their peers have automobiles and they--it's limitless where they can go, so that's in terms of some sense of mobility.  But on the other hand, there was very little of the access to imagery on the TV and, well, there's so much imagery on the TV now that young people have.  There went the gains that they have with the computer technology that the young people have.  Then there's something else that I think is, is a major difference and it's the number of guns and weapons that are in the hands of the youth.  Some of the folks that I grew up with had knives, razors.  Some of these other young people that I worked with had knives.  I don't--I think there was one instance where we had to take a gun away from one of the youngsters.  On the other hand, today, there are guns everywhere.  And with the young people I work with, there were fights between different groups.  It didn't seem as difficult to get them to sit down and talk to each other.  The stakes weren't as high obviously as the stakes today and the stakes today include the drugs, they include the, the fact that there are weapons that are easily, easily brought out.  So those are some of the, the things.  Some people think that the music is a factor; I don't think so.  Some of the music that we listened to and I've gone back and looked at some of the 78s and LPs and they have sexist lyrics and things, probably not as much by way of language that you would have in some of the, the rap music today.  So there's--I just think shades on that, that there's too much credit given to the music that the youth listen to today in terms of its negative impact.  There's been that over time and so I don't see that that's a major--a major factor.
Story_ID: 395487
Speaker 1: Now as you continue to work with youth at the Lincoln House [Boston, Massachusetts], urban renewal was arriving in Boston [Massachusetts], was on the scene, and so quite naturally, then you had to begin to look at, at that kind of a change because you had been born and raised here.  So tell me how your work then kind of broadened and, and what were some of the issues that you faced as a youth leader but also with the larger issues around urban renewal.
Speaker 2: Well, before we do that, I think it's important to at least to talk about the kind of work with youth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The--and it's something that continues today, and that is that we believe in what we call the role model approach, and that meant when I started out, I worked on the street corners because there were conflicts between groups. Became important to understand that the way I grew up was that I wanted to do what my older brother [Everton King] and his peers did.  So they played sports, I played sports.  They used to sit and play cards on the steps, poker for pennies, we didn't have any money, so we went out and found matchbook covers and we put a value on one that said safety first, et cetera.  So the idea of modeling that I watched in my own experience I thought would make sense if I was gonna do work with youth.  And so the first thing that was important was to get the older guys on the corner involved in athletics, and one of the big issues was football, later basketball, baseball.  But by starting with them, in the subsequent years, not only did we have the seniors, we got intermediates and juniors, all different levels of teams in the community.  One of the good things about that which is a piece of what I think about today is that the older guys, some when they stopped playing but even while they were playing were available to coach the young boys.  And so we made that a major piece of the work by bringing them together.  It gave us an opportunity to bring the different racial ethnic backgrounds that existed in the South End [Boston, Massachusetts] together on teams.  And we'd go out to play places and people would say, "Oh here comes that United Nations team."  That was very interesting because I grew up, people called the neighborhood I lived in, the other schools that I went to, the little League of Nations.  That was okay because we did have a way of bringing folks, folks together.  One experience that during some of the early issues around desegregation, we had a team which was mostly black young people playing a team in South Boston [Boston, Massachusetts], and the older fellas who were mostly white would come to watch the younger folks play.  Anyhow, a fight broke out and the people who were white from South Boston were about to do something destructive to the young people who were playing who were mostly black and a wave of white young adults from the South End went onto the field, intercepted it.  And one of the interesting things after it was there was a police officer who was there, white with his brogue, he said, "I'd never believe I'd see the likes of it where in Boston, in South Boston, there would be white people coming out to support the, the black youngsters," et cetera.  So he was impressed with the fact.  But that's what we had built up and that kind of relationship was with the different ethnic groups, with the different ages in there.  So that's a major piece, this role modeling of the ongoing work that, that we do.
Story_ID: 395488
Speaker 1: Because of that and we can say more about this later as we talk about electoral politics, when we were in the urban renewal issues--let me back up.  While at college [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], I got a clipping, newspaper from my parents--parent, my mother [Urcilla Earle King], and it was the Traveller [Boston Evening Traveller] newspaper, and there was a headline on it that said I lived in skid row.  Skid row, I called it home.  And it was important for me to understand this whole issue of how they labeled it as a way to discredit us and then to make it easier to move in and to take it over, and that's what, what happened.  However, the Lincoln House [Boston, Massachusetts] and then the United South End Settlements or Federation of South End Settlements [Boston, Massachusetts] first, became a place where the people who lived in the South End [Boston, Massachusetts], particularly in the Castle Square area, who looked up and saw what had happened to where I lived, which was the New York Street aspect of the South End, and how we had gotten moved out.  They organized and said, whoa, we're gonna change the way this operates.  And what they worked on was making sure that the Castle Square area would, after it got torn down be built up and the people who lived there would have a chance to come back, but it was going to be housing that was there whereas where I grew up, the industry, the light industry, took it over.  As a matter of fact, the Herald [Boston Herald] newspaper building is there now and there are other businesses that, that have grown up there.  So they said we're not gonna let that kind of thing happen.
Story_ID: 395489
Speaker 1: Well, that was a good learning experience for me because I now was working on street corners with young people, as I said with the, the gangs, and the whole question, two things came together.  The first was the issue of urban renewal, and the second was the, what they call the War on Poverty.  And the thing about the War on Poverty, they had in it what they call maximum feasible participation, which meant that when the resources came that the people who were supposed to be affected by them would participate in deciding what kind of issues they'd work on, what kind of programs they'd work on.  Well, it turned out that with Logue [Edward J. Logue] here at the redevelopment authority, he had tried to organize an organization which would play a role in some of the social service issues as urban renewal unfolded.
Speaker 2: Who was Ed Logue?  Who was Logue?
Speaker 1: Ed Logue was the head of the Boston Redevelopment Authority.  He'd come from New Haven [Connecticut] and was going to be the big person to move Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: And how do you spell his last name?
Speaker 1: L-O-G-U-E.
Speaker 2: Thanks.
Speaker 1: And he brought some of the agency heads, one of them being Charlie Liddell [Charles Liddell] who was the director of United South End Settlements [Boston, Massachusetts] to plan on this agency which came Action for Boston Community Development [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Was Charlie Liddell, was he kind of your boss?
Speaker 1: Well, he was--
Speaker 2: Your--
Speaker 1: --kind of my boss--he was--
Speaker 2: He was your boss.
Speaker 1: --the executive director--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --of the--so we listened to what they were saying about the money and who was supposed to be making the decisions and some of us met and said it ought to be in the community.  And I was on the staff at United South End Settlements as the street worker and I raised that and joined with the residents around the process of money coming to them and they decided.  And that did not sit too well with the agency and they fired me.  Mistake.  Because what it did was got all these folks who I had been working with to mobilize and picket the agency in a way that they had to rehire, rehire me and then as the urban renewal thing was shaping up, raised the question about my working doing community organizing with folks.  Because most of the community organizing that the agency was doing was with the home owners and with the businesses.  And I raised the question, it was--people weren't working with their--the tenants.  They--and that we needed something that would allow renters to be able to have some kind of a voice in, in the process.  So at 48 Rutland [Street], we met with folks and pulled together an organization which we called CAUSE, a Community Assembly for a Unified South End.
Story_ID: 395490
Speaker 1: So what were the results of this CAUSE [Community Assembly for a Unified South End] as it's called, C-A-U-S-E?  What, what were the strategies and what were the results for you?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the results is this complex right here, the Tent City.  But that resulted as did IBA [Inquilinos Boricuas en Accion] and other developments without which today there wouldn't be any folks whose incomes were low in this neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Tell me about Tent City.  What is Tent City?  What's the history there briefly?
Speaker 2: Tent City comes about as part of the process.  CAUSE was insisting on an electoral urban renewal committee.  They were insisting on the housing of people onsite.  People were being relocated, dislocated off site.  They said let's rebuild some of the buildings that you've taken, move people into them before you do anything with their, their, their buildings.  And we wanted the committee to reflect an election and not just the anointed people by the city redevelopment authority [Boston Redevelopment Authority].  So in order to move the redevelopment authority in the city, we engaged in several actions like going to the local office and taking it over, going to the--down to city hall and taking it over, and then decided one day when the word got out that this particular area where there was a parking lot and buildings around to the side, that they were gonna take those over and give them as a parking lot, we adopted this strategy that we would come and put a huge picket line around this place.  And then we did so, stopped people from parking, automobile Volkswagen bus drove into me and knocked me down 'cause we were out on the streets picketing, and as a result of that, people attacked the, the driver.  There's a series of fights and, anyhow, twenty-three of us got arrested.  And while we were in jail, the rest of the folks who weren't arrested started building what got to be Tent City, students from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and plenty other places came, word got out.  They put cardboard wood tents, et cetera, and so a good chunk of the area where they'd been parking was covered with tents.  It took--that happened in 1968.  In 1988, they finally got this built and so we're right now in the process of trying to get it to move from the owners and developers to the residents so that it can be a cooperative under their control.  The unique aspect of it--maybe not unique now, was that we ended up with an elected Urban Renewal Committee which was then able to make the decisions about who could get what parcel of land to build on.  And as a result, we have IBA, we have TDC [Technical Development Corporation], a number of these, Tent City, Methunion [Methunion Manor Cooperative, Boston, Massachusetts], where the residents are--their income's below the, the median and some are public housing eligible.  And when I say that without this effort, no doubt in my mind given the trend in this neighborhood and other cities, there would not be the number of folks whose incomes are low living in the South End [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: And making decisions about--
Speaker 2: What's going on.
Story_ID: 395491
Speaker 1: Tell me about IBA.  What does IBA stand for, briefly, and what is that--what was that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --project?
Speaker 2: IBA is Inquius- Inquilinos Boricuas en Accion, it's Puerto Rican tenants association, Boricuas--I'm not sure whether it was a neighborhood or the name that was given to Puerto Rico.  In any event, it's a housing complex, incredibly organized work put together.  They did something very good.  What they did was have the architect go to Puerto Rico with people to look at the lifestyle there and that's why there's a plaza, that's why there's the homes around the plaza, look out on it.  And with that kind of thing, they were able to put something up which really reflects the lifestyle that people from Puerto Rico have.  It's probably one of the best pulled together housing developments run by Latino folks in the country.
Story_ID: 395492
Speaker 1: From this community organizing and the building of institutions in the sense that you played a major role in, you then moved into what we call electoral politics and I wanna talk about--have you talk about your runs for the Boston School Committee and then the eventual election as a state representative of the 9th Suffolk District in the Massachusetts General Court [General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts].  But tell me about your very first election that you were telling me before we went on camera.
Speaker 2: Yeah, people think that the first election was the--the first office that I ran for was the school committee.  The first one that I got elected to was--however, when--if you sold newspapers or shined shoes, you had to have a license, and there were certain restrictions on when you could shine shoes or sell newspapers during the summer because you were supposed to be in school.  And what they did or had was a tribunal.  There were three individuals who themselves who were licensed as either shoe shiners or newspaper peddlers who were elected across the city from those folks who had licenses to be part of this tribunal, and there were a couple of adults who also were appointed by the city.
Speaker 1: Did you have licenses for both?
Speaker 2: No, I just did newspaper.  My father [Watts King] would not let us shine shoes.  He had an experience where he saw a black person shining shoes of a white person and the white person got up, didn't pay him, and then spit on the black person.  And I'll never forget, my brother came in, my older brother [Everton King] came in with a shoe shine box that he made either in school or at one of the neighborhood centers and my father broke it up and he said you'll never do that 'cause he was not gonna have that happen to, to us, et cetera.  So shoe shine, no, newspapers, okay.
Story_ID: 395493
Speaker 1: So in order to shine shoes, you had to, or sell newspapers, you had to comply with the, the rules.  And if you were found by a truant officer without a license or with--selling at a time when you weren't supposed to, they brought you in to this tribunal.  And at the tribunal, we would listen to the--your story and then decide according to what the punishment would be.  So my friends who I played ball with, grew up with on Seneca Street, decided that I should run and they would campaign for me; it was interesting.
Speaker 2: How old were you?
Speaker 1: I was fourteen.  And in junior high school [Abraham Lincoln School, Boston, Massachusetts], almost all of them were fifteen or sixteen in high school, so what we had was this very interesting thing where I'm the youngest of the crew, but they are scattered throughout the different high schools in the city.  Some were at then Mechanic Arts [Mechanic Arts High School; John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science], others were at English [English High School, Boston, Massachusetts], they were at Commerce [Boston High School of Commerce, Boston, Massachusetts], and I think there was another one at Brighton High School [Boston, Massachusetts].  So because they were at these different schools, they first went out and got the petition signed so that I had enough signatures and then they did the campaigning for me, and we won.  And I tell people that was the original Rainbow Coalition [Rainbow Coalition Party] because their names were Ezer [ph.], Cohen [ph.], Parilla [ph.], Zachavedes [ph.], Syrus [ph.], Ramus [ph.], et cetera, so whatever--we, we had this cross-section of folks who supported the campaign.  And it was just--first one, you know got an upstaging to this little primary and then we won the election.
Speaker 2: Was your father [Watts King] still living then?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Oh.  I was gonna ask you how he felt about--
Speaker 1: No, he--
Speaker 2: --this election.
Speaker 1: My mother [Urcilla Earle King] was pleased.
Speaker 2: How'd she feel about it?
Speaker 1: Oh, she was--she was pleased.  She wasn't sure at first what I was doing at this, but she was pleased.  And the other thing was that we got seventy-five cents a night when we met, and so I think we used to meet every Thursday night.  And every ten weeks or so, I got a check for seven fifty or an envelope, excuse me, with seven dollars and fifty cents in it.  And so, I said, hey, that was--
Story_ID: 395494
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me about your next campaign to, to be elected.  What, what were you running for and when was that?
Speaker 2: Well, the next campaign was for the school committee [Boston School Committee].  There was an organization for--called the Committee for Boston Public Schools [sic. Citizens for Boston Public Schools]--I think I remember their name correctly.  And it was Roy Richardson, Paul Parks, and others, but Roy Richardson because this was the church around the corner that the children went to and that we had done some work together on youth issues.  And so he had suggested to them that I might be a good person 'cause we were doing stuff around the schools, a lot of work around our young people, what they were doing in schools, not doing.  We had a tutorial program.  We had workshops with parents and things, and it was also during the time with the Northern Student Movement where the young people who didn't go south for SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] did stuff up north.  And so we had some of them doing tutorial programs, and it's where you got an understanding that something was wrong with the schools in terms of what was happening because we had some very bright children, but they weren't getting into technical or to the Latin exam schools.  So they suggested and came and asked if I'd be interested in running.  Paul Parks and Roy Richardson and I thought about it and I said, "Okay."  When I finished Claf- college [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], I had--in my senior year, I was doing practice teaching and I--student practice teaching in a small, rural community, Bowman, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Bowing?
Speaker 2: Bowman.
Speaker 1: Boman.
Speaker 2: Where they had outhouses, no gym, potbellied stove, and, and in town, the white school had everything, although the black school in Orangeburg [South Carolina] was--didn't have same swimming pool and other things, but it--but I was so struck by that condition, I said to myself, sometime I'm gonna be in a position to run--to do something about this.  And so that with what was happening with the young people that I was working with got me to the point where I'd said I would run for the school committee.  And I ran with the committee for Boston Public Schools.  We had I think four candidates and two of them, one Gartland [Arthur Gartland] and O'Connor [William O'Connor], and I continued to run, not getting elected to the school committee at all, coming in sixth when they picked five, didn't make that much of a difference except it--
Speaker 1: Every voter was running at large at this point, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  And ultimately, I played a role in organizing to get the committee to be both by district and at large, both the city council [Boston City Council] and the school committee, led that movement, did the organizing work, folks like Pat Walker [Patrick C. Walker], others, to get the system changed.
Speaker 1: So when did that change?  Do you remember the year it changed?
Speaker 2: Well, the year it changed was in eighty--'79 [1979] to '83 [1983], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you ran twice, right, for the--
Speaker 2: Three, three times (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Three times for the school committee.
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961], '63 [1963]--
Speaker 1: Three.
Speaker 2: --and '65 [1965].
Story_ID: 395495
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-seven [1967], you became the director of the New Urban League--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of Massachusetts or Greater Boston [New Urban League of Greater Boston] was it called?  We just called it the Urban League, but you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Why did you move into running the Urban League?  What was the background to that, that entry for you?
Speaker 2: Well, the--again, I was asked to--I'm--that's an interesting thing now that I think about it.  I was asked to go to United South End Settlements [Boston, Massachusetts] and then I was asked to run and I was asked to consider going to the Urban League.  And I thought about it and then I remembered that I'd had some mixed experiences with the league, but, but in the long run, it was positive and important.  When I finished high school [Boston Technical High School; John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts], I didn't go to college [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] right off.  I'd heard about the Urban League and there was a man named Ed Cooper [Edward Cooper] who was running, and so I went to talk to him and he referred me to some jobs.  And one of them was to Gilchrist [Gilchrist's, Boston, Massachusetts] and the other one was to R.H. White [R.H. White's, Boston, Massachusetts].  These were shopping--I mean, department stores down--downtown.  And it was at that point that the fair employment practices laws were in and they wanted people who would go and check out.  And so they sent me to these places and I went in, and it was very interesting.  I had a high school diploma and the only thing they could find to offer me was shoe shiners and, of course, I wasn't into that.  The only other people that were working in the places were black women and they ran elevators.  So that was in 1946.  So I remembered that at least the Urban League was trying to do something positive at that particular time.  Somewhere along the line, I'd had another experience with the director and felt--not Cooper, but whoever had taken his place.  I don't remember his name but I feel like given the issues that we were--
Speaker 1: Was that--was it Otis Finland [ph.]?
Speaker 2: No.  The issues we were dealing with, he didn't, you know, broadly and so I said, well, why don't I take this on and didn't ask how much it paid, I just figured it was a job that I thought I could do, and took it on.  And I was--that was a good--I've been fortunate.  I've had good jobs (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well--
Story_ID: 395496
Speaker 1: Well, when you took on the directorship of the Urban League [New Urban League of Greater Boston], as I remember you had some major challenges because the league really hadn't been doing very much, had it?
Speaker 2: Well, it hadn't--
Speaker 1: I mean, it was kind of weak and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and it was--
Speaker 1: --tell us about what you faced as you--
Speaker 2: --it was under the control of people who were white.  It was downtown.  People didn't--'cause I remember when I first went many years ago, it was downtown.  I said, well, okay, so the first thing we did to overcome that was to move to the Dudley Station area [Dudley Square, Boston, Massachusetts].  The second thing was to change the name, so we called it the New Urban League, and so to give it that kind of thing.  But we had a board of folks who were mostly white, not from the Greater Roxbury, Boston [Massachusetts] area, and making these decisions about what was gonna happen.  And so we had to overcome that, change the board, get people on it, black, white, didn't matter, but they had to be people who were willing to work to raise money to deal with the issues that were emerging at that point and at--
Speaker 1: What was the Urban League supposed to have been doing at that point?  What was its--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --charter or program?
Speaker 2: --most of what it was doing was around employment and training to get people access.  There was an on-the-job training initiative that had come through the federal government.  Well, see one of the things that since it was a national organization, if folks at the national identified a program that they thought would be good at the local level, they would get the national resources and then see to it that they were at the local level, and one of them was on-the-job training.  You know, they did some civic stuff to get people to understand more about business and healthcare and, and those kind of things.  The--it was mostly nonfunctioning.  So we brought it to the Dudley area and I hired people.  I have to tell you, I only hire people who have an axe to grind, people who had a good sense of what they wanted to accomplish 'cause then you don't have to supervise 'em.  What you have to do is make sure they got the resources to do what they wanna do.  And so we had people like Bryant Rollins who was a writer, Toye Brown [Toye Brown Lewis] from--who just graduated from, I think NYU School of Social Work [New York University School of Social Work; Silver School of Social Work at NYU, New York, New York], Martin Gopen who both wrote and who was a good strategist.  So we ended up with, you know, those folks getting hired.
Story_ID: 395497
Speaker 1: Was there a daycare center [Children's World Day-Care Center, Boston, Massachusetts] that was established under your leadership of the league [New Urban League of Greater Boston]?  No?  Did you have a--
Speaker 2: No, we didn't--it wasn't--oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Marie Dias I'm thinking.
Speaker 2: Marie Dias.  All right.  So, yeah, when you say under us, we worked with Marie to get that to happen, got the resources to do that.  We got a camp started, Camp Osceola [Devens, Massachusetts] with, what's his name?  Oh, boy.  Anyhow, we got the camp started.  We got the Trotter School [William Monroe Trotter School, Boston, Massachusetts] named.  It was gonna be the Lee School.  They ended up doing a Lee School [Joseph Lee Elementary School, Boston, Massachusetts] but in Roxbury, the William Monroe Trotter School name.  We participated in taking over the--is it the Boardman School [Boston, Massachusetts]?  It was a school out in Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts] near Franklin Park because they weren't either hiring teachers or the kind of programs that were there.  And then we worked with Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts] to form a joint--the Community University Center for inner city--
Speaker 1: I remember that.
Speaker 2: --change [Joint Community-University Center for Inner City Change]--
Speaker 1: I remember that.
Speaker 2: --which worked with Marie, worked with Nat [Nathaniel Young] who founded First Academy [Boston, Massachusetts], worked with what eventually became Circle Inc. [Boston, Massachusetts].  And one of the big things we worked on was the construction industry which ultimately led to the Third World Jobs Clearinghouse [Boston, Massachusetts], Leo Fletcher and, of course, then Chuck Turner [HistoryMaker Charles "Chuck" Turner] took it to the Third World Jobs Clearinghouse.  But we stopped the workers who were building who had come from out of town up on Columbia Road, up in that aspect, had--Bryant Rollins took on Weaver [Robert C. Weaver] who was secretary of housing and urban development, came into town and we put up a picket line, stopped that from happening in order to push the issue of blacks in construction and of who could get the contracts to do that, that work.
Story_ID: 395498
Speaker 1: I recall, too, Mel [HistoryMaker Melvin King], that you and the league [New Urban League of Greater Boston] took on one of the major local funders here in the City of Boston [Massachusetts], United Way [United Way Worldwide].  And tell us about your action towards the United Way?  What was that group and what was your complaint?
Speaker 2: Well, we felt we were doing work in the community and that there were other organizations, but when we looked at the allocation of resources, very little was going directly to organizations that were run by black people and that even today is an issue of they give to white organizations to work with folks of color.  And so we put in some proposals and we didn't get the kind of support that we thought was important.  And so in order for them to understand, we went down to their banquet, it was an afternoon luncheon, and went around with some bags and picked up the trash or the scraps off the table.  And then I went up to the podium and asked to speak, and just took the trash and dumped it on the table saying, we're not taking your crumbs anymore, and withdrew from the United Way, telling them we didn't want their money.
Speaker 1: But they hadn't been giving you anything anyway, had they?
Speaker 2: Well, they'd been but it was so--
Speaker 1: Small (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) small--
Speaker 1: Miniscule.
Speaker 2: --in comparison to what we were asking.
Speaker 1: So what was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, see, one of the things that happened was this, that because we were taking on the construction industry, right, and, and the unions, and some of the union members were on the board of United Way in terms of making recommendations for allocations, that they were the ones who were stopping or saying we shouldn't get, get more money.  And so that was kind of their retaliatory approach to the work we were doing to get people into the unions.
Speaker 1: What was the upshot of this disruption that you created at the banquet then of the, the--
Speaker 2: Well, it's a very interesting thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What, what happened?
Speaker 2: --because we got chastised by the Urban League [National Urban League].  Whitney Young sent what's his name up to deal with us--oh, what was his name, he was--anyhow, he--to deal with us and we ended up with the board now more together 'cause even when Whitney came, told him why are you on me and on us and not on the United Way?  And so they pushed him to the place--was it Whitney or Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] at that time--to provide us with some money, and so we got money from the League, national for the next couple years and then I raised other kinds of money to keep it--to keep it going.  So we did get their support.  However, shortly after it took place, there was a National Urban League conference in St. Louis [Missouri], and I went to St. Louis and I got cheered by the people there.  They came up to me--these are the other execs [executives], they came up and said, "Thank you."  I said, "What are you talking about?"  Said, "Since you did what you did over there, the United Way called us in and we got increases and another, we got increases." Okay?  So we had pushed the United Way around the country to do more for the Urban Leagues than they had done.
Speaker 1: So I have this--
Speaker 2: The other thing that happened is that they changed the board of the Urban League here--I mean, of the United Way and got more folks of color involved on it and particularly on the decision making approach.
Story_ID: 395499
Speaker 1: I wonder if many people realize these positive results.  I remember this time and it was very controversial and people were criticizing you and dah, dah, dah.  But, let me say, I get a sense that when you look back over your leadership of the Urban League [New Urban League of Greater Boston] for roughly four years, did you feel pretty good about those years?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: What you--and what you were able to accomplish or not?  I don't know.
Speaker 2: For me, this is--first of all, I have to say that nobody does anything on their own and so I--I'm not into accepting that.  I just wanna tell this story 'cause I think it explains why.  There was a woman, Catherine Richardson--Richards [ph.].  She was a federal official and head of the juvenile delinquency.  And she came to me with a group of us who were youth workers.  I'll never forget, she came to 48 Rutland [Street], she sat down and talked with us.  And some of the youth workers were extolling how great they were, how they'd done this with this youth and that, you know, and she said, "Well what about the ones that you didn't get?  Are you taking the blame for what happened to them?"  And I sat there and I listened, so her message was, well, you know, you--well what about the others?  And so when you ask do you feel good about what happened?  I mean, you make some changes.  On the other hand, you didn't make the major change so that we wouldn't be in the shape we're in, in now.  So you have to reflect on, on what you really did and whether, obviously, it wasn't enough.  [HistoryMaker] Vincent Harding has this saying in 'There is a River' ['There is a River: The Black Struggle for Freedom in America'] about not--that what we want is a new and informed community and not equal opportunity in a dehumanized society.  So, yeah, I think we got some aspects of equal opportunity but still an overall dehumanized society, so how do you say that, you know, you can feel good about what you did?  All you can say is you tried and maybe that--maybe in looking back you say, well, gee, the--it's like part of the whole Civil Rights Movement, yeah.  You can sit anywhere on the bus but a lot of folks don't have money to get on the bus.  So what we did was important but what we didn't do may be more important in terms of the change, structural change that is needed in this country.
Story_ID: 395500
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-one [1971], I believe you left the Urban League [New Urban League of Greater Boston] directorship and an idea that you had I guess in the early '70s [1970s] resulted in the initiation and the beginning of the Community Fellows Program [Mel King Community Fellows] at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology [Cambridge, Massachusetts] which is ongoing today.  Tell us about that idea and tell us what was the Community Fellows Program and what was your role--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --right at the beginning and through the program?
Speaker 2: It's the idea of people who were getting burnt out from their struggles and if you saw people in the '60s [1960s], you know, up all day, night, struggling to make a difference.
Speaker 1: Were you one of those?
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter) struggling to make a difference and, you know, you can see where they get burnt out, don't have as much access to family.  And so I'd always thought about what--'cause in education, people get paid sabbaticals and even working in the settlement house, we had the month of September off.  I mean, you work with young people, they went to camp, and in between camp and when you started the fall program, you had--you had time off.  And even there, you got some kind of sabbaticals if you were there long enough.  So what we ended up with was people getting burnt out, not having any way to rest, going through the intensity of this.  And so I always wondered what could happen for folks who were on the firing line at that level?  The other side of it is that I was doing some consulting work with a place called Sanders Associates up in New Hampshire [Nashua, New Hampshire] where they were applying to do a Jobs Corps program and so working with some folks around how do you get one started, what would it be like, et cetera, in terms 'cause I'd done a lot of work with youth and thought that would be good to put that into it.  So in driving up there, it was very interesting to see all these business that got established on Route 128, Route 3, and as I did some other thinking through it and went to meetings out in the suburbs with people who were interested in doing something about the issues that we had, in talking with people, and some of them were MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] graduates, they had taken what they'd learned from MIT and started these businesses.  And then what MIT had done is given them a chance to think through these business--you know, these ideas, and then they went out and implemented them.  I said, well, if we could get that to happen for folks who were struggling around--'cause I know all of us had some ideas about what would make work in the communities better, what would make a difference in people's lives.  So I said at some point, that's something that needs to happen.  Well, I was on a plane, got on a plane coming from Washington, D.C., and when I went through the class curtain, sitting in the first seat with space beside him was Jerome Wiesner, president of MIT, and I sat beside him and I told him what I thought we needed by way of the kind of program and the kind of role that MIT needed to play in the community by working with these folks.
Story_ID: 395501
Speaker 1: Fortunately, you had a seat on an airplane, coming back to Boston [Massachusetts] with the president of MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and you were telling--
Speaker 2: Well, I sat down and I had met Mr. Wiesner [Jerome Wiesner] in the past through the efforts with the organizing around the METCO [Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity, Boston, Massachusetts] program, et cetera, and his wife [Laya Wainger Wiesner] was very much involved in that.  And I had been part of a summer study on--in--on education in which we came up with a systems analysis approach for, for the schools.  Sat down next to him, explained to him what the role that I thought MIT should be playing with relationship to the community and how it would be important for folks to be able to come to rest, reflect, research, get revitalized around development of programs, and that he should wanna get that to happen as a role that MIT would be playing.  We talked and when we finished and the plane landed, he gave me a couple of names of people to call, said he would call Lloyd Rodwin who was the department head for urban studies and Charlie [ph.], who headed the urban, oh boy, institute.  In any event, he called both of them, they both called me, set up meetings.  Lloyd put Larry Susskind [Lawrence Susskind] to work on writing a proposal.  Prior to that, I had had some contact with the folks at the Rockefeller Foundation [New York, New York] and I'd explained to them why I thought for their leadership issue that this would be--the kind of idea that I had would make some sense.  And so re-contacted them, they contacted, and so we got money from them.  Plus, they had a contact with another foundation, so between them, we got the money to bring the first group of community fellows into the program [Community Fellows Program; Mel King Community Fellows] at MIT.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: Seventy-one [1971], '72 [1972].
Story_ID: 395502
Speaker 1: The idea as I spelled out was for rest, reflection, revitalization, reorganization, to give people a chance to come and think, to take some classes but to spend the time thinking about how to solve problems that we had in the community.
Speaker 2: Where did these people come from that first--
Speaker 1: Well, the first year and every year, we tried to take some from Boston [Massachusetts] and Massachusetts, but most of them would come from across the country.  They'd come from Texas; California; Illinois, Chicago [Illinois]; New York; D.C. [Washington D.C.]; Seattle, Washington; Portland [Oregon].  We'd get people from across.  So I had a couple of thoughts in mind, first that they should come across the country so that we could get different ideas.  They also should definitely be representative of communities of color.  So I think every year, we had somebody--we may have missed one or two that was African American, Latino, both Puerto Rican and from--or Chicano or we had a Native American.  There were times when we had some of the ethnic groups that were Latin or, or black so that we tried to make sure--we had folks who were gay, lesbian, to get a cross-section of people and experiences in the program because that's where those good ideas would come from.
Speaker 2: So every year, you had a class of fellows who would come who had access to you, access to the faculty of urban studies and planning, access to the resources of MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to begin to look at some of the issues and problems they were dealing with back at their home city--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  In terms of the access, we had a class called issues and strategies in community development so that we could go across, whether it's housing jobs, image issues, media, and get people thinking about those.  Then, there was the access to the faculty where they could work with a faculty person around the specific area of concern, but we broadened it.  They had access to people at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and at Brandeis [Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts] so that they could take advantage of whatever expertise there.  And we also hooked people up with people in Boston who had some programs that they were running which may have been similar to an idea that somebody had elsewhere.  And then most importantly, they had access to each other and--'cause this is where that cross-section could come.  And as you know, having been one, how much being able to bounce ideas off of folks who had been on the ground and how important that is.
Story_ID: 395503
Speaker 1: So in 1971, you became--what was your ro- title?  What was your position at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] then?
Speaker 2: Well, I was lecturer and director, associate director.  There were two of us, [HistoryMaker] Frank Jones, myself.  Frank was a, a tenured person at the institute and I just came in as a person to run the program.  Now when I proposed the idea to Rodwin [Lloyd Rodwin] and others, the idea was to get some national person to do that and, let's see, who was head of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] at that time?  James Farmer.  We tried to get Farmer to be the head.  I spoke with him; he didn't wanna do it.  We tried getting other national people and finally, Rodwin called up and said, well, why don't you just do it instead of--you had the idea, et cetera, and okay.
Speaker 1: Now, you served as the director of this program for how many years then?
Speaker 2: Twenty-five.
Speaker 1: Twenty-five years.  And you had an associate director in the early years--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) who had--fellow.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, [HistoryMaker] Hubie Jones, had been a fellow, and then after Hubie, we had Yonokonai Racis [ph.] who now is a professor at New Hampshire College [sic.].  Then, we--Alma Armstrong played a role and then, what's her name, Antonia Darder, who later went out to college to work in California.
Speaker 1: You're planning a reunion in October I guess of, of 2006, to bring all of the former fellows together over the years.  How many fellows had participated roughly over the years?
Speaker 2: Roughly 187, close to two hundred over the years.
Speaker 1: I'm sure you remember all of them, but are there any who really stand out in your mind today who are out there in, in big positions right now perhaps as a result of the fellows program and what they got through that or anybody that, that--
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting, again, as a result of the fellows program, I don't know.  As a result of their thinking, their ingenuity, their ability to put things together, obviously.  And who--there's several around here, Hubie Jones, Chuck Turner [HistoryMaker Charles "Chuck" Turner], you have Gloria Fox who is a state legislator.  We had several people who'd become--who have gotten into politics.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Byron Rushing--
Speaker 2: Byron--
Speaker 1: --who--
Speaker 2: --Rushing.  So that--and we had Sara Garcia who got into politics in Cambridge [Massachusetts] and who's working--has been working with developing educational programs and schools in New York, in New York City [New York, New York].  We just lost Clarence Barney [Clarence L. Barney, Jr.] who incidentally was buried during the Katrina hurricane [Hurricane Katrina] and who did some incredible work trying to get people's support around the Superdome [Louisiana Superdome; Mercedes-Benz Superdome] that was being built in, in New Orleans [Louisiana].  We can go across the--across the country where we could see a lot of things.  Out in Seattle [Washington], there were--some of the folks have put stuff, stuff together.
Speaker 1: The Community Fellows Program [Mel King Community Fellows] continues today in what mode, in what fashion today?
Speaker 2: Well, it's now called the Center for Reflective Community Practice and I think it's a good model in that reflection is a very important piece of the, the model to do that.  The second thing is, community fellows is like gender specific 'cause fellows is usually seen as a male term, and so changing it, I think, is a very important thing to do.  What they also think about is whereas we brought people from across the country, they think of getting a critical mass from a particular community in doing that, so I think that's a very important, important piece of it.  So it continues in that form.  Ceasar McDowell is the director of the program and is very much into the, the role that is necessary in order for the people to take advantage of MIT and each other, and if you do it in a place like Springfield [Massachusetts], then you're able to see how they can have impact on policies and practices right there.
Story_ID: 395504
Speaker 1: And current with your initiation of the Community Fellows Program [Mel King Community Fellows] and becoming the associate and then director, you made decision to run for another elected office.  Tell us about that because that's a major piece--
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) of your life and, and a major contribution to, to Boston [Massachusetts] and the state.  Tell us about that next elected office and how it coincided with the Community Fellows Program.
Speaker 2: Well, I--it's interesting.  I thought of running principally because [HistoryMaker] Hubie Jones was running for [U.S.] Congress and I had the idea that if I ran, I could bring out more people to support his campaign.  I thought I could win but I also thought that what would be most important would be to increase the pool, potential of people, 'cause it was going to be in the same district.  And so we mounted the campaign and focused it around the I-95 corridor and how we could stop that, which did get stopped, and how we could turn that land into gardens and to transportation, et cetera.
Speaker 1: What was the I-95 corridor?
Speaker 2: Well, it's part of the National Defense Highway System [National System of Interstate and Defense Highways] where I-95 comes from up in Canada and goes all the way down to Florida, and they wanted to put it into a piece of Boston and other aspects of it and so there'd been some serious organizing, bringing people together from East Boston [Boston, Massachusetts], Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], South End [Boston, Massachusetts], Forest Hills [Boston, Massachusetts], Jamaica Plain [Boston, Massachusetts], Dover [Massachusetts], one of the best organizing coalition efforts ever, ever, and in so doing, stopped it and now the question is what do we do to move it into a different direction?  And so part of the--so that was part of the campaign and, obviously, employment, other issues that made some sense.  So I did run on that basis and we did bring out some people to support Hubie's campaign; however, it wasn't enough to compete with--
Speaker 1: Was he running for Congress during the year that he was a community fellow at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or was it the following year?
Speaker 2: Oh, it, it was while he was a fellow.
Speaker 1: So that'd be '71 [1971], '72 [1972]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, same year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you decided in '71 [1971] that you were gonna run--
Speaker 2: Well, '72 [1972]--
Speaker 1: Seven--
Speaker 2: --because seventy--see, the fellows program goes September to--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --June but the campaign--so '71 [1971] September and then '72 [1972] starting January, and that's when the campaign got--and so after the--so he starts in June--I mean, in '72 [1972] and then after the election, we--which is in November, you get into office in '73 [1973].
Story_ID: 395505
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit briefly about that campaign for state representative.  What was--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: How did you go about organizing yourself for that?
Speaker 2: I could get you the papers, the stuff to look at.  We did a number of things that I think we can directly attribute to the, the winning of that particular campaign.  One was purely coincidental, and that is that we chose purple as the color--I shouldn't say we.  Somebody came in with a design for our literature which was purple.  Well, it turned out that at that point, it was the color that was used in the gay community.  And so people thought that I was supportive of those.  Well, yes, because staff I had when I was running the youth worker program and at the Urban League [New Urban League of Greater Boston], I had folks working who were gay, so it didn't dawn on me that that was a, a major contributing factor.  We had this idea because now I told you about the young people I work with in terms of making posters; we could silkscreen them.  And so a couple of the youngsters were working in a place where they did silkscreening and so they would get screens and cut out the Mel King For Rep emblem and use that.  And so they came to our headquarters and they did that on a basis.  We decided that we needed to put something in people's hands that was different from the regular handout, so I hit on this idea of shopping bags.  And we--and this is something that I think is important, silkscreened 6700 shopping bags and I would go to the supermarkets and I'd stand outside, and when people went in, we'd hand it to 'em so when they came out, you know, they'd have my stuff--I mean, their stuff in, in the shopping bags.  And it was a sight sometimes to stick beyond Mass Ave [Massachusetts Avenue] or Washington Street or any of the places in the district [9th Suffolk District] and see people walking down carrying the, the bag with the name.  And then the other place was that people used to put their garbage in the bags and put it outside, so not only did I get it going into the house, I got it when they were finished with it out--outside.  So we thought that--but the amount of votes that we won by that we got, 6500 plus.  So we almost got a vote for every bag that we had.
Speaker 1: Now, you were running to represent what district?  Just describe the district for--
Speaker 2: Well, the district (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) our viewers.
Speaker 2: --was a double district.  It was wards four and ten which was South End [Boston, Massachusetts], Back Bay [Boston, Massachusetts], a piece of it, a piece of the Fenway [Fenway-Kenmore, Boston, Massachusetts], Jamaica Plain [Boston, Massachusetts], and a piece of Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], so we had some of the public housing and we also had luxury houses, so we had the contract.  Fenway Park [Boston, Massachusetts] was in the district, et cetera, some of Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] students in the district, so we had it up and down.  The other thing we did, in order to bring people together, IBA [Inquilinos Boricuas en Accion] was in the district.  We had what we call a traveling meal, and in that traveling meal, we had one part of it at IBA, one part of it at Union Methodist Church [Union United Methodist Church, Boston, Massachusetts], another part at St. Cecilia's Church [St. Cecilia Church, Boston, Massachusetts] in the Fenway [sic.], another part at Bromley-Heath [Mildred C. Hailey Apartments, Boston, Massachusetts], and another part at the newspaper there in JP [Jamaica Plain].  And it meant that people had to go from one place to the other to see--I mean, to get their meal and we charged something like $2.50 each or $5 a family or something.  We got 750 people who came and ate throughout.  So what that did--and we gave people a map, showed them not only these places but the voting places.  So we were able to bring people from across the district to meet each other, to see what their district was, et cetera, and it was I think one of the best campaign events that I ever participated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did you feel--
Story_ID: 395506
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did you feel at the moment that you knew you had been elected state representative of the 9th Suffolk District?  How did you feel that night?
Speaker 2: Well, the first feeling was the primary and, of course, that's obviously critical.  We won and we beat both the incumbents in, in that.  And then the--well, in a way, the primary was--'cause there wasn't any opposition on the Republican side, so I knew that I had won, but you really only know you win until Septe- November when you have the election.  So it was exhilarating having run for the school committee [Boston School Committee] three times, having lost, so this was, was very, very important, very powerful in terms of my life and in terms of, of--
Speaker 1: What role did your wife, Joyce [Joyce King], play in this victory?
Speaker 2: Well, I think you need to ask her.  I mean, she did, you know, some of the obvious things with the campaigning, et cetera, at points wasn't a big thing.  We had these children that we were dealing with, so that was obviously karma.  But I, I think you have to ask her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause she doesn't like me speaking--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --for her--
Speaker 1: You went to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) on issues like this.
Speaker 1: You went to the House of Representatives [Massachusetts House of Representatives] in January of 1973.  What roles did you begin to play as a state legislator?  I know when I was directing METCO [Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity, Boston, Massachusetts], you were on the education committee [Joint Committee on Education].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I remember that.  What roles did you begin to play?
Speaker 2: Well, first I think it's important to understand that what happened at the same time was there were five of us that were--got--that got elected.  There were five--there was the two Bollings [Royal Bolling, Sr. and Royal Bolling, Jr.], there was [HistoryMaker] Doris Bunte--well, maybe there was four--oh, yeah, Bill Owens [William Owens], yeah, the two Bollings, Doris Bunte, Bill Owens, and myself.  So that was unique as quiet as it's kept, and so we formed a legislative caucus.  We got some money from the speaker in order to hire--
Speaker 1: Black Legislative Caucus.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  Right.  From the speaker to hire staff which was--staff was not a big thing there when we first started out and then later, everybody got a staff person.  But we had a caucus staff which made us a unifying body and that we began to work together around, around different issues.  Now, we each had legislative ideas that we put out, but, but what was most important was to make sure that we could work together around different issues.  And one major piece that came up was a senatorial seat, and we really worked together to change it so that we could get then Royal Bolling, Sr., elected to, to be in the state--
Speaker 1: What do you mean when you say senatorial seat, at least for the viewers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: What was the situation?
Speaker 2: --there was, what do you call, redistricting and we said that we had a population that should be represented in the Senate [Massachusetts Senate] and that they needed to redraw the lines so that could happen, and in redrawing--in drawing the lines, they did make that possible, but they also drew 'em in a way that didn't make it possible for one of the Jewish senators to be reelected, et cetera.  But anyhow, we ended up getting the seat that we worked for because the governor at that point, Sargent [Francis W. Sargent], said he would veto it if they didn't come in with a seat that reflected our communities, okay.  So that was a major piece that we worked on.  Kay Gibbs, Diane Renfroe, our staff people were phenomenal in terms of the work they did in getting this together.  And it was important because it showed what we could do, you know, small in number, working together, being on the case, understanding who--what the issues are and really pulling the pieces, the levers that were necessary in order to make, make a difference.
Story_ID: 395507
Speaker 1: And then, for me, there were several issues that I had campaigned on.  My first speech was around returning the land that was taken back to the people for the highway, okay, and then the issues around the schools.  We got into the desegregation issues, the--what do you call it?  Well, the racial imbalance law [Racial Imbalance Act of 1965] had already been passed, but we worked on those pieces.  From then, on the big issues were around the school financing thing, so being on the committee on education [Joint Committee on Education], I could deal with that.  There issues on lead poisoning 'cause I was also on the healthcare committee, so we pushed that.  But my fun committee was to get on natural resources and agriculture, where I got through the community gardens act, the Massachusetts Farm and Gardening Act [Massachusetts Gardening and Farm Act of 1974].  We got through farmland preservation, a number of things, and I got awarded by the conservationists and all the folks because of the work we did with that.  We got farmers markets back in.  We got things where they had to purchase food that was grown in Massachusetts.  And so people thought I was some kind of expert on food policy, et cetera.  It was very simple.  I like to eat, I like to eat fresh, and so whenever I said that, it just increased my support.
Speaker 2: You were serving as adjunct faculty and director of the Community Fellows Program [Mel King Community Fellows] during the same decade that you served as a state rep.  How did you handle both of those?
Speaker 1: It was very easy.  One of the things we did was to get some economic development legislation, Community Development Finance Corporation [Massachusetts Community Development Finance Corporation], and the way we did it was to combine the two.  So we used some of the MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] students, faculty with people who were in community development corporations.  We used to meet every Wednesday morning.  We formed a Wednesday breakfast club, fashioned the legislation there, and then took it to the House of Representatives [Massachusetts House of Representatives] and beyond 'til we got it passed.  So MIT students and faculty could participate in it and then we moved on from there.  The other thing is that the timing and the proximity of the legislature [General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts] to where my office was, was just two stops away on the Red Line.  And so I could do my hearings, come back, do some of the work at MIT in the evening because that's when my class was on Tuesday evenings, and for the other meetings, I could schedule them around that.
Story_ID: 395138
Speaker 1: Tell me about other significant legislation that you conceptualized and sponsored as a state representative.
Speaker 2: Well, I think there are two and they go hand and hand--pieces of legislation--and I do feel very, very good about in terms of their, their impact.  First is the Community Development Finance Corporation [Massachusetts Community Development Finance Corporation] legislation which was an outgrowth of trying to equip community development corporations, particularly around the land on the corridor with ways of getting resources in order to do job creation business development, and so we were able to get that passed.  It's--we just had its thirtieth anniversary.  There's been thousands of jobs created, housing built as a result of it.  A companion piece was CEDAC, Community Economic Development Assistance Corporation.  That was the one in which people could do some of the planning and get some technical assistance for, for it.  That still is in existence.  It's a year younger than the CDFC, Community Development Finance Corporation.  So I'm pretty good in, in terms of myself about having done that.  And the fruition bill, which is one in which people could grow fruit trees, nut trees, berry bushes with support from the department of agriculture [Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources] throughout the--on nonprofit lands on schools, et cetera.  And just one day having just coincidentally gone to the tribal council in Mashpee [Massachusetts] and seeing them with some of these plants that they were putting in just made it really complete in terms of the process to doing that.  There are other things that I think we could call on, but those two ends of it are the ones that I'm very, very pleased about (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You served for ten years in the legislature [General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts] and that ended and why did it come to an end?  What--
Speaker 2: Well, let me back up because at its end was--it's funny.  Sometimes you forget what did--I did the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday [Martin Luther King, Jr. Day] here in Massachusetts; I got that through, went through some stuff with the leadership but that's a bill that I filed and got through, and I think we may have been the second or third state in the country to have it as a--as a holiday.  The other one was the bill to divest from South Africa.  We got that through.  The first thing I did one evening on Ways and Means [House Committee on Ways and Means] one night, two o'clock in the morning was put an amendment on to say that we'd stop any further pension money going to South Africa.  And then in the next eighteen months, we ended up overriding Governor King's [Edward J. King] veto 'cause he vetoed the bill to take our money out of South Africa to divest and we overrode it.  There's only about six people and I think I can name them who didn't vote for--out of the 200, 160, 200 people.  Anyhow, so that was a--and important bill.  And the reward that I got for that was being able to introduce Nelson Mandela and Winnie Mandela to a half a million people at the esplanade [Charles River Esplanade, Boston, Massachusetts] when he was here after having gotten out.
Story_ID: 395139
Speaker 1: I'm not even sure, what was your question to me(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All I said, your, your tenure of ten years came to an end at some point as a state rep.  What brought that to an end?  Why did you--did you decide not to run?
Speaker 1: Well, I decided to run for mayor, that's one, and the other thing is I've always believed that--well, two things.  I decided to run for mayor.  One day I was walking into the chambers and one of the house officers opened the door and said, "Good afternoon, Mr. Representative."  And I realized I liked that sound.  And that day, I decided I'd been there too long, okay?  'Cause I wasn't there to like the sound or to be that.  It, it just--and so I was running for mayor, it was really then I knew it was time 'cause that's not what it was supposed to be about.  So--but then because I was gonna run for mayor, I really--I had run for mayor in '79 [1979].  This time, I really wanted to use all the time and everything (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that was a phenomenal run that you made.  You really brought out the vote across the city.  Tell us about that mayoral campaign and you were a finalist and how did that all pan out for you?
Speaker 1: Well, I knew I could be in the final because we had done our work.  I knew that they had underestimated the voting potential of folks of color.  I knew that I had developed a base around because our legislation and what our work, work with women's issues, they worked with gay and lesbian issues, and you can go across and you can see and so we had that kind of base that was out there.  Question is, could we get enough money to, to do that and to do it in a way that made some sense?  I also understood that the idea of the Rainbow Coalition [Rainbow Coalition Party] kind of symbolizing the togetherness would make, make a difference.  So even though that came a little later in the campaign, it came because the prior campaign in '79 [1979], I tried to come up with something which was kind of an umbrella of the different groups so that people could see that they were interrelated, interwoven, and that it should be that way because we shouldn't be playing one against--one against the other.  There was something else I wanted to do in the campaign and I think we did, we did--I did, and that was at a time when the racial climate was still at a place where people didn't feel they could go everywhere, I wanted to take the campaign everywhere.  So I walked South Boston [Boston, Massachusetts].  I went to the beaches in South Boston.  I walked Charlestown [Boston, Massachusetts].  I went through public housing developments in Charlestown.  People would say you're crazy for doing that.  I said--and why are you here?  I said if I'm gonna be the mayor, I'm gonna be mayor of the whole city and not just part of it.  And I know as a result of that that there were black folks who would come up to me and say, you know, I believe I can go there and--because I thought that was an important thing to do, to take it everywhere.  I walked the parades in those places and put up with some stuff as a result and people put up with stuff.  Some people who were supporters had my signs, you know?  If their windows got broken or they got threatened, they took them down.  It happened in Allston [Boston, Massachusetts], it happened in East Boston [Boston, Massachusetts], et cetera, so those are--but it was important to do for and--
Speaker 2: How close did you come to being elected?
Speaker 1: Not close enough, actually.  Obviously, it's never close enough if you don't win.  But I think that if I remember correctly, anywhere from 25 to 30,000 votes different.  I got 69,000, I think he got close to 100,000 something (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, who was your opponent?  Who was elected?
Speaker 1: Oh, Ray Flynn [Raymond Flynn].
Speaker 2: Ray Flynn.
Story_ID: 395140
Speaker 1: What came next for you, Mel [HistoryMaker Melvin king], after this campaign [for mayor of Boston, Massachusetts] and the changes that, you know, you brought as a result of, of taking that on.  What came next in your life?  You had left MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and you went from there--
Speaker 2: Well, I was at MIT--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right, too.  You were at MIT--
Speaker 2: --until ninety--
Speaker 1: Ninety-six [1996].  Until--
Speaker 2: Until '96 [1996].
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: And, well, continued to do the fellows [Community Fellows Program; Mel King Community Fellows], continued to do community development work.  The--in '94 [1994], organized a conference on the international--on the information highway which as you know became the Internet or was the Internet.  But the idea, having thought about the national defense highway system [National System of Interstate and Defense Highways] and how it ran through different communities and people couldn't get on or off, whether it was I-95, 90 or whatever.  I said, if this information highway is the same thing, then people won't get on or off.  And we had some experience already where the limited access to the technology on the part of lots of people across the country, and so organized a national conference on the information highway at MIT, got support from Kay Gibbs [S. Kay Gibbs] who was at the telephone--AT&T [AT&T Corporation; AT&T Inc.].  One of the important aspects of it came from--oh, boy I can't think of this woman's name, I should get it later--who said that it was an important thing to do, so we pull this off, and as a result, recognized that it was gonna be an important thing to do.  And so we got MIT involved and then--and, excuse me, and then we were able to open up over here, and that begun that process.  And we were one of the first community technology centers around and now there are a thousand across the country.  In Boston [Massachusetts] thanks to the Timothy Smith Fund network program developed by the, the mayor [Thomas Menino] and staff from the trust fund, Bob Fleming [Robert J. Fleming].  We have access to computers, et cetera.  But the biggest access we have is to people who have some skills and who are willing to share them.  And we've had, oh about two thousand people who've come through these doors over the past--
Speaker 1: Past ten years. Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) since we opened [the South End Technology Center @ Tent City, Boston, Massachusetts]--no, in '97 [1997].
Story_ID: 395141
Speaker 1: So here we are, this interview being conducted at the South End Technology Center [South End Technology Center @ Tent City, Boston, Massachusetts] and I'm pleased that you told me about how there are others that have spawned across the country.  By the way, let me just back up very quickly.  Are there any other programs in the country like the Community Fellows Program [Mel King Community Fellows]?  Have there ever been or does your Community Fellows Program stand out?
Speaker 2: Well, I think there are.  I think there's a program.  There are fellowship programs, research and study programs in different parts of the country, so I don't think this is a unique model.  The--well, maybe in some ways.  The--Kellogg [W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Battle Creek, Michigan] has a similar type of program.  At MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] they have one called the SPURS [Special Program for Urban and Regional Studies], special program for underdeveloped regions or whatever, so they brought people over to--from across the seas to do things.
Story_ID: 395142
Speaker 1: Another institution that I think you helped to spawn in, in recent years, we've talked a number of institutions that you've developed, is called The New Majority.  Could you say briefly something about the New Majority [New Majority Coalition] and what that is here in the City of Boston [Massachusetts] today?
Speaker 2: Well, this is an interesting thing to talk about because when the census showed that Boston's population was mostly persons of color, it was Felix Arroyo [Felix G. Arroyo] and Chuck Turner [HistoryMaker Charles "Chuck" Turner], both former community fellows, both elected to the city council [Boston City Council], who proposed the idea to the Trotter Institute [William Monroe Trotter Institute, Boston, Massachusetts], the Asian Institute [Institute for Asian American Studies, Boston, Massachusetts], and the Gaston Institute [Mauricio Gaston Institute for Latino Community Development and Public Policy, Boston, Massachusetts], black, Asian, Latino--excuse me--at UMass Boston [University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, Massachusetts] that they do something to highlight this and to work to bring the groups together around it.  And so--and just the connection to the--
Speaker 1: Community Fellows Program [Mel King Community Fellows].
Speaker 2: --community fellows and so coincidentally on my birthday, October the 20th three years ago--three years now, we held the conference at UMass out of which the New Majority has come and I was given the honor of giving the opening talk on it.  And my point for folks was that we have each powerful cultures but we needed to collectively develop a culture of power where we would be using it in a way that would benefit all the folks, and it's been very interesting to watch it unfold.  There is currently a good steering committee.  There are young folks, younger folks on it as honorary member.  And most of the folks on it are under forty and they are really working.  They pulled off one of the best forums for the past city council election in terms of participation.  We now have an Asian, Latino, and two African Americans on the city council.  The last two I think can be attributed to the work of the New Majority in part, although Sam Yoon ran an incredible campaign.  So it's been very good and I continue to work and meet with them.  And it--that's been one of the really satisfying things that's come out of my experiences.
Story_ID: 395143
Speaker 1: Another major contribution, Mel [HistoryMaker Melvin King], that you have made is your book, 'Chain of Change' ['Chain of Change: Struggle for Black Community Development,' Mel King] which I believe was published in 1983?
Speaker 2: Eighty-two [1982].
Speaker 1: Eighty-two [1982].  You talked about the culture of power in your presentation to the New Majority [New Majority Coalition], and in this book you have what I call a power theory, I guess is what you call it, but you also talk about thirty years roughly of your activities in Boston [Massachusetts] in housing politics and education.  Would you kind of tell us the main ideas in the 'Chain of Change' because this book has been used locally and nationally?
Speaker 2: Well, I think--see I have to--there's a piece in this that I think is very, very important to understand for me and it--it's [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett, 'Before the Mayflower' ['Before the Mayflower: A History of Black America'] where he talks about the issue of image and if I go back across the things that have become important to me and why the technology center [South End Technology Center @ Tent City, Boston, Massachusetts] exists which is what I was just telling the, the men out there who are now taking some courses, it has a lot to do with image and the kind of things that work with people to get them the image, their own stories out there they told because no one should know better than Bob Hayden [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden] the importance of issues of image.  I remember when I first saw this in Ebony magazine how impactful it was and I'm gonna take the time to read it 'cause I think: "This is how it was, to be powerless and to curse one's self for cowardice, to be conditioned by dirt and fear and shame and signs, to become a part of these signs and feel them in the deepest resources of the spirit, to be a placing of judges and courts and policemen, to be black in a white fire, and finally, to believe in one's own unworthiness, to be without books and pretty pictures without the rationalizations of psychology and sociology, to give in finally, to bow, to scrape, to grin, and to hate one's self for one's civility and weakness and blackness."  Now, what I tried to do with this was to take us through the kind of stages that move people from that sense to a sense of the kind of power and beauty that we have.
Story_ID: 395144
Speaker 1: And so there are stages in this where you move from service where you have to overcome the kind of issues that people talk about when, for example, they use the language of disadvantage, culturally deprived, in terms of their working--in other words, they have to change you to make you into something.  And then how once people understand the critical pieces to say that one is deserving and have rights, and of course, that's what came from the Civil Rights Movement.  And then once you do that, you organize because you believe you have rights and you insist to be treated that way which is why Rosa Parks has been--was the most significant person in terms of understanding in my life and I say that in all due respects to Paul Robeson and my mother [Urcilla Earle King] and father [Watts King] who were phenomenal, phenomenal people, but she made that statement about being somebody, being deserving, and acting on it.  And that, that when people say that, then they act that way and insist they be treated in that way, and you then organize.  And nobody, no change comes to any people or group until they've asserted for themselves that they are somebody, they're deserving, right?  'Cause then they act on that.  And so the stages go from service to organizing to institution building 'cause then you build the kind of institutions that are in your challenge.  And so what the book ['Chain of Change: Struggle for Black Community Development,' Mel King] does is to take us through what I think was an incredible period in my life and obviously in the lives of other--others where there is a chain of change, that what happens from each stage, not only happened in education, happened in housing, happened in economic development, employment, et cetera, and you can see how they play off against each other, and out of that, the phrase black is beautiful, black power comes.  So that's, for me, what is the essence of what I was trying to do in the book.  A piece of it that I like, I like the book, has to do with going to some of the people who were involved and asking them to reflect on the work they did, what they would do differently, et cetera, and I would say to people if you don't read the first part, read at least what happened to, to those folks.
Story_ID: 395145
Speaker 1: I found that back part very, very touching, very, very significant.  You also I think are known certainly to me and others as a poet and you've written a lot of poetry.  Why poetry and, and what have you written and how has it helped you and others?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know you spent a lot of time with the poems, so I'd like to kind of end this interview by talking about your poetry.
Speaker 2: Well, there are two things, and one just crossed my mind.  The first has to do with how do you get to like poetry?  And, and, and this is why I know the importance of good teachers.  I had a tenth grade teacher who loved poetry and he used to recite it, and sometimes instead of letting us recite it, you know, he'd get carried away and, and recite it.  But I was always struck by how much he enjoyed it.  And so I liked poetry as it was, but there was something about the enthusiasm with which he did it that really got to me. So that's one piece.  And then the other is it's about words and I did a lot of word puzzles, not crosswords but things and so I kind of liked doing things with words and rhyming, et cetera.  And, of course, growing up in the streets, there was a lot of rhyming that, that went on.  So, so that's a--that's a piece.  And then I used to just write quick thoughts in rhyme, okay?  And some of it may have been laziness in terms of not wanting to take the time to do, whatnot, but if I could do it cryptically, et cetera--and sometimes I looked up and I'd say, oh, that's something, okay, and then I'd add something to it.  So I wrote and one of them is--well, several of them are in the book ['Chain of Change: Struggle for Black Community Development,' Mel King].  But what I really liked that I have done is I've written a song and it has been--well, it's on a CD.  It's not on the market.  I pay and I give it away and hopefully it'll, it'll work 'cause I'm working on another one right now, and I think that for me, it's a real source of pleasure and enjoyment to be able to do that and--
Speaker 1: Could you recite one of your poems for us?
Speaker 2: Well I, I don't memorize them, so if you want and if you can grab my bag, I can do one that I think--or I can read one from there.  Well, this one is called 'Struggle' [Mel King]: "It's a struggle developing solidarity.  It's a struggle being positive.  It's a struggle making common unity.  It's a struggle shaping reality.  It's a struggle living.  It's a struggle because it's slow.  But if we struggle at developing solidarity, being positive, shaping reality, making common unity, we will all grow.  Because the struggle is to work for change and change is the focus of education.  And education is the basis of knowledge.  And knowledge is the basis for growth.  And growth is the basis for being positive.  And being positive is the basis for building solidarity.  Building solidarity is a way to shape reality and shaping reality is living, and living is loving, so struggle."
Story_ID: 395146
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you'd like to add to this interview, Mel [HistoryMaker Melvin King] that I haven't asked you about?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think that what's important has been to be in a very, very good set of relationships.  Now, the principal one has been with my wife [Joyce King] and through all of what we've gone through, the campaigns and, and struggles, that we formed a very good team.  And to be in a relationship with somebody who is a good teacher is very, very, very important.  And at some point actually if I was reading another poem, I'd read a poem I wrote about our relationship which I think speaks, for me, to a sense of community, a sense of being in this very spiritual, caring kind of relationship.
Story_ID: 395147
Speaker 1: Well, Mel King [HistoryMaker Melvin King], we have kind of three wrap-up questions for you, and the first is how do you feel about the way you have lived your life?
Speaker 2: I think about that and I feel very blessed and I've had some incredible opportunities and experiences.  I was talking about relationships and I've been the beneficiary of some incredible people who I've had a chance to learn from.  I was listening last night to a tape by Howard Thurman and I just recalled how many times I used to sit in his office and listen.  A few weeks ago, I met with Chet Pierce [Chester Middlebrook Pierce] who was a basketball coach and we talked about my brother, older brother [Everton King], how the two of them guided us.  I have friends, Peter Roach, Bill Smith, who I'm still in touch with; we grew up together, camped together.  So, I just had--and in my book ['Chain of Change: Struggle for Black Community Development,' Mel King], I dedicated it to the young people.  And it wasn't but too long ago where we sat in a restaurant in Newton [Massachusetts] and talked about the work on the street corners, et cetera.  So, I've been blessed.  I've been a state legislator elected by the people.  I have some recognition.  I have a book, a couple written, worked at the university, taught, ended up being at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] teaching or MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], had some significance.  It's even more significant to be at Roxbury Community College [Roxbury Crossing, Massachusetts] teaching.  So I've been able to go around the world.
Speaker 1: What do you still wanna do that you have not yet done?
Speaker 2: Wow.  I'd like to get one of my songs right up on the charts, et cetera.  I'd like to get something that people buy enough of it so that it gets out there, et cetera, and I'm working on one and hopefully it'll, it'll happen.  What I'd like to do or see happen is a, a end to the violence that has impacted so many of us, both locally and worldwide.  I'd really like to see or be a part of a party and a process where, yeah, really--there's real love around and not the kind of exploitation that exists.  I'd really like to be able to have--be a part of something where that has taken, taken place.
Story_ID: 395148
Speaker 1: Last question, how do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Do I wanna be remembered?  It's an interesting thing.  Let me just say this.  I--we put names of people on buildings and I worked to get John O'Bryant as--the school [Boston Technical High School; John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts] named after him.
Speaker 1: Who was John O'Bryant?
Speaker 2: John O'Bryant was a friend, a campaign manager.  We played basketball.  We did a lot of things together and he worked hard for young people.  He was on the school committee [Boston School Committee], et cetera.
Speaker 1: He was the first black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) First black--
Speaker 1: --of the 20th century, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I could understand that, you know, 'cause somebody I loved and cared very deeply for.  But I don't want my name on anything.  And I'm--you know, I, I think that we just come to do what the creator's gifts allow us to do and that's what everybody needs to feel that they can do, and I think I've tried to do that.
Story_ID: 395149
Speaker 1: And when you talk about relationships, right, this was it.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Turn it this way.  Oh, yeah, good.
Speaker 1: Who's here?
Speaker 2: My mother and father and my oldest brother.  We had a relationship, my mother, myself.  I don't know how much I've talked about how when my father died I used to go around with her to the different places, whether it was hospitals or clinics or things or to places where records needed to be found.  But we spent a lot of time together, particularly the year that I finished high school [Boston Technical High School; John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts] and before I went to college [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], and I worked.  I used to come home for lunch and it'd be just the two of us.  We'd sit and, you know, she'd make some coo-coo and--or send me up the corner to get some (unclear) to go with the coo-coo and we'd sit and talk, et cetera.
Speaker 1: Just for the record again, your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Miriam we called her, Urcilla [Urcilla Earle King], and my father's name was Watts [Watts King].
Speaker 1: And your oldest brother here?
Speaker 2: And his name was Walter [Walter King].
Speaker 1: Okay.  About what year was that taken do you think approximately?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  You got me.  I would say this had to be taken in 1921--
Speaker 1: That's, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Twenty [1920]--
Speaker 1: --close enough.
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty [1920], '21 [1921].
Speaker 1: Can you zero in on the HUGS on his shirt or not?
Speaker 2: Oh, now here's--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: --what--
Speaker 1: Tell us about the red engraving on your shirt.  It says HUGS--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and there's some stick figures underneath.  Tell us about that engraving.
Speaker 2: Well, this is something that was done by my daughter.  One of the former community fellows came and visited and gave me this shirt and I asked my daughter if she would put the symbol--put HUGS on it, and so she made this symbol.  I'm actually going to change my middle name to what it ought to be, Hugs.  I was going to do that today.  I, I am going to.  I've always said that one of the biggest things that we needed to do was to hug and, you know, we talked about it at the fellows, I talked about it all around.  And one day on my way to the Alex Haley farm in Tennessee [Clinton, Tennessee], on the highway was a sign that says, "A hug is a great gift.  One size fits all and it's easy to exchange."  And so I have t-shirts with that on the back of it and I have--I guess it's over there, a little card that I sent out--I send it out, with that saying on it and this--and this symbol.  I believe it's one of the missing dimensions in this world that we live in.  There are not enough hugs.
