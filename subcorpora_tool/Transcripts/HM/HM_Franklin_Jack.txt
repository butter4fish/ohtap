Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: I don't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Today is December 20th [2006].
Speaker 1: It's, it's around Christmastime any way.
Speaker 2: It is and the location of this interview is, this interview is taking place (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 7th [Street] and Arch [Street]. This is one--I'm, I'm more likely, the one who discovered, not discovered, but when this museum [Afro-American Historical and Cultural Museum in Philadelphia; African American Museum in Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] first opened up I was part, I've been a part of this museum ever since it opened, its opening. Even to the planning of it and a matter-of-fact, even before this museum was built I was part of it. It was always in my heart to have a museum and, lucky I was fortunate to be around and they discovered me being a fly on the wall.
Speaker 2: So what year would this, this museum--you remember when you started thinking about the planning of this museum?
Speaker 1: It was at least three years before 1973. I would say about 1973. We had, all of us had a meeting. I'm trying to think now. I can't find that, I can't--we, we had several meeting places that we were meeting because we were wanting to have, have the museum in full of, in, in, in, the center of, in all, in a black neighborhood, that's what they wanted. But I didn't want it that way and I, I fought like the devil to make sure that it didn't get there, but being in historical Philadelphia was the most historical place in the world, as far as I could see was Philadelphia and downtown Philadelphia. And that was the reason why I said that many would be so partial to the location as, as it, as, as to be there, but we wanted to be a part of history and so the only way that we could be a part of history is to live in that, be in that, be in that location. Am I making sense?
Speaker 2: Yes sir. So let--I'm going to start at the beginning of your life. A couple of other questions I have for you. But your occupation, you consider yourself to be a photographer?
Speaker 1: I started out being a junk man.
Speaker 2: I know that's how you started out. And we'll talk about that but, then you ended up being a photographer.
Story_ID: 402562
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me ask you this sir, what's your favorite color? Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: No, as long as it shows color, should it be a particular color?
Speaker 1: Do you have a particular color that you like more than any others?
Speaker 2: No, not particularly, not that, look, as long as it can be seen by everyone. See this is the whole thing in a nutshell. Photography is that as long as you can make a story out of what you, what it is then I would say yeah, go for it.
Speaker 1: But let me just say, these five questions I'm going to ask you right now are, they, these answers appear on our website so I want to see if you have, you know on the computer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: --with your picture and then we have these five little answers. So the first one is favorite color, if you have a favorite color I would put that, what you say your favorite color is on our--
Speaker 2: It's natural.
Speaker 1: Natural, okay. Do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: No, just when I get, when I get hungry, you know, I get hungry I look for food.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of year? Do you have some (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I like the, the fall and, and, and the spring, if I had a choice, but I, but I'm one to accept the way that God put it. He put the different seasons and the, and the different--you're gonna mess us your thing there. But anyway he the one that decided how the, the seasons would be and when, when man decides he wants to change it he messes up every time. But if he let God do it, it comes out right.
Speaker 1: So sir, do you have a favorite vacation place? A place you like to vacation?
Speaker 2: No, I don't have no particular place. Just as long as I can be happy at, at the, at the time period where, wherever I'm at and, and generally I, I, I've been lucky enough to, it doesn't take much to please me. And so I'll go, I'll go by what's happening and, and go from there.
Speaker 1: So sir what's your favorite phrase? Do you have a favorite phrase, something that you always say to people, something that you always say to yourself?
Speaker 2: What, what do I say when I--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Still breathing.
Speaker 2: Still breathing, that's my favorite.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Over and over and over. Five or six times a week.
Speaker 2: More than that.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): More than that.
Speaker 2: But, but as long as I'm still breathing that means--that's the one thing that I have no control over, but God has control over that, so long as, long as I'm breathing right then he's, he's, he's working it for me. And of course I use to be able to speak real good, but lately I've been getting a little haggard with my speaking, but I'm going to get it back together again.
Story_ID: 402563
Speaker 1: So let's talk about your early life before, when you were a little boy. What (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What, before I was a little boy?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what, do you remember before you were a little boy (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Not, not, not too much.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember begin a little boy, growing up here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: No, I was born, I was born at 20th [Street] and Dauphin Street at the hospital [Women's Homeopathic Hospital for Men, Women and Children, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] there and that was--because I, at that time I lived 2115 West York Street, Philadelphia and I, I, I began to fool around with junk because I wasn't a photographer then. But I, I probably had the idea of being one, but I didn't know what I was doing, so naturally I did what I did, what I thought was best for me at the time and I would put, go around and pick up junk because I found out one of the guy, one--the first millionaire I knew was a black man and he lived 27th [Street] and (unclear) and he was a junk man. And he was the first black millionaire I, I happened to run across. We've been friends ever since.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think of his name. It will come to me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --before the month's out or something like that (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So you met him when you were a little boy? You saw him when you were a little boy?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm. And, and he lived on (Unclear) Avenue and he was going around to the neighborhoods and, and collecting trash and, and he, and he was honest. He wouldn't, he wasn't stealing anything like that and I tried not to steal too. I wasn't too good at stealing, but, but I always, what, what I did, I did what I thought was right at that particular time. If it felt right to me inside, then I went for it, but otherwise I'd, I'd leave it alone.
Story_ID: 402564
Speaker 1: So, what was your mother's name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Florence [Florence Collier Franklin] and, and, and she was a schoolteacher and my father, his name was Frank Franklin and of course, he died, or he passed rather, he passed when I was five years old. But, but, but he was on the boiler, because he worked with, with the post office as well as he was a principal of a school down south and, and but when he come to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] he, he, he wasn't--when he first wanted to come to Philadelphia, they say he was trying to talk to my, my mother into marrying him and, and, and but, but, my father realized that he couldn't come nowhere out of Florida or Georgia where, where the two--that they was, unless he married her. So--
Speaker 1: So they got married?
Speaker 2: And so I had one brother [Vincent Franklin] and one sister [Eloise Owens Strothers]. I'm the youngest of the three.
Speaker 1: Where was your--you can drink your coffee, you want to have a sip of your coffee?
Speaker 2: Oh shucks, I was going to sneak and--go ahead (laughter).
Speaker 1: So where was your mother born? Do you know that?
Speaker 2: As far as I know, in Florida, because my, my grandmother [Elizabeth Collier] well actually, was a Florida Indian [Native American], which I didn't--took me a long time--I just found out, realized that, a couple of months ago that she was a Florida Indian, and, and not just a--that's the reason why I'm red, so red myself, and, and a Florida Indian, and us colored folks and the Indians got along real good in Florida, there was a reason for that. And don't, don't say that I'm the gospel, I'm the gospel on it because I don't know. They have to tell you that themselves, but I, I always though, I always thought, because every time I had a chance to play Indian, I would always make up like an Indian and, and, and, and do my war dance and everybody thought I was so cute dancing around, being an Indian. Even when I got up, got up a teenager I still would continue to be a Indian, but I, I never knew what--it just dawned on me not too long ago that I'm part Indian and one of the Florida Indians. That's how, that's how I was so good at being a good Indian when I, when I portrayed the Indians and I just found out this particular group, group, group of people was Indians and my grandmother, I don't know how she got hooked into that, but anyway, my grandmother was, was, somebody made, made a, made an Indian out of her. So that's how that came about.
Speaker 1: What about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: You know, I never, I never remember seeing him. I saw a picture of him. You know like he might have been a pygmy, that's what he looked liked. He might have been a pygmy.
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: A little, a little Indian, I mean little black folks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Pygmy, pygmy, am I saying it wrong?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Pygmy, yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Pygmy, pygmy, it's good, you're saying it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well that's what I, I think that's, that's, but, but I never, but I still--I outgrew him anyway. But I didn't get a chance to live with him or live near him because my grandmother come to Florida--came to Philadelphia and my mother and father, they came to Philadelphia and set up housekeeping here in Philadelphia.
Story_ID: 402565
Speaker 1: Why did they come to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I was, I'm just guessing now, but I think that, the fact that, see, both my mother [Florence Collier Franklin] and father [Frank Franklin] were, were very smart people and they was--anything that make them--make them, they didn't, they weren't going to be no junkies or anything like that, but they were going to be teachers. And they, they were, they were teachers and my father worked at the--he was one of the executives at the post office and my mother was, she, she stayed at--in the school system for a while, but then she began to do all different types of work.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Sewing, she was very good at sewing and, but she was a housekeeper, that was the main thing, that was her thing. And so that was what happened, happened that way.
Speaker 1: So she was--but in Florida you said she was a schoolteacher?
Speaker 2: In Florida she was a schoolteacher.
Speaker 1: And your father was a principal?
Speaker 2: Principal of a school, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then they moved north for a better (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They came to Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: They came to Philadelphia for better opportunities?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and he was--worked at the post office in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: So then you were born here in Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 402566
Speaker 1: So what are some of the other early memories you have growing up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] living on, what did you say, 20th [Street] and York [Street]?
Speaker 2: 21st [Street] and York.
Speaker 1: 21st and York?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So who were your neighbors?
Speaker 2: They were colored folks like us and, and they were very nice people in, in, you know, you--blocks, you lived in blocks. And some blocks you can get along with and then, and, and, the next block you can't get along with, but I always got along with any and everybody I met because they said that I was of good, good stock, so, so that's the main thing. The idea being a good, good person, then I was connected with the church too.
Speaker 1: What church did you go to?
Speaker 2: One of the churches--I attended a whole lot of churches, but the main church was Jones Tabernacle [Jones Tabernacle A.M.E. Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which I was, I was raised in. Because my father [Frank Franklin] passed--
Speaker 1: When you were five?
Speaker 2: Around about that time.
Speaker 1: And when your father passed what did your mother [Florence Collier Franklin] do? She had--that's when she started working at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's when she started doing--
Speaker 1: Housekeeping.
Speaker 2: Housekeeping and, and--because she didn't, she didn't want to go around and just go out and do anything, but she was a real good seamstress, seamstress and she was good at that.
Speaker 1: So when your father passed away your mother started to work (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She took over; she took over the house, the household.
Speaker 1: Did you and your brother [Vincent Franklin], the little--did your brother and sister [Eloise Owens Strothers] do little jobs as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I was the youngest one. My brother was older than me and, and my, my sister was, was--there were three of us and I'm the youngest of the three.
Speaker 1: Did they start to do a little work to help with the house, do little jobs to bring money in?
Speaker 2: Well no, no, I don't even--it's a funny thing, I, I should remember what, what--my brother worked at the Frankford Arsenal [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and my sister she was being taught music by several people in the neighborhood and she was a singer like Marian Anderson, that quality of singing. And she was good.
Speaker 1: So was her music teacher Mrs. Lyles [Ethel Hedgeman Lyle]?
Speaker 2: I can't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can't remember.
Speaker 2: I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: But, but, but my sister can--just like I shot pictures, she, she, she sang and, and, and made music like I take pictures. And I think I was pretty good at that time.
Story_ID: 402567
Speaker 1: So who gave you your first camera?
Speaker 2: My sister [Eloise Owens Strothers] did. She went to the Chicago World's Fair [A Century of Progress International Exposition, Chicago, Illinois] and brought me a camera back.
Speaker 1: Had you ever seen a camera before then?
Speaker 2: Oh I'd seen them in the newspaper, but, but I didn't know what I was going, whether this was going to bug me or what. But I, I, I learned how. I, I went to a couple of schools, but the main thing is I learned through my own self.
Speaker 1: So do you remember what were some of the first pictures you took with that little box camera that your sister gave you?
Speaker 2: I don't know where they are now, but they're probably in, in the archives somewhere.
Speaker 1: Right. But do you know what they were of, can you remember, like did you take pictures of people's houses or people themselves? What were you interested in taking pictures of (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Anything, just general photography itself.
Speaker 1: So as a little boy you'd see--what would you see that would make you want to take a picture of it?
Speaker 2: Anything that was interesting.
Speaker 1: What was interesting to you then?
Speaker 2: Anything.
Speaker 1: Anything. So all the little girls, maybe people playing ball?
Speaker 2: Not particularly, I mean, but, because I was, wasn't into women (laughter), excuse the expression, but, but I would photograph different things that were happening especially, especially events and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Events maybe in the church?
Speaker 2: In the church, in, in the school system, wherever it, it was, if it was history I went for it.
Speaker 1: So early on back when you were a little boy did you ever try to sell your photographs to anybody or you just?
Speaker 2: No, no, not, not, I don't know if I did that or not because money wasn't, wasn't my (background noise)--somebody's trying to shoot me now.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: You didn't think about doing it to make money?
Speaker 2: No, no, that, that wasn't, it wasn't, it was just learning how to do something and do it well. I wanted to be the best at whatever I did and I made sure of that.
Story_ID: 402568
Speaker 1: So did you go to elementary school here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to elementary school.
Speaker 1: What was the name of that school?
Speaker 2: Claghorn [James L. Claghorn School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and I also went to--Arnold, Arnold elementary school [Michael Arnold School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] I went to.
Speaker 1: Were you taking pictures at, at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, I didn't, I didn't take pictures, started taking pictures until I was at Claghorn.
Speaker 1: And that was?
Speaker 2: And that was a junior high. And then from there I went to Simon Gratz [Simon Gratz High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And that was high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So during those, during when you were a student, what type of a student were you in school?
Speaker 2: Oh I guess I was a--just what I saw I took pictures of it.
Speaker 1: No, but were you a good student or did you do your work well, or do--were you rumbustious?
Speaker 2: I would, I would, I would make sure that I can do whatever any, the next guy could do. I made sure that I wasn't stuck.
Speaker 1: Who, who did you look up to then? Do you have any mentors when you were, in, in, like elementary school, junior high school, because your father [Frank Franklin] had passed away? What men were helping to--did you look up to?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had a couple cousins and let me see, what, what, I'm trying to think now. It was a couple of ministers who, who took, took me around while I was learn, learning, so I was, I was in good hands.
Speaker 1: Did you ever think of becoming a minister yourself?
Speaker 2: No. I, I was just the fly on the wall.
Speaker 1: And when you say you were a fly on the wall, what does that mean?
Speaker 2: It means just what it says because I, I would you know, do things just because they would need to be done and, and I didn't make, make no bones out of it and I made sure that I did it right. And that was the whole jest of it. Am I messing you up with the fly on the wall?
Speaker 1: No, I understand. So you always considered yourself to be a fly on the wall?
Speaker 2: In that, in, in that, in that instance of burden, being a photographer I, and I know I had to be there in order to--a whole lot of things would happen and I would be there shooting pictures of it.
Story_ID: 402569
Speaker 1: So before you became like a full photographer when you were a teenager, I know you said when you were a little boy you, you know, were a junk, you took people's trash out.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I put the trash out because it, it was easy money and, and it was available.
Speaker 1: So who's trash did you take out, people in the neighborhood [in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, people in the neighborhood. I wouldn't go out too far in the neighborhood because they would--you, you, you'd be, you'd be interrupted (laughter), you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Did you ever work for white people taking the trash out?
Speaker 2: A couple, maybe about four or five people that I knew at that time period, but I was a boy and I was, I wasn't, I wasn't no, I was about, maybe about ten, ten years, ten years, ten years old so, I wasn't going too far from the house because my mother [Florence Collier Franklin] didn't, didn't mean for me to get lost. All but, many, many of times, she was going, she was going to make me lost, but, but she would always, she would say apron strings.
Speaker 1: So she kept you close to her apron strings?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Story_ID: 402570
Speaker 1: Was your mother [Florence Collier Franklin] a good cook?
Speaker 2: Yep, she was a very good cook. My sister [Eloise Owens Strothers] was a good cook. My father [Frank Franklin], I never did find out about him, his, his ability--but my sister was a good cook and she was a Grand Songbird [Grand Songbird of Elkdom] for the Elks of America [Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks of the World]. And, and I would use her as a companion because we knew the, the head of the Elks, the Elks lodge and I would compare my work with her work, her singing, and I'd say, "I sing just as good as you shoot." I said, "I shoot pictures good as you sing." And I use to use that for a steppingstone.
Speaker 1: When did you realize that you were a good photographer? How old were you?
Speaker 2: I still don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Who was the first person that looked at your work and told you that it was good, like gave you encouragement?
Speaker 2: I can't name, name who, but, but everybody thought I was good at it. And they said--I went ahead and if it wasn't right I'd do it over again and make sure it was right. I had to be pleased with it before I'd decide that you would like it and I had very strict rules for myself.
Speaker 1: So what was your, your goal with, with, with trying to--
Speaker 2: Being, being the best at, at what I did.
Story_ID: 402571
Speaker 1: So do you remember Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] when you were a little boy? Was it, was the town segregated, blacks lived on--whites--one side of town, whites lived on the other side of town?
Speaker 2: We weren't that close together. We were separated. We had sections of the city where, where blacks lived and a section of the city where the whites lived. And I didn't have no problem with it because I was good and, and, and then we--as long as you, you treated--I found out once you treat a person, treat people right, they, they'd, they'd treat you right. Even the bad ones would treat you right if you were good.
Story_ID: 402572
Speaker 1: So, Mr. Franklin [HistoryMaker Jack T. Franklin]--
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: --we were talking about the different sections of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: I lived in most--I, I worked in most of the different parts of the city and, and I was respected by most of the people in the city, so that was no problem. And then once, once I got in the [U.S. military] service then I really got my, myself together.
Speaker 1: But before we talk about you going into the service, let's talk about when you, in high school [Simon Gratz High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you were in high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had no problem with, in, in high school.
Speaker 1: Is that when you started to take pictures?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I began, I began doing pictures because not only that, I was--they had different--they were putting on shows and, and being the little ham I, I would be in the shows and also even wrote a couple, couple, couple, couple, couple shows and I found out white folks, excuse the expression, was all right with me.
Speaker 1: How did you find that out?
Speaker 2: Because I was, I started working with them and before then I was in, in, in, being--and I, and, and I lived in a black neighborhood. You can't really know people unless you, unless you got out that neighborhood. So being in high school I was able to learn the different nationalities and worked with the different nationalities. Just like my friend, one of the photographers, I learned photography with, he was Chinese and his mother, mother had a Chinese restaurant at 21st [Street] and Columbia Avenue [Cecil B. Moore Avenue], Lings [ph.]. And I used to go up to his house and he--we fell out one time because he figured I was trying to steal his method of photography and I told him, "Look I'm not trying to steal your--you do yours and I'll do mine." And, and I was very stubborn in that, in that respect.
Speaker 1: So that's when you were a teenager?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So the, his name of his studio was Ling's Studio [ph.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: At the--
Speaker 2: And his mother had a restaurant over, on, over, over the place.
Speaker 1: Did he become a photographer as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did he mainly photograph the Chinese American community?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, oh no, he was photographing us, black folks and, and I was photographing anybody who would let me.
Story_ID: 402573
Speaker 1: So when you came out of high school [Simon Gratz High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], how did you get into the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: I got drafted (laughter).
Speaker 1: Say you were drafted in 19--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: You were drafted in the '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you, so you were drafted into the Army?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: By that time you were already a pretty good photographer though, correct?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you went into the photography unit?
Speaker 2: I went into the, yep, let's see I'm trying to think now, what would be interesting, because I was in Mississippi, Mississippi (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Gulfport?
Speaker 2: Gulfport, Mississippi and--who told you (unclear)? Oh, you've been reading the, the information, yeah. But, but I didn't--it didn't make no difference to me where I was when it come down to being a photographer. I considered myself being the best that was going on at that time.
Speaker 1: So how did--I, I read a story that's saying that when you got into the Army people were saying some things about, like Negroes and you said to them, "Well, why do you think I'm," (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were Negroes before then, yeah, but what did you hear?
Speaker 1: Just that you said to them, you know, they were saying some maybe off-colored things about black people and you said, "Well, what do you think I am?" And they thought you were Indian [Native American]. They thought you were Native American.
Speaker 2: And they, they did, and then I just found out recently that my [maternal] grandmother [Elizabeth Collier] was an Indian from Florida, was a Florida Indian, what I never, I never knew that until recently then I would--put two and two together and that's how I, I saw a picture of her and her husband and he was a little pygmy. And, but otherwise I, I just recently got--found that out. And, but, but I had a nice family. And my--when it come down to photography, I could shoot any, I'll shoot anybody.
Speaker 1: So in the Army what, did you continue to study photography with anyone or did you just take a lot of pictures?
Speaker 2: I, I took pictures and, and, and in different situations I was put into I had to shoot.
Speaker 1: What were some of situations you were put into?
Speaker 2: We would go to different locations then they would--sometimes some of the things would be mixed, but see most of the, most of, most of the places I was stationed, they were, we were, in the Army. They had the black army and the white army. So that's, that's what we--kept me segregated until they actually integrated in the Army, then I was able to get to this unit that were--didn't mind us being there. I was, matter-of-fact, I was in New York City [New York, New York] at the time and, and I was able to integrate myself with the different movements of, of the troops, otherwise, in that I was still in, in the, in the Army.
Speaker 1: So you were in the Army when it was, it was segregated?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So were you able to, were you allowed to take pictures then of, of black soldiers and white soldiers, or just black soldiers?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I was, I was, being that I was pretty good they allowed me to photograph anybody I wanted to photograph. I was lucky in that respect.
Speaker 1: Was there anyone to give you additional training in the Army? Did they have any photography classes, or--
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think. It was, no, matter of fact, my, my, my, most of my training was after I went into the service and after, after I came out. And that was the funny thing about it. Even though they--I went to, I went to one place, I ended up by it being in, in--was, was--I'm trying to think how, how and when, I was still in the Army, but yet segregated to a degree because I, I--America was still segregated itself. So, I can't, I couldn't, couldn't be altogether different and, and still be American. So that's the reason for that.

Speaker 1: Were you in the [U.S.] Army when you took that photograph of your sister singing on stage at the governor's [George M. Leader] inauguration and Marian Anderson is in the background?
Speaker 2: Oh you remember that picture? (Directs speech off camera) He's a nosey little rascal ain't he? I don't know, I don't know whether I was out the Army then, I, I might have been out the Army then. Marian Anderson and Eloise [Eloise Owens Strothers] all in one, no I was, I wasn't in the Army then; that was before going in the Army.
Speaker 1: So that was before you went in?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you had started to take some important photographs before you even joined the Army (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh I was, I'm telling you, I was, I was, I was good. I was the best that was smoking, as they say, best smoking; I was the best smoking cameraman you wanted to see. And, and many of people have said that they wanted to have me photograph--as a matter-of-fact, I, I went, had to go on several engagements and, and then a lot of times they wouldn't even start their program unless they'd see me on the scene. That's, that's how--don't get jealous (laughter). But, but that would be, be the case. And many, many instances, times I have gone to places and weddings and all that sort of thing and they wouldn't start until I got there. So I was, so I had to be pretty good in order to do what I was doing.
Speaker 1: Did you--go ahead.
Speaker 2: Go ahead, no go ahead.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you work for any of the black newspapers before you went into the Army, or only after you came out?
Speaker 2: No, I worked for them before I went in the Army.
Speaker 1: What was your first professional job? What was the first time somebody paid you for a photograph?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think now. You see it's, it's shooting pictures wasn't nothing--when you're training, training you didn't consider that being professional, so you became professional and so that--a lot of times things like that would happen and, and, and I just kept on doing with I was doing, but for a special assignment they had to almost beg me to shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot a picture because I don't--wasn't sure of what I doing, but at the same time I found out that I was doing it right and, and should keep, keep on doing it.
Story_ID: 402575
Speaker 1: What was the first professional camera you bought? What was the make of that camera?
Speaker 2: A Speed Graphic and it was a miniature Speed Graphic. Of course then, then I had a chance to use the, the [U.S.] Army equipment.
Speaker 1: What kind of equipment did they have?
Speaker 2: Well, Speed Graphic, of course they, they, they didn't mean for me to--they meant for me to still be a still photographer. I wasn't, I wasn't a motion picture photographer.
Speaker 1: So what was the type of camera your sister [Eloise Owens Strothers] gave you? What was the brand on that camera?
Speaker 2: As far as I know it was a AmScope [sic.].
Speaker 1: When did you receive your first, go ahead (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear), go ahead.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: A roll film camera.
Speaker 1: A roll film camera.
Speaker 2: But then, then, then I got a Speed Graphic, a miniature Speed Graphic.
Speaker 1: A miniature and what did you get after the Speed Graphic?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I got many cameras (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you ever have--go ahead.
Speaker 2: --many cameras since then.
Speaker 1: Many cameras, when did you have your first Minolta camera?
Speaker 2: Maybe about two or three years later. But I, I made sure that whatever camera I used, that was the best at that, with that particular equipment.
Story_ID: 402576
Speaker 1: So when you came out of the [U.S.] Army you were thinking then, okay, I'm going to become a professional photographer, or did you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Because you had worked for some of the black newspapers before?
Speaker 2: Well I had worked with them--the black papers anyway. But, but I was going to be everybody's photographer. So, regardless of what it was, I would shoot.
Speaker 1: So you wanted to open yourself up more than just black community?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I was doing that. I was doing the black as well as white, anybody, Chinese, anybody who was, wanted me to do it. I would, I would do it and I was, I was considered the best at what I was doing. And then also I was doing dark room work too.
Speaker 1: So you did your own printing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you--what year did you open your own studio, Franklin studio?
Speaker 2: Which one (laughter)?
Speaker 1: The first one.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know, it's hard to say, what year or anything like that, but--
Speaker 1: Where was it located, the first one?
Speaker 2: North, North Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and then, and then during those years I worked with Ling's Studio [ph.] when he, when he had his place on 21st [Street] and Columbia Avenue [Cecil B. Moore Avenue].
Speaker 1: So you worked with him also?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Who was the first person to give you a job as a photographer?
Speaker 2: My mother [Florence Collier Franklin], my mother wanted me to do a best picture for her. And she just knew that if anybody could do it, I could photograph her best as anybody. And then my sister [Eloise Owens Strothers] was the second one. So those were my two focus, main models were my mother and my sister. Because my sister was--my mother was a good-looking lady with long hair and all that sort of thing and my sister was, she was the Songbird [Grand Songbird of Elkdom] of the Elks [Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks of the World] and I was the, I was the one and only photographer in the city as far as they were concerned.
Speaker 1: Were there any other black photographers in the city at the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had, we had about four or five that, that we considered, considered pretty decent and we got along with--in those days, but we lived in different neighborhoods, but, but we were good friends and we, we didn't have no arguments or fisticuffs, stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Was Marshall Wilson [G. Marshall Wilson] one of those photographers?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes he was. Marshall Wilson was one of my best, one of the older photographers. When I met him he was older than me but, but he was terrific. And then he went to New York [New York]; I think he went to New York.
Speaker 1: Now was Marshall Wilson, was he black?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was black, right. And what about Gaston Levine [ph.]?
Speaker 2: He was another one that's, black and was very good.
Speaker 1: Did any of them serve as mentors to you?
Speaker 2: Yeah they did. Anybody, anybody that I looked at their, they work, I'm not saying they were mentors of mine because I'm still learning, I was still learning and of course they, they, they treated me as being their mentors because I was doing things that surprised them. But I was doing my thing.
Story_ID: 402577
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So when you came out of the [U.S.] Army and back as, as a civilian, what did you do with your G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], the G.I. Bill? Did you use it to go to college or to buy a house, or--
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know what I did with my G.I. Bill, so it's pretty hard for me to say. All I know, I, I, I still survived what, whatever I was doing, I survived. I was still the best that was coming down the pipe.
Speaker 1: So let's talk about when you opened your first studio in North Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]? Was it in North Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think. The one that, the one that--there use to be one on 15th Street, 15th and Columbia Avenue [Cecil B. Moore Avenue] and then, then let's see.
Speaker 1: Was it a storefront?
Speaker 2: No it was a house, but, but I was only a block away from Columbia Avenue. But, but that didn't stop me because all I needed was a dark room. And I would shoot and I, I had, I had people knocking on the door asking me to come shoot pictures for them.
Speaker 1: So, and, and when the '50s [1950s] rolled around by then you, you were, you know, you were in your late twenties, early thirties and you, did you ever go on staff with any of the news, black, any, any of the newspapers? Were you, did you become a staff photographer?
Speaker 2: Yeah I was staff for just about three out of four studios I was, I was on staff with them. So, so they would look for me as, as the photographer and like I said, many of the things I'd go on, jobs I'd go on they wouldn't, wouldn't shoot until I got there. So that, that, show you the, the proof--the way the people thought about my work.
Speaker 1: What did you think about your work?
Speaker 2: I felt I was doing the best I could and that was it.
Speaker 1: What was your specialty?
Speaker 2: I had no specialty, just photograph it and I'll do it.
Story_ID: 402578
Speaker 1: When did you become interested in using your camera to document the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: When the Civil Rights Movement started and, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When did it start for you?
Speaker 2: When they started on Columbia Avenue [Cecil B. Moore Avenue] and, let me see, I was living on 15th Street at the time when that started and then we ended up by going to the--you are trying to pull my teeth ain't you? I was good and I didn't, I didn't bar none when it come down to shooting. So, it didn't make no difference to me, wasn't no cushion. I had to go and shoot it, but I went and shot the pictures and, and I made sure I got good pictures.
Speaker 1: So do you remember in 1955 with Emmett Till and seeing those photographs in, in Ebony and Jet magazine (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: What impact did that have on you?
Speaker 2: Very, very, gave me an idea. Matter-of-fact I'm trying to think was I in Chicago [Illinois] at that time. I might have been in Chicago at that time. But Emmett Till--because we, we thought that was, was a miscarriage of justice, was, it really was. I'm trying to think because I think so much of, some of those things, it looked like I was there, but I wasn't there or was there. I don't know which, where I was at that time, but--because I had been in Chicago. I had an aunt that lived in Chicago. I also had one in, in New York [New York] and I would go to different places and photograph it and everybody wanted, wanted me to do, do my thing and that was take pictures.
Speaker 1: So Emmett Till must have worked on you on several levels because the power of a photograph (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The thing, not so much as that, it was a miscarriage of justice that shouldn't have been, never happened and a lot of things like that you, you, you don't let that carry, stir you up too much because you end by doing the wrong thing.
Speaker 1: Right, but also it was an opportunity for people to see you know, what the power of photography was like, a lot of people won't have seen that image.
Speaker 2: I was doing, I was doing it not because of power to people, I was doing it because it was, doing it because it needed to be recorded.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: To me it was necessary to record the different, different places I would go and, and I would shoot it not because it was so and so, but because it was history that needed to be recorded and we had to know what we were doing if we were able to maintain a, a, a, a, let's see, I'm to think of the right word--it had to be recorded and, and that, and I happened to be the one available to do it. I could do it.
Speaker 1: Had you seen any other photographs before Emmett Till that stirred you up in that same way?
Speaker 2: I probably had, but I mean, I wasn't trying to shoot against anybody. I was just shooting to record what was going on. I wasn't trying to copycat anybody.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was just doing what I knew what how to do and, and it was, it was selling whether I liked it or not. Hope I ain't messing you up too much.
Speaker 1: Oh, no sir, not at all. I'm following you.
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm waiting, I'm waiting to see what it looks like when it comes out. Wake up girl.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: How many (unclear)--no never mind.
Story_ID: 402579
Speaker 1: So also though, in the 1960s you, you know, it was big for, for musicians and you shot a lot of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. I did quite a bit of musicians and, and see my brother [Vincent Franklin] being a music, musical piano player and he had this group and I, I would, I would sit anywhere and, and, and still shoot pictures, so that, that was good, that was a good as far as, like I say it was an outlet for me because, for me doing what I'm doing.
Speaker 1: So what was the theater here that you went to a lot? That was like the Apollo [Apollo Theater] in New York [New York]? Was it the State Theatre [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or the Uptown Theater [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: See, the one that we, that we--the State Theatre and the Uptown Theater because of the location, the, that was important for us to have.
Speaker 1: So do you remember photographing Sam Cooke?
Speaker 2: Yep, I photographed Sam Cooke.
Speaker 1: The Shirelles?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Who else?
Speaker 2: You name them I've, I've been, I've been on stage with them. And mainly, most of them was at Uptown, Uptown Theater.
Speaker 1: The Uptown Theater was a--
Speaker 2: Important, important for us to have.
Speaker 1: It was the famous theater in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And it was like the Apollo.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So do you remember the, the atmosphere, what the atmosphere was like at the State Theatre?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know, remember, I don't know that they were, I was, I was too busy shooting pictures to worry about what was happening then. But I was, I know I was there and, and, and the few that's--wait a few minutes and I'll go back to the house and look and I'll find some of, some of the pictures that I done shot.
Story_ID: 402580
Speaker 1: So when you, when you point your camera and shoot to, when you're looking through the lens to capture something? What is it that makes you say this is a good image? This is what I want, or how does it work (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no I just, no I don't, I don't do it that way. I do it--this is history, it's history and it needs to be recorded. And I'll happen to be the one that's doing it and so I thank God I'm in position to be that particular person to do it. And, and luckily for them that I was there to do it.
Speaker 1: So everything that you've recorded you feel you've done so, because it was history and needed to be recorded?
Speaker 2: The history of it, yeah, and that's the reason why the museum [Afro-American Historical and Cultural Museum in Philadelphia; African American Museum in Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] itself decided of using me.
Speaker 1: So let's talk about some of the big moments in history you, that you were able to record. And you can tell me what one of, tell me some of the ones that have been most meaningful for you.
Speaker 2: The March on Washington would be history and all your different, different events that was nationally, they, they were interesting to me because they had to be photographed and regardless of it, where it started from, it's, it's where it ends up at is what makes it important.
Speaker 1: So the March on Washington was a big one for you?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And then, and then also here were some of the local things that happened. Or let's talk about the South first. You did, you covered the march from Selma to Montgomery [Selma to Montgomery March]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did that too.
Speaker 1: And how long did that take to go from Selma [Alabama] to Montgomery [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: I forget, maybe it wasn't, it wasn't too, it was a matter, matter of weeks that that was done.
Speaker 1: And you stayed the whole time?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Story_ID: 402581
Speaker 1: Very interesting march because it was very important to--it was a march that was--you would think that location, you wouldn't, wouldn't be that interested in that. We found out we were, we were very much in, being part of the, of the, this whole system because it, the fact that it was in Selma [Alabama], right? That's what we're you talking about? And, and it was a country town and, and we, we walked for how many, four or five days I think. Don't make me a liar, (unclear) liar. But, but the, the location of the, of the march itself was so important. And when we knew that so many people were interested in, in the, in the march itself and, but the black people were very much interested in the March on Washington, I mean not March on--the Selma march [Selma to Montgomery March]. And it was--you figure that everything would be out of Washington [D.C.], but it wasn't.
Speaker 2: So that march you photographed Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] as well?
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: And what else do you remember about that? Where did you sleep overnight? When you finished walking what would you do?
Speaker 1: Go, go in the corner and sit in, in--anybody that--them people would take you, take you in their, in their homes and, and so you could sleep because, because of the fact that we were press and they didn't want no bad publicity. So that was the reason, their main reason. But the, but the, but the, not so much as that, as they, they were part of it, it, they were part of a movement and, and, and, and--I done messed up.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: It was part of a movement?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well it's a part of a movement.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, and, and, and, and it needed to be photographed and we did it, we did it. And wasn't no problem--we wasn't--nobody shooting at us or anything like that. But there was a movement of people and, and it was a thing that was not only a movement as far as it, it's, it's going, but it's, it's growing up too. It was getting bigger by the day and that was, that was the whole reason for it. And so we did what we had to do in order to make it survive by, by being available to the, to the public. And that would, did it, the fact that we were there to photograph it. I, I wasn't doing it because of--I was doing it because, because people needed to be reached, reached for what, for what they believed in and so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were there white photographers as well?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, there were white, as white as a--yeah they were mixed, oh yeah. There, there, there were some photographers that were there every time you, you opened your, opened your doors they were there.
Speaker 1: Did you become friendly with some of the other people, some of the other photographers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, anybody that would be friendly, friendly with me I'd be friendly with them.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of their names?
Speaker 2: Not off, not off hand I couldn't tell you that. I could probably give it to you but I'd have to--no, not as photographers, I knew them as workers and there were different people working in, in, in the vineyards, working in the vineyards and so, we, we, we didn't, we didn't go down there just to be showing off. We went down there because it, we thought that we needed to do what had to be done. And, and so we did it that way.
Speaker 1: And that's the same way you felt about the, the March on Washington?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Story_ID: 402582
Speaker 1: And talk to me about the day you went to Washington [D.C.] to photograph that event [March on Washington]?
Speaker 2: There were tons of people down there, tons of people. And, but at the same time I knew it was something that had to be done and it had to be, and, and got to be done my way or else it wasn't going to be right, I, to me. And that's the way everybody thought that same way about their own photography, so that's the reason why they--it looked so good all over because we had everybody doing it and, and, and the only way we could do it is to do it, do it as a people.
Speaker 1: So when you were doing these marches like with the Selma march [Selma to Montgomery March] and the March on Washington which equipment did you carry with you? What stuff did you use?
Speaker 2: I, I used mainly was black and white cameras because we weren't into color and, and we were just on the edge of getting color, but color was too expensive for the average black outfits, so that's the reason why we used black and white. And, and after I still like black and white when, when you still look at the--see, it, black and white make, makes it look for real, whereas color shots make it look artificial.
Story_ID: 402583
Speaker 1: So, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] also had some Civil Rights Movements that you covered (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah, we, we went--as a matter-of-fact Philadelphia had did for more the Civil Rights Movement than anybody else as far as I know. And, and even though there would be nothing going on nowhere in any particular area, but like Chester, Pennsylvania, there would be people in Chester, Pennsylvania, groups, doing things in, in that area, or, or they'd be in Marion, Pennsylvania and, but, they would to say Philadelphia, but the city, they, they would be meaning that particular area. So that's, that's how things would be, be broken down.
Speaker 1: What about the Girard College [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Oh that way quite a, quite a thing. Say, how many, how many days was that? That was, if I'm not mistaken it was three years, something like that. I think it was about three years during--Girard College and, and that was, Girard College is a city by itself and, of course we was over, over there every day photographing it.
Speaker 1: What was the incident? What was the protest about?
Speaker 2: The protest of them wanting to--a segregated city, and segregation in, in a segregated city. See, the, the--Girard College was a white orphanage and they had--in a black area, it not so much a reason for that, but we wanted to prove that we can go anywhere we want to go and that was the reason for that.
Speaker 1: And using your camera you documented some of the activity that was involved in de- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah well, seeing what was going on I, I, I knew the way--it really couldn't be done, the story couldn't be told unless it was done by photography. Just writing it would never, never have gotten it. But writing it, writing it, there were pictures then you can, that, that tell the story.
Speaker 1: And you felt pictures could tell the story better than words?
Speaker 2: I knew it would, it, it did and every, every--if you check the history, if you want to find out, find out that the pictures that told you, told, told the story whereas the writing was--but, but, but has been a, a good helping thing, but, but it was the pictures that really told the story.
Speaker 1: One of the other big events in Philadelphia was the Strawberry Mansion school [Strawberry Mansion Junior High School; Strawberry Mansion High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --construction project. Now they didn't want to have any black construction workers working on that project (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they, they didn't.
Speaker 1: So there was a big protest and a picket. And there was a lot of violence.
Speaker 2: And I was, I was there too.
Speaker 1: How did you always protect yourself from being hurt, because you were in a lot of violent situations?
Speaker 2: I was being--doing my job. They respected me and, and I, I think that's what did the more interesting of, and God was on my side.
Speaker 1: Were you ever afraid that something may happen to you, fearful that you'd gotten yourself in a bad situation?
Speaker 2: Well, you always think of, think on that, but you, you still you had that, but then decide for yourself which is, is the best side of the road to be on, then you then you go with that.
Speaker 1: So when I, when I'm thinking about all the situations you've been in, it was like, almost like being a war photographer.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Stuff was so bad that you never knew what was going to happen to you?
Speaker 2: Well that's true.  That's the way, that's the only way you look at it. And then you--it's funny how it works itself out.
Story_ID: 402584
Speaker 1: By the '60s [1960s] you were like a working photographer. Did you know [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew, I knew Gordon Parks very well.
Speaker 1: Did you ever talk to him about photography? What, what were your conversations like with him? What did you talk about?
Speaker 2: How, how was he doing and he would tell me how he was doing and, and all, all, what was he, what was he into, what am I into, that's it.
Speaker 1: Did you look at his work the same way that you looked at yours; that he was there to document something, or did you see his work as different (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well I don't know how he looked at mine. I, I looked at his work because there is always, always something you can learn from somebody. You can't be on a, on a mountain by yourself, you've got to be somewhere you can know if there is something better, tell whether or not it's, it's, it's on the same track. And knowing that by staying in the same track you don't get into any trouble and that's the reason why most of the people respected my work because it was truthful. Being as truthful as you can then people know, don't, don't--you find out the one who hide his help is the one that lies about their work and, and it comes up and it doesn't, doesn't, doesn't take long before it comes up as a lie and then they are in trouble.
Speaker 1: Are there some civil rights photographs you've taken that you feel more connected to than others, feel strongly towards the work you've done?
Speaker 2: No, not particularly because it's all, it's all my children. If I shot it, I shot it for a reason and, and I go, I go according to that.
Speaker 1: So also during the '60s [1960s] not only were you working on the civil rights stuff, but you, you worked a lot with other celebrities, like Sammy Davis, Jr., [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte, James Brown?
Speaker 2: Yep, all of them.
Speaker 1: All of them.
Speaker 2: They say me coming down the pipe and they'd say, "Hey Jack [HistoryMaker Jack T. Franklin]." I'd say, "Yep, it's me." And there--my old lady there, but she's quiet right now, but that's the one that you need to talk to.
Speaker 1: Did they, did everyone know you by name? People knew you were Jack?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, most of them knew me by--they, they'd call me either Jack or Franklin.
Speaker 1: And you were always with your camera?
Speaker 2: Yep, the man with the beret. I don't have the, I don't have the beret on, and the camera.
Speaker 1: What was it--why did you wear a beret; that was your trademark?
Speaker 2: Not so much as trademark, it was easier to carry, easier to carry, so, that's the reason why, why I'd use it, because I can, I, I don't have to worry about putting it down somewhere and losing it.

Speaker 1: So moving forward like in the 1970s you continued, you continued to work as a photographer and to document stories. You documented this--Josephine Baker?
Speaker 2: Yeah. She was a nice person, very nice. And, and a lot of times people are misconstrued of what and who or how they are, or what they are. And so we have to as photographers, we've got to get the truth out and keep the truth going. And so I try to do it that way.
Speaker 1: How do you do that? How do you get the truth out of somebody using your camera (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You find out just, just what, what their, what their real reason for doing what they're doing. And then I would photograph it and go at it that way. You'd be surprised how things can change a personality because of the way they look.
Speaker 1: What are you thinking?
Speaker 2: Now?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I done got, got myself in a trap.
Speaker 1: Well, I guess the idea for you is to always try to document the truth?
Speaker 2: I try to document the truth and I always did that, even when I first started here with the museum [Afro-American Historical and Cultural Museum in Philadelphia; African American Museum in Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 402586
Speaker 1: How did this museum [Afro-American Historical and Cultural Museum in Philadelphia; African American Museum in Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] come about? How did you become involved with working to get this museum in the 1970s?
Speaker 2: That was 1973 and we didn't have no museum or nothing to, to show, but we, but, but we needed something to, to let the people know that, that we are people and to be a people we had to also show where we've been. You, you can't, can't show where you've been if you don't know where you've been. And this is the reason when, when, the reason why the museum here is like it is today.
Speaker 1: Because?
Speaker 2: Because you've got to have a place where you start from and then from there you can look over from, from that, from that beginning and, and always keep an eye on the, on the mark and then maybe we'll end up by being--I, I ain't got, ain't got the words for it. I, I just been--but, but we've got to show that we are a people, because this is a black museum and then we want to show that we are a people and, and, and we do know what we're doing.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other people that worked with you on helping to make this museum a reality?
Speaker 2: Well it was Clarence Farmer [Clarence Farmer, Sr.]. He was--I'm going to go crazy trying to figure out the different names, but we've got--[HistoryMaker] Rowena Stewart and a couple of directors, but, but the fact is that the people who came down here to work with the museum, so, so, to, to put together what we got, we got now, and it's very important that we got, keep the truth of the, the whole matter going and that was my idea, if we going--it's was no use in putting junk up there if, if it's not the truth then you can't use it, you can't use it. And this is, is the reason why I'm with the museum itself.
Story_ID: 402587
Speaker 1: So did you ever think about taking pictures that, that would be considered art or did you always think about it just to document history?
Speaker 2: Well my, my idea was to document the history because art is one thing and history is another. And, and, and to me if it's done properly it's going, it's going to look like art anyway. And so there, there, there you go, you're right, you're still in it, but you still got to show that it, what it, it came out of a people and not just out, out, out of that person.
Speaker 1: So did you--during your career did you shoot like in, traditionally in black community you have people shoot the, the births, the weddings, the deaths?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've done, I've done all that.
Speaker 1: Why do you think that it's important to shoot the deceased?
Speaker 2: Well, well it's, it's good to know that, to show that you've been here and, and that, especially if you've done something and show that it's stepping from one stone to another and, and from there that's how you, you know where you're coming from and where you're going. In order to know where you're going you've got to know where you've been. Am I making sense to you now?
Speaker 1: Yes sir. So when you look at all of your photographs, do they tell you where you've been?
Speaker 2: Well if, if they don't, they will because I, I go back into the record, but as far as I'm concerned as long, as long as we, we've, we've got the connection. You've got to keep that connection going and, and that's what, the reason why the other nationalities have succeeded, succeeded where we hadn't because we wasn't, we wasn't taught to do that. But now we're, we're being taught and it's very fast, how to correct that mistake. See a mistake is made by man and not by God. And the, and the--if you ran, ran in, ran to his situation and let God give you direction you won't go wrong.
Speaker 1: So have you always been a very religious man?
Speaker 2: I don't know if you should call me religious or not, but--
Speaker 1: A very spiritual man?
Speaker 2: I would say yeah in that respect. I try to; I try to make sure that it's truthful. I, I try to make sure that the, the pictures that I shoot or the work that I do is, it's, it's nothing to be ashamed of and that's the reason, that's the reason for that. If everybody did it that way we'd have no problems. We'd have less judges, we'd have less judges to worry about and, and we'd have more people who, to work, to work with us.
Speaker 1: So when you look over, your, your career and the things you've been able to document, I, I know they are all your children, but are you more proud of some than others, are there some that you--
Speaker 2: There have got to be, there have got to be a couple--
Speaker 1: Jewels?
Speaker 2: There have got to be a couple of bad ones in, in there somewhere, but I don't look for them, I look for the good ones.
Speaker 1: Which good ones are you most proud of? You look at it and you say, I, I just told the whole story with that photograph?
Speaker 2: That would be up to you. You see, because everybody's eyes see, see, see things in a different light and that would be up to you once you see it then you'd know yourself if I've done it right.
Speaker 1: What do you think it was that fascinated you about photography, made you stick with it for so long?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew it was a necessary--it was something that was needed and I happen to be the one that can do it. And I just thank God that he gave me the strength to do it with and, and with his, with his guidance, with his guidance I was able to, to do it.
Speaker 1: When do you think you realized that it needed to be done, that you needed to document the history of black people using photography?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I figured it out as soon as I found out that we were being ignored. We were being ignored, what we were doing. We were ignored and, and different things that we had did and yet at the same time we were being ignored and, and, and shouldn't have been--no one person needs to be ignored and, and that was my reason for it.
Story_ID: 402588
Speaker 1: So once this museum [Afro-American Historical and Cultural Museum in Philadelphia; African American Museum in Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] started to take off and started to, to get off the ground and function on its own and--what made you decide to put your whole body of work here at this particular museum?
Speaker 2: Well, it was the first museum that I ran, that I ran into; of course there were some in New York [New York] I'd worked with, that too. But this is a museum that I worked, I helped start it, so I, I just, I considered one of my children and that's one of my children in this museum. I got a whole lot of children in it, but that's the way it is.
Story_ID: 402589
Speaker 1: So, today do you s- feel you serve as a mentor to other young photographers?
Speaker 2: I hope so. If I don't it would be all wasted because everything has to keep going, growing and, and growing, but if it's just going to be one generation and that's it, forget it.
Speaker 1: Who were your mentors?
Speaker 2: I would say any photographer that, that knew photography and, and, and they respected me and I respected them.
Speaker 1: Who taught you how to use the developing solutions and the technical aspects of photography?
Speaker 2: Well, most of the stuff I taught myself.
Speaker 1: How did you teach yourself that? Did you just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Read.
Speaker 1: --experiment? By reading books?
Speaker 2: Reading, reading books and knowing what it said and, and, and realize what its meaning, what the, the subject matter, stuff means and, and even the style of photography had, done changed about four or five times since I've been here. So you know it's going to change some more. And, and it's just a matter of, of time and we've got to give God his time and he'll, he'll make it.
Story_ID: 402590
Speaker 1: So was, was there one particular store or place that you always went to buy your cameras and all your supplies? Where did you buy your equipment from?
Speaker 2: Most of the time I bought it in mid- midtown [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], but that's, that's a mechanical, see, and, and the main thing is in your head what's doing it. And as long as you keep that on, on, on a, on the right, on the right plane, train, then you'll be all right.
Speaker 1: Did you have any particular lens you preferred, or--
Speaker 2: That's one, one of my pictures there.
Speaker 1: Yes sir, we're going--I have some of your other pictures I'm going to show you and have you comment on them. Did you have, did you prefer a particular lens?
Speaker 2: I could afford, what I, what I could afford. I used any kind, kind of camera that was workable, that was working and, and if I was lucky enough to have, have the kind of cameras that I wanted it would be a different story all together, but I had to do what I had to work with and that was itself was a headache by, by itself, but I, I did it. Okay?
Speaker 1: Yes sir, you did do it.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 402591
Speaker 1: But I was speaking with your wife while you were out and she said that your, you (laughter), you did a lot of, like you were there when they turned the hoses on to people, you know when they sprayed people with the hoses.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I got my share of hoses too, but go ahead.
Speaker 1: But you say you got your share too, so there were times when you felt--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. Just because you were a photographer that didn't mean you, you missed the good happenings. We, we got beat up too.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Bad happens.
Speaker 2: You were beat up also?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, but, but, but we weren't as beat up as hard, as maybe as hard. But the fact is that we, we were available in case they needed some extra whippings because they said they were going to pass them out. But, but most, most of the, most of the demonstrators knew the press and said they, they were going to try not to hurt the press if they could get away with it and so that, that was my lucky star, being available, being available and then I was considered one of the best photographers in, in the area. So you know they didn't want to mess me up because they wanted to make sure that the pictures come out right.
Story_ID: 402592
Speaker 1: How did it feel when you saw your pictures in the newspapers and, or in magazines (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They, they didn't, oh, oh, the, as long as they did stories, the stories, the stories told the truth, I, I, it was all right with me. If it would look like a lie, I didn't, I didn't want it used--I'd be trying to tell the truth about this particular march and what it is--and, and the reason for it and I liked to keep, keep it that way. And so that was one of the reasons why I was, I was, was, was respected by most of the people because they knew if I shot it, it was going to be right.
Speaker 1: So were there any other photographers that you respected as--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was, there was some photographers, Marshall Wilson [G. Marshall Wilson], he, he, he was a little bit older than me. Albert Ling [ph.], Johnny Ling [ph.]; different photographers--Mosley [John W. Mosley], one--we weren't together most of the time but, so that was the reason why I, I, being mostly hard to, to identify them or, or--unless we seen them personally, it was hard, hard to keep, keep that memory in the head because I would be too busy shooting the scenery and not shooting personalities because that, that--see my work was because of, of, of the subject matter and not personalities. And that's the--you find that most of the work that I've done is always personalities and not, always subject matter and not personalities.
Story_ID: 402593
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you a few questions just to--sort of general questions and to wrap it all up for us. What is your advice to young photographers today?
Speaker 2: My, my advice to photographers, photographers is always to remember that it's more than one way of getting downtown. And, and, and the truth of the matter is it's very important that in order to keep our history going, going right, we got to tell the truth and, and that's very important. And if, long as you keep those things in mind you will be all right, but if you start lying about the different things and, and, and different things, you'll be surprised how they, it gets to trap into lies that you'll go from one lie to another and, and it gets pretty hard to get out of.
Story_ID: 402594
Speaker 1: So what, what are your hopes for, for photography in the future, for the African American photographers that are coming out?
Speaker 2: If they, if, if they remember what I say about, about being truthful and, and also being, being--telling the truth of the thing and, and, and making sure that it's, it's photographed that way we will be all right. But as long as we start lying we going, we going to be in trouble. So you--as for writing and everything else we have to tell the truth about the different things. Just like people talk about the, the documentary, he's not telling the truth, well they, they lie, they lie and, and in the newspapers they lie about different things and, and you can do the same thing with a camera if you know what you're doing. But the fact is that the best way to keep it, keep it straight the whole time while you're doing it then you, you won't get in no hung up, won't get in no hung ups, hang ups, hung ups, okay?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yes sir.
Story_ID: 402595
Speaker 1: So let me ask you this, what, what when you think of, when you look back, what is it you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Telling the truth and not, not, not an instigator. I, I, I tell the truth about what it's all about and, and, and all, I try to correct something if it's wrong, but, but, but you find, you find that the, the best thing is to start out with the truth, you always end up with the truth. You start out with a lie, you going to always end up with a lie. So you remember that lies draw lies, the truth draws the truth and that's how it works.
Story_ID: 402596
Speaker 1: Why is history important to you?
Speaker 2: Look at one time, people would ask me where did I, how did I know about such and such a thing, it's history, it's history. And, and it can't be no other way but history. And the only way that we, we know what, what's going to happen with us is the true history of it. And we will also find out that the lies that had been perpetrated, perpetrated on us has gone too far and, and the only way that we can straighten it out is, is, is to be truthful about whatever we do.
Speaker 1: What do you think is the biggest lie that's been perpetrated upon us as black people?
Speaker 2: As black people?
Speaker 1: What do you think is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or against black people?
Speaker 1: Against black people, the biggest lie?
Speaker 2: The biggest, the biggest lie is the fact that we're, we're taught that, that we're nobody. That we had no scruples, no scruples and, and nothing is worthy of us. And that's what--that's the biggest lie, the biggest lie. We're living a lie most of the time because you will find that different things that pops up and that we had nothing to do with it and it's a lie, and, and, and the whole thing, if we, if we are going to go back to our history, we are going to find out that we've been lied to ever since we've been here and that's the reason why we're in such a mess right now. We, we're getting out of it, but, but you see it's harder to get out of a lie than it is to get out of the truth.
Story_ID: 402597
Speaker 1: Okay, so sir, I just want to ask you one more thing.
Speaker 2: Not tonight, I'm tired (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You're tired?
Speaker 2: No, no, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Just about your lovely wife. You recently, you're a newlywed. You just got married a week ago.
Speaker 2: Somebody's been talking. We got a cat and I'm, I'm, I'm going, I'm going, "Where's that cat?" I'm, I'm going to put him in some oil. Yep, we, we, we, we've been trying for fifty years and we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Why, why did it take so long?
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: Or maybe not long enough?
Speaker 2: Maybe not--I don't know, I don't know what I know. I always thought she was special to me and maybe I, maybe I expect too much of her, of her, but now I don't think, maybe, maybe so, I, I don't know, but, but she, she has, she has her way and I've got my way and sometimes it, it, our paths, our paths mix, mixed up, but you find out eventually if it going to take off and straighten itself out. And, and the main thing is if you let God take care of it, you'll be surprised.
Speaker 1: Well thank you very much, sir.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): He just said it, we had to wait for God to say, "Okay, it's time (laughter)."
Speaker 1: Sarcasm will get you nowhere.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Thank you. How was it?
Speaker 2: It was great.
