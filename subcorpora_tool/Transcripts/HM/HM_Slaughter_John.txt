Speaker 2: My name is John Brooks Slaughter.  Last name, S-L-A-U-G-H-T-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born March 16, 1934 in Topeka, Kansas.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm an engineer by training.  I've been an educational administrator for the last thirty years or so of my life.  But my current title is Professor of Education and Engineering at the University of Southern California.
Speaker 1: And you're also a Professor Emeritus at Occidental College?
Speaker 2: I'm president Emeritus.
Speaker 1: Okay, the president, right, okay.

Speaker 2: We're currently on the campus of the University of Southern California in Waite Phillips Hall, the home of the School of Education.
Story_ID: 23835
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five kind of lightweight questions that we always ask as kind of a warm-up, and they only require a short answer.  The first question is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I do have a favorite food, and it's pork spareribs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is purple.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year is the Fall, the month of September.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that because it's when school begins?
Speaker 2: It's because football season begins. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Alright.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: My favorite destination, believe it or not, is home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: My favorite phrase is "Some people would rather have a cause than an effect."
Story_ID: 23836
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.  And I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll keep them separate and bring them together later, so we can keep them straight.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Her maiden name was Dora Reeves, R-E-E-V-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was January 13, 1897.  And she was born in Topeka, Kansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side, and what kind of occupations did they have, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: My mother's family came to Kansas from Tennessee.  I'm not absolutely sure when they came.  I think they came from Covington, Tennessee, if I recall it correctly.  And her father worked, working for large homeowners in Kansas.  Among other things, he was an expert horseman and took care of their horses.  She had a number of sisters and one brother, and on her maternal side of the family, they had a very large family.  They also had come from Tennessee originally.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a story attached to why they moved to Kansas?
Speaker 2: It was part of the great migration, the exodus from Tennessee to Kansas when a number of people came.  A number of African-Americans left Tennessee to go to better opportunities in Kansas--so many that a portion of Topeka is known as Tennessee Town.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is, what you're saying reminds me of a book by Nell Painter, called 'The Exodus.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: About the migration from Tennessee led by, I think, Pat Singleton.
Speaker 2: That's part of it.  That's correct.
Speaker 1: Is that part of your story?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, your relatives on your mother's side came over with--did they come with Pat Singleton, himself?
Speaker 2: I'm not absolutely sure of that.  But it certainly was during that same era.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Benjamin Pap Singleton.  So, there were a lot of black towns established in Kansas in those days.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's right.
Speaker 1: And Nicodemus is one.
Speaker 2: Nicodemus, Bolton--out there, right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were any of your relatives involved in founding any of those towns?
Speaker 2: Not that I'm aware of.
Speaker 1: Or were they living in any of those towns?
Speaker 2: Not that I'm aware of.  As far as I know, they all settled right in and around Topeka.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the area they lived in was called Tennessee Town?
Speaker 2: Well, my immediate family lived outside of Tennessee Town, but I went to school in Tennessee Town, which was less than a mile away from where we lived.  And that was really a large concentration of African-Americans, most of whom had originally had come from Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: My grandfather's name was David Reeves.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said he was good with horses?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did he own any land in Kansas himself?
Speaker 2: Only the home in which my mother was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, alright, now, and your grandmother, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Mercedes, Mercedes Reeves.
Speaker 1: Her family had a similar background in coming from Tennessee.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories on how this side of, I mean, your grandparents' families passed down?
Speaker 2: My grandparents had passed away, but my grandmother on my mother's side was still alive when I was born, but died a couple years later.  My mother tells the story of me sitting on her lap, but my grandfather had already been deceased.  And so, I have no memory at all of my grandparents, unfortunately.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where did your, did your mother talk about growing up and what it was like to grow up in Topeka?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she did.  Topeka was, well, until I was out of college, was a segregated city in many ways.  Limitations on us, as you well know--from Brown v. Board of Education--limitations in education, on access to education.  And certainly in terms of access to restaurants and other things.  My mother had grown up in that environment, and I won't say she had accepted it, but she had learned how to negotiate it.  So, she would talk about that from time to time, and how difficult it had been.  My mother was a person of considerable optimism and positive attitudes, so she was never burdened by that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother have a chance to finish school and go to college?
Speaker 2: She finished high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you know the name of the school she finished?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She made it to the original Topeka High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was Topeka High School, like integrated?
Speaker 2: Sort of.  Yes, it was integrated to the extent that you could go to class, but it was not integrated socially.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Some cities set up separate black high schools--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Topeka wasn't quite large enough for that.  We did have separate elementary schools, which is the Brown case.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did black students get a chance to take part in sports or that sort of thing in Topeka High School?
Speaker 2: Again, I sometimes say it's a wonder we didn't grow up schizoid.  They could play football, could not play basketball.  They could run track, they couldn't play baseball, and so that sort of environment.
Speaker 1: Now, it's often been said that race relations in this country are crazy.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But is there any explanation, what is the explanation for this?  Do you know why they could play one and not the other?
Speaker 2: None that's credible (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, now, did your mother--now what did she end up doing as a living?
Speaker 2: My mother was a housewife.
Speaker 1: Did she have an aspiration to do something else that you know of?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I think my mother was, certainly by the time her children came along, my mother was very content in being a housewife.  She did hair on the side, but not professionally.  I mean, she did for family and friends, but I certainly don't think she had an aspiration to be a cosmetologist or anything like that.  I think she was very content being a mother and a wife.
Story_ID: 23837
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Well, let me go into your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Reuben, R-E-U-B-E-N, Brooks Slaughter.
Speaker 1: Now, I notice you both have Brooks as a middle name.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind--
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  I've often wondered about that, and I love the name.  And I don't know if my dad appropriated it from somewhere or whether or not he was born with it, to be perfectly honest with you.  And I regret that I did not ask him that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My dad was born September 9, 1885.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Tuscaloosa.  Now, how far back can you trace your father's family, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: My grandfather on my father's side was a sharecropper.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Willis Slaughter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was a sharecropper.
Speaker 2: He had been a slave at one point, and was a sharecropper.  He, the story that I associate with him--again, I did not know my grandparents other than having been alive when my grandmother on my mother's side was alive for a period of time.  But my grandfather, much like the story you told, left the place where he was sharecropping to move to Kansas, to go to Kansas where his older sons had already gone and were working in the coalmines in southeastern Kansas.  And my dad, who was still quite young at the time, would tell me he recalled the time when the owner of the property came looking for my grandfather, and my grandfather had left in the middle of the night, walking from Alabama to Kansas.  And he got as far as Arkansas and contracted pneumonia.  And he sent for his, he notified his sons in Kansas--
Speaker 1: His sons?
Speaker 2: He had older sons who were already working in the coalmines in Kansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He notified them that he was ill, and they sent for him and brought him to Kansas where he died.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he never--
Speaker 2: He never was able to join them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He contracted pneumonia and it killed him.
Speaker 1: Is there a story as to why he left?  I mean, we can only imagine that it was not a good situation, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it was just that his sons had told him it was better, a better life for him and the family in Kansas.  His intent was to go get a job, get some money, and send for the rest of the family.  My dad had, there were sixteen members of the family, so it was a very large family.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, was your dad one of the sons that were already in Kansas?
Speaker 2: No, my dad was very young at the time.  He was still at the place in Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this activity takes place, this is a 19th Century--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --a 19th Century drama.
Speaker 2: That's correct.  My guess is this would have been about 1895 or so.  My dad was probably ten years old or so.
Speaker 1: It was not uncommon for people, you know, to be living almost as if they were in slavery--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --because as you mentioned, the master was looking for him--
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: --as if he didn't have the freedom to leave if he wanted to leave.
Speaker 2: That's right.  He had to leave in the middle of the night.  And ultimately, the older sons were able to raise enough money to bring the rest of the family to Kansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's how my dad got there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when does your dad get to Kansas?
Speaker 2: I'm not absolutely sure, but I think it was probably in the very early part of the 20th Century.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, was he grown when he came?
Speaker 2: He was a young man by the time he got there, late teens, a really young man.
Speaker 1: Okay, so around the turn of the century?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: About 1900.  Okay.  Now, what did your, what did your father say about growing up?  Now, he grew up in Alabama, basically.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  He would tell stories of very, very difficult times that they had in Alabama.  The illnesses, the loss of some of his siblings as a result of illnesses, hardships that they encountered.   And then as a young man, when he came to Kansas, he too began to work in the coalmines in southeastern Kansas.
Story_ID: 23838
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he worked as a coalminer.  Did he do that most of his life?
Speaker 2: No, he did that for only until he was in his early forties, maybe.  My dad only finished the third or fourth grade.  But in the coalmine he suffered a very serious accident.  He was setting dynamite in the mines and was in an explosion, and it burned one side of his body and blinded him in one eye.  This was all before I was born.  And he told the story of how he had to crawl out of the mine shaft for a very, very long distance.   And the doctor found him and told his wife at that time--that was his earlier marriage--told his wife that there was no need to treat him, because he wouldn't live through the night.  And the doctor came back the next day to pick up the body, only to find him alive.  That's when they began to treat him.  So, he recovered from his accident even though he retained burn marks throughout his life and ultimately lost his eyesight many, many years later.
Speaker 1: Now was there any compensation for him as a miner?
Speaker 2: Some social security, but in those days there was very little in terms of support.  The black lung disease compensation I think came too late for him to benefit from it.
Speaker 1: Did he have black lung, too?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Did he have black lung as well?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think so, but he could have qualified for that.  I'm not sure of all the details of that, but that's the only thing that I recall that the coalminers had access to.
Speaker 1: This would have been like prior to your birth, in 1934?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was probably in the '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: I'm not sure, you know, what kind of union coalminers would have had in 1920.  I know they were fighting for unions.
Speaker 2: Well, they did have some unions, but they thought that John L. Lewis was one of the greatest people who ever lived.  So, I guess he was covered by some union, but I'm not absolutely certain about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, John L. Lewis, the great labor leader.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, was your father able to work at all, you know, after the accident?
Speaker 2: After he recovered, he was very, very industrious.  He came to, he was living in southeastern Kansas at the time.  He came to Topeka probably around 1930, the early '30's [1930s], and met my mother.  Then they married in '33' [1933].
Story_ID: 23839
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: I forget who introduced them.  He met her father as I recall.  He met her father--my dad, among other things, had been involved in the Baptist religion, and decided that he did not believe in a lot of the doctrine that the ministry at that time was imposing upon people.  He didn't believe in hell fire and damnation.  He did not see God in that sense.  And he became more a devotee of the Jehovah's Witnesses.  And I think my grandfather on my mother's side met my dad through some common interest that they had at that time in the Jehovah's Witnesses.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he introduced her to my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this occurred sometime in the 1930's?
Speaker 2: 1930s, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were they married long before you were born?
Speaker 2: They married in '33' [1933].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was born in March of '34' [1934].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell me something about your parents' disposition and their attitudes, their hobbies, talents, looks--and tell me who you take after the most.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  Early on, I didn't think I looked at all like my father.  But as I aged, I became more and more my father's son.  When I was younger, I looked much more like my mother than I did my dad.  And so, I've aged into Reuben Slaughter.  My dad was a little shorter than I.  He was about 5'8, very strong.  He worked hard all the time.  He was a, among other things a custodian, a used furniture salesman, hauled junk.  He did whatever it took to support his family.  And even-tempered.  As I said, he did not have much formal education, but I've often said, he was the wisest man I ever met in my life.  He was very kind.  He was a person who really loved his children, and I think that's one memory that I and my sisters retain very strongly, that we always knew that we had the love of both of our parents, the love of our parents.  My mother was a very affable individual.  She loved to laugh, was self-effacing and could laugh at herself as much as anything else.  A wonderful cook, very devoted to her children.  And I thank God often for the parents that I had.
Story_ID: 23840
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have siblings?
Speaker 2: I have two sisters.  I had three.  We had, my mother adopted her niece.  My adopted sister's mother died at childbirth, and so my mother adopted her.  My parents adopted her, I should say.  She is now deceased herself.  But I had two--she was older than I.  She was born in 1925.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have two younger sisters.  My sister Sarah, Sarah Eizabeth, who was born August 8, 1935, and a sister Marilyn Jo, who was born December 19, 1937.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you were growing up, did your household consist of your three sisters and yourself and your mother and father?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, there weren't any other relatives living with you?
Speaker 2: Well, for a period of time, my mother's brother, older brother--his name was John as well--which is most likely where I got the name John--lived with us.  And then he married and moved away.
Story_ID: 23841
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, now, can you describe the house you grew up in?  I mean, did you grow in the same place, or did you move around a lot?
Speaker 2: No, I lived in the same house all the time, at 628 Washburn in Topeka [Kansas] on the street where Washington University is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm tempted to ask this, so I may as well go ahead and ask it.  Who was Washburn?
Speaker 2: Washburn was--Ichabod Washburn was his name.   He came from Massachusetts, I think, to Kansas, to Topeka.  And he must have been a landowner or something at the time, but he endowed some land to the establishment of the University.
Speaker 1: Now, was he one of the abolitionist Kansans--
Speaker 2: I don't know about that.
Speaker 1: --back in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know that.  I think he could have been.  I don't have any more history on--
Speaker 1: John Brown was from Massachusetts, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: So, I wondered, you know.  Okay.  So, can you describe your house?  What kind of house did you live in?
Speaker 2: We had a wooden frame house, maybe three bedrooms, but my dad built an additional bedroom onto the house at one point.  It was a house that was probably built in the, originally in the '20s [1920's], maybe 1915 to 1920, sometime during that period.  It was comfortable, certainly far from palatial, but it accommodated our family.  My mother had grown up in.  She wasn't born in the house, but she had grown up in the house, so it was the home she knew.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, her parents lived there in the home when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Story_ID: 23842
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I guess my earliest childhood memory is, before I started kindergarten, I had a habit of sucking the corners of the collars of my shirts.  (laughter).  And my mother used to reprimand me about doing that.  And I remember saying to her that when I start school, I'm going to stop.  And I did.  And that's about the earliest memory, maybe three or four.
Speaker 1: Okay, and negotiation.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Story_ID: 23843
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was there a name for your neighborhood?  You said there was the Tennessee Town neighborhood.  But that wasn't the one you grew up in, was it?
Speaker 2: No, we grew up outside Tennessee Town.  But no, there was no specific name for it.  Our neighborhood was, unlike Tennessee Town, our neighborhood was primarily white, predominantly white.  The block we lived in, other than our home, were all white families.  The block just below us, on one side of the street were all black families and on the other side were all white families.  It was sort of distributed that way.  But our friends and my playmates and so forth at that time were very diverse.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, basically black and white?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were there any Native American kids around, other than--
Speaker 2: Black and white and some Mexican kids, but not in our immediate neighborhood, mostly white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23844
Speaker 1: What school did you start?  What year?
Speaker 2: Buchanan Elementary School.
Speaker 1: And as you said before, this is a segregated elementary school.  It was all black.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was in Tennessee Town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was an elementary school about three blocks from my home, Clay School, which the white students went to.  We used to, we all used to walk to school together, and we'd walk to Clay School and say good-bye to the white kids and then we'd walk the remaining nine blocks to Buchanan School.  And I tell the story that I think when I first began to understand discrimination and segregation was during that period, because something was happening during the day that made me realize that things just weren't right.  Because when we would come back from school, we'd come back by Clay School, and oftentimes meet our white friends there.  But we would be angry.  We would even fight.  And I think it was the result of we'd be close friends going to school, and come back and we'd fight on the way home.  In fact, we used to have some real big fights.  And then we'd change clothes and go out and play ball together, you know.
Speaker 1: So, there was like an unspoken tension around--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the school issue.  Could you tell by looking at it, a difference between the two schools or by, you know, just walking by?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  Buchanan School actually was a nice school, and as I recall, was well equipped.  Other than the fact that--and I've been thinking about this fairly recently--I probably benefitted from having gone to Buchanan School in many ways, because I definitely had the support and love of caring teachers that I may not have had at Clay School.  And, you know, this is certainly not an argument for segregated school environments, but on the other hand it's an argument for caring and supporting and loving teachers, and an environment of high expectations, an environment of expected success.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you like school?
Speaker 2: I loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I loved school.
Speaker 1: I would have guessed that, but I had to ask it. (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, when I said September, you said, "Well, is it because school starts?" (laughter).  And that could have been a fact as well, you know.  I said football, but...
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite subject in school when you were growing up, or did you like all of them?
Speaker 2: Well, it varied.  I would say that probably in the early stages, my favorite subject was English.  And it wasn't until much later that it became math and science.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I loved to read. That's something that me and my sisters did prodigiously, was read.
Story_ID: 23845
Speaker 1: Now you grew up with no television, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And in terms of radio, did you have a radio?
Speaker 2: We had a radio.  Like I said, my dad was a used furniture salesman, so he would sometimes get old radios, and we had plenty of them around.  And that was important to me, because my dad would go to auction houses and buy things that needed repair.  And so he'd buy tables and chairs and things and bring them along and repair them and clean them.  And sometimes he'd buy radios.   And so, he had a barn out in the backyard for this old furniture that he would buy and fix up.  And I started playing with the radios, and then I started fixing some of them, and making them play.  And my dad realized that maybe this was a God-send.  So, my dad built me in the backyard a little radio shack, a radio shop for me.  And my mother bought me test equipment, and I went into the radio repair business.  And all the time I was in high school, I had a radio repair business.  And I used to advertise that I would fix any radio in Topeka [Kansas] for $4 plus parts.  And I paid for a lot of my education through my radio repair business.  That was a significant part of my upbringing because I loved to take things apart and see how they worked.  And that's what I think led me to become an engineer.
Speaker 1: Now, those are the days I remember when you would go to the store and buy a vacuum tube to test the vacuum tube--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to figure out--
Speaker 2: Yep, I had a vacuum tube tester.  I told my mother I needed a vacuum tube tester and we found a used one at a radio store in Topeka.  And she couldn't afford it, but she bought it for me.  She knew that that was something that I wanted and needed for my radio repair business.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How much did it cost?  I guess I'm curious now.
Speaker 2: I think it was about $25 at the time.
Speaker 1: That's a lot of money in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: $25 may have been equivalent to a couple hundred dollars today.
Speaker 2: That's right, exactly.  My dad's annual salary during that time was about $2500 a year or so.  (laughter).  So, you just imagine that $25 was an important part of that one percent.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  But you were able to make money with it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, I would guess you would contribute money back into the home, that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, it was probably significant income.
Speaker 2: Well, it was $4 plus parts, and I did the best I could. (laughter).  But it helped pay for my college education, so my parents didn't have to pay for that as much, certainly for the first two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you ever encounter a radio that you couldn't fix and a problem you just couldn't deal with?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I think there was one car radio that a friend of mine had that I had difficulty and may not have been able to complete, but I became very good at it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you have any kind of consultation with anybody about how to do it, or did you just start to tinker?
Speaker 2: I took a class when I went to high school.  I'll back up.  When I was in junior high school, our junior high school was integrated.  And it was more integrated, actually, in many ways, than the high school.  But in junior high school I decided that I wanted to be an engineer.  And I'm not absolutely certain how that revelation came, other than the fact that I was curious and I liked, like I said, to take things apart and see how they worked, and build things.  So, I would get old copies of 'Popular Mechanics Magazines,' and they always had projects you could build.  And I made cameras and I made various electronic devices, and I decided I wanted to be an electrical engineer.  And I would tell anybody who was in earshot, that I wanted to be an electronic engineer.  People thought I was crazy, because nobody had heard of a--first of all, engineers in Topeka were not anybody other than people who drove the Santa Fe Railroad train, you know.  And certainly nobody had ever heard of a black engineer.  And you know, here is this kid saying I want to be an engineer.  And I don't even think my parents really understood what it was that I was saying I wanted to be.  So, I went to high school, and I remember saying to the counselor that I wanted to be an engineer.  And what they said, which is not uncommon for black kids at that time was, "You need to go to vocational school."  So, I ended up in trade school where I learned about radios.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm going to go back.  These counseling stories, we can begin to make a book out of them.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: The same advice.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But we're going to go back to--now in high school,  in Topeka High School, how were your grades?
Speaker 2: My grades were good.  I wasn't perfect, but I had--I graduated--but  with excellent grades.  I was always a good student.
Story_ID: 23846
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, now did you participate in any high school activities?  I know you said it was a socially segregated school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But did you participate in any activities at all?
Speaker 2: I ran track and I ran cross-country.  I couldn't play on the high school baseball team, but I played baseball and American Collegiate baseball.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Baseball is very important in Kansas, I know that.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you do anything else?  Did you run for any class offices or anything?
Speaker 2: I was on the Student Council.  And I think I was on something else, but I wasn't any more active than that.
Story_ID: 23847
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that's pretty active, you know, the Student Council.  Was there any special teachers in high school?  I mean, well, first let me go back to--I didn't ask you about the teachers in grade school and middle school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did they--by the time you got to middle school, just before I asked you about grades in grade school, were there any black teachers in middle school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, once you left the totally segregated black school, all the teachers were white?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there a different like salary for white teachers in those days?
Speaker 2: I think there was.  I've seen some reports since then and I've read a lot about the Brown [Brown vs. The Board of Education] case and so forth.  And I should say that, you may get around to this, but there were four black elementary schools in Topeka.  And those were the four schools that were the centerpiece of the Brown case.  My cousin, my first cousin, Lucinda Todd, was the first African-American in Topeka to attempt to get her daughter enrolled in one of the white elementary schools.  She attempted to get her daughter enrolled in--I think it was--what school was it?  It wasn't Sumner.  I can't remember the name of the school right now.  And she was an officer, perhaps the President, of the Topeka NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] at the time that the Brown case went to the Supreme Court.  All of the Brown--the case was named after Brown because Thurgood Marshall decided that it would be better to have a man as the primary plaintiff than to have a woman.  And even though Oliver Brown was somewhat of a reluctant participant, he agreed to have his name on the case.  So, that's how it became Brown.
Speaker 1: Yes, so this case was on the lawsuit, Brown v. the Board of Education at Topeka, Kansas.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: Did you know Oliver Brown?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know him.  I didn't know him personally, although I remember seeing him a lot.  But at the time when the case was working its way through being developed, my cousin used to come to our house and report on the process.  At that time I was still relatively young, and it went on for a long period of time.  I was in college at the time it was decided, but I remember--let's see, how did I get off on that?  We were talking about Buchanan School.  It was one of the--I had some wonderful teachers at Buchanan School.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers?
Speaker 2: The one who probably had the greatest impact on me was, I think she may have been my fourth grade teacher, Mrs. McBrier, Althea McBrier.
Speaker 1: McBrier, how do you spell McBrier?
Speaker 2: Mc-B-R-I-E-R.  She may have been second grade teacher, now that I remember.  But she was the one who really introduced me to mathematics.  And she remained someone who followed my career until she died, maybe ten years or so ago.  And she would even, even after I graduated from college and had gone well into my profession, she would call my mother and find out how I was doing.  She was very meaningful.   Burla Ross, B-U-R-L-A, Mr. Ross, was another teacher at Buchanan who followed me for a number of years who I would see when I went back to Topeka.  There were some really wonderful teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did Mr. Ross teach?
Speaker 2: He taught one of the grades.  I think he was a fifth or sixth grade teacher.  And I can recall when he would get called up to go back to the Army toward the end of World War II.  And he later became the principal after the school system integrated.  They finally recognized him and he became the principal at the Topeka schools.
Story_ID: 23848
Speaker 1: Now, I neglected to point out that you were a child during the war.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: During World War II, and were you--I know that's, those were the days when they had drives to collect metal and other things--rubber, and were rationing food.
Speaker 2: That's right, food rationing and all kind of drives.  And I remember buying stamps, war stamps and so forth, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your family receive newspapers?  I mean, the black papers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The Courier, or--
Speaker 2: The Kansas City Call.
Speaker 1: Kansas City Call, okay.  Now, was that produced--well, that's Kansas City.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was the closest black paper to us, so we got that, I think, weekly.
Story_ID: 23849
Speaker 1: And were your parents involved in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or anything at all?
Speaker 2: No, they weren't.  They were not directly involved.
Speaker 1: So, it was your cousin--you said Linda Todd, right?
Speaker 2: Lucinda.
Speaker 1: Lucinda Todd.  Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: They named, they honored her by establishing the Brown Memorial in Topeka and named the Center after her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Monroe School Board is there.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, this is something.  I'm scouring my history in my head here.  Lucinda--now she was, so she was the point person in the NAACP?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: On Brown?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was a strong woman (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a sense at the time that she was making history?
Speaker 2: Not immediately.  I think maybe I was too young to really understand the impact of Brown at the time that she would come back to the house to tell us about the progress that was being made.  It wasn't until afterwards that I really recognized that I had had an opportunity to live through a very, very important phase of African-American life.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And most people still don't know who she is, really, I guess around the country.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: She's not a household word.
Speaker 2: That's very true.
Speaker 1: Now, I've read about it, and it's fuzzy to me, and I couldn't bring it back--
Speaker 2: It was an excellent book.  I was just recommending it to one of my colleagues here this morning.  The book is called 'Simple Justice,' by Richard Kluger which tells the story.  And my Aunt Cindy--we called her Aunt Cindy even though she was my first cousin, because she was considerably older than I and older than us, me and my sisters.  So, my mother made sure we called her Aunt Cindy rather than Cousin Cindy.  But Aunt Cindy plays an important role in that book, and I recommend it to you.
Speaker 1: And I know she's been written about in Taylor Branch.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: That's where I read about her.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 23850
Speaker 1: So, okay.  That's something that's, it's good that we talked about that.  So, what about in high school?  Was there any--here you're getting bad counseling, basically.  But was there any teacher there that seemed to recognize your talent and want to--
Speaker 2: Well, back to middle school.  There was a--my home room teacher who was also my industrial arts teacher, a gentleman by the name of Howard Anderson, is another one who I would say was very important to me, not only in school, but later during life.  I recall even as late as when my father died, that Mr. Anderson came there to support me.  So, I had teachers throughout my life who were important.  And in high school, I had some good teachers who I liked and who were supportive, but not in the same way as my elementary and middle school teachers were.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the name of your middle school, again?
Speaker 2: Roosevelt Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23851
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, in high school--now, when you were ready to graduate, your mind was made up to go to Washburn [Washburn University]?
Speaker 2: In high school, I thought I was going to go to either University of Kansas or Kansas State [Kansas State University].  And it wasn't until I attempted to apply to those schools that I found out that because I had been shunted off into the vocational track, I didn't have the math and science that would qualify me for going to engineering school.  And so, I decided that I would have to go to Washburn and take the courses I should have had in high school in order to prepare myself for going to engineering school.  And so I went to Washburn for two years.
Speaker 1: That was in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: It was within a mile, on the same street, within a mile.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Washburn is an integrated school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It had been forever as far as I know.  And African-Americans were very active at Washburn, much more so than at KU or K State.
Speaker 1: And how do you account for that?
Speaker 2: It's hard to figure out what was going on in Kansas at the time.  And maybe that had a lot to do with the question you asked earlier, was Ichabod Washburn an abolitionist?  Because the school had a history of being much more progressive than the State schools.  And it had been, just simply the way in which it was founded.
Speaker 1: There's actually a Washburn Technical School in Chicago, too.
Speaker 2: That's right, I've heard that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And I've talked to a lot of black people that have attended Washburn at one time.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And so it was accessible to black students.  I wondered, you know.  I never, I just thought, I said well...
Speaker 2: Also, some really notable blacks have graduated from Washburn.  Carl Rowen, Carl T. Rowen, went to the V-12 Program at Washburn.  And I remember a book that he wrote.  I forgot the title of it.  But he talked about his time at Washburn.  There was an attorney--you've heard of Art Fletcher?
Speaker 1: Yes, he's--
Speaker 2: A Philadelphia fan?  Art Fletcher played football at Washburn.
Speaker 1: He was the father of affirmative action.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Under the Nixon administration.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Art Fletcher...
Speaker 2: Samuel Jackson.  Sam was assistant secretary of HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] under Romney.
Speaker 1: George Romney, huh?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  So, there've been some significant African-Americans.  Art Fletcher, I remember Art Fletcher.   Art Fletcher was a good running back.  And in one game against the school from western Kansas, Fort Hayes State, every time Fletcher would get tackled, they would jump on him and hit him and slug him and kick him and everything.  And there was a sportswriter in Topeka named Stu Dunbar.  And Stu Dunbar adored Art Fletcher.  And the article the day after the game said "I never knew that Art Fletcher was a dirty player until last night."  He said, "I saw Art Fletcher deliberately throw his jaw at a Fort Hayes State player's fist."  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: I never will forget that.
Speaker 1: Those are the days when, and I've often heard these stories of what happened to Jim Brown or Ernie Davis.
Speaker 2: Johnny Bright--Johnny Bright was nearly killed by then Oklahoma A&M.  And that's the reason Oklahoma A&M, now Oklahoma State, that's the reason Oklahoma A&M could not get into the Big Eight Conference for many, many years, because they had nearly killed Bright in a football game.
Speaker 1: Johnny Bright.  I hadn't heard of that, I never heard of that story before this.
Speaker 2: Yeah, look it up.  I'm sure you can find it.
Speaker 1: Yes sir.  Now, the sports scene has often been like a small stage for the bigger struggle in America.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a microcosm of reality, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Drama acting out on the field.  Art Fletcher--so, he was a contemporary of yours?
Speaker 2: Art was older.  He was ahead of me.  I was a kid that used to go out to see the Washburn games.  So, Art played right after World War II.  So, he was maybe six or seven years before me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Seven years.  And what about Carl T. Rowen?
Speaker 2: Rowen was there during World War II.
Speaker 1: So, he was a little bit older.
Speaker 2: He was a part of the Navy V-12 Program, or V-5 Program, whatever that was.  They had stationed a number of students at universities around the country, and he was assigned to Washburn.
Speaker 1: He would have been maybe around your sister's age, your older sister's age?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 1925 or around that time?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, that makes sense.
Story_ID: 23852
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, alright.  So you go to Washburn [Washburn University] to shore up on your math and science skills?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  Again, this is one of those situations where I thought that, you know, that the worst thing that could happen to me was that I wasn't able to get into engineering school.  But it turned out to be a blessing, in the sense that while I was there, in addition to the math and science that I took, I also took things like history, English Literature, world history, economics, speech, and then a number of other classes that have actually meant more to me in recent years than did the math and science.  Because I tell people that there is no way I could have ever been president of a liberal arts college, for example, had I not had that preparation.  And when I did get to Kansas State, I found out that the students in my classes, and my cohorts, my engineering cohorts, were better than I in terms of their math and science preparation.  But they didn't have the writing skills, they didn't have the English literature and the broader education that I have.  So, I have become a very strong proponent of scientists and engineers having a liberal arts education in addition to the math and science.  And that's one of the things I profess.  Now, I write about it, I speak about it.   When I first went to the University of Maryland and became the chancellor there, one of the things I encountered was, interestingly enough, some resistance on the part of the arts and humanities faculty, because they were unhappy that the University had selected an engineer to be the chancellor.  They wanted someone from the humanities to be the next chancellor.  And so, I was asked to come and meet with the arts and humanities faculty so they could express their unhappiness with the fact that I'd been chosen.  So, I met with them and I talked to them about my background and so forth.  And I said to them, I said, "I'm the only engineer I know who can quote Geoffrey Chaucer's Prologue to the Canterbury Tales in the original Old English."  And after my speech, I said, "Are there any questions?"  And a gentleman down front said, "Yes, would you quote Geoffrey Chaucer's Prologue to the Canterbury Tales?"  And I said, "The drought of March has pierced unto the root..." and he said "That's enough." (laughter).  So, I believe very strongly that it is critically important, particularly today, with a multi-cultural environment, the global environment in which we live, that scientists and engineers must have a much broader education than simply the math and science that they have historically received.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think with the panic around STEM education, a lot of people have, there's been a philosophy to cut back on liberal arts.  And I've heard that kind of talk, which I think is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I agree with you.  You know--
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's very dangerous, and not in our own best interests.
Speaker 1: Right.  Or just to send students to technical schools to learn without any background other than--
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So--
Speaker 2: I've become sort of a burr in the saddle for the people here in the engineering school, arguing for that.
Story_ID: 23853
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you graduated from Topeka High School in '51' [1951]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Went to Washburn in '52' [1952] and '53' [1953].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you go to Kansas State University, right?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, after having, you know, taken the courses that you needed to--
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it difficult to pay for that, or did you get a scholarship?
Speaker 2: I had a scholarship to Washburn.  I did not have a scholarship to K State.  I worked while I was there.  I worked two jobs while I was there.  I worked at helping the clean-up of the residence hall, and I worked in the electrical engineering department repairing test equipment, and so forth.
Speaker 1: Now, Kansas State, is that the one in Manhattan, Kansas?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's the one that has the good football team.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Is that the one that's number one, now.
Speaker 2: It was number one.  They lost to Baylor [Baylor University], and they fell to number seven.  That's the one, though.
Speaker 1: Alright.  In Manhattan, Kansas.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 23854
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, was there any particular--well, I didn't ask you about--was there any particular teachers at Washburn that you really appreciated above the rest?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  There was an English teacher who played an important role.  Her name was Helen Deel, D-E-E-L.  An economics professor, Mr. Marcuse, M-A-R-C-U-S-E, who I recall very fondly.
Speaker 1: Now is he related to the other--
Speaker 2: Herb Marcuse?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  And now that I think about it, I think their names are spelled differently.  I think I'm wrong.  I think he was M-A-R-C-O-U-X, Marcoux.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, he was not the same--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the infamous--the one you're talking about--
Speaker 1: That's the one that taught Angela Davis?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And mentored her.
Speaker 2: At the University of California, San Diego where I was.
Story_ID: 23855
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  So, Kansas State was, I mean, well, what did you--now, you focused on electrical engineering, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And was there some aspect of it that you had to focus on as a capstone project for a degree?
Speaker 2: Well, I was very interested in--those were the early days in computing really.  I became fascinated by analog computing at the time, and that was before the digital computers really took hold.  And so, if anything at K State, analog computing was the area that I did my sort of capstone thesis.
Speaker 1: Now, you had to learn like Fortran or something?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Oh, I learned Fortran only after graduate school, and I used that.  That was one of the earlier digital computer languages.
Speaker 1: With all the punch cards.
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: The computer in those days was a large item.
Speaker 2: Yes, the computer that took up this room is now on my wrist. (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right.  Okay.  So, kids probably find it hard to believe.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: And what could a computer actually do?  I mean, it was useful in those days, you know, for all that space it took up.
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, almost the only thing they did was just process large batches of data.  You know, we thought they were fast, but compared to what's available today, they were sloth-like, you know.
Speaker 1: But, say compared to a human being that you gave a large number of figures to calculate, the computer was more efficient?
Speaker 2: Oh, much more, yeah, yeah.  They were much faster than a human would be able to accomplish, but they took up a lot of space, and they had vacuum tubes in those days.  They generated a lot of heat.  A lot of that space was simply required to keep them cool.  That was before transistors.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember guys in the computer room at both General Motors and the university I attended, playing Uker  most of the time that they were down there, just stacking cards and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: There was a lot of down time for the operators and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.  My dissertation really consisted of a box of cards, computer cards, to solve the problems every time we had to go modify a few punch cards and run them through the machine.
Speaker 1: So, this is your dissertation much later, on in '71' [1971]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23856
Speaker 1: Now did you graduate with any special honors from Kansas State University?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was elected to the Electrical Engineering Honorary Society, Eta Kappa Nu.  I was elected to another Honorary Engineering Society, Sigma Tau.  Those are the two academic recognitions that I received.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: Are you a fraternity member?
Speaker 1: I'm not, I never have been.
Speaker 2: I joined Alpha Phi Alpha when I was in college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  At Washburn?
Speaker 2: It was at Washburn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23857
Speaker 1: Now, you graduated from Kansas State University in 1956?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And this is--oh, was there any--I guess I'll go back to '54' [1954], in the summer.  Was there any celebration in Topeka around the Brown v. the Board decision?
Speaker 2: Not that I remember.  I was away at the time.  I was in school at the time.  I remember the day that we got the word that the Supreme court had made the decision.  I recall that day very well.  I was at Kansas State at the time.  So, I'm not really sure if there was celebration in Topeka.
Speaker 1: And did Kansas, did Topeka immediately have to, you know, desegregate?
Speaker 2: Well, part of the language of the Supreme Court decision was "with all deliberate speed", if you recall.  And I think Charles Ogletree has written something, "With all Deliberate Speed."  So, it took a while for it to really go into effect.  And my cousin, as a matter of fact, many years later, wrote a piece in which she said that, you know, we're still waiting for it to really have the impact that it was designed to have.
Story_ID: 23858
Speaker 1: And while we're on it, can you tell us maybe, just kind of follow up on what happened to your cousin, Lucinda Todd.  I mean, how did she spend the rest of her life?
Speaker 2: Well, she continued to be an ardent fighter for integration.  I recall, it must have been 1979, the 25th Anniversary of the Supreme Court decision, that President Carter honored her and others at the White House for that achievement.  I was at the National Science Foundation at the time, and I remember having lunch with her when she was visiting for that celebration.
Speaker 1: This is 1979?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  I think it was the 25th Anniversary celebration.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She continued to be an ardent supporter of civil rights.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when did she pass away?
Speaker 2: Lucinda passed away probably about 1995, that period of time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not absolutely certain, but it was before 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  I just wanted to make sure.  And you say that they've dedicated a park to her?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they dedicated part of the memorial to the Brown decision at Monroe School, which was the school where Linda Brown ultimately attended in Topeka.  And there's a bridge or road or something at the school that's named for Lucinda Todd.  But if you look at the Brown Memorial in Topeka, that story is on the website, I know.
Story_ID: 23859
Speaker 1: So, immediately after you graduated from Kansas State you went to work for General Dynamics?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And how did that take place?  Did they recruit you or did you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had a number of opportunities when I got my degree.  And I decided that I really wanted to work in the aircraft industry.  I had been recruited by IBM.  I had an offer from Westinghouse, which I turned down because they said they wanted me to be the Jackie Robinson of Westinghouse (laughter).  I had an offer from Hollands Radio in Cedar Rapids, Iowa which really intrigued me at the time and point, because my girlfriend had been offered a teaching position in Des Moines, Iowa.  So, while she was trying to decide whether or not she would accept the position at Des Moines, I was toying with whether or not I would go to Iowa as well.  But then she accepted a position in San Diego, and I had an offer on the table which I'd already said I would accept at North American Aviation here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. And when I learned she was going to San Diego, I backed out of the position here at North American and went to work for General Dynamics in San Diego [California], which also recruited me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you had to move to San Diego to take the job?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 23860
Speaker 1: I just want to go back to this Westinghouse, Jackie Robinson of Westinghouse.  Can you, is there, how did that conversation take place?   We've got to get this on tape.
Speaker 2: (laughter).  We had recruited from the campus.  This was on the campus recruiting, and they had asked me to take a trip back to Pittsburgh where the Westinghouse offices were.  And it must have been obvious to him that I was somewhat reluctant.  The reason I didn't want to take the trip was not because I wasn't interested in doing so, but I felt that if I went to all the recruiting visits that I had been invited to attend, I would flunk out of school (laughter), because IBM wanted me to come back to Endicott,  New York.  And I was tempted to do so, but the amount of time it would take, and the fact that I was more concerned about being able to graduate, I didn't want to take a chance.  I turned down a lot of recruiting visits except for one in Kansas City, which was close.  And the Westinghouse guy thought this would be an inducement for me.  And he said, "If you come to Westinghouse, you can be the Jackie Robinson of Westinghouse."  Other being an inducement, that was a turnoff for me.  It was a critical time, actually, for young black engineers, because even General Dynamics had hired its first black engineer one year before.  So, these companies were just, this was a new experience for these companies, going after African-American engineers.  And in retrospect, you had to be very, very careful about where you decided to go.  They were under pressure from the government to begin to diversify their ranks.  And it was not so much because they wanted to, but because in order to get government contracts, they had to be able to prove that they were doing so.  So, even at General Dynamics I ran into discrimination, name calling, and things of that sort.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a sense of the type of things that happened to Jackie Robinson when he was the Jackie Robinson of major league baseball?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.  Yeah, yeah, I followed Jackie Robinson very closely, very closely.
Speaker 1: Some people only see the heroic part of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: I remember--you know it's interesting--as a kid, long before Jackie Robinson, I had become a fan of the Dodgers.  That was my team.  And they had a pitcher by the name of Kirby Higby, and I liked that name.   And for some reason, I became a fan of Kirby Higby's.  I didn't find out until later that Kirby Higby was one of the biggest detractors of Jackie Robinson (laughter).  So, I lost interest in him at that time.  But the very first major league baseball game I ever saw, the same cousin, Lucinda Todd, she and her husband and daughter and I drove from Topeka to St. Louis to see the Dodgers play the Cardinals in the summer of 1950.  And at that time the stands at Sportsman Park in St. Louis were still segregated.  And that was the first major league baseball game I ever saw.  We went there just because we wanted to see Jackie Robinson.  So, I knew the difficulties that Jackie had experienced, the name calling and the treatment that he had received from the St. Louis Cardinals and the Philadelphia Phillies, notably.  And so that was a turnoff it seems, that that guy said that.

Speaker 1: What position did you have at General Dynamics when you started?
Speaker 2: I was an entry level engineer.  I think they called me an associate engineer at the time.  And then a year later I was advanced to electronics engineer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, you were there from 1956 to 1960?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And how far did you advance at General Dynamics?
Speaker 2: I didn't get to the senior level.  I left before--and so did others.  I changed jobs two years into my time there and went from the aircraft company to the missile division, and I did work on simulation of atlas missile flights.  I was responsible for post-flight simulation to find out what happened, what went wrong, what went right, by simulating the flight on the computer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this, okay, this is--so, it was possible to simulate a flight on a computer?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: In 1960.
Speaker 2: You could simulate when the booster rockets fell off, when it went into orbit and so forth.  So, I tried to, I tried the mathematical evaluations so that we could determine exactly how the missile had behaved.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you said you had tensions at General Dynamics.  Were you the only, first and only black engineer?
Speaker 2: No, the first one had been hired just a year before.  And, you know, my guess is that they probably, at that time, Condor had 38,000 employees in San Diego [California], huge.  General Dynamics had a huge employment base.  But I would guess there were not more than ten black engineers, if that many, in the entire company.
Story_ID: 23862
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, now you left in 1960 to join the United States Navy electronics lab in San Diego?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Okay.  Oh, meanwhile, your girlfriend who's in San Diego, did you all get together?
Speaker 2: We got married the same summer that--we both graduated senior.  She took the teaching job in San Diego and I took the engineering job, and we got married in August of that year.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, well, tell us about the United States Navy electronics lab.
Speaker 2: The Naval electronics laboratory was a small Navy research and development laboratory, which was a laboratory operated by the Bureau of Ships of the Navy.  And it was a wonderful place to work because it was an opportunity to really sort of be creative and entrepreneurial in identifying activities that could be used to, in my case, utilize computers.  Like I said, computers had just then started coming in vogue, and so people were looking for ways in which computers could be used to do things that had never been done before.  And I had an opportunity, well, in my lab to come up with a new use for digital computers in controlling things like missile launchers and gun mounts and radars and so forth.  And so, I had a bucket of money dumped in my lap, and I was able to build a team and buy equipment and create a whole new set of what came to be known as digital control systems, that have ultimately now become very much a part of not just naval systems, but almost everything that we do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  So, this is--now, so did you patent any inventions in this--
Speaker 2: No.  At that time, the software and so forth that we developed was not patentable, but we were able to break ground in a number of new areas that certainly we ended up getting credit for within the Navy circles, but none of it was patentable.
Story_ID: 23863
Speaker 1: So, at the time same time, I guess you were going to, at some point during this period of time between '56' [1956] and '60' [1960], you were going to graduate school, too, at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, now, so you were working on a master's in electrical engineering?
Speaker 2: Yes, a master's.  Actually, they just called it engineering at the time.  They didn't break it down into disciplines.  So I got an M.S. in engineering in '61' [1961].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  Now, so many people just, you know, once they get their master's degree they just go right on to a Ph.D., but you didn't do that, right?
Speaker 2: No.  As a matter of fact, I said I didn't want to go back to school.  I thought I'd had enough. (laughter).  And I was working and I had a family.  I had two children by--I had my son by the time I completed my master's, and I was taking on more and more responsibility at work.  And that was right in the middle of I think, my most productive engineering period as a practicing engineer in contributing technically.  And so, I just concentrated on that.  And it wasn't until, I think, about 1965 that I was having a conversation with one of my supervisors, a person I admired a great deal.  And I said to him sort of in passing, that when he retired I wanted his job.  And he said to me, the next person who has this job is going to have a doctorate's degree.  He didn't have one.  He said the next person who has this job, he said things are changing, and the next person who has this job is going to have to have a Ph.D.  And that made me think, you know, that's something that maybe I ought to do.  And my wife, who was always extremely supportive, she is the one who encouraged me to go back and get my master's.  She is the one who has been encouraging me to consider getting a doctorate for some time.  And she finally said, you'd better get it.  And so, that's what I seriously had to think about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you went to the University of California in San Diego, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you started, did you start going in '65' [1965]?
Speaker 2: I started taking classes in '65' [1965], and I had a group of a dozen people that I was leading.  And so I had a pretty busy period--two children--and so I was taking courses about the same time that I was working, most of the time I was in graduate school.  And in 1969, the same supervisor that I mentioned gave me a sabbatical at full salary to do my research.  So, I took off a year from work and just went to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell us about your, now you got your Ph.D. in 1971.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 23864
Speaker 1: Now, what was your dissertation about, and who was your advisor, first of all?
Speaker 2: My advisor was the person I worked with at General Dynamics, actually.  His name is Harold Sorenson, S-O-R-E-N-S-O-N.  He's a good friend who had left General Dynamics and gone and got his Ph.D. at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] and then came back, and was on the faculty at UCSD [University of California, San Diego].  And he and I had similar research interests, and he became my advisor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I did my, the title of my dissertation is "The Solution of a Class of Optimal Control Systems With Convex Costs and Convex Constraints Using Linear and Piecewise Linear Programming Techniques."  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, what did that mean for us laymen?
Speaker 2: Well, it's, suppose you have a problem that you're trying to send a rocket to the moon, but you have limitations on the amount of fuel that you can carry.  So, you're trying to optimize its root, optimize its performance, so that it doesn't burn up more fuel than this.   And so, the algorithms that I came up with in this were designed to optimize the path to give it the--give it the, when I say convex constraints, the constraint is how much fuel you carry.  And so, you take that into account in deciding whether you go or not.  You could fly it, you know, to try to get there as fast as possible, but that might burn up more fuel.  So, you want to find the path.  So, the thing I did in my research study was to determine how to choose that path that satisfied the constraint and yet hit the target that you wanted to.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, was this dissertation published?
Speaker 2: I published some aspects of it subsequent to my degree and presented it at various conferences.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there any time during the dissertation process that you felt discouraged or just thought it was too much?
Speaker 2: There were times when I wondered if I would ever finish.  Yes, but again, my biggest cheerleader was Bernice, my wife, who I remember one time when I was feeling down, she reminded me of the saying that "Tough times don't last, but tough people do."  And she went on to give me a kick in the behind when I needed it.  And so, we got it done.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  That's great.  So, 1971 you got your Ph.D.  Now, you were still working with the U.S. Navy lab until--
Speaker 2: I should tell you this.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mentioned a few minutes ago about the supervisor that I told when he retired, I wanted his job.  He retired shortly after I got my Ph.D.  On the morning that I defended my dissertation and was told by my advisor and research committee that I passed, and they congratulated me and said congratulations, Dr. Slaughter, the first thing I did was call my mother and told her.  The second thing I did was go to the Navy electronics laboratory where I was interviewed, on the same day.  And then during the interview, they told me I had the job.  So, the same day I got my degree, I got the job that I had told him back in 1965 that I wanted.
Speaker 1: Did you ever get a reaction from him about it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was very happy for me, very, very happy for me.  And we both had a big laugh that it happened that way.
Story_ID: 23865
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  That's interesting.  So, you were at the Naval lab during--now, what position was it that you had?
Speaker 2: I was department head of the Information Systems technology department.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  So, you were there until 1977?
Speaker 2: No, I was there until the summer of '75' [1975].
Speaker 1: Oh, '75' [1975], okay, that's right.  Till the summer of '75' [1975], and then that's when you took a position at the University of Washington?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And you came into the University of--did you come in as director of applied physics?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was recruited to be the director of the applied physics laboratory, and professor of electrical engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this is a position where you had tenure when you were around, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  That was an amazing thing.  I didn't have to go through the rigors of getting tenured.  It was sort of, oh by the way, you have a tenured position.  (laughter).  So, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what was that like?  Now, you're at the University of Washington.  This is up in Seattle.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was a wonderful experience, very excellent laboratory and a wonderful university.  And I had a lot of support from the people in the laboratory.  There were only a very few African-Americans working there.  And then in the engineering and scientific ranks, I can't recall that there were any.  There were some staff people.  The laboratory was founded during World War II to develop underwater acoustics in torpedoes for the Navy.  And then after the war, its activities expanded.  We did work in the Arctic Ocean studying fish migration, in addition to doing a lot of work on the underwater vessels, subversive vessels.  It was really a great experience.  It was something I thoroughly enjoyed.  In many ways I wish I had a longer period of time there.
Speaker 1: So, what happened?  Now, you were there from 1975 to 1977.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 23866
Speaker 1: And in '77' [1977], you joined the National Science Foundation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In 1977, I got a call from the director of the National Science Foundation saying that my name had come to their attention, and they wondered if I would be willing to come join their staff to be an assistant director for astronomic, atmospheric, earth, and oceans sciences with one of the major directors of the Foundation.  And I had long had an interest in serving in Washington [District of Columbia], and it was an intriguing possibility.  And in discussing it with my family, I decided that it was something that I would be willing to do for a period of time.  So, I took a leave of absence, actually, from the University of Washington with that in mind, that after two to three years, I would come back.  It didn't work out that way, but that's what I had in mind.
Speaker 1: So, you moved to D.C., to Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did your family stay back in--
Speaker 2: No, we all went.
Speaker 1: Everybody went, alright.  Okay.  So, you were there for two years.  Well, describe those two years for us.
Speaker 2: I was there for two years.  It was a fascinating experience, because I had never worked in astronomy and earth sciences before.  And having responsibility for those programs was a great education for me.  And one of the highlights of the experience was that the assistant director for the area that I had is responsible for the U.S. Antarctic Research Program.  So, I had control of what happened on the Antarctic continent.  So, I had an opportunity to visit Antarctica and to--one of the photos that I will show you is during the time I was at the South Pole.  In the Antarctic, the U.S. Navy works for the assistant director, so I had the responsibility for directing the Navy activities and so forth.  So that was the highlight at the time.  As a matter of fact, there's a, I had a mountain in the Antarctic named after me, Mount Slaughter, in the Ellsworth Mountain range in the Antarctic.
Speaker 1: In Antarctica?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, that was a, I know it was cold--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it's the highest, coldest, driest place on earth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you, was there like a base station?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  McMurdo Sound.  We started in New Zealand and flew on a ski-equipped aircraft into McMurdo Sound in the Antarctic, and that was our home base.  From there we visited different parts of the continent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you ever in any dangerous situations or anything?  Antarctica, you know...
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were in some very bad weather and some severe flying conditions where there was some concern.  You had to be very much on guard, because the weather could change immediately and you could find yourself lost there for a period of time until it cleared up.  Fortunately, we were able to, on this one occasion we were able to get out before it hit too hard, even though it was kind of scary for awhile.
Story_ID: 23867
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were there for two years.  But you didn't go back to the University of Washington.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, while I was at NFS [National Science Foundation] the first time, I was asked to consider coming to Washington State University as provost.  And I had dreams at that time that ultimately I wanted to be a college president.  And being the provost is really the next step to doing that.  So, again, after consultation with my family, we elected to accept that invitation.  Actually, I received the invitation to come back a year earlier.  I'd only been at NSF about a year when I was asked to consider the position.  And I told the president at Washington State at the time that I could not do it, it would not be appropriate to leave NSF that quickly.  And he said, we'll wait a year for you.  And we did it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, now what does a provost do?  I've always wanted to ask that.  (laughter).
Speaker 2: The provost is responsible for the academic program at the university, primarily.  I was provost and vice president for academic affairs.  That was my title.  And, but in addition, the provost oversees the athletics program, and essentially all the other vice-presidents report to the provost.  The presidents of universities today are primarily concerned with fundraising and the public relations aspects and so forth.  And the provost is really the operating head of the institution.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So--
Speaker 2: All the deans reported to me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now where is Washington State?
Speaker 2: In Pullman (?), Washington on the eastern side.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's the inland, you know, part of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: South of Spokane, about eighty miles.
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, you were there from 1979 to--just a year, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Just a little over a year when I got a call from President Carter asking me to come back.  So--
Speaker 1: This time you came back as director of the National Science Laboratory?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, this is, this seems to me, I mean you were really, just really climbing the ladder, you know.  I mean, you just were really moving fast.
Speaker 2: Well, this was a big move for us.  And a real opportunity, in that, again, I was hesitant, very hesitant, as a matter of fact.  I turned down the offer on numerous occasions prior to the call from the President.  The White House personnel office had been asking me for some time to come back, and I kept telling them no.  And the only reason that I changed my mind was the call from the President himself, in which he said, "I understand that you've been somewhat reluctant to come, but you're my choice, and I would really like you to do it."  And I've often said, well, you can't say no to the President.  So, we went back, and it was important because it is not uncommon for the director of the NSF ultimately be a college president, which had been my dream all along.
Story_ID: 23868
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, you were the director of NSF [National Science Foundation] from '80' [1980] to '82' [1982].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what were some of the issues and duties, well, duties as president at NSF in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a difficult time.  And the biggest issue I had was that shortly after I was confirmed, well, shortly before I was confirmed, actually, Jimmy Carter was defeated by Ronald Reagan.  I was the last Carter appointee to be confirmed by the Senate because they were waiting for Reagan to come on.
Speaker 1: Had you interacted with Ronald Reagan when he was governor of California?
Speaker 2: No.  I had not.  But I had interacted a lot with members of his transition committee.  And I had actually good relations with them, and I think that's the reason that they approved my appointment and I was able to transcend the period from Carter to Reagan.  But I wanted to make sure that I, before I moved my family from Pullman, Washington to Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia], I wanted to make certain that I had the support of the new administration before I would go back to Washington to take the job.  But it was very clear early on that many of the things that I believed in were not necessarily supported by the new administration.  They wanted to eliminate science education, for example, from the budget.  As a matter of fact, they did eliminate it.  So, the biggest issue I had for the two years I was there was getting it restored.  And that occupied a significant part of my time, getting science education restored.
Speaker 1: I guess the philosophy of the administration was that this was something that the public sector ought to fund, science education.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Science education and behavioral and social sciences were on the chopping block.  And the hardest thing that I had to do was to go to the science education director and about 125 people, and tell them that they had just lost their jobs, because I didn't believe in what the administration was doing.   So, with the support of some people in Congress, mainly Ted Kennedy, we were able to get it back on the radar screen in the Congress and ultimately get science education restored, even though the full restoration didn't occur until after I left.  But we laid all the groundwork during that time.  The other thing that was significant during the time I was director was that we were able to establish engineering as a full directorate at NSF.  Up until that time, only the pure sciences had been considered a part of the NSF portfolio, and there had been a long standing desire on the part of the engineering community to be included.  And I think the fact that I am an engineer was important, and during the time I was there we were able to get engineering established.
Story_ID: 23869
Speaker 1: Now, I've interviewed quite a few engineers that seem to have a chip on their shoulder about the difference between the scientist and the engineer.
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: I think the general public has, you know, kind of a mottled understand of what an engineer is.
Speaker 2: Yes, it does.
Speaker 1: Now what, can you address--
Speaker 2: I guess this is another issue that I feel very strongly about.  I blame engineers for doing a poor job of communicating to the public what engineering is all about.  And consequently, engineering ranks very low in prestige in the eyes of the public, even though most of the things that the public applauds are not science, but engineering achievements.  And I say that people generally think of scientific accomplishments and engineering failures.  And the reason for that is that engineers are poor communicators and do a lousy job of expressing what it is that they do.  And engineering has become a stealth profession.  It's hidden from view.  So, and nationally, the National Academy of Engineering, for example, is recognizing that, and is beginning to develop programs that do a better job of communicating the engineering profession and what the engineers do.  The space shuttle, for example, is not a scientific achievement.  It's an amazing engineering achievement, amazing, when you think of the recent landing on Mars.  That's all engineering.  I mean, the scientists had to come up with the information that we needed to have about what you'll encounter in space, you know, in terms of atmosphere and so forth.  But to be able to take a piece of equipment from earth to Mars is all engineering.  It's amazing engineering.
Speaker 1: So, would it be fair to say that science discovers how, you know, certain systems in the natural world work, and the engineer applies them to--
Speaker 2: That's right.  They say scientists discover what it is, engineers develop what never was.  So--
Story_ID: 23870
Speaker 1: Now, were you the first black director of NSF [National Science Foundation]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Walter Massey was number two.
Speaker 1: Or Samuel Massey, was it Samuel or Walter?
Speaker 2: No, Walter.
Speaker 1: Walter.
Speaker 2: Samuel was the professor at the Naval Academy.  Walter Massey was later president of Morehouse.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Okay, alright.  So, now, you were there for two years and then you--
Speaker 2: Became chancellor at the University of Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, you didn't get a chance to go back to Washington State?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they call you back?  Did they try to get you back?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They asked me to interview for the presidency when it opened up, but at that time I was at Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, you were chancellor of the University of Maryland from '82' [1982] to '88' [1988].  And you were also president, right, at some point, right?
Speaker 2: Well, the title changed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was chancellor and then the last year, during the last year I was there, they switched titles.  The system head had been president and he became chancellor, but it's the same job.  They just changed the nomenclature.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How was this--like was the University of Maryland in College Park?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's the flagship campus at the University.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, this is big stuff, you know.  This is, this is big--well, not that a scientist at the NSF [National Science Foundation] is small, but these are all big positions.
Speaker 2: Well, College Park had 38,000 students when I was there.  I used to tell people that the significant thing about my becoming chancellor at College Park was that when I graduated from high school, I could not have  attended College Park because it was segregated at the time.  And so, the university had gone through a major, major change over that period of time.  And I've had a tremendous amount of regard for the University of Maryland.  I feel very blessed that I had an opportunity to lead it for six years.
Story_ID: 23871
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was some of your accomplishments in the six years?
Speaker 2: Well, we diversified the institution significantly in terms of its faculty and student body.  We strengthened its academic programs.  I felt very good about that.  I think we raised its profile in the public mind significantly.  The major problem I had is one that occupied a great deal of my time, and that was the death of Len Bias, the basketball player, which in 1986, for more than a year, I think was about the only thing I had time to deal with in the aftermath of that experience.
Speaker 1: Now, this is an event that rocked the country.
Speaker 2: Yes, it did.
Speaker 1: Here's a young man who died of a drug overdose, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, cocaine overdose.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  A great basketball player.
Speaker 2: Wonderful.  And a wonderful young man.  You know, was it the first time he'd ever had--I can't say it was.  On the other hand, he was anything but a drug user.  He was, he had just received, he had been the number one pick of the Boston Celtics the day before.  He came back to the university and celebrated with his teammates, and somebody gave him some cocaine, and said here take this.  And it was either very high octane cocaine, or whatever you want to call it, and it turned into a heart attack.  It was really a terrible, terrible experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is, I think, I mean I remember it being covered by 'Nightline' and '60 Minutes'--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was on Meet the Press and all that.  I mentioned to you that I used to run track and play baseball.  And one of my dreams as a kid was that I wanted to see my name on the sports page.  Well, I saw my name on the sports page in 1986, and I sure didn't like it.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, when something like this happens, I guess the question they're asking you is what is going on at the University of Maryland and does this reflect the atmosphere on the campus, and are other athletes on drugs and--
Speaker 2: Or, is the university a haven for drugs?  And I ended up appointing two important committees, one headed by former U.S. Attorney General, Benjamin Civiletti, to look at drug usage on the campus, and another to examine our academic expectations for athletes.  And those two reports were very important in terms of laying out the profile for the future of the university.  The difficult time was that I had to fire the athletic director and the basketball coach.  The basketball coach was Lefty Driesell,  who was an icon in Maryland.   And people gave me a lot of grief about the fact that I fired Lefty, but I had concluded very clearly in my mind that Lefty could not continue as the basketball coach.  Even though I liked him personally, I had to make that decision.  I ended up getting death threats and all kinds of things as a result, but it was the right move, in retrospect.  And part of the reasoning of the death threats is that I replaced him with a black coach, Bob Wade, from Baltimore.  And a lot of the old-time Marylanders were unhappy with that.
Speaker 1: Now, I guess they considered that almost as a last straw, or something like that, right?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: I can imagine people--I don't know if anybody who will watch in the future will know the magnitude of big time college basketball in those days, and how, maybe more so now than then, Maryland was really a big time basketball school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  So, it was a tense time.  And I had friends who advised me, you know, don't--you know, because they feared for me--don't fire the coach, you know.  But I had to do it.
Story_ID: 23872
Speaker 1: Now, was his case similar to the recent case of Joe Paterno in terms of not being a part of what happened, but looking the other way and not--
Speaker 2: Well, it was some of that.  But also, I was concerned because there was not the commitment on his part to the students' academic success.  And he had made some statements that were incendiary.  For example, one of the things that he had done earlier, and that I had warned him about, was that one of the, a couple years earlier, one of the black basketball players had been accused of attempting to rape a white female student.  And Lefty had called this young woman up and told her not to press charges.  Well, you can't do that.  So, I had to publicly reprimand him for intervening.  I mean, he just did things like that.  He publicly said that he thought it was okay for students to take, for basketball players to take drugs because that improved their performance.  You know, I mean, just dumb things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I can clearly see, yeah.  Now, when you were there Len Elmore played, right?
Speaker 2: Len had already graduated at that time.  But I got to know him and he served on one of those committees for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Len Elmore, John Lucas.
Speaker 1: John Lucas, right.
Speaker 2: McMillan, John McMillan.   We had some great teams. I'm trying to think of a couple of the other people, but they some wonderful basketball teams.
Speaker 1: That's right.  I mean, College Park was, you'd hear the basketballs bouncing when you'd hear the name--(laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: In the general public, anyway.
Speaker 2: The ACC in those days--the Tobacco Road, Duke [Duke University], North Carolina, North Carolina State, Maryland.  Those were some really, really great basketball teams.
Speaker 1: That's true, that's true.  So, now when you--Len Bias passed away in 1986, so the next two years was consumed by, you know, you say namely by the fallout and all of that?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: The firing of Lefty Driesell, and other things--did you, I mean, when you took the job at Occidental [Occidental College], was it like a breath of fresh air?
Speaker 2: Well, it was.  We had, my wife and I had pretty much concluded that we ultimately wanted to get back to California.  I had been interviewed for the presidency of an Ivy League university, and I hesitated to allow myself to be interviewed for it, because I feared that they only wanted my name to prove that they were looking at a diverse pool, but that they were not serious in terms of their image.  Because at that time, I don't think there had ever been an African-American who was president of a private university in the country.  I mean, there had been public institutions but not a private one.  And so, when I was approached by Occidental, I told them no, because I didn't want to go through that again.  And it wasn't until I said to them--they kept asking me to come out to be interviewed, and I kept saying no.  And it wasn't until they called me and said, "We really want you to come out."  I said, "Look, if Occidental is really interested in me, rather than my going out to the campus to be interviewed, send somebody back here to interview me."  I was still in D.C. [Washington, District of Columbia].  And much to my surprise, they said okay.  And so, they sent the chairman of his search committee, who turned out to be someone who I came to admire a great deal.  He passed away this past year, and I gave a tribute to him at Occidental in June.  But he was instrumental not only in my coming to Occidental, but in really paving the way and supporting me all the time I was here, for the eleven years I was president here.
Speaker 1: Now, did you find that all the public appearances that you had to make during the Len Bias affair, did that help you in terms of other jobs or, you know...  Because it sounds like it may have boosted your profile.
Speaker 2: Well, it did.
Speaker 1: Your comportment and how you handled the situation.
Speaker 2: It did.  I think it had a lot to do with Occidental coming after me.  But more importantly, it taught me a lot about myself.  I had never been, I had never experienced someone showing dislike and hate for me, and I didn't know until I experienced it that I could handle it.  And I learned a lot about myself through that experience, that I could take a lot more than I ever thought that I could.  I could deal with a lot more than I ever thought I could.  And that was an important revelation for me.  And so, yes, I think that it did raise my public profile, and that helped.  But I think maybe more importantly, it helped me understand myself a great deal more.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in a position of leadership like the president of the University of Maryland, and the director of NSF [National Science Foundation], and especially through times of adversity, I mean, what do you look to for inspiration?  I know you mentioned your father being a role model earlier on, but I just wondered, you know, growing up a poor kid in Topeka [Kansas], who do you look to for, well, modeling in terms of how to handle those kinds of situations?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a very good question.  I often read about people who have endured so much more than I ever have.  I'm reading right now, I'm reading a book which talks about the experiences of not only slaves in America, but Native Americans and what they went through, the Trail of Tears and the Cherokee in Georgia and the treatment that they received.  And so, whenever I think about, you know, hard times, I realize that what I go through and what I've gone through is nothing compared to what others have.  And so, you know, I certainly had, my father remains my primary role model.  But in many ways I feel I have a responsibility to my two kids to be as strong as I possibly can be, and to try to provide the kinds of things--so that my son, for example, says when somebody asks him "Who is your role model", he will say "My dad."
Story_ID: 23874
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, well, tell us about Occidental [Occidental College].  What were some of the--we know what the duty is to be the president.  But what were some of the issues on the campus when you came to Occidental, and what did you do?
Speaker 2: I still had a number of issues that needed to be addressed.  First of all, it was not well-recognized for the quality institution, excellent institution that it is.  And part of the reason for that is that the college had a history of not recognizing its relationship to Los Angeles.  What I mean by that is, it almost tried to pretend that it was not in L.A.  And I remember that the press release that announced my coming to Occidental after describing my background, it ended up saying Occidental College is located east of Glendale and west of Pasadena.  Well, I called the guy in the public relations department and I said, "From now on, I want us to say Occidental College is located in the city of Los Angeles, because I want us to be known as a liberal arts college of Los Angeles."  And one of the first things I did was to invite Tom Bradley to come out and have lunch with me.  And my wife and I had lunch with him, and I said to him that, you know, I wanted Occidental to be an institution that supported the City of Los Angeles' activities, and if there was ever anything I could do, I'd be happy to do it.  And much to my surprise, when the Rodney King incident occurred and he asked Warren Christopher to chair the commission to look at the Los Angeles Police Department, Mayor Bradley called me and asked me to serve on that commission.  And so, that was a way in which I, representing Occidental, could make a contribution to the city.  So, building relationships with the City of Los Angeles was very, very important.  The other thing was that the school had failed to recognize that the community around it had changed, that it no longer was a community where it was primarily white and with artsy people, and so forth.  It had become heavily Latino, and the college had not made that transition.  And I said that we need to become the most diverse liberal arts college in America given the demographics and where we are in the future trends.  And I was very proud that a few years later, U.S. News and World Report named us as the most diverse liberal arts college in America.
Story_ID: 23875
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you just pointed out during the break that the founder of Granite Broadcasting was an Occidental [Occidental College] student at one time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now that was before you got there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He may have been there about the time that Obama [President Barack Obama] was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he just missed him or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Or had just left or something before Obama--I think it was close.
Speaker 2: It was close, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So when President Obama was there, it would have been--
Speaker 2: Obama was there in '81' [1981].
Speaker 1: '81' [1981], right.  Okay.  Alright, so you're trying to, you were talking about trying to make Occidental more--
Speaker 2: More multi-cultural and diverse.  I got a lot of resistance from old alumni who wanted to remember it when it was a place where rich kids, or people who thought they were rich, from Pasadena and Glendale and San Marina, went to school.  And they couldn't quite envision kids from South Central Los Angeles and Boyle Heights and those areas, but we made it a better school and that was a wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there eleven years.
Speaker 2: Eleven years, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a particular highlight of that eleven years in terms of--or was it just the growth and development as a community--
Speaker 2: Well, there were a lot of individual highlights.   And I think the important thing was we did a very successful capital campaign and built a lot of new buildings.  And one of the highlights was while I was being interviewed, there was an African-American female faculty member who was on the search committee.  And at one point during a break in the discussions, I turned to her and whispered, "How many African-Americans are on the faculty?"  And she said, "You're looking at 50 percent of them."  And I say if I had to identify one highlight during the time I was there, we hired sixty five tenured and tenure track faculty members, one-half of them were women, and one-half of them were people of color.  And there's not another college or university in the country that can claim that kind of performance.  And it improved the quality of the faculty significantly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a philosophy about how long one should stay a president of a college?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't attach necessarily years to it, but, you know, a ten year run is probably about right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I know we were interviewing other presidents who have a similar philosophy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Some do not, but there are some who do have, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm not a strong believer in long term leadership of any position, because institutions change and they demand different kinds of leadership styles.  I think that the timing for my change was about right.  So, somewhere in that range is probably close to optimum.
Story_ID: 23876
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you left Occidental [Occidental College] in 1999?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you--
Speaker 2: I came here for a year after that.  And while I was here, I was asked to come back to New York to lead the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, NACME.  And you know, almost all of my professional career is in one way or another, formal or informal, I've been devoted to increasing representation in minorities in engineering.  So, that was a great opportunity to lead an organization devoted to that purpose.  NACME is the largest private provider of scholarships for minority students in engineering.  We grew the scholarship program.  We added a pre-college dimension because we needed to get more kids in middle school and high school prepared to enter engineering when they get to college.  Only 4 percent of minority kids graduate from high school with adequate preparation--and that is--there's no way that we're going to be able to build the numbers unless we change that calculus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what kind of pre-college program did you have?  Was it similar to like an Upward Bound Program or something like that?
Speaker 2: We started with two other organizations.  We started with what we call the Academies of Engineering, putting into high schools, taking a large high school, like a 2000 student high school and building within it a 400 student academy which focuses on math and science, with teachers who are prepared to teach the fundamentals and concepts of engineering so that the students, when they graduate from high school, are engineer ready.  And we built a network of academies in engineering with the idea in mind that ultimately there would be 110 of them around the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How many exist today?
Speaker 2: I guess by now there's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty or so, that's progressed with five or six a year, over a period of time.  We'd do more, but I left there three years ago, and we were on that path.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, does this coalition, does NACME interact with the--there's a National Association of Black Engineers, right.
Speaker 2: There's a National Society of Black Engineers.  There's a Society of Hispanic Engineers, there's a Society of Women Engineers.  All of them have relationships with one another.  And NACME is the only full service organization in providing money at the level--most of them are more concerned with socialization of the students on campus, and so forth.  We have NACME chapters here, six chapters here.  But NACME is like I said, the largest private provider of scholarship money for engineering students.
Speaker 1: How is NACME supported?
Speaker 2: By corporations.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Alright.  Okay, so you were there from 2000 until--
Speaker 2: Nine years.
Speaker 1: Nine years.  Okay, 2009.
Story_ID: 23877
Speaker 1: Did you come back here to USC [University of Southern California], when you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you're currently professor of education and engineering for Rossier School of Education and the Viterbi School of Engineering.
Speaker 2: Right, Viterbi.
Speaker 1: Viterbi, okay.  And, also president emeritus of Occidental.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, there are some articles that we had in our kit, around computer ethics, and there are other things that you've like spoken to over the years.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you have a, what's your, are these articles about ethics about ethics in science?
Speaker 2: I think my paper on ethics addresses a number of various athletics, science, computers.  I just talked about the importance of leaders, particularly scientific leaders, understanding that their decisions affect more than just technology, but their decisions have to take into consideration the human component, because there are ethical and moral matters that have to be considered.  For example, it's one thing to say we're going to build a nuclear power plant and go through all the technology necessary to build it, a nuclear power.  But where are you going to put it?  Is it going to affect the neighborhood?  You've got to think about the ethical and moral considerations of all the things you do in technology.  And in the past, that has not been high enough on the priority list.  Technologists have just focused only on the technology.  And I'm saying that you've got to think much more broadly than that when you design things, in terms of what impact is it going to have on society.  Because technology is amoral.  Technology is neither good nor bad, it's how you use it, which is the important thing.
Story_ID: 23878
Speaker 1: I took a note. I can't remember what it was in the context of, but what was the Christopher Commission, what was that?
Speaker 2: The Christopher Commission was the one that Tom Bradley formed to look at the Los Angeles Police Department after the Rodney King incident.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Warren Christopher, who was later Secretary of State under Clinton, chaired it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I intended to kind of follow up on that anyway.  Now, the Rodney King riots in L.A. took place in 1991, I believe?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what's your reflection on that, on the Rodney King riots today?
Speaker 2: Well, it became very clear that the LAPD operated with impunity, and that nobody was really paying attention or punishing the police for their excessive use of force and violence against citizens and mistreatment of citizens.  And the Rodney King incident really brought that to the forefront.  And the Commission that Warren Christopher headed that I had the privilege of serving on was very, very important in terms of making that evident to people, that the LAPD had become uncontrolled and that the leadership of the LAPD had been delinquent in terms of it's commitment to making the police force truly an organization that was here to protect and serve, as it describes itself, rather than being an organization that ran rampant and did more destruction, particularly in minority neighborhoods, than help.
Story_ID: 23879
Speaker 1: Okay.  Also, we mentioned earlier that Art Fletcher, the father of affirmative action, who was a Republican, actually--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was someone that you saw play football in high school, well, in college, rather.  But California here is the home of very well organized attacks on affirmative action.  And I just--
Speaker 2: University of California--and I forgot his name, now--
Speaker 1: Ward Connelley, yeah.  I think that's one right?  Ward Connelley--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ward.  And those actions, Prop 209--and those actions have decimated the University of California in many ways, and has reduced significantly the number of African-American students at those universities in UCLA [University of Cali and at Berkeley, and so forth.  I've been a strong opponent of Prop 209 and trying to point out the impact.  I wrote a piece on "After Affirmative Action", and the impact of things like 209 and the similar propositions up in the state of Washington, and another one in Texas.  Those things have had really negative impacts on, I think, the titles and the CV.
Story_ID: 23880
Speaker 1: Okay, right, right.  Now, do you miss research and engineering?
Speaker 2: Well, I think when I made the transition into administration, I made the right move, because I came to the conclusion that the thing I enjoy more than anything else is helping people achieve their goals, helping to get the resources available to the people, putting the right teams in place.  So, rather than doing the research and development myself, I enjoy building the structure so that the research and development can take place by the people who I think are much more capable than I of doing that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, what courses do you teach in the education department?
Speaker 2: I'm teaching two courses.  One is called Science Technology in Society, which focuses on some of things we were talking about, ethics and so forth, in scientific and technological.  And then I'm teaching a course called The Politics are Different, which addresses some of the critical issues related to multi-culturalism and globalism in the world today.
Story_ID: 23881
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African-American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I certainly hope that it becomes a more cohesive community than it has been in the past.  I have strong hopes that we can improve on the quality of education that African-American children are receiving.  I think it's unfortunate that far too many African-American students are in educational settings where teachers are less well-prepared and less well-motivated to provide them the kind of instruction that they need.   And so, I have strong hopes and aspirations for improved intellectual achievement, educational achievement, for young people.  Certainly I hope to see a stronger focus in the future on building stronger families.  It's interesting, I saw something recently about, we were talking about baseball, and only 8 percent of major league players are African-American as compared to say twenty years ago when there were 27 percent.  And one of the reasons for that, this person said, and I hadn't thought about this, is that too many African-American families are without fathers, and young boys learn baseball from their fathers.  They learn basketball from their peers and they learn football from other sources, but baseball, they learn from their fathers.  And if they don't have a father, they don't get to play on the baseball field.  I hadn't thought about that.  And I think there's something to that.
Speaker 1: You're right.  Baseball is more structured and requires more patience and strategy.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  And you know, playing catch, you're growing up with it when you're kids.  So, it's important.  So, I'm hoping that we can build, rebuild, some of those kinds of things in the future.
Story_ID: 23882
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, when you look back at everything that you've done up to this point in life, is there any major thing that you would do over again, or undo?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There's some things I probably would not do.  I think I took some risks that fortunately paid off, but at my age now, looking back, it sort of scares me.  But I was willing to do--like, I took the position, the first position at NSF [National Science Foundation], before I was assured that my nomination was going to go through the Congress.  And I had already moved my household effects to the east coast, even before the Congress had acted on my nomination.  So, I wouldn't do that if I felt deeply about it.  So, yeah, there are some things that I would have done differently.  And there are some things I would have done better.  You know, I think about my experiences as the college president where I could have done a better job of communicating, could have done a better job of quelling some concerns and so forth.  But all in all, I consider myself as having been blessed, and having had an opportunity to do some things that other people haven't had an opportunity to do.  I feel very fortunate about that.
Story_ID: 23883
Speaker 1: Okay.  Likewise, when you look back at everything, again, what today would you consider to be your accomplishments and your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I think perhaps the most important thing that people can say about me is that I've been consistently fair, and that I have defended the things that I believe strongly in.  I have been a strong proponent of what I refer to as both excellence and equity, believing that there is no excellence without equity, and that quality and equality are not mutually exclusive.  That's sort of my, that was sort of the mantra of my leadership at Occidental.  And when people think about my time at Occidental, that's the first thing that they think about, is that I brought the focus on the importance of both excellence and equity, and that continues to be something which is foremost in the Occidental College mission statement, those words that I introduced, because I believe that that's what higher education in an honorable society has to adopt as its major thrust.  I tell people that when we talk about Harvard [Harvard University] and Yale [Yale University] being excellent institutions, that Harvard was not excellent when Jews couldn't go there, that the University of Georgia and the University of Mississippi and the University of Alabama and all of the southern universities, the University of Maryland, could not claim to be excellent educational institutions when they denied the entry of African-American students.  There is no excellence without equity.  And until such time as we recognize that, we'll still have a long way to go.
Story_ID: 23884
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us something about your family.  Now, you have children, right?
Speaker 2: I have two children.  My son John is a veterinarian in Baltimore [Maryland], and my daughter Jacquelyn is teaching community college in the Hampton Roads area in Virginia.  My wife [Bernice] has a doctorate in educational administration.  Right now, she's just helping me.  I tell people that everything I know about education, I learned from her.  She was a principal and teacher in San Diego and assistant superintendent in the State of Washington.  So, she's had an in-depth experience in education.  So, I'm very proud of my wife and my children, what they've accomplished.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there anything that I haven't talked about that we need to discuss?
Speaker 2: (laughter).  I think we've talked about a little bit of everything.  (laughter).
Story_ID: 23885
Speaker 1: I've only got one last question, you know, formal question.  So, if there's anything else, I'll ask it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I'd just like to be remembered as someone who truly cared about people and who did everything he could to help people live happy and fulfilling lives.
Story_ID: 23886
Speaker 1: Go ahead and tell us about this first one.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of a portion of my family taken in back of our home in Topeka.  My children were young, and that's my small daughter in front with her head down.
Speaker 1: Can you go from left to right, like you're reading?
Speaker 2: Okay.  On the far left is me.  And then my son, John, Jr. and then my daughter, Jacquelyn with her head down.  Standing in the back is my nephew Brian, my sister Sarah's son, my father, Rev. Brooks Slaughter and my mother Dora Reeves, and my wife Ida Bernice Slaughter.  That's a picture of me when I was at the University, no, when I was at Occidental College.  That's a picture of me at Occidental as well, early in my days at Occidental.  That's a picture of me when I was chancellor at the University of Maryland.  That's a picture of the Chesapeake Bay outside of Baltimore when I was sport fishing, with the big blue that I'd caught, in my hand.  I visited Egypt in 1981, and that's a picture leading into one of the tombs.
Speaker 1: Valley of the King?
Speaker 2: Yes.  A picture of me and my wife Ida Bernice Slaughter at a dinner at Occidental College.  That was a picture in about 1999 at the University of Southern California.  I believe that picture was at Occidental College at one of the celebration dinners.  And that's an Occidental College picture as well, at Thorn Hall at the college, behind me.  That picture was taken when I was speaking to a group at the University of Maryland after the Len Bias incident.  I'm not sure of the date of that picture, but I think I was at the National Science Foundation at the time.  That's a program from my inauguration at College Park in May of 1983, and that was the picture of me that accompanied the program.  That's how I looked in 1983.  That's a picture when I was the assistant director at the National Science Foundation visiting the Antarctic continent in 1977.
Speaker 1: Okay. (Unintelligible).
Speaker 2: And here's a picture when I was sworn in as the director of the NSF.  Frank Press, the president's science advisor is on the left and Lewis Branscomb, who was the chairman of the National Science Board.  That's a picture when I was at the White House and Congressman Steny Hoyer of Maryland was introducing me to Ronald Reagan.  That picture was taken in the early 1960's when I was a young engineer at the U.S. Navy Electronics laboratory, when I received the Scientist of the Year Award.  That picture is me with the head of the U.S. Civil Service Commission in about 1961 when he was visiting the Navy Electronics laboratory and I was asked to meet with him.  This is a picture of me signing a treaty, a science treaty with the Japanese at the National Science Foundation when I was director.  And that's a picture in about 1971 or 1972 at the U.S. Navy Electronics laboratory.
Speaker 1: 1972.
Speaker 2: That picture also is at the Naval Electronics laboratory, I'm not sure what year.  That's the pamphlet that describes the excellence and equity program that I established at Occidental College.  This is a picture when I was on a site visit at an atmospheric science experiment in Wyoming in 1981.  I'm sure it was at the University of Maryland, and that picture, I can't remember the exact setting.
Speaker 1: (unintelligible)
Speaker 2: That picture was when I was president and CEO of the National Action Council for Minorities and Engineering in about 2008.  On the left is President John Toll, of the University of Maryland.  He's the gentleman who hired me as the chancellor at College Park, and a picture of my wife and me during my inauguration in 1983.
Speaker 1: Occidental picture.
Speaker 2: And that's at my retirement from Occidental, my wife and I, and pictures of the day and final graduation service in 1999.  And a 1999 Los Angeles and Kline's Magazine picture describing my experience at Occidental. That's another Occidental College alumni magazine, I believe, which describes my period of service for eleven years, from 1998 to 1999.
