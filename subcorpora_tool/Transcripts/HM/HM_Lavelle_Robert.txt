Story_ID: 616174
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Her name is Mary Anderson Lavelle.  She--I know nothing about her mother or father, I heard that her mother and father were killed in a buggy accident in Hopkinsville, Kentucky where she was born.  She was reared, seemingly, by relatives until she met and married Reverend Franklin Pierce Lavelle [Franklin Lavelle].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what is your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was May the 5th, eighteen eighty--'84 [1884].
Speaker 1: Okay, and she was born in Hopkinsville?
Speaker 2: Hopkinsville, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, can you trace her ancestors back very far?
Speaker 2: I've tried and had no--in fact, I've often regretted not asking my mother more questions about her parentage, and for some reason I never did.  But because it was, seemingly, was a painful type of, of situation that happened to her as a young girl and she just never volunteered to talk about it and I never asked.
Speaker 1: How old was she when her parents passed?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She was a child though when they passed (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she, she married when she was sixteen.
Story_ID: 616175
Speaker 1: Well, did your mother [Mary Anderson Lavelle] talk about growing up in Hopkinsville [Kentucky], what it was like?
Speaker 2: No, no, never--my mother died in 1963.  I think it was March 6, somewhere around there, and she was a semi-invalid at the time.  She had lost one of her legs and blood poisoning back when they didn't understand when a bruise would occur, you know, you needed to treat it.  And at the time, we didn't have medical help and this bruise occurred on her foot because of a fall or something.  And she just kept putting Vaseline on it or I'd rub it and everything and the, the foot started deadening and the--when we finally took her to a hospital, doctor wanted to take off part of the foot she wouldn't agree to it.  She--the, the, the deadening disease traveled up her leg until it got up above her knee on her right leg and my sister, Mary [Mary Lavelle Goode], who was four years older than me, dropped out of Peabody High School [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] in order to take care of her mother because we had no nurse; we had no money.  And, and I would lift my mother each day while my sister Mary would bathe her back and all and powder her so she wouldn't get bedsores.  And, all the while, I'm seeing this dead part of this right leg just becoming more and more intense.  And, finally, the doctors we called, they came and they said she's gonna die, and they--but they didn't--we didn't have any hospitalization or anything so she didn't go to the hospital.  And she just stayed there and we continued to treat her as I'm describing, and finally one day, when they had said that she was dying, we thought, well, you know, mother's dying.  What happened the leg started separating, the part that was dead started separating from the other part instead of it traveling farther.  And pretty soon, the raw part of the live was separating from the dead part and pretty soon, there was nothing but bone there.  I could see the bone as I lifted my mother as she was being bathed by my sister and, you know, we, we couldn't--we'd call the doctor whenever we could and they finally came and, and they said, well, they was just couldn't understand why the poisoning hadn't continued to go up.  We didn't understand either, but we did permit mother to go into the hospital and they did saw the bone.  And so they took off that dead limb.  And then she became this semi-invalid and she lived forty years after that almost, on crutches getting around.  And she never--she had these eight children of course, we were all sort of supporting the family.  Each one working where and as we could.  Like all of my schooling is night school, because I had to work during the day, you know, in order to help bring food home to the--and help pay the rent to where we might live and all.  And all of the--my brothers and sister did the same thing.  And so we--I didn't really have a childhood so to speak of playing games after school and all, although, I wanted to.  And many times I remembered praying for snow at night not so I could sled ride the next day but so I could get up early and shovel snow and make some money so I could buy my lunch that day for school.  And, or bring, or some money for, for some items I needed for clothing or to just help at the house.  But that's what that--our family did, and that might be unusual now for a family.  But that's what was happening then after my father died, my mother illness and, therefore, we as children just sort of grew and tried to make out as best we could.  But, what we had more than anything else was, seemingly, the support of community.  People respected that Lavelle family, Reverend Lavelle's [Franklin Lavelle] children.  People expected me to be a good kid, I was a bad kid (laughter) but they, they would get me out of trouble when I'd get in or try to keep me from it, or they would grab me and take me home, you know, when I would just becoming incorrigible so to speak.  Just a regular kid, but everybody was sort of, I felt, minding my business but they were just trying to help those Lavelle kids.  And I never understood that until later what that meant.  And that, I guess, is another part of the story.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, that, that's--you kind of jumped the gun but I'm glad you told the story 'cause you told it--you probably--in a way you probably wouldn't have if I'd a stopped you.
Story_ID: 616176
Speaker 1: So you-- did you ever meet your grandparents on your mother's [Mary Anderson Lavelle] side?
Speaker 2: My mother's side?
Speaker 1: Yeah, were they--had they passed away?
Speaker 2: No, I knew nothing at all, that's what I'm saying.  I--that's the one thing that I fault myself for not having pressed my mother about, you know, for not having asked.  But, it was seemingly what was always on my mind so prevalently was earning a living, you know, making some money so I can bring money in to help the family as well as sustain myself.
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother have a chance to go to school?  Did she go to school?
Speaker 2: My mother, yes, she, she had seemingly high school but we never talked about that either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she was--oh, yeah, she could--she was a educated person.  She wrote well and she--I don't remember her being able to help me with my math I was poor at, but, but I, I just knew my--considered my mother educated.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know what her relatives did that kept her?  Did they--what kind of work (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Her relatives?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, what did they do?
Speaker 2: I knew of no relatives of hers.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I wanna pause tape for one second there.
Speaker 1: I'm glad that you told me.  And they'll be glad too, I mean, they, they're cooperative.  They just didn't know.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, good. I didn't wanna interrupt you but we're, we're back up with the camera now so Larry [Larry Crowe] will continue.
Speaker 1: Okay, no, I was asking--you said your, your mother was raised by relatives after her parents died?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: What did those relatives do for a living (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know.
Speaker 1: You don't, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I never, ever inquired into her background or relationships or anything.
Speaker 1: So you don't know if they lived on a farm or lived in town or you don't know anything?
Speaker 2: My, my--no, my assumption was they lived in town, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I don't remember any living on a farm.
Story_ID: 616177
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your father.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Can you give me your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Franklin Pierce Lavelle [Franklin Lavelle].  He was named for that president that isn't very famous (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, just spell the regular, like the President Franklin Pierce, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.  It's spelled just like that.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Seventeen seventy-seven [1777].
Speaker 1: Eighteen seventy-seven [1877]?
Speaker 2: Eighteen seventy-seven [1877] (laughter).  And he died in 1925.  He was forty-seven when he died.  See if that adds up.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.  Forty-two I guess. Okay, and, well,
Speaker 2: And there's a little bio about him in this book that shows you his picture.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  Yeah, can you--where was your father born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky also.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what do you know about his family?
Speaker 2: I heard that his father was a Kentucky judge, I heard that.  I don't know verification of--his mother was a maid and the home of this Kentucky judge and she was a, sort of a half-breed.  When I say half-breed, she was part Indian [Native American], part black.  And I remember her 'cause I knew her as having high cheekbones and reddish complexion and long, black hair and her name was Stigger, S-T-I-G-G-E-R.  And all I ever knew her by was Grandma Stigger.  She lived with us when we lived in Chicago [Illinois] for a while, and when my mother [Mary Anderson Lavelle] had her eighth child, who was my youngest sister Margaret [Margaret Lavelle Fields], the number of children in the house plus my father's mother made it sort of too much a load for her so my father's sister, Carrie [Carrie Lavelle (ph.)], came from St. Louis [Missouri] to take her mother back to St. Louis with her.  So Grandma Stigger went to live with my Aunt Carrie and I don't know any more about her.
Speaker 1: About how old were you when that happened?
Speaker 2: When that was going on?
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: I was seven.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Just before we came to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 616178
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your father.  What did he do, what was he like, you know?
Speaker 2: My father was a very, very respected minister, Church of God minister.  And he did evangelistic work, by that I mean seems like we were always traveling somewhere for him to go to speak and run conventions like Billy Graham does.  And people would come to and all that, and we would stay there for a while.  And that was the way we lived for, as I recall my early youth when I'm speaking before eight years old.  And my father, when we lived in Chicago [Illinois], we--my father was assistant associate pastor of the Church of God there on South Side of Chicago.  And he had a call to speak in St. Louis [Missouri] at a, a three day conference of this group of people and he went there, and to help his wife be relieved of some of the children and not having to pay for me on the train, under five--I was five, he took me with him from Chicago to St. Louis.  So, after the three days were up of this tent meeting revival, the people were flooding so into the tent and overwhelming it that they decided to hold it on for another week.  And so, I stayed with my dad another week there.  Then the next week it got more and more people kept coming.  And pretty soon they had to get a bigger tent, and they would roll the sides up.  And it's hot in St. Louis in the summertime, and the white people were looking in at these meetings that were going on with my dad preaching.  And I'm there, of course, every night, and during the day whoever would have me, looking out for me, would sort of have me and I'd be sort of bored with that type of setup 'cause there weren't kids or, or anything.  I was just with older people usually, most of the time.  And--but, yet, that went on.  And my dad would call my mother every day, night from St. Louis telling her what was going on.  Chicago is not too far from there, you know.  And so, she would listen, but, finally she told him after we had been there over a month, she said, "Frank [Franklin Lavelle], that boy's gonna be six years old and he needs to start to school.  So, you need to get him back here to go to school, start to school."  And, he says, "Okay, Mary [Mary Anderson Lavelle]," so he--but he didn't.  And the tents kept getting bigger and the people kept more and more people.  And St. Louis was becoming a sort of a, a congenial town of black and whites mingling together because of that particular meetings going on in this tent, by this Reverend Lavelle.  And so, everyone was just eating it up, and including the St. Louis politicians and all, you know, you're the, the black and white, you know, comingling and, and a peaceful city and, and all that.  And so, my dad is sort of, at that point, convinced, well, he's got to sort of stay there for a bit.  So he takes me to--he told my mother he's gonna take me to school, so I said, "Oh, boy, good, I'll go to school."  So it was a big, red brick school, I saw these kids running around and my dad's got me by the hand and I'm pulling away from him to run up to that school.  He said, "No, not that school, son."  I said, "What'd you mean? There's the school."  "Not there."  So we walked on past that school, and we kept walking and pretty soon the pavement ended and dirt road began and, I wonder where we're going.  So, finally, we come to a place where the, the one story, tarpaper, shack and I saw a lot of little kids my size running around out in the yard.  And that was the school my dad was taking me to.  I went with him in there and the teacher, woman teacher, acknowledged him and started recording my name and all.  And I'm pulling on my dad's coattail, "Dad, I don't want to go to this school. I want to go to that school back there."  He just tried to keep me quiet while I kept pulling at his coattail.  And finally, though, I tugged at it so hard because I just couldn't believe that he would not let me go to that other school and was requiring me to go to this school.  And, at that point, my dad sort of got the message and he apologized to the teacher, took me by the hand, took me back to the place where we were staying, called my mother and said, "Have Frank [Frank H. Lavelle]," that's my oldest brother, "meet the train." He's gonna put me on it and send me back to Chicago to start school there.  Which is what happened, I left my dad in St. Louis there and I started to school in Chicago so I never had that type of, of segregated education.
Story_ID: 616179
Speaker 1: Then began the story of this understanding of black and white situation that I hadn't experienced at this point or didn't know anything about, because at five I wasn't aware of just how things were.  I'm just trying to, you know, be a kid playing with everybody else.  In fact, one particular time in Chicago [Illinois] right after that incident I'm saying about there, I'm playing with these kids in Chicago where we lived on the West Side and they're--it's Christmastime and they're calling me out, "Hey, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle], come on out."  You know, "What'd you get for Christmas?"  I wouldn't go out because I had gotten a stocking with an orange in it, a stocking with an orange.  And there they were with their bikes and scooters and clothes, you know, coats and sleds and all that kind of stuff.  "Come on, Bob, come on out," and I wouldn't go out.  And I remember looking at my dad [Franklin Lavelle] and I saw tears in his eyes, and I could see I didn't understand, you know, but I just knew he was so--he felt so badly because he wasn't able to get me more and I wasn't out there with those kids.  I felt badly too, I sort of wondered why I was born to someone who didn't have the money like those other people and why we had to live the way we lived.  And so, I was just very, very upset with my family as well as my situation and I couldn't be an ordinary kid it seemed.
Speaker 2: Now, this is--you're five years old then? This is like 1920, right?
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty [1920], that's right.
Speaker 2: Now this is not--the Depression [Great Depression] hadn't even hit yet.
Speaker 1: There's what?
Speaker 2: There's no depression yet?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  No, this was in Chicago at this point, no depression, and my dad is--but we're getting stuff from the South.  People that we knew in the South, they'd send us bushels of apples and bushels of, of bananas and, you know, all that kind of stuff.  And my dad would take them up to the, to the stores up on the Lake Street.  Lake Street in Chicago was where the sort of minority groups lived, you know, and all the merchants in that area were Middle East people, you know, the Israel people, Israelites and all and the Slavic people and all.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Jewish people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and my dad would take these up to exchange 'em for sugar and meat, you know, or butter and they--and we'd, you know, make, make the exchange and that would be good.  So, this one time my dad made this exchange in this place and he saw as we were leaving, he saw this sign in the window that said, janitor wanted.  So, he looked at it, he said, ah, he took the janitor sign down, took it up to the merchant and said, "I see you need a janitor," said, "I'll take it.  I'm available right now, what, what (unclear) do you want and what's the pay?"  This man looked at my dad and says, "Ah, reverend, you don't want that, that's a job for a nigger."  And my dad said, "Well, I'm colored and I, I need to work, so, just tell me when you want me to work and what the pay is."  "What do you mean you're a nigger?  You're whiter than me."  And, at this time I'm, I'm not paying much attention but I'm looking at that merchant and the veins in his neck were standing out and his--he looked like he's gonna bust because he, he was so mad at my dad.  And I looked at him and I looked at my dad, and he said my dad, my dad's whiter than him.  I said, "Yeah, my dad is whiter than him."  And I'm just trying to figure this out, and looked like he was gonna grab my dad, you know, and actually hit him.  And, my dad took, you know, handed the sign back to him and says, "Come, son, let's go."  And so, we left there and I said, "What's a nigger, dad, what's a nigger?"  Here I am five years old, not having heard the word actually not that it wasn't used, you know, but never heard it, never thought I heard it anyway.  And I'm living among black and white all the while but in totally unaware of any type of racial situation.  Although, I'd gone through that back in St. Louis [Missouri], you know, at that school.  But I didn't recognize what, what, what was happening.  And this is when I saw that the whole impact of the racial situation of this country to sort of hit me, and then I had not only become cognizant of it but realizing how unfair and bad it was, and the necessity to do something about changing it.  And that's been an obsession with me all my life, and I guess that's part of the story.
Speaker 2: So this is like--you were about, what, still five then or were, were you six by then?  Were you six years old by then?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was six years old.  I was starting to school at that point.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In fact, I think I might have already started.  And that was the incident time about the Christmas toys and things.
Story_ID: 616180
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember the name of the school that you started?
Speaker 2: No, that, that's a funny thing.  Fulton comes to mind but I'm not sure that, that was the name.
Speaker 1: That sounds right.  That sounds right. There is a Fulton school [Robert Fulton Elementary School] on the West Side.
Speaker 2: On the West Side of Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, then that's it then.  But I, I remember the address was 2621 Park Avenue in Chicago.  I never will forget that address because mother made sure I remembered that 'cause I had a tendency to stray away, you know, to try to make a reconnaissance of areas (laughter) and might get lost.  You tell 'em where you live, 2621 Park Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, now, you lived in Chicago for how long?  How long were you there?
Speaker 2: Five years, yeah, five years.
Speaker 1: Five years, okay.
Speaker 2: We left there in November of 1923 when we were told we were coming to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  My dad was gonna pastor this Church of God at 309 Paulson Avenue.  It's now the Lincoln Avenue Church of God in East Liberty [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And this church had a parsonage, and we moved into the parsonage there in November of '23 [1923].  And my dad was a type of person that he was--he preached the word but he was also a pastor to people.  He took their problems on himself, you know.  At that time in the early '20s [1920s], a pastor was sort of the reverend, he was the revered person who did everything, knew everything, you know.  If someone was sick, he would go to pray for them to heal them because they couldn't afford a doctor and there were no black--many black doctors or anything.  And so, if anyone needed money, well, then my dad would either go in his pocket or try to help them to find some type of work or to get some (unclear).  Or if it was a domestic situation, differences or anything, my dad would go to placate and separate what the word of God said, pray with people and all that.  And I'd be with him in a lot of those occasions and it would just amaze me that my dad, no matter what people wanted, they called my dad and, or what they needed they'd call my dad and he would be there trying to do it, you know.  So, that went on for a year and a half and in April of 1925, a year and a half after we got there my father died of pneumonia, from overwork, exhaustion, you know, he just--but I remember many times I would be--I'd hear my dad come in.  We never had a car or anything, he'd--but he'd come in at midnight and wherever he had walked to someone's problem or situation, trouble, and I'd hear my mother fussing at him, you know, and saying, "Frank [Franklin Lavelle], you, you just got to get some rest.  You can't--you, after all, you, you can't do everything that you're trying to do."  And he would, you know, placate her, "Yes, Mary [Mary Anderson Lavelle]. Okay," or whatever.  And then one particular night I remember he told her that--the phone rang and he had just gotten in at one o'clock.  I remember it 'cause we were--my room is up above him and I heard him talking on the phone and I couldn't hear what he was saying but then I heard mother say, "Frank, you can't go out of here, you just got in you're, you're sick yourself.  You got to stay here."  And, "I'll be back, Mary."  He left, I heard the front door.  And he went, whatever the situation was.  But that's what I remembered about my dad was, that no matter what the situation, circumstance or condition, he was the ameliorator of it for whatever way he could--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that was that.
Story_ID: 616181
Speaker 1: How did your father [Franklin Lavelle] pass away?  What happened, what happened (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.  We had this call to go home on April the 25th of 1925, and I remembered at the time I was--forgot what grade I was in, fifth or sixth, something like that.  And I was going home and I saw my brother, you know, coming from his class going home and my sister [Mary Lavelle Goode] come from where she was going home, and we'd gotten a call for everybody because my father was dying they said.  And he was home dying, so we all were crowding around his bedstead where he was dying and there was--it seems like there was no one but the family, I don't remember any, any, any doctor or anybody and--but I do remember that my dad was trying to--the reason we were there was he wanted to tell us something.  And he was trying to tell us to make sure that we stuck together, looked out for mother [Mary Anderson Lavelle] and that was it.  His trying to tell us that and so weak and all, and I said, "Oh, dad, you don't need to worry 'bout that, I'll take care of mom," and I'm ten years old.  And I'm saying I'll take care of mom.  My dad even smiled by this guy talking about he's gonna take care of mom.  But then I did try to do that.  And I never will forget that I said that and I also know that, that she lived then on and we did, we, we took care of her.
Speaker 1: Now, so you're, you're ten years old when your father passed.  You were ten years old when your father passed away.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, right.  I was almost ten, I was going on--
Story_ID: 616182
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You've got a sister, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Any other brothers--
Speaker 2: I, I had three sisters.
Speaker 1: Three sisters.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, where do you fall in the order, are you the--
Speaker 2: I'm the sixth, the sixth child.
Speaker 1: Sixth child?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you've got two brothers ahead of you--okay.
Speaker 2: And there was one brother younger than me and one sister younger than me.  But they're all dead now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm the only one still living.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were the baby of the family then?
Speaker 2: I was the sixth of the, the, the two younger than me are both gone.  My, my daughter--my sister who was the baby died last year in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay, so there was seven and you're the next to the youngest?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: There were seven of you, seven brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: There was, there were eight all together.  My brother Richard [Richard Lavelle] died in 1956; he was the first of the children to die.  And then they started dying.
Speaker 1: Well, name all of them for us and we'll--just so we can get them straight.  Could you name all your brothers and sisters for us?
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Starting with the oldest and go
Speaker 2: The oldest was Irene [Irene Lavelle Oden] and she was twenty--she was born in eighteen, 1900 so I could always keep track of her age.  And she died in '77 [1977], so she was seventy-seven years old, all right.  Then there was my brother Frank [Frank H. Lavelle] who was next--he was born in 1906 and he died in 1995, so he was almost ninety.  My brother Richard was the one--the first one to die of cancer in 1956, he was only forty-seven.  My brother Claude [Claude Lavelle] who--well, my sister Mary [Mary Lavelle Goode], rather, my sister Mary was the next one, she was the one that took care of mother [Mary Anderson Lavelle].  She was born in 1911 and she died ten years ago.  My brother Claude was born in 1913. He died 1969 in Philadelphia.  And my brother Ambrose [Ambrose Lavelle] who was a minister, Church of God minister, who died in 1981 and he was born 1918.  And then my sister Margaret [Margaret Lavelle Fields] died just last year, and she was born 1923.  I remember she was born in Chicago [Illinois] just before we came here [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And then I was born in 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so, well, can you describe--now this is a--so it's just--who's at home when your father [Franklin Lavelle] dies?  Who--how many of you are living at home?
Speaker 2: When my father died?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: All except my sister Irene.  Yeah, she was married at that time and living with her husband Reverend Eugene Oden.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had some adult brothers and sisters that were living at home?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes, in fact, my, my brother Frank the oldest had just finished high school and he had a job waiting table in the Rittenhouse restaurant on--in East Liberty [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  It was sort of a fancy restaurant.
Story_ID: 616183
Speaker 1: What side of town did, did you live on?  What did you call your neighborhood?  What was the neighborhood in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] that you lived in called?
Speaker 2: Oh, in East Liberty where we lived?
Speaker 1: You lived in East Liberty?
Speaker 2: Yes, East Liberty.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  We lived on Paulson Avenue and that was--you know where Penn [Avenue] and Frankstown [Road] is?  Most people would know where that is.  That was the heart of East Liberty, and East Liberty at the time had a--it was a sort of a shopping area like the downtown of Pittsburgh.  And they had a department store, Mansmann's Department Store and May Stern department store as well as a lot of churches and, and other type of industries, you know, going.  And the steel mills were pretty prominent in Pittsburgh at the time and so that was the general economic climate I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, I think [HistoryMaker] Rod Doss grew up in Liberty too, right?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Rod Doss of the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier]?
Speaker 2: Rod Doss, Rod Doss?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: He grew up in East Liberty, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, sure.  I knew his mother real well, yeah (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 616184
Speaker 1: We always ask this question and, I mean, with--can you give us an idea of what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds?
Speaker 1: And smells, yes.
Speaker 2: And smells?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: The sights and sounds were mostly the, the night time, the skies lit up with the steel mills when they were operating full and it was just like a fire, you know, everywhere.  And the sounds were usually the usual city sounds of sirens and, and music blaring from jukeboxes and things like that in communities and areas.  And the area of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] was very smoggy and had the--was known as the smoky city at that point because the number of steel mills and the lack of clean coal and that type of stuff.  And, I remember the smog that would occur as a result, and the sinus problems that I had being aggravated by and the atmosphere, generally, though--and, but I was really much aware of the segregation situation.  The lack of respect for and opportunities for black people.  And at that point that's when I'm this dishwasher at the--in this restaurant and Ira Lewis (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, I don't want you to tell that story yet.
Story_ID: 616185
Speaker 1: Can you tell me a little bit about school?  Now, now, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) School? Schools, yeah.
Speaker 1: I know you said you started in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: At Fulton [ph.].
Speaker 2: Right, my--
Speaker 1: And when you moved here, where did you go?
Speaker 2: Moved here, I went to Lincoln School [Lincoln Elementary School] in East Liberty [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And it's still there although it's not the same building.  And that's on Lincoln Avenue and Frankstown Avenue between those two streets.  This Lincoln School is and then I went to high school, Westinghouse Junior High [Westinghouse Junior High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] as well as Westinghouse High School [Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] until the tenth grade when I dropped out to take this dishwasher job during Depression [Great Depression].
Speaker 1: Now, that, that's when your mother [Mary Anderson Lavelle] was sick too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother was still living until--
Speaker 1: And she was sick, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, she was very sick.  Yeah, very sick.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you were telling us that story.  Now, just to talk about school for a minute, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  I played truant quite often. I didn't have anyone to discipline me or to check on me and so, I, many times, I would leave the house and everyone thought I was going--mother thought I was going to school.  She, at that point, was getting on crutches and all.  And she had fixed me a lunch and I would take it and I'd find a couple of other guys and we'd take our lunch and we'd find someplace to go and--behind the billboard down two or three blocks from where we were and we would eat our lunch and maybe we would even play cards, you know, and gamble.
Speaker 1: So this is when you were in high school, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, high school.  That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, my high school years were not productive years for me because at that point I was trying to be an ordinary kid like everybody else instead of being an ordinary kid going to school, I was an ordinary kid that was not going to school as much as I could.  Because I felt that, that was defying the authorities, you know, and showing some I don't want to be this Lavelle, goody boy.  And, but, but that's what caught up with me.  And when I decided that I needed to get my school, my education and I started back to school and went to--had to go to night school, people would see me washing dishes.  Are we ready for that?
Speaker 1: Now, not yet.
Story_ID: 616186
Speaker 1: Now were there any special teachers in grade school that you remember that took particular interest in you or any teachers or people in the community that you admired when you were a little kid growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There were--seems like teachers would take an interest in me but I didn't want them to (laughter) and they would--and at that time my--I just had a very, very difficult time in school.  Well, first off, my mother and dad [Mary Anderson Lavelle and Franklin Lavelle]--remember my middle name Roselle?  That was what they called me, Roselle, you know.  And it's a girl's name, you know, and the kids would therefore call me Rosy [ph.], you know, and all that and laugh at me.  And I, and, and, then so that meant I had to be fighting all the time 'cause I, I resented it and all.  And so that type of thing is what I remembered my junior high days primarily being.  And finally when I started to senior high in ninth grade [at Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], Mr. Ingram [ph.] the teacher had down there, you know, my name Robert Roselle Lavelle [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle].  And he said, "Everyone calls you Roselle."  I said, "Well, you're not gonna call me Roselle," I said, "I just gonna forget about that."  He did, you know, he would call me--so he called me later on during the session he called me, he said, "Robert."  Asked me a question and all, I didn't answer because he didn't say Roselle (laughter), so then he called me Robert two or three times.  But that made me realize, you know, that I needed to make sure my identity as to who I really was and, and what my name was.  And, but my mother and all had just thought that Roselle was so pretty.  And I didn't see where that was germane at all to being a man or for a young person.  But, coming from that area, I mean, in, in that particular bent what was most important to me during those early high school days was not only trying to have it both ways, playing truant and not being in school and trying to still make decent grades at the same time.  And not let my mother know, you know, that I was not being this dutiful child that she thought I was.  And it finally sort of caught up with me and I realized that I needed to get down to business about busting those books.  And that's when I realized I was deficient in a lot of areas, and I realized also that I wasn't proficient in lot of areas.  For example, math has always been very difficult for me and I just didn't have that.  But, yet, it seemed like history courses and stuff like that, ethereal courses or abstract courses, you know, I sort of had a bent for, caught on.  And so, that, that was the area that sort of started bothering me in life.  And, when I was drafted in the [U.S.] Army, they give you those tests.  Mechanical aptitude test as well as just intelligence test, the intelligence test I make 133 what they considered genius type of thing.  Mechanical aptitude, 98 or a 79 or something like that and they said, "What's the matter with this guy?"  So they gave it to me again, and I still made that low mark.  They said, this guy doesn't have mechanical aptitude, and I didn't and that's when I started realizing that I was deficient in that.  But that's also where math was coming in.
Story_ID: 616187
Speaker 1: Let's go back to, to high school [Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] now.  Now, you were in--were you in--you dropped out in the tenth grade and--
Speaker 2: And I kept this job (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) was it primarily to work or--was that why you dropped out?
Speaker 2: Yeah, to work.  Primarily to work.
Speaker 1: And your--you still had brothers and sisters working bringing money in, right, to the house?  Your brothers and sisters were still working too (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, oh, yeah.  Everybody, everybody was still helping out, except that they were helping out when and as they could or would.  And sometimes they wouldn't, you know, like I had one brother who took a job on a bus, as a steward on a bus, transcontinental bus, so he could go to California and stay, which he did.
Speaker 1: And never came back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, I mean, at that time they had--buses had stewards just like a airline had stewards, you know.  The person to bring the people a pillow, you know, and see to it that they had the rest stops for (unclear) and then so the people would take those kind of jobs just to get tips 'cause they didn't pay any money, and to get somewhere else where they wanted to go.  And so, he went to California.  So this one brother went to California and stayed there, so at that point we lose that income on the house.  And we had this other brother, younger brother [Ambrose Lavelle], who decided he was gonna go to school and he couldn't afford to bring money home because he had to go to school, so he left home to go to school and he did, this younger brother.  And pretty soon there was not many people at home to help at home, and I'm this guy trying to still help at home and still trying to not do.
Speaker 1: Now, what did your mother [Mary Anderson Lavelle] think about your dropping out, did she--
Speaker 2: Oh, she, she thought it was awful.  Oh, yeah, she just said, "Bobby [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle], you can't do this, you know, you have to--." I said, "Mom, I gotta bring this--gotta make this money."  But at the same time I knew that my grades were bad and I didn't wanna tell her that, and I didn't want her to know that I was playing hooky.  And so, I dropped out and mother would sort of look at me disapprovingly about that but never, ever putting me down, you know, always--she sort of depended on me, needed me.  And, she loved me and she knew that I loved her but, yet, that was always a area that just no one could seemingly change me about and I had dropped out.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now it's time to talk about a dishwashing job.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, how did you get that job and--
Speaker 2: How'd you get that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Mr. Jeffries [ph.] was a black man who was a friend of the family and he was also the head of the janitors at Boggs and Buhl Department Store [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and they, Boggs and Buhl had this restaurant that needed a dishwasher.  And so, he told me about this dishwashing job when he knew that I'd dropped out of school.  And I went and applied for it and of course I got it, ten dollars a week.  So I would bring that money home.  People would look at me, I didn't even know these people.  They'd say, "Hey, Lavelle, you can't wash dishes all your life. You better go back to school."  And I'd say, "What's it to you?  I gotta make this money."  And I just kept that up.  But I was still aware of the fact that I had to go back to school so I did and that's when I finished night school, high school at night while I was in that dishwashing job in Boggs and Buhl Department Store.
Speaker 1: Now, how do you spell the name of the store?  How do you spell the name of the store?
Speaker 2: Boggs, B-O-G-G-S and Buhl, B-U-H-L Department Store.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were on the north side of Federal Street. Now, it's a housing project.
Story_ID: 616188
Speaker 1: How long were you there before you went back to school, start going to night school?
Speaker 2: I was--I worked there [Boggs and Buhl Department Store, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] for two years and I finished high school while I was working there.  And, Ira Lewis, president of the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] whose daughter I'm playing with, and they lived a block away from us out in Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And he's taking me for rides, you know, with his family and he--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were dating his daughter?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  We were only ten and twelve (laughter), thirteen, fourteen, yeah.
Speaker 1: Thirteen, fourteen, okay.
Speaker 2: That's right, thirteen, fourteen that's what it was.  But, but sort of dating, yeah.  But, you know, kids weren't dating then they were just playing together.  But, anyway, Ira Lewis knew that I liked his daughter Jane [Jane Lewis Woodson] and played with her.  He knew his daughter Jane liked me, and so he also was keeping tab of me going to night school.  So, when he heard that I had graduated from Schenley night school [Schenley High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], that's when he said, "How would you like to work for the Courier?"  "Boy, would I?  Oh, man, yeah."  I didn't ask him what he wanted me to do, just let me work there.  So, when I went there, he gave me this job as general flunky so to speak where you just do anything that you're told, and it was a lot to be done.  And so that's what happened.  And, but there I saw black people controlling their lives and that meant everything to me.  And it also meant so much to me to be working for a place where I felt I could progress, that I could go up and that gave me the incentive to say, "Let me continue my education, you know, not just high school."  And so, I see the Courier has white people keeping their books but they had black people everywhere else, you know, and that's what impressed me.  You know, even--they had a couple of white linotypists but most of the linotypists were black, the (unclear) were black, engravers were black, and circulation and advertising all black.  And I was just so pleased, it was just a scattering people like that.  The writers and all were all black and so I was just so thankful to be there working with people, you know, where I could become like them.
Speaker 1: Now, how old are you at this point?  Are you-- what are you?
Speaker 2: At that point?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Seventeen.
Speaker 1: Seventeen, okay.
Speaker 2: No, eighteen, I guess, yeah, eighteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In fact, I'll get it straight.  I started working in September of 1935. I was nineteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 616189
Speaker 1: First day I worked there, that night Joe Louis was fighting Max Baer, and I don't know if you remember that fight or not but Joe Louis knocked out Max Baer.  Well, here I am working at the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier] and at that point I'm mailing papers, you know, wrapping papers to send to the places in California and Chicago [Illinois] and Miami [Florida], and New York, everywhere.  'Cause the Courier had those different editions where they sent a newspaper that had the edition of the area where it was going with the front page news from that area, but the rest of the interior, you know, was all the national news and all.  And so, with these editions that we had, well, my job working at the Courier that first day was wrapping those papers and wrapping the papers, putting a label on them to send them to those places.  When I was putting a label on, I saw that the label told where the--how to get there, those places.  And they would go by railroad baggage route, you know, Pennsylvania Railroad, for example, to Washington, D.C., Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac [Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad], RF and P to Richmond [Virginia] from Washington and then Atlantic Coast Line [Atlantic Coast Line Railroad] to Florida, you know, that type of thing.  I started being intrigued with those labels I'm putting on, trying to figure out how they figured out how to get there.  And I realized that the guy that does that isn't around any, you know, anymore.  And so, we're having these calls at that, that particular night we were run these papers because Joe Louis knocked out Max Baer and Ches Washington [Chester L. Washington] is up there with Bill Nunn [Bill Nunn, Sr.]and they're flying back saying hold the presses, you know, just keep, keep rolling because we got the pictures of Max Baer, you know, stretched out and the Courier had Max Baer stretched out on the front page and I'm routing these papers to all these different places.  And people were calling from places and I didn't have a train route for, you know, so I'm looking up how to get that, that papers to those people.  And you're on the telephone and I'm all night answering the telephone because I'm on this, you know, wrapping these papers and the press are rolling and the editorial staff and everybody is gone, you know, they're, they're home sleeping.  And here we are rolling those papers and I'm getting these calls from people saying, "Send papers here, send papers there, send papers to other places," and I'm writing all that down.  I say, "How do I get it there?  How do I get it there?"  Well, that's when I started looking up those railroad charts and I started routing those, those papers to those places and putting them on the mimeograph machine that they had, you know, I could type and I'd put them on a mimeograph machine, put those labels on.  But I'm doing that all the first day at the Courier that I worked there, and I'm just seeing a need and trying to fill it and doing it.  Everyone was impressed.  And, of course, I worked twenty-seven hours the first day there.
Speaker 2: Twenty-seven hours?
Speaker 1: Twenty-seven hours.  We--before Vann came in, Mr. Vann,
Speaker 2: Robert L. Vann [Robert Lee Vann]?
Speaker 1: That's right, Robert L. Vann saw us and he realized that we had been working all night, and he was so pleased and he told Ira Lewis to send us over to the Y, stop the press, send them over to Y and he called over to the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] and they blocked some rooms out for us.  And all of us went over and went to bed for four hours and then they woke us up.  Go back, start those presses rolling (laughter), four hours sleep and we were rolling the presses again.  I worked eighty hours that first week, eighty hours, I'll never forget it.  And, didn't matter to me I wasn't getting home even, you know.  I'd call my mother [Mary Anderson Lavelle] and tell her, I can't (laughter)--and she understood, so--but, but when it's that eighty hours, when I got my pay it was ten dollars.  Yeah, ten dollars for the week.  Yeah, and Ira Lewis would count out five dollars and five ones.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Now this was the same thing you were making washing dishes.
Speaker 1: That's right, same thing.
Speaker 2: Ten dollars a week.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that was all right with me.  I'm working for black people now, you know.  (Laughter) Yeah, that's all right.  I understood, and the longer that I--and that's all right, black people.  But, I, I'm, I'm going, I'm leaving there with this dollar, with this ten dollars, you know.  Worked hard for it.
Story_ID: 616190
Speaker 1: And there's Daisy Lampkin.  You ever hear that name?  Daisy Lampkin was the vice president of the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] as well as first vice president of the national NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  She's sitting outside Ira Lewis' office.  Said to me, "Young man, give me a dollar."  I said, "Give you a dollar?  Ten percent of what I worked all week to earn, what for?"  "NAACP."  I said, "NAACP that, that's an all right organization but you'll never get my ten dollar--my, my dollar."  I worked--and I was about to leave.  "Just a minute, young man."  She said, "What you're saying is that you're better than the Scottsboro Boys, huh?"  Scottsboro Boys, I knew all about them.  They're on the front page and they're sentenced to death and everything.  And I'm saying, "No, I'm not better than them."  She said, "Well, that's what your dollar is gonna help try to get them free because NAACP is doing it, no one else."  She got the, she got the dollar and (laughter) I became this avowed NAACP person at that point.  Became a fundraiser for it, you know, got subscriptions for it, and new members for it.  And became first vice president of it and on the news all the time because of, you know, all this type of stuff because of Daisy Lampkin saying, you're not better than the Scottsboro Boys.  (Laughter) Yeah, but that type of thing though is what--it'll hit you at, at, at times of, of most impressionable times and you can't escape it.
Speaker 2: So did you become a member of the NAACP in your youth?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I'm a life member and I've gotten other--all my family's life members and everything.  Sure, I was first vice president of the NAACP when the riots were going on, you know, when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed and I'm this guy trying to quell the riots and, and I'm being threatened too because I don't have a dashiki and have this coat and tie.  (Laughter) Gonna blow me up too.  (Unclear). On yeah, you're the same as whitey, you know. (Laughter) So, it was just, just, it just and interesting period.
Story_ID: 616191
Speaker 1: So, the very first day you were able to improve the way they mailed the newspapers out?
Speaker 2: I didn't exactly improve it, I just learned how they did it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then was able to use it for these new places that were calling and we didn't--I didn't know how to get them there but I utilized the train traffic system of maps that we had in order to figure out this railroad will take this there and this railroad will take it there.
Speaker 1: Oh, to the people that wanted the paper that, that you hadn't established a route for yet?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, those who were calling up about the fight.
Speaker 2: I start figuring out how to get the paper to them by this baggage routes, you know, they--the--we wrapped these papers and put the label on it, and the train people would read those labels, throw them off here.  Those people read the labels, put them on the train going to that place, those people read the labels, throw them off at the destination.  The people at the destination come and get them, and that's the how the distribution of the newspapers occurred.  And I learned all that the first night--the first day I'm working for the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier] is how to do that and it was just amazing.  But that's a phenomenal situation that sometimes you rise to meet occasions and you don't know why or how but you just do, and so I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're like--you were thirty-five years old?  No, I'm sorry, it was 1935, right?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-five [1935].
Speaker 1: And you're nineteen?
Speaker 2: That's right, I'm nineteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, 1935, okay.
Story_ID: 616192
Speaker 1: As you were telling me when we came in, we were discussing all the different jobs you did at, at the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause there're a lot of things to do and you had to just a kind of a general description to do a lot of things, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, just tell us some of the things that you--that, that Mr. Lewis [Ira Lewis] had you do?
Speaker 2: Well, the main thing that he had me do was be available for wherever he wanted me to go to take or to--at that time they didn't have fax machines, they didn't have any way of transporting information, you know, except by mail.  And so, if you could send anything by messenger, well then you, you had a quick way of getting it.  I became the Courier messenger guy.  No matter what it is that was needed, if we had to transfer money from one bank to another, you know, because we didn't have enough funds in one, one account in order to cover our expenses well then I could run the money from this bank where we did have the funds to the bank where we needed funds, and therefore make sure that we had funds there.  But that was before they had electronic funds transfer and all that, you know. You actually had to have the money in the bank.  But that was back in 1935, don't forget.  So that was one of the main things that I did, was make sure that the, the Courier would use me and, and I would drive Mr. Lewis' car.  And he had a Lincoln Zephyr by the way.  You ever hear of a Lincoln (laughter)?  Oh, man, I, I would drive that Lincoln Zephyr, that was great.  People thought that was my car (laughter). But, but--and, and I would take it and make these transfers, you know, this money to these different places.  And, in addition, there might be other legal matters to be taken.  Like, Vann [Robert Lee Vann] might have some legal stuff and all that, and I'd be the guy to run that.  "Lavelle [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle], you know, take this to the court."  In return, Mr. Lewis and Mr. Vann, when Henry Armstrong the fighter that had the three titles at one time, he was fighting at Hickey Park [Millvale, Pennsylvania] one night and Vann and Lewis both wanted to hear him--wanted to see him and so they had me drive them and--in the Zephyr, okay, and so the three of us--the Zephyr is a two seater but the three of us are sitting in the front seat.  I'm driving, you know, Lewis and Vann and we're going to see Henry Armstrong.  And I got to see him knock out this guy at Hickey Park that night with Ira Lewis and, and Vann.  And, so I'm this guy, this sort of important guy but at the same time I'm sort of the general flunky, you know, the guy just to be available to do whatever is needed to be done and I did it.  But, by the same token, anytime Nat King Cole would come, for example, he would stop by the Courier for whatever and I would get to take him somewhere.  But, as I said, Joe Louis would come and that was a great thing for me to be able to take him and all.  But I got to know these people myself and they got to know me, and they sort of thought I was a pretty important guy because I was the guy that the, the Courier entrusted them to, you know, for me to make sure that they got where they wanted to go or did what they wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Well, that was a--that's really fortuitous that you--I mean, what it looks like you got two older black men are mentoring you and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and you get chance to--they're the most successful--two of the most successful in the city.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: And you have to--and you spend all day with them.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  And, and he's the attorney general, assistant attorney general in, in Roosevelt's [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] cabinet even, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Robert L. Vann, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Robert L. Vann.  In fact, he, he would drive down to Washington [D.C.] sometimes and spend a week, you know, or so and then he'd come back.  And one time when he's coming back from there, he was driving his car, his--he had a Packard at that, that particular time, and he passed a car on a hill and the car turned over and head on crash and he was in the hospital for weeks and very, very, very sick.  And, I'm this guy having to go to the hospital with documents for him, you know, and stuff and everything for him to be able to sign and then to discuss with whatever and all that.  So, I, I'm just this intermediary in all kinds of situations with people who--and they're also my friends, you know.  Adah Moore [Adah Moore Lavelle], this young girl that comes to work at the Courier (laughter) she's nice looking, you know, young woman, you know, and she, she sort of looks at me and I looked at her.  But all the young girls that came to the Courier, you know, I'd take them out, whatever.  But this particular one was--turned out to be the nicest one I knew and so I just end up marrying her, because we worked at the Courier.  But that's another story about how that happened because I--
Story_ID: 616193
Speaker 1: Well, I just wanna ask you about some of these celebrities.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was--is, is there any particular story about Joe Louis that you wanna tell us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Joe Louis, he would--he just had so much money, you know, he had a bankroll.  I never saw so much, it just made me mad seeing him hand out ten, five, ten dollar bills, you know, to people because he, he wasn't used to all that money either, you know.  Like, on his first fight he made forty-four thousand dollars.  He said, "Is it that much money in the world?"  (Laughter) That's back in 1935, you know, and so he--but there he is--and, of course, he's handing me money too, you know.  And, and I'm in this seat, this convertible driving him to West Virginia where he's gonna referee one of the bouts and we're driving along he and I just, and you know I'm having a good time but people started noticing him in this convertible, you know, open car.  Joe Louis.  Cars were turning around on the highway trying to catch up with us, you know, and, boy, you just--practically boxing us in, you know, trying to get a look at Joe Louis and trying to get him to stop and sign autographs and all that.  And, Joe--I, I said, "Joe, should we stop?"  "Naw, don't stop, keep on going."  So, we, we'd keep on going.  But, then when we go to the place where he was gonna referee this fight in Wheeling, West Virginia, which he did.  And we left there, we went to a night spot and of course all the girls were--good looking girls, chorus girls and all that, they were all swarming around, you know, he was just handing out five and ten dollar bills to all of them.  And, and I'd just say, boy, that guy--said, he, he just didn't know what to do with money.  And he died sort of a pauper, you know, as you know.  And it just hurt me to see him having done what he did with his money that he had and to not have--because he, he, he considered me his friend.  And I was his friend.  And I would try to tell him, Joe, you know, you ought to do this, that and the other, but what can you say to a guy that's on the top of the world, you know.  He, he ain't listening to me but he appreciated the fact that I had the interest, and I knew it.  And we just knew we were friends.  But, yet, I, I couldn't make any--I couldn't tell him to save his money (laughter) and think he'll do it.
Story_ID: 616194
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you mentioned people like Nat King Cole, Cab Calloway, other people who would come into town (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Nat King Cole, I never got to know.  I wanted to know him real well because my wife [Adah Moore Lavelle] just loved him.  Oh, he had a trio, the Nat King Cole Trio and my wife would buy the records, you know, and all that.  And she just loved him and his silky voice that he had and all that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yea, now, you said you met George--
Speaker 2: And Billy Eckstine.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Billy Eckstine is a friend of mine.  We used to play hooky together from high school.
Speaker 1: Oh, you knew him from high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in high school.  Our families were friends.  Billy Eckstine.  And he lived out on, on a street in East Liberty [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] there, and he went to Peabody [Peabody High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and I went to Westinghouse [Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And, yet, we were--he would call to tell my teacher that my mother [Mary Anderson Lavelle] was sick and, and I needed to go home.  And everyone knew my mother was sick so I would leave, you know, the building to go home and he'd be out there waiting for me, you know (unclear).  He'd say come on, man, let's go (laughter) so, he and I would--we would go to some, some movie or something in the afternoon and all.  But, Billy Eckstine--and we were really close friends.  And, and sometimes at the parties when we would go to--and Billy would sing, you know, he'd sing, play the piano and sing.  We'd say, "Ah, Billy, why don't you shut up, man?"  We were trying to shut up this guy who became this celebrity that we were paying to hear and here we were not recognizing in him.  But that's kids for you.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now you met J.A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers] and George Schuyler?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: What were those guys like?  Now, these are like--
Speaker 2: I never got to know them real well except on one occasion I had to take Schuyler down to, to the train and he was just, you know, I was talking about how I was very impressed with his knowledge of things, you know.  And he, he liked all of that, and then I was very much impressed with--and I'm not saying I always agreed with but I, but I was solely impressed with--and, but, but, yeah, the others that I would, would have occasion to meet except for Mrs. Bethune [Mary McLeod Bethune], you know, I told you about the incident with her in California and all.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us again 'cause you told me downstairs, so tell, tell us about
Speaker 2: Say, what?
Speaker 1: Tell us about it now, 'cause you told me downstairs about that.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, okay, okay.  Mrs. Bethune became the first ambassador to the United Nations for the United States when the United Nations was formed after World War II [WWII].  And that was in San Francisco [California] and she was in San Francisco, and for some reason she was over at the camp site, camp night where I was stationed.  And I don't remember what that was but the colonel was so impressed with this high United Nations dignitary, you know, that he was of course chauffeuring her around and she, she saw me, "Ah, it's Mr. Lavelle [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle]!"  You know.  And so--and the colonel, boy, he's Mr. Lavelle, you know, here I am. I'm a Lieutenant Lavelle, of course, you know, but, but the colonel, he don't pay no attention to me but Miss Bethune knowing me and he's catering to her because she's a Washington [D.C.] ambassador, you know.  And she, and she's, boy, and he was really, really impressed.  But that's, but that's, really what that type of thing and Joe Louis coming to the same camp.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, you had a similar story with Joe Louis, right, when you were in the [U.S. military] service?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right.  At the same camp.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but--and that's what made me--I, I was the most important guy in that camp.  You know, this guy that knew these dignitaries, you know, and people who respected him, you know.  And here he is this second lieutenant, you know.  Here we are just, you know, just maybe not even saluting him at the time.  (Laughter) But that was one of the things that--but, and helped me socially in the area where I was with the people that I say mingled with after--when I was off duty in San Francisco.  And there, Cecil Poole [Cecil F. Poole] was one of them.  You probably don't know that name, he was a, a attorney, assistant attorney general for, for--in California or somewhere.  But, Attorney Cecil Poole, P-O-O-L-E.  His parents lived here--his parents were undertakers here and he was a--became a famous lawyer.  He died early as a young, young lawyer though.
Story_ID: 616195
Speaker 1: You worked for the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier] for I guess five years before you were drafted?  Five or six years, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was drafted in 1943.
Speaker 1: Oh, '43 [1943] okay.
Speaker 2: I worked--I, I started work in '35 [1935], eight years.
Speaker 1: Eight years, okay.
Speaker 2: I was eight years and at that time I'd been in Pitt school at night for four years at night.  I started in '39 [1939].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, from--
Speaker 1: So, Pitt graduate school, or Pitt, well, University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And you were going--you were trying to get a degree in accounting at that time?  Were you working on a degree in accounting at the University of Pittsburgh?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I was working on a bachelor's of science degree with accounting major, which I obtained when I returned from the [U.S. military] service in 1951.  I obtained that--started in '39 [1939] and was four years in service.  I--that was eight years or so.  How long?  Eleven years.  I can't count (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, you said you, you came out of the service--you served in the service for four years?
Speaker 2: I came out of the service in '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: Forty-six [1946], okay.
Speaker 2: September '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I went in, went in service--
Speaker 1: And then you went back to--
Speaker 2: --in March of '43 [1943] so I was three and a half years in service.
Speaker 1: Okay, then you went back to school and finished at University of Pittsburgh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, then I went back to school, that's right.  I went back to Pitt at night to, to complete my degree, my, my bachelor's degree in '51 [1951] and then went back for my master's degree in '54 [1954].
Story_ID: 616196
Speaker 1: Now, you met your wife at the, at the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier] too?  Adah Moore [Adah Moore Lavelle], right?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: You met your wife at the Courier too?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm glad--that, that's right.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that, yeah?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) People would always say that Bob Lavelle [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle] takes all the new girls out that come and so when she came to work at the, at the Courier, well, I didn't take her out right away.  I, I just, I saw her but I sort of knew her because I knew her family; we traveled in the same social circles, you know.  But I didn't pay any attention to her because I considered her such a young girl, she was five years younger than me.  And at the time I liked a girl who was a friend of hers who was three years older than she, but that I liked, you know, very much.  And so I had these five girls that I liked that I was going to see.  In those days, you didn't shack up with girls or anything like that. You just, you know, you, you went, you, you dated and all that kind of thing.  And you exchanged dates, you know, with fellows and all that.  But--and so, I was going to see these five different girls but I knew I was getting older and I said, it's time for me to start getting married.  So I made up--I was taking these accounting courses [at the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] so I made up these T accounts, put the names of these five girls on top of the account and then I put debits and credits, you know.  And, and, and, and, you know, and these debits would be, is she truthful, is she clean, is she, is she timely, you know, is she--her personality, you know, does she do this, that and the other?  And all those different things I had as virtues and vices, you know.  So, I'm putting these things down for these five girls I knew because I'm trying to (unclear) them and the one that I hoped to win wasn't winning, this one that made my heart flip every time this friend of Adah's but, Adah, the one I married, the one I worked around all the time, she's the one that has these virtues that I most wanted, most liked, you know, most admired.  And, yet, wasn't paying much attention to because the other girl I thought was prettier, you know, and all that kind of stuff.  And made my heart turn over.  But, but, but yet I noticed that this Adah, she was sort of liking me and she was sort of letting me know that, and I was sort of, okay, that's nice.  But I would take her out and take her home sometime, I had a car by then and I would take her home.  And, so I'd finally made up these T accounts and come up with her name as being the one I'm gonna ask to marry me which I did.  And, of course, she accepted.  And, in 1942 we got married, July 25th, 1942.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And at the wedding were Ira Lewis and Robert Vann [Robert Lee Vann] and their wives and--I'm sorry, Vann was--Vann had died in '40 [1940].  Vann's wife [Jessie Matthews Vann] was there, Mrs. Vann 'cause she had a rehearsal dinner for us.
Speaker 1: Now, did Mr. Vann ever recover from that accident?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he recovered from the accident but he died of cancer in 1940.  He had this cancer diagnosis around 1938 and then he had the operation that--where he had a colostomy I think, you know, put in and he, seemingly, got along all right with that for six months or so but then he, he was never able to make it and he died from it in 1940.  And I was one of the pallbearers in his funeral, and we were--we had full dressed outfits on all of us pallbearers, you know.  Was really a pretty big funeral, 1940.
Story_ID: 616197
Speaker 1: By the time that you're drafted, what position did you hold at the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier]?
Speaker 2: In 1943, I was at that time working in the accounting department, having taken accounting on my own.  I didn't tell you that story.  I asked the Courier to send me to Pitt [University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] to take accounting because I saw these white accountants and all the rest of the people were black.  And I told Mr. Lewis [Ira Lewis] that I think that Pitt ought to send me to Pitt--I mean, the Courier ought to send me to Pitt to take accounting, and so that I can be their accountant, you know, you need to have a black accountant.  Mr. Lewis thought it was a good idea, he said, "I'll talk to Mr. Vann [Robert Lee Vann] about it."  He talked to Mr. Vann about it and he didn't say anything to me.  And I said, "What did Mr. Vann say?"  He said, "Mr. Vann said that you were more important in a general capacity than that, therefore, he wouldn't do it."  I said, "General capacity?"  That means he'd keep me around to run errands for him and do all these things and whatever, whatever, whatever.  But I said, "I can't be this, this specialist [sic.]."  He said, "Besides, Mr. Vann said that you'd be able to, to name your salary."  I said, "Suppose I'm your accountant and I sign as your indentured servant to work for you for whatever amount you will pay me because you have paid me for my education?  What about that?"  He took that to Vann.  And Vann still said no, general capacity is better for me.  That's when I decided I was gonna go to Pitt on my own and that's when I told my mother [Mary Anderson Lavelle] what was going on, why I wanted--I needed this money to go to Pitt.  Didn't have any money.  She had two industrial insurance policies on me, Metropolitan Life [Metropolitan Life Insurance Company].  She paid twenty-five cents a week for each one, and each one was worth five hundred dollars if I died, when I died.  They--one of those--my mother said, when I told her about that, I said, "I just need some money so I can start."  I said, "And the tuition, the ten dollars a credit, I said, I need to take accounting.  I need to take freshman English, that would be fifty dollars and so I need about twenty-five dollars for books.  I need about seventy-five dollars and I need to be able to get that, I don't know where."  So, she gave me one of those policies and she said, "See what they're worth."  So we talked to the insurance agent who came around to collect the twenty-five cents each week.  He says, "Well, seventy-five dollar cash value."  I gave it to him, he gave me seventy-five dollars.  I started to Pitt.  Okay.  And that's how I started.  But, another thing which is another story.  Pitt wouldn't let me in, in a degree status because my high school record wasn't good.  And I said, yeah, but here's my money, don't worry about it, you know, I'm gonna--. Oh, no.  You can't--that, that really made me mad but they stuck to it.  But that--I'm doing a, an article for Pitt, the University of Pittsburgh right now about this very story.  'Cause they stuck to that and then they--while they would admit me general capacity but not as a, a degree student unless I made up those grades.  So I went and took remedial courses at the same time I was taking other courses and back just night school plus, plus, plus, in order to make up for that.  And I did make up, and Pitt admitted me in degree status, and I paid my way.  But that was what made me so mad at Pitt, angry with Pitt and everything else.  But at the same time it made me respect Pitt and recognize that Pitt is a real school of academic excellence not just a school with the big urban university.  And so, I was able to get that degree, you know, by having paid my way all those years until I got the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] going for me after coming back from the [U.S. military] service, you know.  I was in Pitt from '39 [1939] to '43 [1943], drafted in the service, when I came back from the service in '47 [1947], I went back to Pitt but then I had the G.I Bill going so I didn't have to worry about it.  So then I started taking twelve and fourteen credits at night, still night, while I worked at the Courier during the day.  And that's how I finished University of Pittsburgh bachelor's [degree], '51 [1951].  And that's when I decided, since I still had G.I. Bill time going, to continue on and get a master's [degree] which I did.  And I got the master's in business administration and accounting and all, you know.  And I was--that sort of helped.  And, at that point, I still had some credits from the G.I. Bill, and so I started to work on this degree, (laughter) Ph.D.  My wife [Adah Moore Lavelle] said, "Enough is enough."  She said, without me at night all these years, you know, helping me, keeping the kids quiet and whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.  And I said, yeah, she's right.  And she had really put up with an awful lot, and so I just said I, I got enough degrees.  And so, I didn't, I didn't pursue that.  But that was another aspect of what my wife has meant and been, been to me all these years.  Is how she has been in the sort of background in that regard, while I was out there sloughing and trying to make it and she--but that's one of the virtues that in the T accounts that I (laughter), I didn't realize.  So, you can see how the Lord has been guiding my life even when I didn't know it and didn't deserve it and anything else.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were you going to church all this time?
Speaker 2: Going to?
Speaker 1: Were you going to church?
Speaker 2: Church?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes and no, I, I, I became an agnostic even.  I wasn't gonna give God credit for all the things I'm doing.  After all, you know, I'm doing these things, I'm making all these things and all that.
Story_ID: 616198
Speaker 1: But that's when it finally came to me and my mother's [Mary Anderson Lavelle] still living, at this point, and she's this person I'm--I have her power of attorney, I'm taking care of her, you know, she's semi-invalid and all.  And I'm paying her bills and picking up her laundry and--she wouldn't live with me.  I built a new home and I built a place for her, you know, to be able to stay and she wouldn't.  "No," she said Adah [Adah Moore Lavelle], she loved my, my wife but she said, "Adah, Adah doesn't need a mother-in-law in the house with her."  'Cause she had her mother-in-law.  I do remember those days and all that, so she just wouldn't.  But Adah loved her too, you know, so they, they got along well together.  But she, she wouldn't come and live with us, but then--but she would always say to me when I would come, and in one time particularly we had been broken into the night before and about the fourteenth or fifteenth break-in, and I didn't put--I wouldn't put an iron grill all around the building or anything because I said that this is my community, I trust these people, I can't shut them out with an iron grill, you know.  I'm, I'm not gonna protect these windows.  Well, they canceled my glass insurance after the third break-in, and I finally was absorbing all my insurance costs and everything.  And I said, well, I still can't put that iron grill around to protect me.  Said, 'cause I got to show these kids that I'm not afraid of them.  And I was afraid of them, but I'm not afraid of--but, but, and also I got to show them that I trust them, you know, and I love them.  I said, they got to see that.  And the only way they can see that is for me to take these break-ins and all that and not retaliate, not come back at them.  And that's what I did.  I got written up because of that, people, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This in the, this is in the '60s [1960s] or when or what time period are you talking about now?
Speaker 1: The break-ins?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Fifteen of them.
Speaker 2: No, what time period are we talking about?
Speaker 1: Oh, what time period?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Until 1974 of that, that went on from 1970 say 'til 1974.
Speaker 2: Okay, I just wanted to put a date on it 'cause somebody might think it happened in the '40s [1940s] or (unclear) talk about.
Speaker 1: It was happening, seemingly, every other week or so, every other night or so.  People breaking in because there's nothing to stop them.  They could take a typewriter, you know, and hock it, so, and people would do that.  And, one time some guy broke in, cut his, he cut his arm evidently 'cause the blood was all over the place.  And I followed the trail of blood to this house and I went to the house there and it was an abandoned house, the guy wasn't in it.  But I got a call that same day the guy, you know, he said I, "I been watching you.  I see you.  I want you to know that it's not against you. I'm the guy that broke into your place last night and took that typewriter."  He said, "I needed a fix and I just need to hock it."  And he did, he told me where he hocked it. I went and got it, paid for it, you know, to get it out.  And, he said, "But I'm gonna come to see you."  I said, "What about?"  "I'll be there."  I'd forgot about it because after--but about a year and a half after that, a guy came in one day and asked for me and I told him (unclear).  So, he rolled up his sleeve, had a big scar there.  He said, "You see that scar?"  I said, "Yeah."  "You know where I got that?"  "How would I know where you got that?" I'm not even thinking of it, you know, I've got so much on my mind and here's this guy.  He said, "Coming through your front door."  Ah, here's that guy that cost me all that money, caused me all that problem and here he is coming to see me.  And he says, "I want to make it up to you."  And he tried to repay me, you know.  And, you know, money wise.
Story_ID: 616199
Speaker 1: Tell us about the [U.S.] Army.  Now, you, you were drafted in '43 [1943]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '43 [1943].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you had just gotten married [to Adah Moore Lavelle], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got married in '42 [1942]. That's right, one year.
Speaker 1: You, you told me the story downstairs.  It's a real good story, but you go into the Army, you're there three weeks and what happens?
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter), yeah, yeah.  I'm drafted in the Army and I'm trying to stay out and everything.  And I got in and of course, when I was drafted, I had to go through the same thing everyone else does, the orientation period, the (unclear) things and all that, and take the shots and all that.  And then finally you're assigned to a, a place where you're going to be--do your Army stint and we're sent to Indiantown Gap [Fort Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, Pennsylvania] and there was the fort battalion being formed, 504 fort battalion of a thousand men and seemed like they--these thousand men were all black and they have a cadre sent to train these black guys and the cadre couldn't read or write that was sent to this battalion of a thousand men in order to teach and train.  And these men that couldn't read or write could certainly teach and train them how to bout face and how to do the calisthenics and how to be a soldier, and how to man that rifle and to do all of that phase.  But somebody had to do the morning reports and get the duty roster and comply the, the, the payroll.  And someone had to do clerical work, and there was no one, none of them that could even read or write to say nothing to do clerical work.  And so, the colonel of this outfit seeing these guys and having this cadre and looking at the list of the new recruits that's come in, sees this name Lavelle who has accounting on his background and has shorthand and typing, and all the things that he could see he needs some proficiency in.  And so, he sends for me and I'm eating my dinner in this big mess hall with these other guys, and they're calling my name out and I said no one knows I'm here I'm not going up there.  They kept calling, finally, after the third call I went up and there was this black lieutenant.  "Why didn't you come right away?"  "I was eating my dinner."  "Come with me."  "But I'm eating my dinner."  "Come with me."  So, I went with him and there we went down to this white colonel, looks at me and says, "You're [HistoryMaker] Robert R. Lavelle?"  "Yes, yes, sir.  Yes, sir."  "You this person who went to the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?"  I said, "Night school."  "I didn't ask you that."  I said, "Yes."  "You have shorthand and typing, and you can do all these things?"  "Yes, sir."  "You're my sergeant major, come with me."  And I'm wondering when I'm gonna eat, so I'm hungry.  So I went into this big tent, there's this tent and there's a desk in there and there's a, a big shelf with army regulations in it.  And he says, "Here's your place to work."  And he left me.  He left me with those lieutenants who were there and one of them was this black lieutenant and a couple of other lieutenants who know me from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], you know, that knew somewhat about me.  And they knew I had certain clerical skills and all, and so they told me about the regulations where you'll find this, that and the other, you know, you have to do this.  He said, "What we need--," it's gonna be a inspector general come through this outfit that comes to every outfit after two weeks to determine whether or not they are ready to be, you know, Army--useable in the Army.  And, he said, "This IG is gonna be coming and therefore you have to get this outfit ready."  Don't know what to do but, of course, you need to get this duty roster, duty roster first off.  So I start seeing all these guys and what they do.  And so, I start picking out other guys that had clerical skills or worked in offices or something like that and we picked out four or five of those guys to help me, you know, where in what I was doing.  And so, they then brought me my food, you know, that I hadn't eaten yet.  And they brought me a cot in that I'm to sleep on, and for three days and three nights I'm right there in that headquarters going over those lists, pulling these guys out, signing this here, doing that there.  And figuring out how to make out these morning reports and the sick lists and all that, and how to make up the payroll and to make sure that these people are paid at the proper time and all.  And I'm learning as I'm going, as I'm doing and I'm fascinated by it.  But that's what sort of kept me from just passing out I guess because I wasn't sleeping or anything.  I was just fascinated with the learning and understanding I'm having of what it takes to run an army.  And how you have a thousand men that you have to feed, clothe and train each day and, when you don't know how to do it and you still have to do it, and so I'm just fascinated by all that.  And I'm learning and absorbing it and evidently doing it so that when the time came for the inspector general and I had the major, sergeant major of the battalion had to present this battalion to this inspector general, and I had to even about face.  And I hadn't had any basic training or anything yet.  But I had learned how to about face though so I did all of that and presented the--to this colonel--to this inspector general and we passed that inspection though.
Story_ID: 616200
Speaker 1: And when we did, the colonel at that point had become friends with me and, because he recognized his need of me and also my need of some encouraging help and that he was providing that.  He was seemingly from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. He was an engineer very brilliant guy and he--another story about him.  It goes on and on. But he really was advancing me to these various grades, you know, that I was supposed to get as a master sergeant and I'm this sergeant at this point, three up you know.  And on, on my uniform and about four weeks there, three or four weeks there.  And he knew my wife [Adah Moore Lavelle] was pregnant.  And he says, "Lavelle [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle], how about typing yourself up a three day pass and go home and see your wife."  And I said, "Oh, my, boy!"  I just couldn't believe that.  So I got the pass and I made the pass up, he signed it and I went home, brought it--came home.  And I came in on the Pennsylvania Station [Union Station, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] to the same place where I had left three weeks before and the same bell hops and all had seen me leave, saw me come in with these stripes on.  And they said, (unclear) I said, "Hey, get me a cab, Red, come on."  I knew those guys.  "Give me a cab, you hear me?"  Okay, they got me the cab, so I got the cab and I got home.  And I hadn't been home but a minute or two before the doorbell rang and I was still greeting my wife, you know, and hugging her, so glad to be home.  And I opened the door standing right there at it, and there was this shore patrol guy a corporal and this private, you know, just regular private in the [U.S.] Army.  And they're standing there and this corporal says to me, "You're Lavelle?"  I said, "I'm Sergeant Lavelle."  He said, "You're under arrest."  "Under arrest?  For what?"  "Impersonating a non-commissioned officer."  I said, "Impersonating?  I am a non-commissioned officer."  So I pulled out my orders and I showed it to him.  Boy, those guys, here I had outranked them, you know.  One of them is saluting me and almost falling down the steps to get away from me because they were afraid that I might prosecute them, (laughter) you know.  So, anyway, that was a--just a great incident that occurred.  But, I'm--my, my life is replete with them as a result of what was happening to me from then on just where you sort of are seeing a need and you're trying to fill it all the time.
Story_ID: 616201
Speaker 1: Now, you told me another story by you, you were sent back another time for a leave just when your wife [Adah Moore Lavelle] was about to give birth to your first child (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes, thank you.  I'm transferred--I'm, I'm this guy, this warrant officer, supply officer for this battalion who shipped the outfit to Hawaii, which was then a territory, you know, two thousand miles away from San Francisco [California].  And I had transported these thousand men over there, and there we were training and staging for deployment as five different companies that we're gonna divide this thousand men up into companies of two hundred men each and assign them to port battalion jobs of loading and unloading ships in all these various islands that were to be conquered such as Guadalcanal [Solomon Islands] and, and Iwo Jima [Japan] and all.  And that was all what was going on, and here I am trying to get back home by having seen this notice that anyone with overseas duty qualified for quartermaster corps, administrative work, you know, as a, as an officer lieutenant.  And that's what I really to be was this lieutenant.  And I wanted to get back home and so I having read the regulation, I complied with all the regulations, typed it all up, took it to Major Bush--Colonel Bush [ph.] and said, "Colonel, would you sign this?  I want to apply for Officer Candidate School in the states."  He laughed, he said, "What, do you want to be a general?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He signed it.  He said, "You won't get anywhere with this."  So, he signed it and I took it and sent it.  What he didn't know was they were looking for people like me back in the states.  So, when that--my request hit the headquarters area, they inside of five days, they had sent a notice and I have that--those orders here my coming back to the United States by first available carrier to go to the quartermaster's school at Camp Lee, Virginia [Fort Lee, Virginia] with a ten day delay in route.  Meaning, that I could stop off at somewhere between myself and this Virginia school with ten days, which of course I'm taking to go to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and my wife had just given birth to our first child [Robert M. Lavelle].  And I'm taking her home from the hospital with our child and everybody can't get over this guy Lavelle [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle], you know.  First, comes home and all these, these, these advancements, you know, and now here he is getting home in order to take his child home and he's gonna go to, to this commissioning school, you know, officer's candidate school.  And, boy, how does he do all this stuff.  Well, how do you do it?  You just do it by following orders and regulations and doing what you can. And so, I did, I did get to take my wife home with the child and the most wonderful thing about that was, then I became--when I saw the--they saw my record that I was dealing with illiterate people and I started schools, literacy schools, you know, reading and writing schools, and, and the outfit the 504th fort battalion where was, so they sent me to the Information Education School at Washington and Lee University [Lexington, Virginia] and that's down near Virginia.  And that's where I got to go after, after I had gotten this.  So, I was again given more training in the Army because of my effort to try to help someone else to learn to read and write.  And I'm being trained as a sort of a teacher so to speak, and that was what I became pretty proficient in and became that.
Story_ID: 616202
Speaker 1: When you, when you--so you become a second lieutenant, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, second lieutenant.
Speaker 1: And what was your rank when you came out of the [U.S.] Army in '46 [1946]?
Speaker 2: First lieutenant.
Speaker 1: First lieutenant.
Speaker 2: Yeah, first lieutenant.  I was a separation officer in San Francisco [California].  All the people--the war [World War II, WWII] is over at this point and I'm still in because I'm this guy has to separate all these guys coming back from the Pacific.  And so, I'm not able to get out.  And I'm this first lieutenant at this point, I'd been advanced.  So I'm looking in to say, well, might as well be captain.  So, but I hadn't been in grade long enough to be a captain, and besides the war is over and, you know, they don't need captains.  And so--but, yet, I had a friend in the Army who was a, a colonel who knew that the Army was looking to keep officers in who were specially qualified in regular army, who wanted to be regular army.  And so, he was at this point, becoming regular army this colonel.  And he said, "Lavelle [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle], man, it's a good life, you know, you, you could be this regular army and, you know, become this captain, whatever, whatever, whatever.  And you have you'll have it easy for now on."  I said, "Naw, man, you don't understand."  I said, "I'm tired of this footlocker living and moving from place to place.  I want to settle down and be home.  I don't want to be in the Army."  "But, man, you'll get a regular army captaincy, can't you understand?  You'll have it made for life."  "Yeah, that would appeal to me at one time but it doesn't now, I just want to go home."  And so, I refused that.  And when the other guys heard that I--what they wanted more than anything else the other officers, you know, here I am turning it down.  And then they just couldn't believe it.  And, but yet, I--you know, you have to know people's background to understand how to gear it in life, because it isn't that I wanted a life of comfort, so to speak, as I wanted a life of meaning and I just at that point wasn't seeing any meaning for my being an officer anymore.  I mean, true, the Army needed officers for, you know, the training and all that but I just didn't want that.  You know, I wanted to have this meaningful life among people generally, civilians, you know, fighting this battle of--in fact, the Double V campaign that, that we had was still very, very poignantly part of my memory and a necessity in my life.
Story_ID: 616203
Speaker 1: Explain what that is for those who watch this who don't know what the Double V campaign was or where it came from.  What was it?
Speaker 2: Right.  During the war [World War II, WWII], there was a--the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier] was siting victory, you know, home victory at home and trying to encourage the black people, black, you know, all the people.  But yet, this man [James G. Thompson]--I've forgotten his name now but he sent in this slogan V for victory, V at home.  What we need is this.  This black fellow, and the Courier immediately seized on that.  Just in the (unclear) they, man, this is our slogan.  Okay, double V, victory at home, victory abroad.  Well, I'm buying that too, you know, I'm, I'm for that, sure.
Speaker 1: So the victory at home for black people is about--our victory at home is about what?
Speaker 2: Was about having equal rights.  Oh, yeah, the victory--but for black people was not being recognized as someone different when you went anywhere.  You were an American, and that was what I was trying to--like that's what happened to me when I first became an officer even, you know.  The people in Virginia where we were, they, they weren't quite sure what I was, you know, and some of them would even ask me, you know, "What are you?"  I said, "What do you mean, what am I?  I, I'm an American soldier, what are you talking about?"  "No, you know what I mean."  "I don't know what you mean, what do you mean?"  You know, then they wouldn't say it, you know, so because I wouldn't let anyone get away with that.  And it just infuriated me so that, that was going on.  But that was such a poignant part of me just because of my Courier experiences, you know, with this.  The Double V campaign and really not only buying into it but having lived it in my own way of living all my life that way.  And I just couldn't see any other way to live.  And so I just never ever tried to now--when I married the one thing I had against my wife [Adah Moore Lavelle] was that she looks like white.  She's black, she looks like white but I have sisters who look like white, you know, blue eyes and all that kind of stuff.  Same type of family I came from.  And, but the one thing I had against her was her looks, her color.  I was so sick of being discriminated against or mistaken for, or asked who I am or what are you, or what--that I just said, this is just, just for the birds, you know.  I, I just--I want to be just a plain human being.  And that was how I just viewed life.  And my wife agreed, bought into that, but yet people still have trouble with her, you know.  And, in fact, at the time when we were at Hampton Roads [Virginia] and we were on the ferry going across and we went into the black side, you know, the colored and white side.  And, boy, when we went on the black side all the sailors on there saw that and they thought my wife was white, you know, so they came over and the ferry almost swamped because of, of the people.  Honestly, it was just an unusual--so I, I--and I was sort of fearful.  And I said, well--but no one was trying to do harm except curious, you know, and no one trying to intimidate even.  But, I, I went out and that's the one thing that I was always--I, I was willing to--I knew I was willing to fight than die for being a human being.  I knew that and that, that's another story, 'cause that's exactly what happened way before Rosa Parks.  I'm in Norfolk [Virginia] and my wife is with me at this point and that's where my son Bob [Robert M. Lavelle] was conceived, because Homer Brown [Homer S. Brown], the judge that was here in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]--maybe you don't know of him but Homer Brown's wife [Wilhelmina Byrd Brown] was from Norfolk and her father was Dr. Byrd Brown in Norfolk, very prominent physician.  And he had a Cadillac with a chauffeur and everything, and he would chauffer and so--but she, Miss Brown arranged for my wife to come down to Norfolk to be with me while I was down there training, getting ready to go overseas, thinking to England at that point.  We were at the Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation [Virginia].  But, instead, I had to ship the outfit to, to California because we were suddenly changed when the war in England, war in Europe ended.  And, you know, was ending anyway.  They just felt--they, they switched us to go to the Pacific.  So here I am this warrant officer trying to get our outfit ready for the Pacific and I'm on this boat going across the Hampton Roads, you know, port of embarkation area there to Hampton, Virginia to the school.  That's what it was.  And, these sailors and all on this, this ferry were just trying to figure out just, you know, what's my wife--what am I doing with that woman, that white woman, you know.  And I'm there trying to let them know that none of their business, she's not white, and besides, you know, we're all in this together.  And so, she and I went out and stood in the front in the front, in the bow of the boat where we were neutral, you know, on neither side.  And, fortunately, fortunately, the sailors subsided.  They, they just went back where they were, no one, you know, tried to do anymore when they saw that happen.  And I guess it was my attitude at that point, 'cause I was ready to die.  And someone sort of knew that, 'cause I just knew that I wasn't gonna be treated in anyway disrespectfully or my wife, you know.  And, and, and that was just it.  And, I, I don't know how I showed that but I knew I felt that way, and, and that's why I said let's just go stand out there.  So, anyway, that subsided and we got through that.
Story_ID: 616204
Speaker 1: Now, when you came back to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], you came back in '46 [1946] and you were at the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier] for another ten years, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  From '47 [1947] 'til '56 [1956].
Speaker 1: Okay, almost ten years, nine years.  Okay, so, did you do your regular accounting job when you got back?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I was working in accounting at that point.
Speaker 1: And going to school.
Speaker 2: And it was at the same time I was doing my real estate.  I--while I was at the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], I had so many credits piled up and everything and I had all my requireds and everything else because of night school.  And they only give two credits for night instead of three or four, you know, and so I had too many--I just had all kind of credits.  So I was taking real estate courses because they were elective.  I said, "I might want to buy some--a house someday."  So I'm taking these real estate courses and I do well, well in 'em and all.  And so I had taken a real estate license examination and had passed it, and so in, in '49 [1949] I became a licensed real estate agent for Ramsey Real Estate [ph.].  You had to be with a, a broker as a salesperson for two years before you could qualify to be a broker.  So I became that licensed salesperson 1979, so 1951 when I had two years in as a licensed salesperson with Ramsey I became a broker and opened up Lavelle Real Estate [Lavelle Real Estate, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] in 1951.  And I opened that up in a place on Webster Avenue, 2046 Webster Avenue.  A roofer--I mean a fellow who had a printing shop was a friend of mine and he--I needed a separate ground floor location, separate from any other business location in order to be a broker.  So he permitted me to have a carpenter partition off a front of his printing shop and, so that when you come into his front door you could go to the printing area or you could go into Lavelle Real Estate.  So that gave me a separate ground floor location, separate from any other business and separate personnel.  I am all that so everything was fine except when he would run those presses and I'm on the phone, I had to--people would say, "What, what's going on?"  I said, "Well, I don't know, just a minute, I'll find out."  I'd go and say, "Hey, please shut the presses down."  He would stop the presses, he was a friend of mine, and wait 'til I'd finished my conversation.  But for five years that went on before I opened up my real estate office across the street at 3001 Center Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I bought this building after that.
Story_ID: 616205
Speaker 1: Okay, so in 1956--now, in 1956 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, nineteen fifty--1951, I opened Lavelle Real Estate [Lavelle Real Estate, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Yeah, '51 [1951] you opened Lavelle Real Estate, and--
Speaker 2: On Webster [Avenue], 2046.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And 1956, you--
Speaker 2: And then in 1956 I opened the real estate at 3001 Center Avenue.  And, also, the same year--let's see, 1957, I put Dwelling House Savings and Loan [Dwelling House Savings and Loan Association, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] with that same real estate across the street as--because I was fusing these two businesses.
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of the savings and loan?
Speaker 2: Dwelling, Dwelling House.
Speaker 1: Dwelling House, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the one that exists right next door, Dwelling House Savings and Loan.  It was then Dwelling House Building and Loan [Dwelling House Building and Loan Association, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] but I changed the name to savings and loan because that was, you know, different name.  That was an acceptable name so--and I needed to have a separate ground floor location, separate from any other business to have this savings and loan recognized.  And, so therefore that's why I bought this building and the ground floor of this building had a grocery store.  And I had that--the grocery store was going out of business so I took this downstairs and partitioned it and made Lavelle Real Estate one side, Dwelling House Savings on the other.  Dwelling House Savings and Loan at that point had 501 Herron Avenue as the address because that was the address of the property (unclear) and then 2009 Center Avenue was the real estate.  So people somewhere else would think that these were two distinct businesses separate from each other geographically even when they are just right next to each other.  But that's a long story trying to shorten to tell you how that happened.
Speaker 1: I'm sure it didn't happen easy, but it, it was--that's okay.  So, all right, so by 1960 I guess, you got both businesses going and you're--so when did you have both businesses going at the same, same time?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-seven [1957].  That's a--I sort of got to tell you how that happened I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a long--I will shorten it.  But, Dwelling House Savings and Loan was on Wylie Avenue, 1828 Wylie Avenue down among all the black people.  But it had been one time a Middle East area, mostly Jewish, and that area had this savings and loan.  Dwelling House Building and Loan it was, open seven to nine [o'clock], third Monday each month in this roofing and tinting shop where it was located.  You know, the roofer and tinter had this savings and loan in there.  And it's a cage with a teller cage and everything where people would come, seven to nine, third Monday, pay their mortgages or get the mortgage or whatever and get the--put in money in savings account or get money out of their savings account.  So, the third Monday of that month I had been trying to find a place for--where I could--I, I had savings accounts with everybody but if they wouldn't make mortgages for me on properties where I'm trying to sell in a white area for example--and that's another story that we haven't even come to, my multilist (unclear).  But, anyway, I'm trying to get this mortgage on this property on Dinwiddie Street, two blocks away from this place with the sign in the window Dwelling House Building and Loan, and I couldn't get that mortgage anywhere.  I had a person who had $7500, wanted to buy a house cost--I mean, I'm sorry.  They had--they wanted to buy a house that cost $7500, they had a $2500 to put down, they needed a mortgage for five thousand and I was trying to get that mortgage for these people in that area.
Story_ID: 616206
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this question because from talking to people in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] it seems to me that people feel that your savings and loan business is not just a business but it's some kind of project to better the community.
Speaker 2: To better the community?
Speaker 1: Yes.  And they keep saying that about you so it must be.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It's a ministry.
Speaker 1: Was that your intention?
Speaker 2: It's a ministry, indeed it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, indeed it is.  In fact, but see that's the problem, the problem is it's a regular board of directors, you know, who all say, look, we gotta make this profit, we gotta do this, that and the other (unclear) and all that.  And even the examiners when they come in.  Right now, one of the biggest criticisms that they have is Bob Lavelle [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle].  They gotta somehow get rid of Bob Lavelle because he influences people idealistically that is not materialistically good, you know, it doesn't bring about--and, therefore, he was all right for his time but it's time for him to get out of the way.  And so, the board tried to remove me.  They said that I would be a director emeritus, which is removing a person and allowing them to have status, you know, but you can't--you can come to a board meeting but you can't speak or you can't vote.  You can't do anything, you know, you're just name, okay.  Well, I refused to be that because I was voted to be a regular director, okay.  But, at the same time, the examiners were very, very, very upset with us because we still had prisoner accounts.  And prisoner accounts in this day of, of protection and the day of, of vindication of, of self and the fact of having make sure you know who you're dealing with all the time, how can you do that with prisoners?  You can't, because they're in prison and you can't see them, you can't talk to them, you know easily, even try to get something from them, you can't.  And so, you can't identify them.  But, yet, you can identify them but it's a very laborious process and we do it.  And they hate it because no one else is doing it, nobody else is doing it.  And, therefore, they have to somehow or other put the screws on us and nitpick everything that we do so they can find fault with and therefore stop us from.
Speaker 1: Okay, let me ask you a question now.  Why would you do that?  Why would you--is it--why is it important for the community that a prisoner has an account?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because a prisoner is, is me.  I'm the same as that prisoner, yeah.  Ninety-five percent of the people in prison are the same as me.  They didn't kill nobody, they didn't rob nobody; they might have sold some drugs, they might have broke some laws, they might have been Enron people who misapplied the books and mixed in all that type of thing.  They're in prison, yeah.  But those are people just like me, oh yeah, in prison, sure.
Speaker 1: They could be accountants for Enron [Enron Corporation].
Speaker 2: That's right, absolutely, absolute.  And they are, but what I'm saying is they do their time, they come back and their perfectly acceptable and okay, and all right.  Always, so, but yet we can't have an account with them?  You don't know the numbers--see I used to open all of the mail, that's what I did.  And the letters that would come from those people would, oh, just would be--tear me up.  Talking about how we're a light in their darkness, someone trying to give hope to them when they have no hope, you know, they're in there being decimated and being all that yet they know that they're coming out to try to live a normal life again.  And here we are trying to help them to have that normal life again.  They see it, they know it, and they read it.  I write it.  And every twice a year I write it, and so the people like what I write.  And so they just send money and, and everything else.  And even try to get us to bend the rules, you know.  I want to send more money than you'll, you'll take.  Nope, can't do it because the rules were, you know, we had to obey the banking rules and all that.  But still there's certain things that we do but that's the whole point, Dwelling House Savings and Loan [Dwelling House Savings and Loan Association, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] has never, ever been just a banking institution.  It's been an institution that cared for the people, see, and that's where Lavelle's Christianity came in.  Because he applied it, and I said so in my letters, my newsletters end up in the love of Christ Jesus.  They said, I can't do that.  The United Jewish Federation [United Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh; Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh], "Even the people took their money out," you know, the Jewish people, "because after all you're denigrating the Jewish people."  "What do you mean denigrating? I'm just being who I am. That's who I am."  "Oh, no, you can't do it."  But these are friends of mine, Jewish people friends of mine.  And I understand what they're saying but they don't understand me.  I said, "That's my letter, I have the right to be who I am.  You don't have to accept it but it's still my letter, I just have to (unclear) be obedient because at judgment day when I stand before my maker, he's gonna say, 'Lavelle, why didn't you do it then?  Because you wouldn't, you were afraid of their intimidation or you were afraid of not making that profit, or you were afraid of this that or the other.'"  That's when I'm gonna get a judgment day, and I'm very, very concerned about what's gonna happen to me at judgment day.  Because I know that that's gonna happen to everybody, there is gonna be a judgment day just as there was a creation day there's gonna be a judgment day.  I know that.  I want to be able to have him say, "Well done good and faithful servant.  You've been faithful in the little few things. I'm gonna make you ruler over many things."
Story_ID: 616207
Speaker 1: Let me ask you another question about that, about religion since we're talking about it.  Now, you said at one point when you were, when you were working at the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier], in the beginning you first started going to night school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You considered yourself an agnostic, you really weren't thinking about this stuff.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What happened to refocus you on religion?
Speaker 2: Yeah, thank you for that because it's very important to know that.  And what happened was this mother that I tell you about that I used to hold up to be bathed and to--who I had the power of attorney for, and who I took care of and everything.  And I would go to see her and she couldn't walk, and she'd be sitting looking out that window with a smile on her face at seventy.  And I'd get mad at her, what's she doing smiling?  What she got to--rainy day and bad outside, she can't walk.  Here I am, you know, able to walk around doing everything, bringing her, her groceries in and picking up her laundry.  And here she's smiling and, and just as serene.  I thought she's just a nice old lady that didn't understand life, and she would look at me and when I would walk in it was just like Jesus himself walked in.  "Oh, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle], oh, Bob," you know, just that her whole day would light up because I'd come.  And I'd come to bring her laundry or pick up her checks to do whatever, you know, sign.  And she--but, but then--and we would have a good time but I'd be rushing.  She'd see me looking at my watch.  She'd heard about the holdup I had or the break-in that I had and different things.  And she saw me on television, this, that.  And she'd say, "Ah, son, I know you're busy and all."  She said, "Oh, but you don't know what--just how wonderful it is to see you.  Just to be with you."  I said, "Yeah, mom, thank you."  And then she said, "Oh, son," she said, "if you just understood this wonderful life."  I said, "Mom, I don't wanna hear that, I'm as good as the next guy."  She said, "You're better than the next guy, son. I don't know anyone better than you.  But until you know Jesus as your savior and lord, you aren't gonna know the peace that passes understanding."  She would say that to me knowing she was gonna make me mad and I was mad.  Oh, yeah, I'm this good guy, I'm this guy teaching the bible class at Grace Memorial Presbyterian Church [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And I was, and she knew it.  And, yet, she's telling me that I don't have that peace.  Well, she's right about that I don't have that peace because I'm upset and I'm angry and so she--but yet she would say, "Oh, son, it's a wonderful life."  She said, "Oh," she said, "just," she said, "I just rejoice in having you as my son."  And I'd leave, you know, 'cause I had to get back to work whatever.  That went on for years.  My mother died in April of--in March of 1963.  And I'm sitting at my desk downstairs thinking about my mother and how I didn't have to rush out there, I didn't have to pick up her laundry, I didn't have to pay her bills.  I didn't do this, that and the other, and I'm realizing how much I missed her because every week I'd be out there two or three times a week and even on Sunday taking my family, you know.  And picking her up, taking her by bodily, you know, just to take her for a ride and I always had to drive by the cemetery to see my dad's grave, you know.  And--but mother was always just--she was just so--she just thought that the sun rose and set in her son Bob.  And showed it, acted it, but yet her son didn't have this peace.  And she, she was right.  So, finally, when she died and I didn't have that peace (unclear), and we buried her.

Speaker 1: After about a month I'm in church one Sunday, and Reverend Tolliver [Harold Tolliver] is finishing his sermon and I'm realizing that I think about my mother talking about that peace that passes understanding.  And I didn't have it and I knew I didn't have it.  I knew I needed something and I needed that, but most of all I wanted to be like my mother.  I wanted to be calm and serene no matter what the circumstance or situation.  And she was, and she had it and I didn't, so I went up and stood in front of the congregation.  Reverend Tolliver says, "Yes, Mr. Lavelle, what is it?"  I said, "I've come to receive Christ into my life and I like the way the Presbyterian church has its government in a form I'm gonna worship and this Presbyterian church after I receive Christ in my life."  The whole congregation stood up and applauded, about four hundred people.  This important guy, Bob Lavelle, talked about he's gonna join them finally.  But I was teaching a bible class.  But I wouldn't join and they never understood why I wouldn't join.  Because joining church meant what my dad said what church joining meant, receiving Christ into your life.  That's what my dad preached, taught, that's what he lived.  That's what people who would see me and excuse me and forgive me because I was Reverend Lavelle's son were imputing to me because I was his son, therefore, I was deserving of something special and better.  And I wasn't.  Just a bad kid.  And all this went on all my--and I started--suddenly all--you know, during that month after my mother died it's coming to me all the things I'm talking about now, the good things that happened in my life because I was a Lavelle, because my dad was Reverend Lavelle [Franklin Lavelle], because my mother was Mary Lavelle [Mary Anderson Lavelle].  And all these things were coming to me, and I'm realizing that I'm the recipient of something I hadn't earned, done nothing for, didn't deserve.  And, therefore, I had to do something about it and that was agree with my mother that I wanted that peace.  And so I stood up in front of that church and said that.  The church was ecstatic, they were just--oh, they were so pleased.  This important Bob, this important businessman, you know, the guy they're seeing on the news and hearing about and all that.  Guy that's always being held up, robbed and, and making mortgages for people, you know, just doing all the great things.  And they were just so pleased.  But then I--they made me an elder, I didn't know what an elder did.  Well, an elder was a spiritual leader of the church that you met and you had to determine the church situations, problems needed to be resolved and all that.  Usually end up around money, you know.  Well, here money is what I work with and all.
Story_ID: 616209
Speaker 1: Anyway, they made me this elder and after two or three sessions--they met every month and everyone was so pleased to have me.  But after two or three sessions, they weren't so pleased to have me and I could tell it.  And I couldn't figure out why and I was really puzzled by it because I knew that the church's attitude towards me had changed somewhat.  And, finally, the pastor one day after a session meeting, everyone gone, asked me to wait.  He was sitting there in his robe and all and he was perspiring and it wasn't all that hot in there I thought.  But he said "Reverend Lavelle [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle]," he said, "I don't know how to say this but the people they say they're not gonna follow you."  I said, "Follow me?  I'm the follower. What, what are they talking about?"  He says, "Ah, you know what I mean."  I said, "No, I don't know what you mean.  But I was--you know, I, I'd been puzzled by the attitude towards me and all."  "Well, it seems like no matter what type of situation that comes up in our session meetings or trustee meetings or whatever meeting, or church meetings, he said you have a bible solution for it."  I said, "Is that bad?"  I said, "Is the solution not, not proper and not right?"  Well, I couldn't think of what, what is he talking about.  He said, "No, no, no."   But, at this time he's just drenched, you know, he's, he's really so upset, so emotionally upset and I could see that.  I said, "Well, Reverend Tolliver [Harold Tolliver]," I said, "I can see that I shouldn't be in this church [Grace Memorial Presbyterian Church, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]," so I said, "Don't worry."  I said, "I'll leave."  And I got up to leave and I was gonna leave, you know, and go to some other church for that matter.  But he got up with me, he put his arms around me and he hugged me.  He said, "Brother Lavelle, the Lord sent you here."  When he said that, I collapsed.  I didn't expect that, but then it came to me what the problem was.  I could see, and I wasn't even aware of the problem because all I'm doing is, is living life as I live life.  Respond to life with the solutions to the response needed to, you know, whatever it was.  But that's the thing that was what differentiated me from day one, from Camp Meade [Fort George G. Meade, Maryland].  That I had that in me and I didn't realize, I didn't know it.  And, yet, I was picked out there.  And there were a lot of guys in that outfit, you know, when I went over to the outfit.  There were a couple of guys, Ph.D.'s.  Yeah, I didn't have no Ph.D.  But they didn't take him, they took me.  But, but the thing about it was that, that particular--when he said that to me and I realized, what do I do now?  The pastor's saying the Lord sent me, so I had to stay.
Story_ID: 616210
Speaker 1: But, it didn't get any easier.  The hate mail began, yeah, and all the different little--
Speaker 2: Hate.  I'm sorry, hate mail from the church members?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, unsigned.  Yeah, yeah.  Me with a dunce cap on, Bible in my hand and people think that you're a successful businessman but they don't know that your, your wife [Adah Moore Lavelle] inherited the money.  You know, you inherited your wife's money and all.  My wife--her dad was a barber who played the stock market and had charts all that, people thought he had a lot of money.  I had to bail him out because his stocks went bad two or three times, you know, but people didn't know that.  But they just thought he had money, therefore, I got money.  You know, but I mean just that type of thing was the type of, of hate mail that I got.  And, and it's been--it's not--I get a lot of--I've gotten, gotten a lot of hate mail just, just because people resent the fact that you try to do and be who you are when it's different from what someone else may do or be in a certain given situation.  And you're not trying to be anything, all you're doing is responding normally and naturally to what you think you should be doing and you do it.  Like, people think I'm smart, you know, and all.  And I'm not smart but I always, always know what to do because I, I sit and reason what do I do or pray about it, you know.  How do I do it?  And I don't see handwriting on walls, and I don't hear voices but I certainly know that it's almost as if God says to me, "Get up Lavelle and get to work there," (laughter).  He doesn't tell me to, to just do this, do that, do the other.  Just get to work.  And you do whatever is in front of you to do and you do it to the best of your ability and extent.  And that's the way I, I've always lived life, and I never really could seemingly complete things just because I never did get things done that I wanted and all, and was always uncertain about.  But, yet, the things now--and, and my, my, my physician, my doctor, you know, this cardiologist that I have, he, he's the one that said, if everyone had my attitude, there wouldn't be cardiologists.  What's he's talking about is my belief, sure.  And, and not, not just a belief but it's what I act on evidently.  I mean, I, I, I live it.  And, and in living it, that, that's what my wife--my mother [Mary Anderson Lavelle] would talk about that peace that passed understanding, you know.  I have that ability to live differently than I am just because it's instinctive with me.  It was given me, yeah, I did nothing for it.  But that's when, as I say, I changed from that agnostic, you know, when my mother died.
Story_ID: 616211
Speaker 1: Now, is there any particular project that you worked on over the years or helped along that you're the most proud of?
Speaker 2: Project that I've done what?
Speaker 1: Is there any particular project that you've helped along through the savings and loan [Dwelling House Savings and Loan Association, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] or, or, or--that you're the most proud of?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess two or three of those were people where we were able to help people who changed their life around.  Just sort of like the man that broke in, you know, that, that I helped there.  Where, where you see people's lives change as a result of you're doing something unusual and the unusualness of it is it's just not so unusual to you but it's the only thing that to be done at the time.  So you just come up with, you know, you do that.  But that's why I say about not being smart, and I'm not.  And (laughter) I almost didn't--couldn't finish--couldn't get my bachelor's degree because I couldn't get that math--those math problems that I was trying to solve, you know, that--word problems, you know, you have to solve the word problem to derive a formula from it and then use a formula algebraically to solve the problem.  And I couldn't figure out what the word, you know, the word formula was.  I couldn't from the--by reading those problems.  But this Professor Pit [ph.], he'd say, "Read the problem Mr. Lavelle [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle]."  And, I'd say, "Yeah, I did read it.  I read it all, I stayed up all night reading it, I still can't get it.  Help me with it."  "Read the problem," and walk away from me.  I was ready to shoot him because I, here I thought he wasn't helping me.  But he was helping me.  And finally, and I'm telling this story to the--at the Harvard Princeton Yale Club [Allegheny HYP Club, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] downtown last July, last month to these teachers about this situation how I finally came to the--how I got my, my graduation--my bachelor's degree by passing this test.  And how it happened was I couldn't solve this problem but this teacher I'm trying to tell them how you as teachers need to be willing to do what that teacher did to me.  He knew he was a cur in my displeasure, my hatred and I wanted to actually bump him because I was just so mad at him telling me to read that problem.  And all semester he said, "Read the problem, get your money back when I could because you can't pass this course."  Even told me that.  But yet, he would tell me read the problem.  I said, "But that teacher insisted that I read that problem.  So when I one night I was about to have a nervous breakdown, knowing that I'm failing the course and knowing that I need--I can't graduate because I'm failing this course and I'm collapsing over this dining room table.  My wife [Adah Moore Lavelle] had put the kids away earlier, you know, and she's just worried about me at this point 'cause I knew I was about to have a nervous breakdown.  I said, 'Oh God, please, help me!'"  And, I'm telling these teachers that.  And at least some teachers and I said then I fell over this problem, this--you know, and looked at it and then that word problem that I was looking at and wondering about how to derive a formula from.  I said, the formula came up and hit me in the face it looked like.  And I looked and I put it down, and I worked it out algebraically and it worked.  The next problem I did the same thing, I had twenty of them.  I did them all, worked them all.  Took them in to that teacher the next day and next night, you know, and he looked at them, he said, "Who did these for you?"  I said, "I did them."  "Oh, you did, huh?  Sit down."  So, I sat down.  He reached over and got ten more problems different from those.  "Work them, now."  I sat and worked them.  The semester ended two weeks after--two weeks after that and there're five people who finished that course of out of twenty that started it.  A C minus was the highest grade given and I got it in that course.  And I was able to graduate because that teacher would not show me how to find that formula.  He made me read it for myself. He made me solve it for myself.  I wasn't able to solve it for myself, but I finally recognized that I couldn't.  I said, "God, help me."  But that's when these teachers I'm talking to--I was given fifteen minutes to talk to them.  I talked to them for seventeen minutes and then they had questions to answer, they allowed five minutes for that.  Forty-five minutes after I finished talking to them telling this story, they're still asking me questions.  The convener says, "We got, we got, we gotta get on with this.  You can't be keeping Mr. Lavelle here all day."
Story_ID: 616212
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  Let me--I think this is important as a realtor during the civil rights days, what--I'm kind of changing the subject here sort of.  We'll get back to some other things, but what was it like being a realtor during the days when housing segregation was breaking up here in the City of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: What was it like the housing segregation was broken up?
Speaker 1: Was breaking up, yeah.
Speaker 2: You mean when I won that suit?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, tell us about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I won that lawsuit.
Speaker 1: I didn't know about the suit, but tell us about it.
Speaker 2: What happened, yeah.  When I, I was suing, you know, for--to become a member of multilist [Greater East End Multilist, Inc.] and they wouldn't let me in.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is '68 [1968], right?  Nineteen sixty-eight [1968].  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell us what--first--okay.  What is multilist?  What is that?
Speaker 2: What is multilist?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, multilist is a multiple listing group of people.  Multiple meaning more than one person, okay.  Many of them listing to--cooperating to list their properties together so that they have this one list of properties for sale.  There might be four hundred real estate offices, all of them with different properties for sale.  They all join this multilist, put their properties in this multiple listing service so that each one of them has each one of those houses for sale then that they can sell themselves and share the commission, the commission with the person who listed it, okay.  That's what multiple listing means.  So, I couldn't join that because I was black.  I didn't get enough votes to get in, that's what they said.  So, I then sued them under the Sherman Antitrust Act, restraint of trade provisions 1890 [Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890], showing that they were restraining my opportunity for trade by restricting my opportunity to have the same houses they have.  And Thurgood Marshall's the one that put this in my mind because he's the head of the Legal Defense Fund of the NAACP [NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc.] at the time before he becomes the [U.S] Supreme Court justice.  And, I'm up there in New York and they're screening me to see if I can go to the Supreme Court clean and not be, you know, decimated as a result of this multilist fight they're gonna have to be able to break down housing discrimination in America.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're suggesting that if had you sued and you had some skeletons in the closet they would of danced them out and it wouldn't have worked so the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was trying to find a guy like you that, that had a pretty good record to, to sue?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.  I was their guinea pig. I was their, their horse to ride to the Supreme Court.  Oh, yeah, they, they looked at me. They said, "But are you clean enough?"  But that's when they paid my way for two days up there while they checked me out trying, you know, they asked me the most embarrassing questions and everything, you know.  'Cause they'd say, "You don't know what's gonna happen to you when, you know, when this gets around."  Well, I found out what happens, because when I did finally sue and I find out I get hate mail, got toilet paper that used, you know, in the mail.  I get calls on the telephone where people would say, "You're gonna die tonight, nigger." That type of thing.  Or someone call and say, "You have two children [Robert M. Lavelle and John Lavelle]. You, you love those children, don't you?  Let's see, they go along Iowa Street up to Milwaukee Street so they can go to Madison School [Madison Elementary School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] every day. You wouldn't wanna see them get hurt, would ya?"  Hang up.  And then different other times just hate mail that just, oh, it was just terrible.  And, they come in--they, they impounded my, my bank account, everything.  Tried to accuse me of, of mixing hand money with regular money and all.  And I never did, my wife [Adah Moore Lavelle] saw to that.  But all these things that they just tried over an eighteen month period when this multilist fight was on.  And I'm having these pretrial conferences before Rabe Marsh [Rabe Ferguson Marsh, Jr.], the judge down there to determine how to get this case so it's Supreme Court wise, you know, right.  And these pretrial conferences are going through what's going on every day.
Story_ID: 616213
Speaker 1: Now, now how did the multilist case get resolved?  How was that resolved?
Speaker 2: Thank you.  It got resolved fortunately because I was about to go crazy and everybody else working around me was, was afraid and everything when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed and I'm the first vice president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the Urban League [Urban League of Greater Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] at that time.  And the riots were going on, and people were even calling me up in my place here because I didn't wear the dashiki.  They said they were gonna bomb me out because I'm this white folk's nigger and all this type of thing.  And I'm just trying to ride it out and try to ride it through.  But at the same time, I'm realizing that I just have to withstand, you know, what's going on around me because I have to win this case.  And so we're going along and these people who are opposing me, realtors throughout the country, were sending money here to fight this case because they knew I was gonna break housing wide open.  And, so they, they had this thing--that they finally told the judge that they knew we were about at this point to go to court and not have any more pretrial conferences.  And they said that Mr. Lavelle [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle] has a good reputation in the community.  They don't know him, but we do and that he has all this--these other people supporting him.  But they said, we have a--, "We, we know that Mr. Lavelle is, is not a good ethical person.  We know he isn't and that's why we oppose him and we'll prove that."  And the judge says, "Well, bring your proof."  So they said, "Well, we don't have that available right now but we'll have it next week and we would ask that you not have anyone around because we don't want to hurt Mr. Lavelle any more than this will hurt him."  And I said, "Wait just a minute."  I stood up, my two attorneys from New York said, "You can't talk."  I said, "I gotta talk."  I said, "Talk about me and my integrity."  I said, "Judge Marsh [Rabe Ferguson Marsh, Jr.], I respectfully request that you not allow anything to be said about me that isn't said in open court before anyone present, including myself, no matter what it is,"  I said, "because what I'm doing here has no more as the importance of my standing in saying what I am."  Judge Marsh says, "Your request is honored Mr. Lavelle.  Okay, present your case."  They said, "Well, we'll have it in two weeks."  So, my lawyers at this point, they're really worried, you know, as to what these guys are gonna--and I'm concerned myself, you know, what did I do?  And I'm really--but, but yet they had screened me and everything.  And I said, well, no matter what it is that I did, you know, I can--sure, I did it and so what I'm, I, I'm sorry about it and who else has done whatever, whatever, whatever.  And, I'm, I'm sort of at peace with myself about that.  I'm picking up the real estate news from the Harrisburg [Pennsylvania] about the Real Estate Commission that, that determines all licensing and everything, and I'm reading about the different people whose licenses were being revoked for misdemeanors that they had, had made.  So I picked it up and I noticed that this one person whose Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] guy that I knew, a black fellow that I knew, had a big office.  I had asked him to join me in my class action suit in multilist, he wouldn't do it and I wondered why.  But he was a bigger office than me, you know, I just thought he, just thought he didn't need me for that and he didn't wanna have displeasure with those other guys.  I found out he was being--his, his license was being revoked for unethical behavior.  I said, "Wow."  You know, here's this guy that--I didn't know what that was or anything else but it told what he had done.  So the next week when I was expecting this call for this hearing by these guys about this stuff about my reputation and all, instead they came in court and said that "We have decided that we're going to accept Mr. Lavelle and we'll make a, a consent decree and we don't have to go to trial.  And there'll be a settlement, we'll make the settlement.  And we're not claiming anything wrong but we'll admit him to multilist [Greater East End Multilist, Inc.]."  Foolishly, I jumped at that.  I said, "Boy, great!"  And I accepted it, the settlement.  So this settlement, and it was written up in The Wall Street Journal and everything.  And you saw, you know, (unclear) but it wasn't a lawsuit that went into the archives by precedent of winning a case against.  It was not that; it was a settlement.  But I didn't understand legalities, but that's why my lawyers were trying to keep me quiet.  And up--this guy telling him no, you gotta do this, gotta do that.  But, I'm this agreeing to a settlement and they wouldn't keep me quiet so I settled, okay.  And, of course, I was admitted.  And, of course, people throughout the country--all blacks became multilist members throughout the country that wanted to be.
Story_ID: 616214
Speaker 1: So it did have the effect of helping everybody (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.  It, it had the direct effect.  That's what I said, so I felt I won.  Okay.  But, in effect, I didn't win because the black people that I thought would be coming to me, flocking to me to buy their homes and all were now going to these white people who were employing these black people to sell them the homes as agents who wouldn't accept them before.  So, I not only loss but I loss big in terms of that.  They really made money, the blacks made money.  That fellow would have made lot of money that--oh! But that was a fellow that, hey, took his license from him that they were paying to say that I was an unethical person.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And I didn't know that at the time 'til, 'til later.
Speaker 1: So, when he was, was kind of pulled back down for being unethical that made him--that--he lost his credibility?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  He lost his credibility; he lost his license and everything.  So, therefore, they had no case.  This case that they had against Lavelle [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle] because unethical (unclear) him, the presbytery itself standing beside amicus curiae in court with me.  Yeah, the presbytery of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], you know, white people standing beside me in court and they knew it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now business got good at some point I guess because by 1979 it says here that Lavelle savings and loan company was worth more than 7 million in combined assets, so this is, this good, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 19--1970 was when we became insured.  Yeah, Dwelling House [Dwelling House Savings and Loan Association, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] became an insured institution and I had been working for it for nothing for thirteen years from 1957 to '70 [1970].  And paying its bills for it, and keeping its books, and clean, clean the office, you know, the janitor and everything else because Dwelling House didn't have that money.  But now that we were this insured institution well then I started taking a salary.  But I never made much.  My highest salary for Dwelling House was fifteen thousand dollars a year, highest salary.  Most of the time it was ten and eleven because I was trying to build up the reserves by not taking a big salary, because needed the reserves in order to withstand all these things that were happening to us to close us down.  Like right now, they're trying their best to close us down, but we have almost 20 percent reserves.  The average bank like Citibank [Citibank, N.A.], Citicorp [Citicorp Savings Company] and all those, if they have 3 and 4 percent reserves, they have great reserves.  Yeah, great reserves.  Here we are, almost 20 percent.  Yeah, enormous.  So, yeah, we, we just--sure, but we're not sometimes liquid because it's all loaned out.  But that's the point get loaned out and mortgaged, that's the purpose of it, okay.  So, you're just trying to always meet the situations and circumstance.
Story_ID: 616215
Speaker 1: Now in 1978 you joined the board of the--of directors of the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You want to tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--they--I'd been a Presbyterian elder since 1963, and so since I was this guy who had, had this multilist fight and the presbytery itself had agreed to stand with me amicus curiae in court, so they had put me on some of their governing committees including the Presbyterian Foundation.  The Presbyterian Foundation is the foundation that controls the money of Presbyterian churches throughout the world--billions of dollars.  I'm on the foundation because I'm this black banker who understands how to compute the interest but yet I'm this ethical person who has credentials as an elder and who can give a sermon if necessary, and so I'm on this board.  And I'm on that board for nine years, you, you can serve nine years total.  Three consecutively then you have to be voted back by all the, all the presbytery have to vote you back in on that board.  It's such just a prestigious, important board because it has the money, okay.  And so, I'm put back on that board for three different times 'til they can't put me back on anymore then they made me a director emeritus.  I have the plaque at home, you know, that (unclear).  But that is--but, but, but the idea of my being this Presbyterian elder has never been a focal point with me in terms of trying to gain economically from it, you know, it never have and never will I don't think.  But, yet, that's what generally is done with those positions, you know, a person uses that as a--but I, I never did.  And I never have made any money.  And people don't understand that either, they think that I'm wealthy but it isn't true.  I mean, you see what you're have in here, what you're going through trying, trying to even be comfortable in this place and it's just that--I'm just trying to be an example in the community, you know, of capitalism being successful among black people, you know, wealth creation, capital and real estate.  And cohesively working together to bring about a good that each person then helps to cohesively bring about, you know, like ripples in the stream when you skip the stone across.  And that, that, that's just what you trying to do all the time.
Story_ID: 616216
Speaker 1: Now, tell me this.  When you look back on everything that you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now if you could?
Speaker 2: Thank you for that question.  I never really gave, gave it much thought but, now that you're asking me, I can see now that there really is not.  The fact that--like this woman that I married [Adah Moore Lavelle], you know, we've been married now for sixty-six years, going into our sixty-seventh year and can't do without each other.  I know it.  But, yet, we're still two different individuals, you know, with different bent, feelings, understandings, likes, dislikes, so forth.  Always have been, always will be but yet we're becoming this one flesh and we know it.  But that's what the Bible says, that in the beginning God created man.  And the one thing he said that wasn't good was for man to be alone so he created--he put man to sleep from the--took a rib from here and made this person.  And, Adam came up and said, "Wow, man!  Wow."  (Laughter), "Woman, okay."  So he gave her this, this woman and this woman and this man, he with a penis and she with a vagina enjoying each other walking with him every day--and the Bible says that--until they decided--He gave them a mind, you know, to make decisions about, think, to do and to be, and obey, and to relate to and everything else.  And so, they started relating to someone other than God.  And that was to relate to this Satan who says, "Huh, God only treats you like He does because you are so obedient to Him."  "Oh, we, we can just live anywhere we want except we can't eat from that tree."  "Ha!  Yeah, God says, if you eat from that tree, you'll be like him.  You'll understand him, therefore, he denies you the right to have it.  Should he do that?"  Yeah, yeah.  He said--that's not verbatim what happened but he says, "Yeah, He can't do that.  Let's just see this tree, see what if it looks good.  Tastes good."  Yeah, okay.  Gave it to Adam, he did too.  So the only thing that they were told not to do is what they did.  Sin came into the world, and man had fallen.  And man no longer had this walk with God, he with a penis, she with a vagina naked so they suddenly hide.  He comes.  "Hey, where are you?  I'm ready for this walk."  "We were naked, that's why we were hiding."  "Naked!  Who told you, you were naked?  Did you eat from that tree you shouldn't have?"  He knew they had, yeah.  So, because they did that He cursed the ground that they walked on.  He said, "From now on you're gonna have to dig it and plant it, and sow it, and cultivate it in order to be able to eat.  And there's gonna be thorns and thistles and everything else that's gonna keep you from it and all this.  And you're gonna have a hard life because of your sin."  And so that happened (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 616217
Speaker 1: In, in that vein, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that they will have the understanding I have, that, that they will all recognize that Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] when he came out with, "I am somebody," I had to laugh at that when they attribute that to him.  My dad [Franklin Lavelle] was saying that, you know, back when I was this kid didn't understand why this--why he wanted that job in this grocery store and this man called him a nigger.  And my, my dad knew he was somebody.  And that's why he took me from there and why he never ever let me, you know, get into that--involved in that type of thing.  But he also continued to live his life and to be that example that people never ever forgot.  A woman came to see me when I was still working at the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier]--my office, real estate office [Lavelle Real Estate, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] across the street to buy a house from me.  My wife [Adah Moore Lavelle] called me and said, "This woman's here that wants to buy a house from you."  I said, "Who is she?"  She told me her name, I don't know her.  I said, "Well, tell her I'll be off at work at five o'clock and I'll be up to see her."  So, five o'clock this woman was there waiting for me and sure enough--and I needed to sell a house, you know.  And so she greeted me so warmly and she was so kind to me, and I said, who is this woman.  And she had come--she worked for a white family up in Latrobe [Pennsylvania], a wealthy family, and she had come home for this weekend, you know, and she was gonna retire from them.  And she'd saved a lot of money because they were wealthy people and they had, you know, she just worked--she didn't have to have any expense so she had saved this money.  So she brought this money down to buy this house, and she said to me, "How much would it cost to--?" She said, "I think I can afford a house about ten thousand dollars."  She said, "'Cause I have, you know, about thirty-five hundred to put down.  Would you say that, that's right?"  I said, "Yeah," I said, "that's about right."  I said, "30 percent down plus closing costs.  Sure, you got it."  "So, find me a house."  So I found a house right up here on Brackenridge Street, ten thousand dollars, just what she wanted.  Oh, she was elated.  Came down to give me this money.  It's four o'clock in the afternoon on a Friday, 1953, and I'm--banks are closed, you know, no banks open at night then.  And I said, "Wait a minute you don't need this money," but she said, "Well, I wanna give it to you."  So, but anyway, I called the woman that she wanted to buy the house from, told her that I had this woman that's gonna buy the house so just hold on a day.  She says, "Oh, Mr. Lavelle [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle]," she says, "after you left some man came and like the house so, and gave me money while I was there, you know, while they were there.  So I've already sold my house."  I said, "But this--."  "I'm sorry Mr. Lavelle."  So, I didn't have a house for this woman and she wanted to give me this money.  I said, "Well, I'll have to find you a house."  She says, "Well, my bus leaves at eight o'clock and I'm--I don't want to miss that bus to go back to the--I'll come back next week and we'll find another house."  She said, "Just, just find me a place."  Then she told me what, you know, what--she knew I knew what she wanted and so she says, "So I'm gonna leave this money with you."  I said, "Wait a minute, you can't leave that money with me."  She started counting hundred dollar bills out to me.  And I, I told her, I said, "You don't need this money now.  You need it, you know, when I find this house for you." "Oh, I don't wanna carry this money with me."  And she just kept counting the money.  I said, "You don't--." I said, "You can't leave that money with me."  I didn't even know how much it was.  I said, "You don't even know me."  She stopped counting then.  "Oh, yes I do know you, young man.  I knew your father [Franklin Lavelle]."  That was the first real indication I had of my heritage of what I'd been left, this legacy that I was left by this parent.  These people who would always see I was Lavelle and trying to get me out of trouble, trying to excuse me or trying to do whatever.  And here it was because of my parentage, my father and my mother [Mary Anderson Lavelle].  And it just made me realize all the more the debt that I owed as a result of being this Lavelle.  And, therefore I couldn't wash dishes all my life because I was this Lavelle.  That's what the people said to me when I was washing dishes and I--you're a Lavelle, you can't wash dishes all your life.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now--
Speaker 2: So I realized what I was given was what I needed.
Story_ID: 616218
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at everything you've done to this point, again, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: What do I what?
Speaker 1: What do you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: What do I consider to be--I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: To be your own legacy?
Speaker 2: My own legacy?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you (laughter).  Don't forget I told you I not only can't hear good but my comprehension isn't--yeah, I hope my legacy is the same as what my dad [Franklin Lavelle] left me, a name that people will not only respect but give the opportunity to those who respect the chance to be fulfilled in their lives.  I would want everyone to be able to make the choice of even what they're even gonna believe or not, you know, whatever, whatever, whatever.  That they make the choice.  But that's what I meant when I said that if all 7 billion people in this world, all, almost 7 billion, knew that they had this choice of what they're gonna do with their lives all lives would change.  And people do have that choice but the problem is they don't know it until they've lived long enough.  Sometimes they, they've destroyed it, you know, because they didn't understand it or ever get it.  But that's the point I'm trying to make is they have to have it from sort of the womb, which means a man and a woman get married--nowadays, you know, you don't have to get married.  That's what's wrong, yeah.  And a penis and a vagina being organs supplied by God that misuse of causes all kinds of problems, but they are considered illnesses rather than diseases.  And so, that's all right too.  But my hope and plan and expectation is that everyone would be given this opportunity to think about these things I'm talking about so that they can make their decisions as to how they're gonna live their life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us a little bit--
Speaker 2: (ROBERT M. LAVELLE):  Can I interrupt for one minute?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: (ROBERT M. LAVELLE):  Dad, did Mom [Adah Moore Lavelle] give you a list?
Speaker 1: He, he came to give me a year of his life when he got his master's degree.
Story_ID: 616219
Speaker 1: Well, that's the next question I have is about him and your wife [Adah Moore Lavelle].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): We're rolling (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, you have one--okay.  Tell us about your family.
Speaker 2: My family now (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, You mentioned--you talked about your wife and, and your son [Robert M. Lavelle] is grown now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that I had this son who came to give me a year of his life after he got his master's degree in 1970, that year (laughter)--but he was the one who I had--when I saw him through, you know, University of, of Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] and also NYU [New York University, New York, New York], you know, master's and he was the one that was in the Peace Corps in Nepal because--and he was the one that went to Mississippi in '64 [1964] when three [Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman and James Chaney] were killed.  He was with those--that group that went in and I didn't know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) For SNCC, yeah, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, right?
Speaker 2: And I didn't know for three days whether or not he was one of those killed.  My wife and I almost went crazy because we had let him go, you know, down there because he was a civil rights worker.  And he's doing all that because when he said he wanted to go to Mississippi--and, and I'd bought him a new car, you know, so, because he had been such a good student at Penn State and the core group was up there trying to get people to go, go to Mississippi that year, '64 [1964] to enlist people to vote and all that and to teach 'em read and write.  And he called me up from there, knowing he had this new car saying, "Dad, I wanna go to Mississippi.  I need your signature to let me go."  I said, "No, you can't go to Mississippi."  "Why not?"  "You might get killed."  "Oh, I'll be all right, Dad."  Sure you can--I said, "No, you can't go."  But he wanted to go and he wanted to--I said, "But you can't take your car."  "It's all right."  He didn't care, he wanted to go.  So, I said, well, (unclear) my wife, no, I'm not gonna agree.  So, he said, "But only you have to agree, Dad.  I don't have to have both signatures."  So, I signed, I agreed to let my dad, my son go to Mississippi and left it on the dining room table.  But I didn't send it to Penn State where he was.  Three days it was lay there and then on the third day my wife's signature was under mine and she had crossed out I and made it we.  And then we went through that period of not knowing whether he was one of the one's who were killed or not for a period of about six weeks.  And, oh--I'm sorry, it was only six days.  But it was just such a awful, awful time.  I'll never, ever forget that.  And we had people praying everywhere for us, you know, for our, our son and everything.  And I was speaker at all these big churches, you know, the Mount (Unclear) churches and the Fox Chapel [Pennsylvania] churches.  These are rich areas, you know, I was the speaker and people sent money into us, you know, to send there or whatever.  And they just couldn't get over the fact that we had this son, and I couldn't get over it.  I'm trying not to, yeah.  But anyway he--but then when he came out from Penn State he came back finally and went to Penn State and, and graduated.  And then he decided he wanted to go to the Peace Corps and he went to Nepal.  Nepal, you know, this little country between India and Indochina, yeah.  And there he lived a primitive life for two years and just--he lost all his hair and everything.  He, he, (laughter) but he was just that type of kid, you know, he just had to have--go where the action was and be part of it.  So then when he came back and went to, to NYU to graduate school and when he got his master's degree and he called me up to tell me, you know--I didn't go up to--for graduation.  I said, "That's great."  I said, "Take one of those good jobs I know you been offered."  Yeah, he said, he had three offers and one of them was fifteen thousand dollars; that was a lot of money back in 1953.  I said, "Well, go on take it."  He said, "No I'm not gonna take that."  He said, "I wanna work for you." I said, "I can't afford you. Take that job."  "Oh, no, I wanna work for you."  He said, "I think I owe you that."  I said, "You don't owe me nothing. I gave you the education.  I don't owe you anything."  I said, "You just take that job."  He wouldn't, he came back.  I got some people to agree to fund five thousand dollars to pay him for working in Dwelling House [Dwelling House Savings and Loan Association, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] for that one year and that's what I paid him for that with a master's degree for one year.  And, of course, he's still here and now he's the president of it, you know.  That, that's his story.
Story_ID: 616220
Speaker 1: Now, the second son, Johnny [John Lavelle], Johnny is four years younger than Bob [Robert M. Lavelle] and he is the one who--while this one never gave me any trouble, did all the right things.  He's the one that did opposite.  When he was, was in Schenley [Schenley High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] finishing high school and the Vietnam War was on and his friends were being drafted, and he was becoming draft age and he was the some type of thing he was with the school an important educating type of thing, you know, I was very, very proud of him and pleased with him.  And he was a artist type of guy and whatever it was.  But then he said that he didn't think it was right for him to be able to get the goodies that I afford because I can afford it and his friends are going to Vietnam and come back in body bags and all that.  He graduated from Schenley and I sent him to Carnegie Mellon [Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] to still, you know, no draft because he's in school.  So he was there for about four or five months.  Finally, the school called and said--and he was staying at home.  No, he, he--I wanted him to stay at home but I had him--he wanted dormitory life so I gave him dormitory life.  The school called me and told me that he hadn't been to classes.  And the, the person that called me from school was someone that knew me, the professor, you know, who friend of some people I knew and all that, you know, friends of mine.  Said, "We're concerned about John. We don't know where he is or where--." I said, "Well, I am too and I'm concerned."  So, for six weeks my wife [Adah Moore Lavelle] and I didn't know where he was then we finally heard from him he was in Canada.  He'd gone there rather than to go to Vietnam, you know, he had--he didn't wanna go to school.  He went to Canada.  A friend of mine was running the Canadian program for housing program, whatever, this professor friend and my son had shown up at his house.  And he knew in, in Toronto [Canada] he knew that this man was my friend and he was bereft of anything. He was dirty and no home, no, no money and nowhere to go.  But he knew that his dad had this friend, okay.  So the friend calls me and tells me that John was there.  And he wouldn't take John in unless John let him call me and tell me so.  And he took John in and, of course, cleaned him up, you know, and all that.  My wife and I went up to see him at that point, we drove up.  And I drove up to bring him back.  I said, "You're gonna come back here and face whatever it is.  But," I said, "but one question I have to ask you, just one question, just answer it."
Story_ID: 616221
Speaker 1: All right, now you--where we left off you went to Canada to get your son [John Lavelle]--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and you were gonna bring him back and you told him, you said, "Well, whatever it is that you, you we're gonna bring it back and face it, right?"
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And then he said to you, you said he said--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, right. I said, "The only question I have to ask you is, why?  What are you doing there?  You had a four year scholarship--," not a scholarship, I'm paying for it, you know, deferment, Carnegie Mellon [Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  He looked at me as if I was crazy, "You can't--you're answering your own question."  "How am I answering my own question. Don't play with me."  I'm getting a little upset.  He says, "It never occurred to you that I'm Bob Lavelle's [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle] son, been Bob Lavelle's son all my life, expected to be like Bob Lavelle because I'm his son."  And he says, "Because you can afford to send me to Carnegie Mellon and my friends whose families can't are being sent to Vietnam and coming back in body bags, and you're this one going around preaching all the time about you're the same as your shackled brother in Mississippi.  And you're the same as this person, you're the same as that person and you're not the same as that Vietnamese, huh?" I had no answer.  I just couldn't cope with the fact that he's resenting and blaming me for the fact that I had made that sacrifice to send him to Carnegie Mellon to keep him from--and he's saying that I'm this guy that goes around talking about facing our responsibilities and living up to what we're supposed to do and be and yet I don't mean it when it comes to my own skin or my own necessities.  That's what he was saying to me, that I was a, a, a false--I projected a false image, a hypocrite is what he was saying to me.  And I, and I--it took me a time, a little while for that to sync in but, you know, I got to thinking about that and my son, Bob [Robert M. Lavelle], had done the same thing to me when he called from Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] and said he wanted to go to Mississippi.  And I said, "You can't because you might get killed, you know."  He said, "Why not?"  "Because you might get killed."  And his response to me was, "Huh, I've always--I thought you'd be pleased."  "Pleased!  Why would I be pleased when you wanna go somewhere, where you might get killed?" He said, "Well, I've always heard you say you're the same as your shackled brother in Mississippi."  And he had heard me say that because that was my speech wherever I was, I went.  And here this four year younger son is saying to me the same thing in Canada, similar vein of the fact that I am the same as those kids' parents and all who're coming back in body bags, but yet I'm deferring my son from that possibility just because he's my son.  Therefore, I'm seeking preferential treatment for him and I'm saying I don't believe in that.  And that's what it was, and that's what it really is.  Because it really isn't right to defer the kids whose parents can afford to send them to college and the kids whose parents can't have to go fight a war.  It really isn't right.  That's done because that's the way the politics is played, but it's still the matter of right and wrong.  If you're one of the parents of one of the children who you can't afford to send to college and they're going to Vietnam as a result, and getting killed as a result how do you feel about those people who could afford to send their children or made it possible for their children to avoid it?  How do you feel towards them?  You know, what do you think about them?  Or do you think anything at all about them?  I mean, it's that matter of relationship again that you recognize the relationship of people because everything is related because God created a relational thing.
Story_ID: 616222
Speaker 1: Did you see the, the 'Bodies' exhibit ['Bodies: The Exhibition']?  Okay, wasn't that an amazing exhibit?  I, I went to see that about a week before I was put into the hospital with my last cardiac failure in June, and I was literally amazed at the anatomy and its composition and its completions of working, you know, of relationships.  Everything has to fit together, work together and all that.  Each one of the organs of the body has to be made mechanically to fit, and they do, and they work so that in cohesive with each other.  And that's what that exhibit was saying to me.  How can anyone say there's no god?  Anyone!  And look at this exhibit and see what man is made of.  The composition of a man, how could anything like that just happen?  How could the eye just happen that's gonna coordinate because the mind tells it--what it tells the mind to do as a result and therefore the fingers are gonna do it because the impulse is sent to it.  How can anyone think that all that could be happenstance?  And I came from that exhibit, and believe me I was in that hospital for five days with this cardio- congestive heart failure situation.  And where they put this pacemaker and all that, but every medical person on that floor knew that I had been to see that exhibit and how much respect I had for them as a result of what they're supposed to know about this anatomy that they are applying these procedures to.  And how much I not only respect but appreciate them, and I said, find it hard not to revere you but I can't revere you because the creator is the only one I can revere.  And I'm telling this to these different people, the different shifts in this hospital during the five days I'm there and almost every one of them had to come in my room and tell me how much they're gonna miss me when I leave  (laughter). Yeah.  And, and it was true because they, they just don't have patients like that who, while he's in there for his situation that's very serious, he's still concerned about their understanding how blessed they are and how important they are, and how they're supposed to think about each other as a result of, and the patients that they administer to, you know.  What they're supposed to do.
Story_ID: 616223
Speaker 1: Now, now, our last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  The last question is, sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Thank you.  That's, I guess the most hardest question of all because I'd like to be remembered as an important guy (laughter).  But, I, I guess if, if someone would remember me as being one who tried to apply and live up to all he had been given--I think it's 1 Corinthians 7:4 [sic. 1 Corinthians 4:7], the Apostle Paul asked that question of the people.  He said, "What do you have that you haven't been given?"  In other words, tell, name just what it is that you weren't given that you have?  And you have nothing, because you were given everything you have.  So, if you can understand that everything you have you've been given and, therefore, you owe to this one who gave you, this creator who gave you, made you, this debt of reverence and gratitude and then if you were to try to pay him for this great gift he gave you of life itself and the ability to reason and function as you do then you are trying to be obedient to him with it and therefore he is looking at you and saying, well done.  That's why I created you.  I'd like for him to be able to say that.  That, well done, good and faithful servant.
Story_ID: 616224
Speaker 1: Okay, just tell us who's in this picture and about when it was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, those--that picture is the picture of the black cadets in the graduating quartermaster class of--at Camp Lee, Virginia [Fort Lee, Virginia] in 1944, December.  And I'm one--the first one.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next?
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my roommate named Eubanks [ph.]--no, no, that's me (laughter) I'm sorry.  That's a picture of me in, in the cabin that we had built in Hawaii at the 504th port battalion.  And, if you notice on the stand next to where I'm sitting is that picture of my wife [Adah Moore Lavelle] that she had sent me from home for it to be with me there.  And that cabin was made from crates that were taken from, from the tanks and things that were being shipped to the Pacific at that were at Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii] and we were stationed near there.  And I was able to salvage the plywood from them.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next?
Speaker 2: The picture of the one couple there is Russell Washington and his wife, Vera [Vera Fullum Washington].  They are friends of ours who go to--who went to our church, his wife is dead.

Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a little, tiny picture so (unclear).
Speaker 1: There is a similar picture that was taken in 1978 of my Dwelling House campaign to become an insured institution [Dwelling House Savings and Loan Association, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and we had to get 1 million in assets, and have two hundred fifty savers.  And the campaign to bring that about took thirteen years from 1957 to 1970, and that is when that came about 1970.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next?
Speaker 1: That's the picture of Warrant Officer Robert R. Lavelle [HistoryMaker Robert R. Lavelle] and it was taken when he was twenty-nine years old, that was taken at Fort Lee--I mean, at Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation, Virginia .

And I was standing out overlooking the city where that picture was taken of me, and I was seventy-nine at the time that was taken.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of my father, Reverend Franklin Pierce Lavelle [Franklin Lavelle], taken about a time when he was in his probably thirties.  He died when he was forty-seven here in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], otherwise, I don't know where we'd, we'd have been.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
