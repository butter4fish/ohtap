Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But actual full time law practice, I don't do it anymore.
Speaker 1: All right.  And you're also a politician, or have been, a retired politician, I guess.
Speaker 2: I don't think you ever really ever retire from politics (laughter). Once you're in that business, yeah.  Yeah, but I was, I was in an elected office in the City of Cleveland [Ohio] for twenty-six years.  I was the, the present- I, I went in, in the council in 19--I was elected in 1963.

Story_ID: 623087
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as a warm up, and they only require a short answer.  First one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, fried corn.

Story_ID: 623088
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna ask about your family history first.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Cleveland Forbes] side, but separately so we can keep them straight, and then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Elnora Bradley, E-L-N-O-R-A, Bradley, B-R-A-D-L-E-Y [Elnora Bradley Forbes].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I really--May, 1893.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Hazlehurst, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you go?
Speaker 2: It's, it's, on, on mother's side, it's, it's very sketchy.  My grandmother, my grandfather, my grandfather was not my mother's father, but my grandfather raised us.  I've never known anybody except him.  And my grandmother- grandfather had four daughters.  The oldest daughter was Rosie [ph.]; my mother, Elnora; Mary [Mary Echols], Aunt Mary; and the youngest daughter was Georgia [ph.].  Georgia was the only child of my grandfather, Joe Lynch [Joseph Lynch].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The--my mother and my mother's--my Aunt Mary, my Aunt Rosie, were the children of white farmers who raped my grandmother, who went to bed with my grand- made my grandfather get out of the bed, okay.  So that's--and, and my, my mother--my grandmother was my mother's mother, and I was never aware who my mother's father was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's see, what about on your, your mother's mother side of the family?  Is there any history there on that side that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my brother [Zeke Forbes] did some tracing, but I was--I, I knew my, I knew my grandmother's family, my Uncle Howard [Howard Bradley], and it was, it was my Aunt Rose [Rose Bradley].  There were several of those people that we knew.  They used to come to Memphis [Tennessee] from Arkansas.  They live in Arkansas.  He was Arkansas.  And every year when the Mississippi River would overflow, they would come to Memphis because Memphis was the bluff city.  And they would come and stay with my grandmother and my mother, who lived directly across the street from each other until the high water went down.  Then they would go back and start their farms again.  But I knew several of, of, of, of those great uncles, my grandmother's brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Eliza Bradley [Eliza Bradley Lynch].  And she married Joe Lynch, so it was the Bradleys.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who subsequently, most of them ended up going to Chicago [Illinois].  And we've had family reunions where I've seen, seen them.
Speaker 1: These are the uncles?
Speaker 2: Uncles and aunts on my, on my grandmother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I have, I have an outline of the--for my brother did some research on the family.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Are any stories passed down?  Now, now, what you just told us is a, kind of a devastating story.  And--
Speaker 2: But that's, that's, that's, that is, you know, I, I had nine, there's nine of us, eight brothers and sisters.  I was the youngest, but I had a sister [Catherine Forbes] who died when she was a year old.  Those things were kept from us, but it was not until I was grown that- I always noticed that my Aunt Mary and my Aunt Rosie were, they looked like white women. But my grandfather treated everybody, treated them the same. And it wasn't until I was grown and would go back to Memphis at my sister's--and my mother had passed, told the story of--that's--and my grandmother and grandfather lived on a farm.  They, they made him get out of the bed, say, say, "Joe get up," and they'd spend the night, right.  That's--and they were ashamed of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now this speaks to lack of power.  I mean, I mean--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: --I don't think anything else could speak to a lack of power.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were, they were--my, my mother never discussed, it was never discussed around us.  But my oldest sisters and, and as they became the grown women, they, they knew about it, and they would talk about it.  But it was--and I've, I, I told this story (laughter) at an NAACP Freedom Fund Dinner [Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner] one night, and it was hardly a dry eye in the, at the dinner.  But he had to get up out of bed and let the, the, the plantation owner come in and lay with my--put my grandmother.
Speaker 1: So, now, in terms of--are there any stories in, on that side of the family of--now, it couldn't, slavery couldn't be much different from that in some ways, but are, are there any stories of emancipation or, or the Reconstruction era or slavery days that are passed down?
Speaker 2: No. As I said, the, the information was very limited on my grandmother's and grandfather's side of the, of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Those kind of bad things, they didn't talk about those things really.
Speaker 2: No.  And, and I don't think that was unusual among black people then.  My mother born in 1891--'93 [1893], my father (unclear) and my, my grandmother, my grandmother was born in 1865, grandfather born 1867.  So it, slavery had just ended, but for all points and purposes slavery was still going on.
Story_ID: 623089
Speaker 1: Now, what were the stories about your mother's [Elnora Bradley Forbes] growing up?  I mean what, what do you know about her, her growing up?  Did she have a chance to go to school, or did she--
Speaker 2: My mother went to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my mother went- my mother finished the eighth grade, all right.  And I, I responded quickly to that question you asked me because when I was, when I was in, in high--before I get to that, my mother was very dark. And my mother was, always ashamed of being black, until, I was in Cleveland [Ohio], until H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] came on the scene, and he freed her of her shame.  And he came to Memphis [Tennessee], H. Rap--I, I went to visit her one time and she was (laughter) telling me about H. Rap Brown and black is beautiful, and he freed her of her shame of her skin being dark, hell of a story.  I, and I then I, and I would talk to her, and she would talk about him, those young black freedom fighters coming to Memphis, and the Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] killing, those type of things.  They came down and created the situation.  And I, you know, I, it was a tearjerker.  But she finished eighth grade in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember, I remember distinctly I was in high school [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee] and my mother could do algebra and would help me with my homework.  And this is from a woman who eight- who was, had an eighth grade education and nine children.
Speaker 1: So she had a, a good education even though it was cut short.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: That was unusual in her time, in her day and age, you know, born 1893.
Speaker 1: Did you know the name of her school?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Did that come down--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or, or--
Speaker 2: This is down in, in, in Hazlehurst [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: --oh, okay, all right.  So did your mother, what, what did she end up doing for a living?
Speaker 2: She was a housewife.  She raised, she raised, she raised her children.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your mother have any special talents or any--
Speaker 2: We were--we lived in Memphis, but Memphis was, was--not everybody--all black folks lived the same section, yeah.  But she did, my mother did day work.  My mother, my mother, I can remember she'd go into the homes of white lawyers, businessmen.  And, and the status of that time, everybody had a Negro maid.  And she, she worked, and she would cook and (unclear) she'd bring food home to us, anything to get by.  And then my father [Cleveland Forbes] was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let's go to your father's side and get his--
Speaker 2: No, I just wanna say with us--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I'm, I'm--my father was--he believed in farming, and we were kids who would go to school, and then we'd go out on the farm and raise cotton and corn, anything to make a buck [dollar].  But my father was a rolling stone, be home sometimes, and sometimes he'd be, he'd be gone.  But she was the one was the gatekeeper that kept us together.
Story_ID: 623090
Speaker 1: Let's go to your father's side.  And can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Cleveland Forbes, C-L-E-V-E-L-A-N-D.
Speaker 1: Now this is--does his name, you know, presage--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --Cleveland Forbes, and what, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in, in September of 1891.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: Natchez.
Speaker 1: Okay, Natchez, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: He's one of ten children.
Speaker 1: Are there any--how far back can you trace your father's side?
Speaker 2: I can, I can trace my father's side back to the beginning.  I have a, I have a family outline.  I can trace it back.  The progenitor, the--would trace our family back to a woman named Betty Forbes [ph.].  She was a slave.  She was born in- the records show that she's born in 1779--1774.  It was either in a county in Maryland or Liberia.  That, that, it can never be verified, it couldn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My brother [Zeke Forbes] went back--he went to Maryland to try to get the records of the slave ship.  But it was--that was the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was taken to Mississippi by a man by the name of Alexander Young, who was a, colonel in the post-Revolutionary War.
Speaker 1: So the post-Revolutionary War.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was in the [U.S.] Army, but he, he, he was, and he was--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --he was--
Speaker 1: --right after--
Speaker 2: --born in 1774.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But he was a colonel.
Speaker 1: Post-Revolutionary r--
Speaker 2: Army.
Speaker 1: --Army?
Speaker 2: Yeah, post, post-Revolutionary Army.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: He was a colonel, colonel, and he took Betty to Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, when they were opening up that land in Mississippi to settlement there.
Speaker 2: Now she's a slave, but he's a white man.  And they had a son, and his name was William [William Young (ph.)].  William had ten children.  But William also attended the University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati College; University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio].  Now don't tell me--he attended the University of Cincinnati.  The family tradition in history is that he--that it, it probably was in a mechanical or an industrial type of program at the University of Cincinnati rather than baccalaureate paper.  You know, it's--so what it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) would have been--let's see, okay, so, this would've been like in the early 1800s or something, 18--
Speaker 2: Well, he was--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) for they--let's see.
Speaker 2: --I have his dated.
Speaker 1: Okay, if, say, Alexander Young is born in 1775, right?
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1774].
Speaker 1: Seventy-four [1774].  Then this is getting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it's vice versa.  He was born in '79 [1779], and, and my forebear was born in--
Speaker 1: In '74 [1774].
Speaker 2: --seventy-four [1774].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm just saying he, he's in his--this should get him in his twenties when has--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --children, and so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that, that would make it, you know, he'd be--that'd be around 1800 or so.  His offspring would reach maturity around 1820 I guess, as, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I got the family tree.
Speaker 1: So, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: I got that family tree.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So University of Cincinnati in 1820.  That was kind of early, so maybe later on then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But bear in mind now--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --he's the son of a white man.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So he was never a slave.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But some were, you know, 'cause Jefferson's [President Thomas Jefferson] sons served in the house.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he was, but he was never a slave.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's okay.  So, so he, what, what did he learn, and what, what did he--you said, said he studied a technical field, or--
Speaker 2: I think it was in a technical field.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what, what did he go on to do?  Was there was a record of that?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Is it a record of what he went on to do?
Speaker 2: Researched and developed that. But he had, he subsequently had ten children.
Story_ID: 623091
Speaker 1: So he would be William Young [ph.], or--
Speaker 2: There's a story that I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna tell you about that.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And he had ten children, what--it's four, four sons, let me see, yeah.  And one of his sons was George L. Forbes [George Forbes], who would have been, who was my [paternal] grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: O- okay?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.
Speaker 2: He's my grandfather.  My grandfather had ten children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, this was in, of the ten children, most of them made a decision that life would be much better for them if they would go by the name Young rather than go by the name Forbes.  Bear in mind that my, their, their grandmother would have been, her name was Forbes [Betty Forbes (ph.)], as the slave.  Young was the white side. So they took the name Young rather than Forbes.  So you have all these people (unclear) descendants, Forbes and Young, but they, it's really all full blooded.  There's no half blood in there.  But the majority of them took the name Young so they would be--take, take the white side so they would be treated better.  They thought they would be treated better.  Are you following what I'm saying to you, yes?
Speaker 1: Right.  And your, your--
Speaker 2: But my father [Cleveland Forbes] and my father's brother, Alfred [Alfred Forbes (ph.)], always kept the name Forbes.  The other eight children went by Youngs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did the ones fare that were named Young?  Did they fare any better than the, than the Forbes?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Black is black, brother, black is black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to--would see them.  They all--we, we all treated the same.  Nobody had any, any more than anybody else.  They were basically farmers and sharecroppers.
Story_ID: 623092
Speaker 1: What about your, father [Cleveland Forbes], you said, now he wasn't around as much as your mother [Elnora Bradley Forbes].  He wasn't really the, the kind of steadfast gatekeeper that your mother was.  But what did he--did he have a chance to finish school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No. My father finished the third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, and--
Speaker 2: He worked at, he worked at a Procter.  He, he worked at subsis-subsidiary of Procter and Gamble [Procter and Gamble Company] in Memphis [Tennessee], a company that's called the Buckeye Cotton Oil Company [Buckeye Cellulose Corporation].  And that was a, was a plant that distilled oil from cotton seeds.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They would take the cotton seeds and they would crush them, and from that would come what they call then seed oil--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which is a, was a value, valuable property back then.  And he, he worked there.  And during the course of his working there as a young man, he, his arm got caught in the machine, and it was cut off.  His, his, his right arm was cut off.  And there was no such thing as, workers' compensation and liability.  And what they company did, they gave him a lifetime job.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is before there were any labor unions or any--work- workers had any kind of control--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --so--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --yeah, if, if--
Speaker 2: But if they had--
Speaker 1: --if you--
Speaker 2: --they had unions, but blacks wasn't, wasn't participants in the South.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: So his security was a lifetime job at the, at this oil company.  Now, as a, an accord, the company let him--they had land on the, on the company's premises, and they gave him the land that he could farm.  That was a, a sort of compensation.  So he would--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, he was lucky to get comp- any compensation at all, really--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in that situation.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but they, they kept him on the job.  He--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they found things for him to do, and then they let him have the company.  So my father had mules and wagons, and we would have to go down and, they'd plant corn and cotton, and we would have to take care of the crops, my brothers and my sisters.
Speaker 1: So his, his father [George Forbes], you know, went back to the South after he studied at University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati College; University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio].  He didn't stay in Cincinnati [Ohio] apparently.
Speaker 2: No, that, that would have been my father's grandfather [William Young (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Your father's grandfather, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Of the, of the nine of us, I was the only one to ever see my mater- my paternal grandmother [Allie Forbes] and grandfather, who lived in Mississippi.  I remember I was a kid about four or five years old I went down there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your father had this land outside, this was outside the city limits of Memphis or where the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you live close enough to it where you all--you said you all worked there, you know, as you went to school and everything, right?
Speaker 2: I drove my--we drove our mule and wagon (laughter).  Like you drive your car--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --we would drive our mule and wagon.
Story_ID: 623093
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Elnora Bradley Forbes and Cleveland Forbes] met?
Speaker 2: I, I don't, I can't recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't recall.
Speaker 1: Okay, but they, they met in, in the '20s [1920s], I guess, or '30s [1930s]?  You were born in thirty--
Speaker 2: I was born in 1931. I was the last one.  I'm, I'm, I was the last--no, I had- my sister [Catherine Forbes] was born in 1935.  She only lived a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my brothers and sisters were born in, I guess you'd go back to 1918, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your parents then in the nineteen teens [1910s], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so a sister born in 1918, okay.  All right, now, is there--when you think about your parents' personalities and their dispositions and sense of humor, how they walk, how they talk, how they look, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That is an interesting question that you're asking me.  My mother was, my mother was a very devoted lady.  She devoted to her, to her family, and she was--to her children.  And my mother, my grandmother [Eliza Bradley Lynch], my grandfather [Joseph Lynch], they founded a church, a little church called Princeton Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church.
Speaker 1: So this is your mother's family basically who founded--
Speaker 2: My mother, my grandmother--
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: --my grandfather.  And bear in mind, we lived across the street from each other.
Speaker 1: Princeton Chapel.
Speaker 2: Princeton Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church.  It is still there on Eldridge Street [sic. Eldridge Avenue] in Memphis [Tennessee].  And, whenever I go there I--(unclear) I--(unclear) go by, go to have service at the church.  And she was, she was a lady that, that kept her brood together.  My father was--and I--and the, the older, the older I got, I, I under, I understood it.  I, I understood him.  He was a man that was, was driven.  He--you lose your arm.  You have eight children.  You're treated like a boy.  I, I, I used to see my father call ten, eleven, twelve year old white boys mister.  He'd scratch his head, because you had to do that.  He, he, he--you had to do that, and you, you mix that with the trying to survive.  And he was, he was, he was kind of a wayward guy, like, he was a, he was a rolling stone.  He'd be home sometimes.  And sometimes we'd go out, and we'd, we'd pick the cotton from the, from that company [Buckeye Cotton Oil Company; Buckeye Cellulose Corporation], the land.  And when he'd finish picking the cotton and my father would settle up, and he would take the money, and we wouldn't see him no more until the next spring.  That left my mother having to take care of eight kids.
Speaker 1: Now was he, was he still working for this place during that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --period of time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But he just wouldn't come around o--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: And that was a, that was a--so, sometimes people would, would say to me that you look just like your daddy, and I would get mad 'cause I wanted to look like my mama who was the, the standard bearer for the family.  But as I grew older, and, and you, you would became more educated, you, you put it all in context; you put it in context.  Yes sir to thirteen year old white boy.  You're reduced less than a man.
Speaker 1: Did he drink, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, not--that wasn't his--he, he was--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --not a drunkard, no more than anybody else.  But that wasn't his, that wasn't his problem.  It was the things that was eating him up inside.  My father and I never had a conversation like you and I are having now.  We'd just, you know, I could go see him, "How you doing?"
Story_ID: 623094
Speaker 1: Can you name your brothers and sisters for us in order?  And put yourself in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but I can't give you their, their birth dates and that--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's okay, as long you can--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --just give us kind of like the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, my oldest sister is Marie [Marie Forbes (ph.)]. Okay.
Speaker 1: She, she's deceased now.  Then I had a brother who was Mack Henry [Mack Forbes (ph.)].
Speaker 2: That's the second Mack Henry I--there's a Mack Henry that went to our church from Louisiana, Mack Henry Reed [ph.], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then after Mack, I had a sister named Eliza Mae [Eliza Forbes (ph.)]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --who was named after my [maternal] grandmother, Eliza Lynch [Eliza Bradley Lynch].  And then I had a sister was Ophelia [Ophelia Forbes], who's Camadie's [ph.] mother.  And then I have a brother named Cleoford [Cleoford Forbes].  And next in line was a sister named Louise, Thelma Louise [Thelma Forbes].  And I had a brother, a brother named Joseph [Joseph Forbes].  And then there's me.  And we had a, a youngest sister, my youngest sister was Catherine [Catherine Forbes], who was born in 1935, and she lived a year.  And that's, that's the clan.
Story_ID: 623095
Speaker 1: Do you have an, an earliest childhood memory?  Your first--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --first thing that you remember?
Speaker 2: I re- I re- I, I remember my sisters.  That's probably the only thing, the earliest thing that I can--I remember my sisters, the--my youngest sister who died [Catherine Forbes].  I remember her wake was at, was at our house [in Memphis, Tennessee].  And that was--those times you had wakes in homes.  And I can remember her, her body being in the, in the, the front, we called it the front room.  I can remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, you, you were saying the church was right across the street?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, my--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --[maternal] grandmother's [Eliza Bradley Lynch] (unclear) the church was, the church was across the railroad track--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --and down (laughter) this, we lived near a railroad track.  Most black folks lived near railroad tracks, okay--across the railroad track and down the street.
Story_ID: 623096
Speaker 1: Can you describe, well, describe the neighborhood in Memphis [Tennessee] you, that you grew up in.  What, what- did, did, did it have a name, or--you said it was near the railroad (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We lived in Hyde Park [Memphis, Tennessee].  We called it Hyde Park.
Speaker 1: Okay, Hyde Park.
Speaker 2: There was a grammar school across the railroad track and up the street.  And the school was next to the railroad track.  It was Hyde Park Elementary School [Memphis, Tennessee].  That's where we went to school from the first grade through the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was just, you know, single family homes.
Speaker 1: These are like bungalows or like--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the, the one, one story?
Speaker 2: One story, no basements, was no basements in the South.
Speaker 1: Frame houses?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you had a brick house you were rich.
Speaker 1: Did you have a, a nice yard?
Speaker 2: We had a front yard, we had a backyard, and then we had a yard behind that that we called a lot, 'cause my father [Cleveland Forbes] kept--we had cows and mules.  And we're the only ones, we're the only one in the community who had had mules and cows and chicken and geese.
Speaker 1: You all were the only ones in that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, the only ones.
Speaker 1: Now was that--I guess it was okay by the laws of the city, huh, to have those livestock in a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --okay.  I know some cities, even, my mother describes growing up in Dayton [Ohio] where you could have chickens at one time in the yard running around, and--
Speaker 2: You, you have to--
Speaker 1: --then they stopped it.
Speaker 2: --you have to understand the hierarchy of Memphis.  And, and my father was a, my father was, worked for different white individuals.  He works for this, this company [Buckeye Cotton Oil Company; Buckeye Cellulose Corporation], but he also, he also farmed for a man by the name of J. W. Curry--W.J. Curry.  And this Mr. Curry was a developer, had lots of land, big white developer.  And my father was, he worked for him.  And J.W. Curry [sic.] was a highly influential figure in Memphis politics.  So if, if there was a problem my father go to J.W. Curry, and the problem would go away.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're suggesting that if it was okay with J.W. Curry to have horses--
Speaker 2: No, I'm not suggesting that.  I'm telling you that.  I'm telling you that.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: And I will, I will thoroughly enunciate it.  I re- I remember once when I was (unclear) my father would, when he would go in, and I'm, I'm, I'm not, I don't mean to demean my father, but I, I'm trying to give you a picture of what was going on.  I don't think it was much different with him and anybody else, black people.  You know, you, I remember, when I told it would go away, and, and we didn't have anything, and my mother [Elnora Bradley Forbes], my mother went to juvenile court, and there was a, there was a woman judge by the name of Kelly [ph.].  And, and, and this lady was subsequently disgraced because of a child ring in Memphis that would, she was selling children.  But anyway, we, we all got in the back of a truck for my, my cousin.  My cousin Artis [ph.] took us down to juvenile court that morning.  And my mother was trying to get some food, trying to get some money from her food.  And I could remember as, as though it was yesterday.  Mr. Curry showed up.  Were, we're little kids, you know.  J.W. Curry showed up.  And the judge sent us home, told my mother don't come back down there anymore, no money, no food, no nothing.  But that was, that was not unusual.  That was--I, I re- I remember there was like--when I was a kid, a fella in Memphis by the name of Red Launge [ph.].  Red Launge killed about five or six people, black people, never went to jail, because it was white men who interceded in the system.  Am I getting my point across to you?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Okay. I saw that.
Story_ID: 623097
Speaker 1: These are politicians clearly abusing their power for whatever they wanted to do, right?
Speaker 2: My father [Cleveland Forbes] in Memphis [Tennessee], I, I never recall when my mother [Elnora Bradley Forbes], grandmother [Eliza Bradley Lynch], they couldn't vote.  They could always vote, but you had to pay a poll tax.  But I remember my father used to, the same mule and wagon I'm telling you about, there would be, there would be political rallies that the Crump machine would have.  And my fa- when the rallies was over they would, they'd have watermelons and, and those things.  And my father would go around at these, after, after the political rallies was over, and he would pick up the watermelon rinds from these places, which meant that he knew these people.  And we'd bring the watermelon, watermelon rinds back home to feed our pigs.  So that's why he was, he knew these people in the position, not of equals.  So it was nothing for a white man to get on the phone and say, "And let this--that's my nigger.  Let him alone."  I mean that's the way it was done.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's, that's the South that I, that I knew, that I grew up with.
Speaker 1: Now, yeah, so, who, who was mayor when you were growing up in Memphis?  Do you remember, or did--
Speaker 2: Didn't matter.
Speaker 1: --(unclear).
Speaker 2: Ed Crump [E.H. Crump] was the man that ran Memphis.
Speaker 1: Crump, right, right.
Speaker 2: You heard of the Crump machine.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Didn't matter.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: He was the one that ran Memphis.
Speaker 1: I have certainly heard of him.
Speaker 2: He was a, he was a little short white man with white hair, bushy hair, with a hat sitting on top of it.  I was kid working at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis, and I would see him with, go up on Main Street between 2nd [Street] and Main there was a park that blacks couldn't go in.  And he, I would see him walking with his cane through the park.  But he was the one that, he ran Memphis.  They built a park for black folks on Beale Street called Handy, Handy square [W.C. Handy Park, Memphis, Tennessee] that you could sit there, but you couldn't sit up on, in the park on Main Street.
Story_ID: 623098
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Well, whatever, whatever I am or whatever little bit I have achieved, I, it's because of my mother [Elnora Bradley Forbes], all right.  It's because of my mother.  We had to, we had to pick cotton.  We had to chop cotton.  We had to plow the crops.  And we didn't, we didn't really want to do that, but she says you have to do this in order for you to get along, for you to survive.  So, cotton and corn, as much as we hate it, it was her way of keeping her kids together, feeding us.
Speaker 1: Now this is on your own place?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: On your own place, right?
Speaker 2: No. This is only places that my father [Cleveland Forbes], from J.W. Curry [sic. W.J. Curry] and the Buckeye Cotton Oil Company [Buckeye Cellulose Corporation].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This, no, no, no, no.  But that was, that was our, her way of getting it together, in addition to her, in addition to her working in the homes of white, white people.  But always, always behind it, we never went to school until the crops by laid by what you called, when the cotton was picked.  We never went to school until October, November.  That's when we went to school.  But she always insisted that you had to go to school, and I don't recall ever one of us failing, even though we were two months behind.  The teachers understood it, they knew the Forbes kids.  But her, her motivating factor was that you've got to get up and go to school, you've got to go to school.  So you ask me about the sights and sounds.  And you also had to go to church.  Then, as my, my brothers, my sisters began to grow older, my Aunt Mary [Mary Echols] lived in Chicago [Illinois] and, and the first person, first one of my brothers and sisters leave was my sister, Marie [Marie Forbes (ph.)], the oldest sister.  She went to Chicago, and she lived with my aunt until she could get herself established.  And as she got established in Chicago, my brother Mack [Mack Forbes (ph.)] would leave.  So that, and that, and that voyage continued throughout all our lives.  As one would, would leave and go, he'd bring up another one, either from Chicago to Cleveland [Ohio].  That was our way of escaping.
Story_ID: 623099
Speaker 1: Was it unusual for the Forbes to like, you know, you say you got like a farm basically in the city, and--
Speaker 2: We were the only ones.  I, I didn't know anybody else.
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: That was black folks on the farm.  Okay, we were the only ones.
Speaker 1: --okay.  I know I've been in Memphis [Tennessee] where a truck will pull up in a neighborhood, and people could, you know, would fill, they'd fill up the truck to take them out to pick cotton.
Speaker 2: To go pick cot- yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, you go, you go, the truck come back four o'clock in the morning, load up, go over to Arkansas, stay all day, come back.  Now if you were, were, were chopping cotton, you chop cotton two dollars a day, you picking cotton it was two hundred- two dollars a 100, but that's how they got the farm labor--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --folks unemployed in, in, in Memphis, take you over to West Memphis [Arkansas], Hughes, Arkansas, come back.
Speaker 1: So when the, when your father [Cleveland Forbes] would take you to, to chop cotton or pick cotton or corn, did you, were you compensated at all for it?
Speaker 2: You didn't pay your children.  Black folks didn't pay their children to go chop cotton.
Speaker 1: That's what I was thinking.  That's why, that's why I asked.  I didn't--
Speaker 2: No, I was just, I was telling you about--
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: --in addition to what we were doing, there were other folks would catch the truck every morning--
Speaker 1: Sure, I understand.
Speaker 2: --and go chop it.  But did not, we'd, we'd catch the mule and drive down two miles to the Buckeye [Buckeye Cotton Oil Company; Buckeye Cellulose Corporation]--to the bottoms, and we would do our own farming.
Speaker 1: I was just making a distinction that you all weren't really getting paid for any of this.  I mean you, you wouldn't, your, your father would get the pay, and you said he'd disappear, right?
Speaker 2: Once, what you call, once the crop, you lay by.  That's what, that's the term, it mean you settle up.  You bale the cotton, and you, you go take it to the gin, and you get paid.  Well, he would, sometimes he'd leave.  We wouldn't see him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But your mother [Elnora Bradley Forbes], you know, compelled you all to go on and do it anyway, right, 'cause he was your father?
Speaker 2: And then she, and I, I can remember there were times about three years she would, she'd say well, I'm not gonna do all that anymore, so she'd, she would take us and we would go to Missouri to pick cotton.  We would (laughter) it's, you know, I'd, talking about this, it's, it's not easy.  She would take us up to Missouri.  I remember we used to go a place called Portageville, Missouri.  And we had a reputation of picking good cotton, of good workers.  We make two dollars a 100.  And some of us, the older in the family could pick two hundred pounds a day, which mean you made four dollars.  And we would stay there from September, October.  Cotton would, would blossom, would bloom, and would open the middle of September, be there from September, October, and early November.  We out there in, in Portageville in the country.  All you do is buy your, buy your food.  By the end of the time that you're through farming, my mother would have quite a pocketbook, and we'd come back to Memphis and go to school.  She'd buy clothes for us.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, that's almost three months, I guess.
Speaker 2: I said, we didn't go to school until November.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you actually lived in that place on the, on the place that you were pick, picking the cotton now?
Speaker 2: No.  We lived, we lived in Hyde Park.  We lived in Memphis, the City of Memphis, but--
Speaker 1: But you would have to travel to Missouri for that three month period?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we would catch a, a seed truck that would, would, would take the whole family and clothing up to Portageville, Missouri.  We'd stay there three months.
Speaker 1: You're right.  That's what I'm--
Speaker 2: Then we'll come back to Memphis, to Hyde Park.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: Now, sometimes, that, that, that happened after my father would, would farm for him and wouldn't have no money.  He might decide he'd, rolling stone.  So we'd spend the winter without any food, or she'd have to go work, and my grand- my grandmother [Eliza Bradley Lynch] and grandfather [Joseph Lynch] took care of us.  Then my sisters and brothers would send money from Chicago [Illinois] to take care of us.  That was their life.
Story_ID: 623100
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a, this is kind of a hard life, even--
Speaker 2: You see now when I--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --told you I would cry when people say that you look like your father [Cleveland Forbes].  Am I embarrassed by this?  You wanted, you want to know my history.  But I, I sit here with you, and I, I think I understand it.
Speaker 1: So you never had a conversation with your father about this after you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --grew up or?
Speaker 2: No, we're nev- I never had, I don't think any of us had a conversation with our father.  I don't think any of us had a conversation with him.  I, I try to put it into context of where he was at that time, and I'm just telling you, you know.  I didn't have to call white people sir, mister, white boys. I didn't have to do that.  But he lived in a day and a time when you, if you were going to survive, that's what you had to do.
Speaker 1: So, now your grandfather was around, right, when you were coming, your, your household consisted of, of you, your siblings, and your mother [Elnora Bradley Forbes].  And were your grandparents [Eliza Bradley Lynch and Joseph Lynch] around too, or?
Speaker 2: I lived, we lived at 1315 Austin Street, Memphis, Tennessee.  And in that household was my father, my mother, and eight brothers and sisters.  Sometimes my father would not be there.  And I would say that he would, would be gone more times than he was there.  My grandmother and grandfather lived at 1311 Austin Street, which is directly across the street from us, okay.  At 13- at 1307 was a vacant lot, and next to the vacant lot was a railroad track, okay.  Across the railroad track was the school [Hyde Park Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee], the grammar school where we went to school.  So that gives you an idea what, the location we were.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you said the church [Princeton Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church, Memphis, Tennessee] was like, across those tracks and then down the street?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the church was, was down.  It was not in, was not in--
Speaker 1: Wasn't in the same (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) was not in--
Speaker 1: --same neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was fifteen minutes away.
Story_ID: 623101
Speaker 1: How important was the, was, was your [maternal] grandparents were, were like, how important were they in your development growing up?
Speaker 2: When there were no food we ate at, my, my grandmother [Eliza Bradley Lynch] and my grandfather fed us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can remember almost every Sunday morning I would eat at my grandmother's house.  My grandfather said, "Feed him."
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you close with your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Great man.  And, and that's why I, when you, when you try to go over the family tree on my mother's [Elnora Bradley Forbes] side, I have trouble accepting anybody except my grandfather, who was really not my mother's father.  He, he fed us.  He cut our hair.  He made sure that we went to church, okay.  He was, he was the, he was the man.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And his name again is?
Speaker 2: Joseph Lynch.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so he was around, was he around during the, all the time that you were growing up [in Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  We could go across and, we'd go across the street and I would, we, we all loved our grand- our grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We'd go across the street, and we'd sit up.  And he has a potbelly stove and had a three room house, and we'd sit there and he'd bake peanuts in the stove, in the ashes, okay, made sure your- my grandfather couldn't read or write, but he made sure that we were men, grew, grew up to be good men.
Story_ID: 623102
Speaker 1: Let me tell you about my [maternal] grandfather [Joseph Lynch].  My grandfather was the (clears throat) was the man in our life.  But we would go across the street.  He would roast peanuts, and it, it, it have this wooden stove and, and potbelly stove.  And the ashes would fall down to the bottom, and you'd pick the ashes out.  And if, and this, the cinders would fall, and he would put the peanuts down in there, and he would put potatoes in there, sweet potatoes.  And we'd go over there, and we'd eat peanuts and, and sweet potatoes.  And then my grandfather had a, a very unique thing he would do.  He would, we'd go over and would eat breakfast and would have salt meat and rice and what have--things that people did in the South, and he'd drink coffee.  And sometimes they didn't, they didn't have a coffee pot.  And they would, they would cook their coffee in the skillet, just put the, put the coffee in a skillet and boil it, and you'd drain the coffee--
Speaker 2: No, go, go ahead.
Speaker 1: --you, you drain the coffee in a cup.  And he would drink the coffee out of the cup.  And when he would finish drinking the coffee, he would turn the cup upside down in the saucer.  Now bear, bear in mind that this, this is not perco- you know this is, didn't come from a coffee pot, because the grounds would be in the, in the coffee cup.  He'd turn it upside down.  And then after about five or-- minutes, he said, "Well, let me, let me read this cup.  Let me see what your fortune is."  And he would take the cup, and he'd say, "You know, George [HistoryMaker George Forbes], I see you'll have a long life, you know, and, and it look like, look like something's gonna happen next week."  And we would be, we would just be (laughter) enchanted with my grandfather reading the coffee cup, right.  And that happened, that would, every time he he'd drink a cup of coffee he do, and I couldn't wait to, 'til I got grown so I could read a coffee cup, see what the grounds (laughter) would say.  So that was some of the things that he would do with us.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So there was a lot of interaction with him (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.  And, and, and, and the thing is that, no matter how poor, and these were, we were poor people, there was always something that you could find levity, you know, and find joy.
Story_ID: 623103
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about school.  Now you started at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hyde Park.
Speaker 1: --Hyde Park School, right.
Speaker 2: Hyde Park Elementary [Hyde Park Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee], right across the railroad track.
Speaker 1: And you went there--
Speaker 2: Eight years.
Speaker 1: --throughout elementary school, right?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: You went there throughout elementary school.
Speaker 2: Eight years.
Speaker 1: And now this is an all-black school, of course.  We have to say this 'cause people are gonna be watching this three hundred years from now are not gonna know.  So this is, this is the South in the 1930s and '40s [1940s].  And so this is an all-black school and in the, on the, in Memphis [Tennessee].  All, all your teachers are black, right?
Speaker 2: I never had a white teacher until I went to college [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio].  Yeah, this is, this is all black.  And then when I finished elementary school, we went to Manassas High School, all black.  There was two (clears throat) there was two schools in Memphis at that time, what is (clears throat) Manassas (cough) excuse me, and Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee], Manassas on the north side, Booker T. Washington on the south side.  Then they came in with several more schools, Melrose [Melrose High School, Memphis, Tennessee] and Hamilton [Hamilton High School, Memphis, Tennessee].  You would pass, you would pass white schools in order to get to the black schools.  You could not, you could not go to school with white kids.  You could not sit on the front of the bus or the streetcar.  You sat in the back, and that was understood.  All the teachers were, were black.  They were good, from, from your, from your first grade through high school, and particular in high schools.  And most of the women, most of the teachers were women.  And they would, they would not let you use discrimination or segregation as an excuse for not succeeding, because they knew that you were gonna have a chance to succeed in life, you had to learn.  So they, they made you learn (cough), even if it meant using corporal punishment, 'cause they understood it.  They were subjected to the same type of subjugation that you were.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, how, how big was Hyde Park?  It was a, was it a big school in terms of the physical facility, or?
Speaker 2: No.  It was one through eight, and I would say that there were, there were probably, for every grade, there was probably two or three teachers, for the first grade, second grade, okay.  And, and the higher you got I think there was, when you got to the eighth grade, it was probably two classes, 'cause some kids would drop out.  But it was, it was, it wasn't a small school, one floor.
Speaker 1: So one story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, one story.
Story_ID: 623104
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher in grade school [Hyde Park Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Ms. Johnson [ph.].  Ms. Johnson taught, well, you know, you, they all were fave- Ms. Johnson taught history.  Ms. Lundy taught music, Maola Lundy [ph.], she taught, she taught music, and she taught it, English, handwriting.  The time that, that she taught handwriting I missed that, that's why I can't write good now.  I would, I was picking cotton.  I missed that session (laughter).  I, I learned to write on my own.  I never knew how to make the loops 'cause I was picking cotton from September to November.  So when I got through, that handwriting session was over.  Ms. Cresswell [ph.] was a woman who taught English and insisted that you speak good English.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Man by the name of Mr. Cash [ph.] was the man in the school.  I think they had about two men, but Mr. Cash was the one that issued discipline--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for the whole school, make sure you didn't act a fool.
Speaker 1: Who, who was the principal?
Speaker 2: A man by the name of Lynck, L-Y- L-Y-N-C-K [sic. William Lynk].  He, he liked classical music, and his favorite song was the 'Bells of St. Mary' ['The Bells of St. Mary's'], and, and one time I, they had a program, and I was designated to solo 'The Bells of St. Mary.'  (Singing), "The bells of St. Mary (unclear)"--
Speaker 1: Can you remember it?
Speaker 2: --some of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There was a movie with--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Bing Crosby--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'The Bells of St. Mary' ['The Bells of St. Mary's'], right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember it, and I sang that, and after that I was okay with him (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now were you a talented singer growing up, or this--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I did, I liked music, I really did.  I, I liked music.  And, and, and Ms., Ms. Lundy, I would always sing solos.  And then when I went to high school [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee], I followed with that, even in college [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio] took, yeah.  But I always, always liked music.
Speaker 1: --okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But they, the point is that they, they gave us a broad spectrum of things that was necessary to have successful lives.
Story_ID: 623105
Speaker 1: Did you like art as well?  I see you have a lot of art in your home here, lot of real, really nice art.
Speaker 2: Well my daughter [Helen Forbes Fields], my daughter is, is the art connoisseur.  She picks up, she's on the board of the art museum [Cleveland Museum of Art] here in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were, were you involved in sports in school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  I, I was a, I worked, but I wasn't inclined toward sports.
Speaker 1: You probably didn't have a lot of time, I would guess.
Speaker 2: When I went to high school, no, yeah, I always worked.  I worked in, I remember, I remember the war [World War II, WWII] was going on.  There was a, there was a, a, a military base, a naval base [Naval Air Station Memphis; Naval Support Activity Mid South] right outside of Memphis [Tennessee], a place called Millington [Tennessee].  And I worked in a, a nightclub.  They didn't sell whiskey in, you couldn't buy whiskey in the clubs.  You, they would bring their bottles, and sailors would come into this nightclub.  And it was country music that they played, yeah.  They'd have these country bands.  And we would get the setups, the pop, the Cokes [Coca-Cola], and the glasses.  And these sailors would come in.  They were training out there, and they would come down, and they'd, I remember they'd scratch your head and, and give you a tip, you know.  So I worked there.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: Thirteen.  And then I, but I, I worked mostly in hotels.  I was a cook in hotels and busboy, but I really ended up being a cook.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'd go to school, and if you worked you'd get a permit.  You'd get out of school at two o'clock so you could go to your job, and we'd work until eleven o'clock.
Speaker 1: That's a long time.  That's every day?
Speaker 2: Yeah, five days, five days a week, okay.  I remember (cough) I worked at a place called the Peabody Hotel [Memphis, Tennessee].  And when I go to Memphis now I, I stay there.  I worked there.  They had a club on the top of the hotel called the Skyway [Skyway Ballroom] (cough) excuse me.  And a man jumped off the Skyway one night, committed suicide.  And I got off of work during that time period, and we're going to catch the bus.  And they had what you called the lineup, the last bus of the evening, twelve o'clock  And the police stopped us and said, "Where you going, boy?"  I said, "We're going to catch the bus."  "Where you coming from?"  "From work."  "Where you work?"  "Work at Peabody."  Said, "What do you?"  "As a cook."  And I can, I remember this as though it was yesterday.  He says, "Damn, no reason white folks jump off the Skyway.  Niggers like you cooking," just as though it was yesterday, okay.  No reason, there's no wonder white man jump off the Skyway and committed suicide.  Niggers like you are cooking.  Don't look in amazement.  That was typical for, for that time.  We, we learn how to adjust to it.
Speaker 1: So this is, did you work there all throughout--
Speaker 2: High school?
Speaker 1: --high school?
Speaker 2: Just about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in Manassas High School [Memphis, Tennessee], were, were you drawn to any particular subject?  This is when people start, were you involved, were, were, were you in a college bound curriculum, in a general course, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just general course.
Speaker 1: General course?
Speaker 2: Yeah, general course.  They didn't, they didn't have any college bound, nothing like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They wouldn't, were not preparing young black kids to go to college.
Speaker 1: So that wasn't even in the curriculum at--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --at Manassas?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 623106
Speaker 1: Was there a school for the, the professional blacks or whatever, or the sons and daughters of the teachers into, I know there were some lawyers or some other people in Memphis [Tennessee] of the black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know, I was, I recall one black lawyer when I was in Memphis, one black lawyer.
Speaker 1: Who, who was it?
Speaker 2: The name escapes me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there's no, no black lawyers.  The--
Speaker 1: I guess the generation of the lawyers they, they were in your generation.
Speaker 2: --that's right.
Speaker 1: A.W. Willis and--
Speaker 2: That's, that's right, those guys.
Speaker 1: --Sugarmon [HistoryMaker Russell B. Sugarmon] and all those.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But prior to that, but you know, the, if you were Pullman porter, a schoolteacher, a minister, that was the upper crest, crust--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of black people, Pullman porter, okay.  We had a couple of black doctors, few black doctors.  There's a black hospital, Collins Chapel [Collins Chapel Connectional Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee] now, but that was, but Sugarmon and those guys came of my generation.  'Cause there was no place for you to go to school.  That, no, there was no college preparatory.  At the time that I was going to college [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio], you, if you were, if there were no black schools [HBCUs] doing this, you, the state would send you out of state.  You could go to Michigan, you go out of state, and they would pay the tuition.
Speaker 1: That is if you could be admitted to those schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, if you wanted to, you wanted to be a lawyer, you want to be a doctor.  There was no schools in Tennessee.  You, you couldn't go to, to those schools in, you couldn't go to Tennessee, University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee] and those places, but they would pay the tuition for you to go to school out of state.
Speaker 1: On the graduate level, right, right.
Speaker 2: But a lot of, lot of the undergraduate things they didn't, they didn't have schools in, in, in Tennessee that would teach you these things, engineering, huh, engineering, those kind of things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: From, from the under- undergraduate work, you would, you would go to out of state.
Speaker 1: Did, did you know any kids that you grew up with that went to college, you know, out, out of Manassas [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: That went to college?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, kid became doctors, schoolteachers.  I, I, I, I formed them, would see them all the time when I would go back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, there was determination to make it.  You didn't, you didn't want to live, you didn't want to live like that the rest of your life, you know.
Story_ID: 623107
Speaker 1: Now at Manassas [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee], were you drawn to any particular subject matter the most, I mean, more than, than any other, like math or reading or--
Speaker 2: I had a, had a woman who taught English, Bebe Bowers Fingal.  And she was a, she was a woman that, that drew you to her.  She wanted you to learn.  And she, she taught you in a, in a, in a very loving way.  You didn't want to let her down.  He had a group called the speakers and writers club, and I belonged to that.  And it was mostly boys, and she would call her, call us her big guns.  So you, you, you wanted to, you wanted to make sure that you, that you wouldn't let her down, so we spent a lot of time studying.
Speaker 1: So what would the speakers and writers club do?  What would you do?
Speaker 2: Essays, speak, you know, speak in the assembly.  But she, and it, you know, it, it gave you poise.
Speaker 1: What was the teacher's name again?  You--
Speaker 2: Bebe Bowers Fingal.
Speaker 1: Okay, Bebe, that would be B--
Speaker 2: Bebe, B-E-B-E, Bowers, B-O-W-E-R-S, Fingal.
Speaker 1: Now the last name again.
Speaker 2: F-I-N-G-A-L.
Speaker 1: F-I-N-G-E- G-A-L, okay, all right, okay.
Speaker 2: And then there was another lady by the name of Georgia Quinn, who taught music.
Speaker 1: So you were singing in the chorus or the choir?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  But the idea with them is that they were trying to, they were, not trying to, they were producing well rounded individuals.  And they would--they wanted you to have an appreciation that you could do these things, do it here, then go and do them, do them other places and continue your education, okay.  That's what they really wanted.
Speaker 1: Now did you get opportunities at church for, you know, public speaking?  And, and you know, did they have any youth committees at church that you got involved in?
Speaker 2: No.  Our, our church was a very small church [Princeton Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church, Memphis, Tennessee].  But they would take, they would--what she would do is take us to various black churches in the City of Memphis [Tennessee] to sing--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --big church, Metropolitan Baptist Church [Memphis, Tennessee].  We would, frequently we would go to these places, and they would bring us on as the senior class or choir, Manassas High School, under the direction of Georgia Quinn.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so, did you, were you involved in any other activities in high school?
Speaker 2: I was in plays.  I was in a play called--
Speaker 1: What plays?  Do, do, do you remember what plays?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Lighthouse Nan' [Sheldon Parmer] I remember (laughter) 'Lighthouse Nan.'  Don't ask me what it was, you know.  I was in plays.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Debating team.  We had, she had, we had a debating team.
Speaker 1: So this is like (unclear) yeah, this is 1949 or so?
Speaker 2: I finished in '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: You finished in '49 [1949], okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I was there, was there from '45 [1945] to '49 [1949].
Story_ID: 623108
Speaker 1: Forty-five [1945] to '49 [1949].  Yeah, this is end of World War II [WWII], and we entered in the Korean conflict [Korean War] and all that on a national level.  And so you were in high school [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee] when Jackie Robinson integrated baseball, right?
Speaker 2: That's exactly right, exactly right.
Speaker 1: So what, what'd you, did you remember any special response the people had to it or--
Speaker 2: For Jackie Robinson?
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's like, slavery ending all over again.  That was, that, that was, that was a big thing.  I can remember men, women leaving Memphis [Tennessee], going to St. Louis [Missouri] or Chicago [Illinois] to go see the Dodgers [Brooklyn Dodgers; Los Angeles Dodgers] play.  They didn't come down, they didn't come to, they didn't come to Memphis.  And those were the closest Major Leagues, St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs.
Speaker 1: Did they sponsor bus trips to go down to see them play in these--
Speaker 2: They'd--
Speaker 1: --parks.
Speaker 2: --they'd drive up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you dressed up.  You wore a shirt and ties.  It was, it was, it was like a homecoming, big, shirt and ties, hats on, fur coats, going to see the Dodgers, going to see Jackie Robinson.  Now we had a, we had a, a black team in Memphis called the Memphis Red Sox, yes, what it was.  That was the black league [Negro League], the Birmingham Black Barons, Atlanta Black Crackers, yeah, and they would come in, Pepper Martin and those people.  I been, I been, I had seen them play.  But Jackie Robinson, you'd dress up, drive up to Chicago, drive to St. Louis for pregame series and come back.  People were doing that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The, the black team played in a place called Martin's Park [Martin Park, Memphis, Tennessee].  Dr. Martin was a dentist.  The Martin brothers [J.B. Martin and B.B. Martin], they owned that park.  And there was a team, a minor league team in Memphis called the Memphis Chicks.
Speaker 1: The Memphis Chicks, they were, they, in the Major League Baseball, minor league team?
Speaker 2: Southern, the Southern League [Southern Association].
Speaker 1: Southern League, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They fed into what Major League team?  It was--
Speaker 2: I can't recall now.
Speaker 1: --yeah, 'cause I heard of them, but I can't think of what team it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Memphis Chicks.  I remember, and we would, we would listen to them on the, on the, on the radio.  They'd broadcast on the radio.  Then they had a bleacher section for black people.  They had a baseball player by the name of (Unclear).  One day (Unclear) got, got up, and they were announcing someone hit one over in the coal pile.
Speaker 1: So that's what they called the black part of the bleachers, the coal pile?
Speaker 2: Someone hit one over in the coal pile.
Story_ID: 623109
Speaker 1: When you were a senior, now were you getting any counseling about what you ought to do after high school [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Hm, hm?
Speaker 1: Did you receive any counseling about what you should do after high school?
Speaker 2: We didn't have counselors in, in, in high school in Memphis [Tennessee], not, not in, not black schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what about Ms. Fingal [Bebe Bowers Fingal]?  Did she, did she get, give you some advice about going to school or--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  (Unclear) the teachers in Mass- they were, they were trying to produce an atmosphere that you, that you could, we didn't have any money, right.  We didn't have no money, but they was trying to get in your head that, you know, forget about it.  You got to make it, and you got to get the hell out of here too, but you're gonna do it.  So you would, so, I wanted to be a lawyer.  I always wanted to be a lawyer.
Speaker 1: So, I mean, how, how far back can you remember want- wanting to be a lawyer?
Speaker 2: We, you had to want to be something.  I didn't want to pick cotton and plough the mule the rest of my life or go down there and work at the chemical plant where the black folks inhale all those sulfuric fumes all day long.  So I wanted, I wanted to be a lawyer.  So they, they, they worked around that, speakers and writers club.
Story_ID: 623110
Speaker 1: Can you remember, like, who or what incident inspired you to become a lawyer?  I mean, was it a movie, or, or somebody in the community, or what, what was it?  You said there wasn't no, there's like, one black lawyer, right?  And you said your mother [Elnora Bradley Forbes] used to work for some lawyers.
Speaker 2: I'm pausing because I'm wanna tell you a story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's a young black, a young black boy was on trial for killing a white man.  And as I told you I, I worked downtown.  And I wanted to, I went down to the courtroom to listen to this case.  (Unclear) in the hotel that I worked for the, there was a, a, a lawyer.  I cannot, I cannot recall his name, but he wore, he wore high heel shoes.  He wore high heel boots 'cause he was a short guy.  He wore high heels (unclear) he was a very prominent lawyer, who was defending this, this, this kid.  And I went in the courtroom, and I sat in the back where black people were supposed to sit, in the designated area.  And I went down a couple of days, and I, and I, I just listened to it.  I didn't, I didn't know what was going on, but I listened to him.  And I remember this lawyer telling the judge and the jury that if, he said, "This is a good nigger," and he says, "I can, I can take him home, and, and he'd be all right.  This, this, this is," I remember, "this is a good nigger."
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay, we're rolling again.  So, the judge said this is a good nigger (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, the lawyer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, lawyer, yeah.
Speaker 1: The boy's lawyer.  Said, "You send him home, and I can, I guarantee that."  And I, I recall that, and I can, I can picture this, this, this lawyer now.  He's walking to the courtroom, gray hair.  And they took a break.  The court paused for a break.  Now mind you, I told you I'm sitting on the back row in the colored section.  So I went to the bathroom, and I went into the colored bathroom where I was supposed to go in Memphis [Tennessee].  And as I was at the urinal, the sheriff came in.  His name was M.A. Hines [ph.].  Now I knew all these men because I cooked and a busboy in the Peabody Hotel [Memphis, Tennessee], and they would come into the dining room.  You follow me?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The sheriff came in, and, and then he went to the urinal next to me.  So I said I know I'm not in a white restroom.  So he said, "Nigger, what you doing down here?"  I said, "Listening to the trial."  He said, "You get your black ass out of here.  Don't let me catch you down here anymore."  Public courthouse, black bathroom, black urinal, and I left, I left.  But that didn't abate my desire to be a lawyer.  So I know if I ever went to college, that's what I wanted to do.  But I just always had a fascination with it.  And I would, I would see these men in the, in the hotel in the dining room, say okay.  You'd read about them.  That's a true story that I just told you.
Speaker 2: So, were there any, were there other black people in the gallery watching or too or--
Speaker 1: I was the only one.
Speaker 2: You were the only one?  Okay, so this is something that they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I knew this man because he, he, working in the hotel, I worked, I worked in a place called the Parkview Hotel [Memphis, Tennessee], which was an apartment hotel.  It was a residential hotel.  People didn't live in, they lived in the hotel.  And the law enforcement people would come in at nighttime, and they would be bloody.  There'd be blood on their clothes, where they had been (laughter), they had been beating black people.  And when we'd get off from work, you had to, you had to catch the twelve o'clock line up.  And that was that last, that was that last cars that would, every, every route in the city would come down Main Street, and at twelve o'clock they would all line up.  You had to catch that car, because you missed that you had to wait an hour before you can catch another.  They would only have one bus running per line, per night.  They let the prisoners out of jail at nighttime so they could catch the lineup.  That's when they let them out, and their head would be bloody.  They had bandages on them.  And I'm telling you what I saw, okay.  There's nobody riding the bus, nobody riding the streetcar.  It didn't make any difference to them.
Speaker 2: So this is, yeah, this is, this is Memphis in those days.  That's what, so, so, just back at this case, I'm just curious.  Did, do, do you know if the kid ever got off, or did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, the kid got the electric chair.
Speaker 2: Got the, okay.
Speaker 1: He got the electric chair.
Story_ID: 623111
Speaker 1: So there are big issues seething in Memphis [Tennessee] as you were growing up.
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: There are issues seething in Memphis as you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was horrible.  It was horrible.  I was a busboy.  I was a busboy.  I remember it, I guess these are the things that motivated, that drove me to try to do something in life.  I was, I was a busboy.  I, I worked in the grill at the, in the Peabody [Peabody Hotel, Memphis, Tennessee].  And I remember one night we had a, we had a man that was a manager.  His name was Mr. Carter [ph.].  I was in high school [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee].  His name was Mr. Carter.  It was a decent, decent man, treated you nice.  You know what I mean?  Treated, you know, treated you.  I, I got a frog in my throat, and I was, I was, I was, I was getting ready to go into the dining room to clear up some tables.  And a waitress was coming in on swing, the door swinging come in, and I started coughing.  And, and next to the door was the desk of the manager.  And she told him, "That nigger is getting fresh with me."  Now I'm coughing.  I'm trying to clear my throat, right.  She said, "That nigger is coughing at me, getting fresh with me."  Well, he was sitting there.  I said, "No, I didn't," and I started crying.  I started crying 'cause I know what that meant.  And she told him, "Just (unclear) at him," and he called me over, said, "Go on back to work," say, "go on back to work."  'Cause a white woman accusing a young black boy of being fresh with her, that's, that's a lynching offense in Memphis.  Never forgot that, and I never forgot him, "Just, just go on back to work."  Now that's, that's my background.  That's the Memphis that I grew up with.
Story_ID: 623112
Speaker 1: I was telling you about, about that woman.  I, she's a waitress, a redhead, redhead woman, just told that man.  But it was just he just happened to be, there's the doors.  I'm getting ready to go out, and I stop.  I'm coughing.  She comes in and, "Nigger," and he's there, go back out.  But that was typical of, of the Memphis [Tennessee] attitude.  As young men, as young high school boys, that was, Memphis is, is hot in the summer, it's hot in the spring.  There's nothing for you to do.  You go to school, you come home, and we go up to the corner, the barbershop, the drugstore.  And you stand out on the corner, get an ice cream cone.  And I, I re- I remember, and the police come by and just chase you like you're dogs.  You see the lights coming.  You know, they'd have it on bright lights, and you start running, and you haven't done anything.  "Get off the corner, nigger."  And I remember, I remember, I remember one night, boy named Junior Fisher [ph.].  Junior had a, Junior had a mustache.  He was older than we were.  And they rolled up, and they say, "Come here, nigger."  And they put his head in the window, and they rolled the glass up on him.  And they started the car up, said, "Now, nigger, don't you break my window."  And the car was going down the street slowly, and he had to keep up with it.  And when they got through with him, Junior had a knife in his pocket.  They took the knife, and they put the blade of the knife against his mustache and their finger, and they pulled his mustache off.  Now I'm not telling you what somebody told me; I'm telling you what I saw.  But he had to trot right alongside that car.  They said now, "Nigger, you'd better not break this window."  It's no accident that Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed in Memphis, okay.
Story_ID: 623113
Speaker 1: So, now when you're a senior in high school [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee], then what do you think is your best option, you know?
Speaker 2: Get the hell out of here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got to get out of here.  I, I, there's nothing for me to do here.
Speaker 1: Now did, did you join the Marines (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I, I, I went to, I went to Chicago [Illinois].  I had a brother in Chicago.  I followed, I followed that, that trail, and I spent, think I spent a summer.  And I came back home, but it was nothing to do.  So I had a brother in Cleveland [Ohio], my brother Zeke [Zeke Forbes], and he sent for me, and I came here.  And I came here in '50 [1950] I think it was.  And I stayed with him until I had to go to, was drafted, and I had to go back to Memphis [Tennessee] to be drafted.  And I was drafted in the Marine Corps in 1951; yeah, it was '51 [1951], and I spent two years in the Marine Corps.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, the Marine Corps ni- this is 1951?
Speaker 2: Fifty-one [1951].
Speaker 1: Fifty-one [1951], yeah.  By then, in the interim time, you, just you, you were just trying to figure out something to do, huh, I mean in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Didn't have any money, trying to work, worked a little bit, you know, but--
Speaker 1: So did you like Chicago or--
Speaker 2: Chicago will eat you alive, okay.  Chicago will eat you alive.  I had a, I had a job.  I worked in the, a furniture store on the West Side out in, out in Cicero [Illinois].  I worked in a place called Wallen Fine [Wallen Fine Furniture Company].  I was, I was a, I was the, the porter.  I kept the furniture clean.  But that was just, that was just an interim thing until I could try to get things together, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, in Cleveland, what, what, what did you do in Cleveland?
Speaker 2: I had a job.  I, I, I, I worked in a factory.  I, I worked down in, in the Flats for a while and a place called Cleaners Hangers [Cleaners Hangers Company, Cleveland, Ohio] that made clothes hangers.  That was the first time I ever worked in a factory.  But I knew that I could not keep up with the machines (laughter).  You, you, you, you would, as the time study, I couldn't do that, I just couldn't do that.  In the meantime, I had applied to go to Baldwin-Wallace College [Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio].  Didn't have any money, didn't know how I was gonna do it.  But between the application and the starting of school, I was told to come back to be drafted, which is probably the greatest thing that happened in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Unclear) so, U.S. Marine Corps, I mean, they draft you.  Then you--but did you volunteer--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in the Marines, or could you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --choose--
Speaker 2: No, no, I was drafted.  You're, you're, you're, you're subject to the draft, so I had to go comply with the draft status.  And I think in, in the group that I was in it was about sixty or seventy people.  And they took ten people, and they'll tell you you got to go to the Marines.  They say you, you, you, and they (unclear) I said well, I want to go to the [U.S.] Army.  They said no, you're going to Marine Corps.  So I was sa- selected from the draft to go into the Marine Corps.
Story_ID: 623114
Speaker 1: Now, where did you go to for training?
Speaker 2: Parris Island, South Carolina [Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island].
Speaker 1: I, I couldn't imagine that being much better than Memphis [Tennessee], but.  So, but what was Parris Island like?
Speaker 2: Let me, let me tell you, when I was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when there was ten of us going to the [U.S.] Marine Corps, there was nine white and one black.  I was the only black that was designated to go to the Marine Corps.  You had to go to Nashville [Tennessee].  That's the place of embarkation, whatever it was.  We go to Nashville, and you kept a tra- you, you, you caught a troop train out of Nashville, out of Nashville, going into Parris Island.  Now when I got to Nashville from Memphis, there's a restaurant that feeds, that, that feeds the, the troops.  I knew that I could not go into the restaurant, front of the restaurant, so I had to, so I'm not gonna embarrass myself and things.  So I go to the, go to, just go to the back.  Well, that's what the help, the cooks, the waiters, salad girls, they were all black.  And there's a picnic table in the kitchen that's designated for soldiers and draftees.  Well, in order to compensate for what was going on, the black help made sure you got the best food and all you could eat.  You understand what I'm saying to you?  They knew the white boys in the front, the black here to feed you.  And then we have to catch the train going to Parris Island, South Carolina.  And they would, recruits coming from all over the country, catch the train going to South Carolina.  And I tell you, from the time that I caught that train in Nashville going to South Carolina until I finished boot camp in December, I was never discriminated against.  I never saw discrimination for that two month peri- three month period.  I never saw discrimination.  We had big Marine gathering here in Cleveland [Ohio] this summer.  And I talked to some of the, the Marines, some of the officers, what have you, was, was at lunch with them, and I told them that story.  But I also told them that what the Marine Corps did, (laughter) they treated everybody equally bad.  We were doing a, we were doing a close order drill one time.  They're teaching you how to do left face, right face, to the rear and all that.  And, and the drill sergeant ordered a left face, and a white guy did a right face.  And the, and the drill sergeant jumped over people and knocked him down.  And that was the first time in my life I'd ever seen a white man knocked down.  So I said this is where I belong.  This is where I belong, where they treat you the same.  I have nothing bad to say about the Marine Corps, nothing bad to say about the Marine Corps.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so boot camp was, it was fair, you said, but it's hard--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --but tough.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  They, they taught (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 2: --you to, to survive.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: They did not discriminate.
Story_ID: 623115
Speaker 1: Were you stationed overseas--
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) afterwards.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I finished, when I finished boot camp, I was assigned to south, to Parris Island, South Carolina [Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island].  Everybody is, is, has a, a designated 0300, which is a basic rifleman, everybody.  You have to, that, that is you.  But then you have specialties.  Well, I've given you my background as a kid cooking in these hotels.  And they were drafting people, and they didn't have enough cooks, so they says, I said well, I can cook.  So I, I cooked in South Caro- I cooked at Parris Island, okay.  And that's what I did for the two years that I was in the, in the [U.S.] Marine Corps.  I went to Opa-locka, Florida, right out of Miami [Florida].  And then I ended my two years in Quantico [Marine Corps Base Quantico, Quantico, Virginia], in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], right outside of D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you, were you able to take advantage of any special training in the Marine Corps, I mean, in terms of academic stuff?
Speaker 2: No.  That, that wasn't, that wasn't available--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, when you got out, you went back to Cleveland [Ohio], right?  And--
Speaker 2: I knew, I knew, right, I didn't, I didn't bitch about the Marine Corps.  I didn't bitch about service, 'cause I knew that was my ticket to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Don't have to worry about it.  I knew that, that I would get a check every month.  So when I, when I, I got out in October, yeah, it was October of '53 [1953], and I went to college that following January.  Think I worked a couple, I went back to Memphis [Tennessee], and I worked in Memphis for a couple of months at a Swift Packing Company.  But I knew that starting January of that, that quarter, then I would be in college.
Speaker 1: So you went to Baldwin-Wallace [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, it's here in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  It's in, within the city limits?  It's in Berea [Ohio] in, in Cleveland?
Speaker 2: No, it's Berea.  It's out, it's in the suburb (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 623116
Speaker 1: All right, Baldwin, well, tell us about Baldwin-Wallace [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio].  What's the, why did you choose Baldwin-Wallace?  And--
Speaker 2: I, I don't know.  I, I, I heard about it.  Harrison Dillard was, was a track star, was a hurdler.  And he, he made national news.  And I said well, here's a guy that Dillard could, and I had been in Cleveland [Ohio], and, and he was heralded all over the country, all over the world.  And he was a good salesman for the, for the, for the school.  I read about, so I'll give it a try.  So I inquired, and I was accepted.  But you bear in mind, that's prior to my going into [the U.S. military] service.  They accepted me.  So rather than going back through everything else, I knew I was coming back to Cleveland, and I just, I went out there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a, it was a Methodist school, and I was a, I was a, I was a Methodist.
Speaker 1: So you had a, I didn't ask you this, but, but you had decent grades in schools, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was no, no problem with getting in college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was no problem.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: After I'd been there for a while, I said well, maybe I'll change and go to a black school [HBCU].  But I was, but they, they treated me and they wanted me.  They treated us great.
Speaker 1: Were there other, other black students there too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was about, and it was a small, I think we had about, don't know what the population was, but it was a, had about twenty or thirty of us, full time on campus, got friends that I, I made, still my friends.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is 1953.
Speaker 2: And then I, then, and, and I, I fitted, I fitted into the college.  And they, they, they're very good.  I, I had the Korean [Korean War] veteran's benefit.  And I would, I would work on the col- I would work during the summer rather than coming into town looking for a job.  I painted houses that the college owned, okay.  And they paid a, I painted with the professors.  They paid a decent wage.  And what I would do, rather than take (laughter) said the ladies in the treasurer's office, rather than get paid, because I was staying out there, didn't need a lot of money, I would let my pay ride.  Rather than paying me, I'd, I'd let it ride and apply it to the coming quarter's tuition.  And because I did not accept the money, take the money, I didn't have to pay taxes, income taxes.  So the full wages were applied toward the room and board and, and tuition.  And that went on for 'til--I, I finished college in three years, about three, three years and a quarter.  I went during the summers (unclear).
Story_ID: 623117
Speaker 1: Were there any special teachers or mentors or remarkable people at Baldwin-Wallace [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --that you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.  And, and they, they softened, they softened my concept on race.  Well, they tried to (laughter).  You know, the world isn't a bad- a battleground, and they taught you ideas and concepts.  Fellow by the name Themis- Themistocles Rodis, he, he died some, a couple of years ago, very influential in my life.
Speaker 1: Themistocles Rodis, now, what--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and his last name is R-O--
Speaker 2: D-I-S.
Speaker 1: --D-I-S.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was very, very influential in my life.
Speaker 1: Is there a name, a story behind his name that you know, or--
Speaker 2: He's Greek.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Oh, he was a Greek (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he was, he was a Greek.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And he, you know, and we were very close.  He died about five years ago.  And I, I read about it.  It said Professor Rodis died.  And I went to the funeral.  It was a Greek, Greek Orthodox.  And I, I sat in the back of the church.  And one of the, one of the family members looked back and he saw me.  And he, I can see he told his mother.  When the, when the funeral was over, they were surprised that I was there.  So when I went out, instead of getting into the car, they waited for me.  And I knew, I, I knew his daughters because I went out when I was in council [Cleveland City Council], he invited me to come out one Sunday evening to talk to his, his students.  And, and the daughters was all on my ass about (laughter) my philosophy and what have you.  I remembered them this way.  But, but the family, they just, they just, they were just surprised that I would come.  I said no, he was my favorite professor.  And I went to the car and chatted with the other, and they just thanked me profusely for coming.  But he was a big influence.
Speaker 1: Now what, what did he teach?
Speaker 2: History.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: History.
Speaker 1: What, what kind of history?
Speaker 2: American history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had a, I had a theme in college.  I wrote papers, and whenever I wrote a paper it was always about black people, Black Man Moves West; Black Man in Sociology, okay.  It was, it was, I don't care what class it was, it was always ba- professor always knew they was gonna get a story about black folks, and they anticipated it.  But Themistocles said, "Yeah, you got, you got to, we, we appreciate that.  We want to hear that, but you gotta broaden your concept."  And then I had another, my, my, when I first went to college, I, I thought I wanted to be a preacher.  So my, my counselor was, was a fellow by the name of Ray Stickard [ph.], who was a Methodist preacher.  I tell this story, that one day I was walking across campus.  You gotta bear in mind I'm a [U.S.] Marine Corps veteran.  I tell the story I was walking across campus and cussing like a sailor, and Dr. Stickard heard me and said, "George [HistoryMaker George Forbes], you and the Lord ain't on the same page.  You better try to do something else."  So I say that's when I became a politician (laughter).  But the college was, was, they, they wanted us.  They treated us well.  They treated me well.  I, when I finished my career in politics, they came to me and said we want, we'd like for you to teach out here, and I taught ten years at Baldwin-Wallace, urban problems and political science.
Story_ID: 623118
Speaker 1: Now what was your major in, at Baldwin-Wall- Wallace [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Political science.
Speaker 1: Political science?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It usually is when people are going for law.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You started off trying to do re- religion?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that lasted about a--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a quarter.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And when I taught there, I taught ten years, the money that, that they paid me I never, I had an option to teach in business school, graduate school, undergraduate, or I could teach night or teach day.  I chose to teach in the daytime in the undergraduate, to be right there with the students.  And I, I never took the pay.  I set the pay out.  I put the pay into a scholarship fund for kids that, that didn't have money, because sometimes when I was in college my, my funds were short, and they would send for me, said, "Come here and sign a form so you can--," there'd be enough money to pay you, you could take the classes.  So I, I left that, and it, and the fund is still there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you, you taught there from what year to what year do you think?
Speaker 2: I got, I, I, I left city hall in '89 [1989], and I started teaching in '90 [1990], I think it was, and I taught ten years.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Who, now, since you were a political science major, was there a political science mentor there or someone who you learned, who taught you political science that you admired, or, or what was it?  It may not have been.
Speaker 2: Well, you had it right.  I wanted to be a lawyer, and, and that's a lot of political science people go into law, okay.  But I was always fascinated by the, the political world.  I, my mother [Elnora Bradley Forbes] I think said they could always vote.  They always voted.  And one of the most, I, I remember the, the first time I voted, I voted for Estes Kefauver, was a senator from--
Speaker 1: Kentucky.
Speaker 2: --from Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Tennessee?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother, I was home, and we talked politics.  My mother said she voted for Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower].  I was shocked.  I was, I was just completely shocked.  Said, "You voted for a Republican?"  But my mother's generation, they were Republicans.  They all were Republicans because Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln], Lincoln, it went back to Lincoln freeing the slaves.  My generation of people were influenced by Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] and the things he did for, for black people.  I was absolutely shocked.  But she always voted.  So, it was the process that, that, that, that always concerned me, and, and, and I liked it.
Story_ID: 623119
Speaker 1: I wasn't around during the time when, I, I, I was around during the time when people, it wasn't unusual for there, there, there to be black Republicans, but I wasn't around during a time when my father's generation and you and others became Democrats.  And was there, how did you resolve or reconcile the Dixiecrat faction as Democrats with the rest of the Democrats?
Speaker 2: Well, before the Dixcrat- before the Dixiecrat there was the Roosevelt/Truman Democrat, okay.  There was the Roosevelt/Truman, and, and--
Speaker 1: Well, Dixiecrats were still in it.  I mean, even when, even when they were--
Speaker 2: No.  I know what you're saying.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I know it, but hear me out.  The Dixiecrat really came in with Strom Thurmond and those guys, and they just set themselves apart and Eastland [James Eastland] and all those and Stennis [John C. Stennis] in Mississippi.  We were, we, we were aware of that, but Truman [President Harry S. Truman] eliminating discrimination in the [U.S. military] service.  That was Truman that says, and, and no, no (unclear) and, and Truman was, wasn't no liberal, okay.  But he did the right thing for black folks as far as he was concerned at that time, wasn't no great earth shaking thing.  And Roosevelt's [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] program extended to poor people of all colors with the, with the NRA [National Recovery Administration], the CC camps [Civilian Conservation Corps], and, and, and black folks could, could join those things, but it was nothing earth shaking.  But I think that they negotiated around the Strom Thurmonds and the, the Stennises from Mississippi.  And that, that--
Speaker 1: So you, you had to look beyond those kind of people.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that, that was the, the motivation.  But the main thing was that we ate.  We could eat under their policies, you know.  We could eat under their policies.
Story_ID: 623120
Speaker 1: Okay, now, had you started taking notice of Chica- of Ohio politics and Cleveland [Ohio] area politics when you were in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --college?
Speaker 2: When I was in college I was hip.  I was the president of the Young Democratic Club [Young Democrats Club], Charlie Vanik [Charles Vanik]--Vanik was the congressman, and there's a lady in council named Jean Murrell Capers, who was a Democrat, and I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were the president.
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: And you were the president.
Speaker 2: Of the, of the Young Democrats on the campus, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, now that's, that's significant in a sense that Young Democrats have a black president that, I mean, is, is, is it not?  That, that, isn't significant that--
Speaker 2: You know, young white kids are Republican.  You know, it wasn't, wasn't a great achievement.  You know, I kind of got it by default (laughter), you know.  And--
Speaker 1: So this is Young Democrats at Baldwin-Wallace [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio].
Speaker 2: At Baldwin-Wallace, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So would you say that Baldwin-Wallace was sort of, was, was a liberal campus in--
Speaker 2: When I went, when I went, that, that wasn't on my mind.  I just wanted to get an education.  The politics of it didn't, didn't concern me.  It just happened that I knew I was a Democrat, and, and wasn't that many.  So, that's how I became the president of it.  And we would bring speakers out.  But here, here, here you are (unclear) you, you don't want to just sit there and don't do anything in college.  And that's when I got the, the concept of the entree that maybe, may, there may be something.  When Jean Murrell Capers came out invited, there was a big issue in Cleveland about putting fluoride in the, fluoride in the water for the teeth.  And she was a, an advocate of that, or she might have been against it.  But we brought her out to, to, to talk about it.  Charlie Vanik was a congressman.  We brought him out to speak.  So, I, I, I, then it, it became interesting, it became interesting.  That's when my, my concern about politics began to grow.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So people are addressing the issues of the day on the campus.
Speaker 2: And would come to campus.  They came in at, you know, I'm, I'm from Memph- I'm a kid from Memphis [Tennessee], but you invite him, sure.  So I would see them, would meet them.
Speaker 1: Now, now would you, would the other area schools bring people out to, and would you go to those schools to hear lectures?  And you got like--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --Case Western Reserve [Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio]--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --these other--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --Wooster [College of Wooster, Wooster, Ohio], all these schools around--
Speaker 2: I was just--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --at Baldwin-Wallace.  And I, and I took that same concept when I'd taught.  I taught two days a week, daytime on campus and, I had kids to transfer from other colleges to come (laughter), to come to Baldwin-Wallace because I was teaching.  They, they knew of me in, in politics in city hall.  But I would, I would teach one day, and I'd bring a speaker the second day, and everybody.  Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] would come, came out there; Dick Jacobs [Richard E. Jacobs], who was a big builder in Cleveland; Voinovich [George Voinovich], you name it; Lou Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes].  I wanted the kids to have an opportunity to meet these, these kinds of people.  And it was, and sometimes, I know when Jesse came, the, the whole school--the whole student body was invited.  We moved it into, he moved it into the, the auditorium.
Story_ID: 623121
Speaker 1: So in fifty--you're at Baldwin-Wallace [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio] from '53 [1953] to '56 [1956] I guess.  Is that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '57 [1957] fif- fif- I went to, January '54 [1954] to June of '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you were in school when Brown v. the Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] came down, right?
Speaker 2: Wore, wore, I wore a suit and tie to class that day.  Did you hear me?  I wore a suit and tie.  I had one suit, put my blue suit on and with a yellow shirt and a blue tie, all day long.  Say, "Why are you dressed up?"  I said, "I'm free today."  I wore a suit and tie on Brown v. Board of Education.
Speaker 1: You, you were taking particular interest in that.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And were, were you a, a part of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] at all--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in, in those days?
Speaker 2: No, not then.
Speaker 1: But you would read, you would follow it in the news and, and--
Speaker 2: It's been my, it's been, it's been my life.
Speaker 1: --any of the black students organize themselves in any way on, on campus into--
Speaker 2: I don't recall at that time.
Speaker 1: --I know this is before the days of the black--
Speaker 2: That's right.  This--
Speaker 1: --student unions and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: But what did, yeah, but with twenty students on the campus, you would think that somebody would have the idea that, I mean, that, that you all sit together or, or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --interact together in any way.
Speaker 2: No, we didn't.
Speaker 1: You didn't, okay.
Speaker 2: This is, this is pre, this is pre-civil rights.  This is just beginning to, to hap- this is pre-civil rights.
Speaker 1: Now you were staying on campus, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a black roommate, white roommate?
Speaker 2: No, I was a veteran.  I had a private room.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so that wasn't an issue.
Speaker 2: That, the [U.S.] Marine Corps say I was entitled of that, yeah (laughter).
Story_ID: 623122
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, we're talking about, talk- we were talking about Brown v. the Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]. When you were in college [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio] and found out it and wore your suit and tie, did you have any idea of the players, you know, in terms of Thurgood Marshall and--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --those, okay.
Speaker 2: You got to understand, I have always been motivated.  I always, this has, this has been from the time that I was a boy.  My, my teachers in high school [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee] said, "It's, it is not right that you have to sit on the back of the bus.  Don't settle for this," okay.  And I didn't like it either.  I didn't like being chased by the police.  So the, the race issue have always, this is, this was in, instilled in me from the time that I was kid.  So, that's where I got it from.  But I'd watch, I'd watch the, the, the factors that went into Brown.  I'd watch the cases.  I watched Thurgood Marshall.  I watched the fellow at Howard University [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] that was behind the case.
Speaker 1: Charles Hamilton [Charles Hamilton Houston] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, I'd watch that, watch all of that.  So I was, I was waiting for the decision.  And when the decision came out, that was great, I know that was a, a momentous day in the history of this country as it pertain to black people.
Speaker 1: So you were in college also when, what, I guess you, you were there when Little Rock [Arkansas] was, was--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the crisis in Little Rock when they--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --attempted to integrate--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Central High School [Little Rock, Arkansas].  Well, they did it, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I'm, I'm--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --all of that was, all of it was part of my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You also are in school I guess when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] started in Montgomery [Alabama].  And the Montgomery Bus Boycott in '56 [1956], yeah, you'd be towards your, the end of your college days--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I guess when that started.
Speaker 2: I, I met, I knew him.  He would come to, he came to Cleveland [Ohio] for the, for the Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes] registration drives.  I have a picture of him.  We're on, we're on the back of a truck, you know, a semi.  Ben Branch had the Operation Breadbasket band [Operation Breadbasket Orchestra and Choir].  They would come and go to shopping centers and go to grocery stores.  And the band would play, and Dr. King would get up and say you gotta go register.
Speaker 1: So this is later on in the '60s [1960s], right, we're talking about, not at the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: --col- in college.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--
Speaker 1: I, I was talking about in college.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, in, in college, so you, you, I guess you gotta be seeing this on TV and radio or the news--
Speaker 2: My, my, my classmates, my friends, my black friends in college always kid me about being involved in struggle.  They'd always kid me, 'cause you know, any time there was something that was going on, that I would be an advocate of it.  But I knew that was, I knew that was gonna be my life work, life's work.  That's what I wanted it to be, my life's work in some kind of way.
Speaker 1: All right, so, now what about, was, Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio]. That's close by too.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, it's, Ober- Ober- Oberlin is about thirty miles from us down, west of us.
Speaker 1: But I know Oberlin always, it has a history of agitation for social change and that sort of thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was that, that was their mission, Ober- Ober- Oberlin and Antioch [Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Very liberal schools.
Story_ID: 623123
Speaker 1: I'm just wondering if it, I mean, well, so, of the people that came out to speak, who inspired you the most, in terms of--
Speaker 2: You mean in college?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: No, we were not in Oakland [California].  We were, we were, we were, I think I would be accurate in saying that Baldwin-Wallace [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio] was basically a Republican school, okay.  That, that, that, that wasn't, you're there, you were there to get an education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The racial thing was, was my passion.  And the professors, some of the professors understood it and, and, and pushed me to do that.  But I don't recall any, Jim, Jim, Jim, there was a young black civil rights worker with, with, was with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  He was a preacher, Jim, who went to Baldwin-Wallace, and they, they loved him.  The name will come to me before the if you're--
Speaker 1: Oh, is he the one that led the sit-ins down in Nashville [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I know who you're talking about.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I can't, I can see him in my head, and I can't--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --think of his name now.
Speaker 2: He was a--
Speaker 1: Jim--
Speaker 2: They would bring him.  He was a, BW alum, loved him.  But other than that, that was--
Speaker 1: Yes, he was mentioned earlier this week too, a couple of times, Reverend James, James--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was a--
Speaker 2: I know him because his, his, his family--
Speaker 1: James Lawson.
Speaker 2: James Lawson.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: His sister belonged to our church, you know, at the Methodist church (unclear) and he would come and preach.  But he was, he's an alumni of BW. They loved him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He led, he led the Freedom Riders, basically (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was, but he was more of a strategist for their movement, in addition to being an activist.  He planned, he knew how to plan and do those things, yeah, Jim Lawson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so, did you graduate with any special honors or anything, or--
Speaker 2: I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: You know, but that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was a full grown man.  You gotta be man.  I'm a [U.S.] Marine Corps veteran.  We wanted to get the hell out, you know.
Speaker 2: All right, so this is 1957?
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957].
Story_ID: 623124
Speaker 1: So what did you do af- excuse me, after graduation?
Speaker 2: I had to have a job, so I got a, I got a, I got a, make sure I got me a teaching certificate, something to fall back on in case, you know, you had to do something.  I got certified as a teacher.  Then I got married.  Mary [Mary Fleming Forbes] and I, we married (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, well, tell us how you met your wife.
Speaker 2: It was in college.  We went, we went out one night, group of us, black guys on campus, and we went to a party.  And my wife had a red dress on (laughter).  And you know, black men love red (laughter).  So I met her.  And she was a social worker.  She worked at a children's home here in Cleveland [Ohio].  And we started dating.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I, then I got a job at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service], 'cause I had to have a job, started working at post office for the summer.  A lady by the name of Frances Bolton [Frances Payne Bolton] was a congressman in the district that I lived in, and she was a Republican.  She had been a congressman for years, and I went to her, went to her office.  I need a job, and they gave me a job.  From that day until this day, I have all, I'm a Democrat, I have always been able to get along and, and always had contact Republicans officeholders, from that day to this one.  And they have, they have never asked me to be a Democrat, a Republican.  But I've always been able to work with them, do legislation with them, even to this, this governor we have now [John Kasich].  And I have a, a history and a reputation of a fellow that crossed party lines to make sure things are done.  She didn't know me, didn't ask me it, just sent me down to see the postmaster, and they gave me a job.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what, what did you do at the post office?
Speaker 2: I drove a truck.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because they get, that's, driving a truck would fit around a schedule for me to go to law school [Cleveland Marshall Law School; Cleveland Marshall College of Law, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Had, had you been accepted to law school at that point?
Speaker 2: I went to law school in '58 [1958] I think it was.  Yeah, I went to law school in '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: So that's about, that's, that's pretty close afterwards, after graduating from Baldwin-Wallace [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958], '59 [1959], yeah.  But I'd, I had a teaching certificate, so I taught, I taught school.  I said I was I, I was a substitute teacher.  I went to law school.  And what else did I do?  Law school, taught school.  I did something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seems like enough already, but, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you did something else on top of that?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.  It was three things that I did.  I taught school, went to the law school, taught school, went to the law school, taught school, went to law school, and drove a mail truck.  Taught school, went to law school, and drove a mail truck.  That's what it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Yes.  Is that enough (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.

Speaker 1: So you went to school at Cleveland Marshall--
Speaker 2: Cleveland Marshall.
Speaker 1: --Law School [Cleveland Marshall Law School; Cleveland Marshall College of Law, Cleveland, Ohio] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's now Cleveland State [Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, it's now Cleveland State.
Speaker 2: It is now Cleveland State.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: Cleveland State took over the law school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, I know there's a Marshall Law School [The John Marshall Law School] in Chicago [Illinois] too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were they affiliated at all?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: All right, so, Cleveland Marshall, is that a, that's also the school that Carl Stokes attended too, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Most of the lawyers in Cleveland [Ohio] went to that school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so what was it like?  What were you, what did you learn in law school?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a lawyer, man.  I wanted, I wanted to be a lawyer.  I'm, I'm just, you, you, you looked at, you looked around, and you saw successful black men particularly, and, and, and the law profession has been good to them.  It gives you a chance to express yourself and to spread your wings and do things.
Speaker 1: Who were the black lawyers in Cleveland then when you were going to law school?
Speaker 2: Jim Willis [ph.], who was with the supreme court, sat with him on several cases, and Dollree Mapp case [Mapp v. Ohio, 1961], Jay White [ph.], Clarence Rogers, who eventually we end up being partners, quite a few other, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Stokes brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Lou Stokes [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes] was a prominent lawyer.  Norman S. Minor was one of the top criminal lawyers in the country, Norman S. Minor.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, so, now was law school difficult for you?
Speaker 2: Doing all that I had to do, doing all that I was doing, you know, it was, if, if, if I had of, well, eventually I did, but it was, it, it, it was no, it was no easy, it was, it wasn't a snap.  You had to buckle down.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you, you had put a lot of pressure on yourself by working and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But by the time I, by the, by the time I was winding it up, I think I had left some of those jobs, yeah.  But I had a good friend.  I had a very good friend.  His name was Jake Head, James Head [ph.].  He's one of the, he was one of the smartest men that I, that I've known.  Jakey was an Internal Revenue [Internal Revenue Service] agent.  He could take a pencil and just do things with it.  And when I was in law school, we would, we had a study session together.  It was about three or four of us that studied together.  And he knew that I was driving a truck.  And we'd have a study session on Saturday mornings.  I would, and we'd study all day Saturday.  I would, if it was at my house, his house, I would do the cooking.  We, we studying all day.  And we'd get the food or eating steak, rice, whatever, and I would, I would cook.  And while I would cook, they'd make sure that I'd get the points in law that was necessary, okay.  And then if I needed additional study time, he would sit down with me and make sure that I could, I knew what was going on.  And it was almost like he took me under my wings, and he got me through law school.
Speaker 1: His name is Jake?
Speaker 2: Jake Head.  He's, he's, he's--
Speaker 1: Head, okay.
Speaker 2: --he's deceased now.  James Head.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But just, Internal Revenue agent, just, just smart.  And we became lifelong friends, our families, our children.
Speaker 1: So he became a lawyer too, or, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, never practiced.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Didn't want to practice (laughter), just, just went to law school.
Story_ID: 623126
Speaker 1: Are, are there any professors that, that come to mind from law school [Cleveland Marshall Law School; Cleveland Marshall College of Law, Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: No, they, they had, the dean of the law school was a man by the name of Wilson Stapleton [Wilson Gesner Stapleton].  He was a, the mayor of Shaker Heights [Ohio].  And he was, he was the perfect man to, to be the dean of an urban city law school.  He understood your problems, and he wanted, he wanted the school to be successful, but he wanted the students to be successful.  So it was, it was an open invitation to, to be with him.  And the fact that he was mayor of a suburban city, it all converged on the point that here's where you belong.  He didn't, didn't, didn't automatically kick you out.  Go back and do it all over again.  Here's where you did, wanna try to make it right, okay, just a great guy.
Story_ID: 623127
Speaker 1: So you're in law school [Cleveland Marshall Law School; Cleveland Marshall College of Law, Cleveland, Ohio] from '59 [1959]?
Speaker 2: Fifty, fifty--
Speaker 1: Fifty--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) damn, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958] to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958] to sixty [1960].
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960].
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960].  Is that about right?
Speaker 2: No, four year, law school was four years.
Speaker 1: Four years okay.
Speaker 2: Sixty-two [1962], yeah, 'cause I took the bar in '63 [1963], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay, so you, you were in law school when they had the big election where there are actually some, still some significant black Republicans in the 1960 election, Kennedy Nixon [John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Richard Milhous Nixon], right?
Speaker 2: Who was that?  In '60 [1960]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Kennedy and Nixon--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --JFK won and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I, I was about, I, I, I always said that when I got elected, wasn't but two important people in the world.  That was me and J.F. Kennedy.  We're gonna solve the problems of the whole world.  Yeah, so he was (unclear) the same time.
Speaker 1: So, so did you consider him inspirational?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  All that nonsense about a Catholic and all that nonsense.  I think it was, we used to have a, a big, we'd have a roast, what kind of, steer roast in Cleveland [Ohio], the big thing in the Democratic Party was steer roast out at the place called Euclid Beach [Euclid Beach Park, Cleveland, Ohio].  And he would, he appeared out there at the same time that I was running for office.  Oh yeah, everybody was with Kennedy.  All black folks with Kennedy.
Story_ID: 623128
Speaker 1: Now, 1963, the year that you came out of school, was a pivotal year in African American history.  I mean, so many things went on that year.  I know CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] had heated up things and was, they, they were doing sit-ins in all the major cities.  You had the murder of Medgar Evers that summer, March on Washington that summer, the bombing of the church in Birmingham [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama] was that fall, as well as the death of John Kennedy, the assassination of John Kennedy.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This, so do you have any reflections from '63 [1963], the year that you came out of law school.  When you're coming out, it seems like with a, a lot of changes on, you know, as you're emerging from law school.
Speaker 2: I was, when, when, when I came out of law school, I was the, never tried a case.  I'm a lawyer.  I was a legal advisor for a group that was called the Freedom Fighters.  I had been a, I had been working with the City of Cleveland as a housing inspector, and I had a friend of mine named Lou Robinson [Lewis Robinson], who was also a housing inspector.  Lou became known as the rifle man because Lou advocated violence in order to achieve equality.
Speaker 1: What's his last name, Lou?
Speaker 2: Lou Robinson.
Speaker 1: Robinson, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, he wanted his rifle, and they started calling him the rifle man.
Speaker 1: After the TV character, yeah?
Speaker 2: No, after his avocation that he's gonna carry it.  He wasn't gonna be discriminated against.  He was gonna carry his rifle.
Speaker 1: I know the TV show was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'The Rifleman' (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) (Unclear).
Speaker 1: But he was a, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Lou scared all these white folks to death in Cleveland.  They said we got to do something about this man.
Speaker 1: So would he, would he be, I guess he had a similar reputation that Robert F. Williams did in North Caro- you know wrote, 'Niggers With Guns' [sic. 'Negroes With Guns'].
Speaker 2: But he was, he wasn't, he wasn't really that bad, okay.  But we had some, you know, we had, what's the boy's name?  Ahmed?
Speaker 1: Fred Ahmed Evans.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, but the organization was the Freedom Fighters.  That was the group, Lou, Lou is from that group and had some young liberal whites in the group.  And I was the (unclear) my reputation was beginning to open up as a advocate of change.  And so I was their legal director of it, the legal advisor.  And it was, it was good for me so I could get some business, so in case somebody needed a lawyer, they could, you could hire me.  I didn't know what the hell I was doing, so I, I would go to the book.  But that, that was my initial participation when I got out of law school.
Speaker 1: Did, did, did you intend to be a civil rights lawyer as such?  I mean is that what your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not necessarily.  I mean, I've always known that I was gonna use that for, for a platform, life's work, but I also wanted to, wanted to make a living.  But nobody was busting down the door.  So I began to, your name be in the paper a little bit, you know.
Story_ID: 623129
Speaker 1: What was the agenda of the Freedom Fighters?
Speaker 2: Oh, Cleveland [Ohio] was a very polarized city.  They had a river that separated east side from west side at that time.  All blacks lived on the east side; all whites lived on the west side.  It was a lot of things that was going on.  Had a guy, a policeman by the name of Pas- Pedsak [ph.].  I think it was P-E-D-S-A-K, killed seven black people, okay, killed.
Speaker 1: This, this is in what year?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: During this time.  He didn't kill them all at one time, but he had killed seven, seven black people.
Speaker 1: So there was a need for the Freedom Fighters.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they were little more outspoken than the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And then CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] came around, had a woman by the name of Ruth Turner was head of CORE.  They were very strident.
Speaker 2: You said Ruth Turner.
Speaker 1: Ruth Turner, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, she, she headed up CORE.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Cause CORE was really active in Ohio in those days.
Speaker 1: Yes, they were.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So CORE, I know they did demonstrations and sit-ins for jobs and that sort of thing.  Is that was what they were doing here in Cleveland?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: I know CORE's agenda in Dayton [Ohio] was to integrate city government and--
Speaker 1: But we also had a, we also had a, an educational problem.  And--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --no, an education problem.  Black kids were being taught in the basement of churches.  They, white kids going to business schools for white kids.  And CORE was very instrumental in that, making the change in the education status of black kids.
