Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Where you from, ma'am?  You must be a Southerner.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm from HistoryMakers and our director, she teaches us those kind of, ma'ams.
Speaker 2: Lorraine Patricia Marigold Isadora Toussaint, for the record (laughs).
Speaker 1: Lorraine, can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: L-O-double-R-A-I-N-E, Patricia, P-A-T-R-I-C-I-A, Marigold, M-A-R-I-G-O-L-D, Isadora, I-S-A-D-O-R-A, Toussaint, T-O-U-S-S-A-I-N-T.
Speaker 1: Okay, well--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) My mother [Janet Angela Beane Toussaint] named me all those names because I think she planned to have four or five children, but when she was done with me, she says, I'm, I'm done.  I'll just give her all the names.
Speaker 1: Okay, so is that the story behind all the names?
Speaker 2: I think that's what my mother said at one point.
Speaker 1: Are you named after any relatives?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, Patricia is my Aunt Yola's middle name.  Lorraine is just a name that they thought went really well with Toussaint because it's relatively French.  It was either going to be Lorraine or Suzette.  I'm glad it was Lorraine.  I mean I, I don't think I would have turned to be a Suzette.  Patricia, Marigold, I have no idea.  Isadora, I think is my Saint name because I was born Catholic.  I was certainly christened Catholic.  And Toussaint is my, my dad's name.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Four, April 4, 1960, and place of birth is Trinidad, in the Caribbean.
Speaker 1: Yes, what place in Trinidad?
Speaker 2: San Fernando, Upper Hillside, San Fernando.
Speaker 1: Upper Hillside, okay.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm an actress.
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a good question.  It might be what, October 6--not, ooh, October--(laughs).  You know, time is so relative and I rarely know what day--date it is, and sometimes I don't even know what day it is.  It's October 6, 2004.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?  And you don't have to give your address.
Speaker 2: Yes, you are in my home in Los Angeles.
Story_ID: 14447
Speaker 1: What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color?  I would say--I just redid my house so--and a lot of it is in yellow tones, so I would say anything warm and buttery feels really good.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Ooh, I think I might.  Well, you know, my stewed oxtails are high up on the list of favorite foods.  I'd say for the moment, stewed oxtails are, are pretty high on the list.
Speaker 1: We should pause.
Speaker 2: (Tape interruption)
Speaker 1: Okay, we are rolling.
Speaker 2: All right, next question is what is your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 1: My favorite time of the year I would, I would say is summertime.  I like it hot.
Speaker 2: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 1: Ooh, vacation destination?  Well, Paris [France] is my favorite city thus far, but any place that has a warm ocean.  So any--well, Caribbean, Mediterranean, I'm any place literally that I have water warm enough to run into without feeling it, bathwater warm.  So probably the Caribbean.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, do you have a--this is the last question, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 1: Curse words or (laughs), no.  That's the Actor's Studio.  Do I have a favorite saying?  No, no, I, I actually don't.
Story_ID: 14448
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Janet Angela Beane, J-A-N-E-T, Angela, A-N-G-E-L-A, Angela, Beane, B-E-A-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you know her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: It's 11-2-1934, November 2, 1934.  And where was she born?
Speaker 1: She was born in Trinidad.
Speaker 2: Okay, same place?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: San Fernando?
Speaker 1: San Fernando, Upper Hillside.
Speaker 2: All right, okay, now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I can go back to maybe my mother's grandmother who was a Carib Indian.  And if I'm not mistaken, her name was Rose.  And Rose was, I believe, if not--I believe she was full-blooded Carib, the way they described her as an old woman.  She was, she--very, very, very white hair and very long white braids that came all the way down to her waist.  And the indigenous people of the Caribbean of Trinidad were the Carib Indians and the Arawak Indians.  They are no longer there, but--
Speaker 2: You know, now, Trinidad, unless I'm getting my history wrong, it was the first island that [Christopher] Columbus landed on.
Speaker 1: Oh, gosh, you know, what I--that's going back, Hispanola.
Speaker 2: Or, and he was--.
Speaker 1: It was one of the earlier ones.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was one of the early ones for sure.  And I don't remember that.  I, I used to know that as a kid, that kind of history.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was some place, I think some edifice there that Columbus had built or something that's still there, I believe?
Speaker 1: No, that's not, that's not Trinidad.  But Trinidad was one of the earlier islands because the--Trinidad is, its sister island Tobago, which they're not connected, but they, they share the same government.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So, well, what do you know about the ancestors on their side?  Are there any stories about them or?
Speaker 1: Oh, gosh, yes, you know, I come from a matriarchal family and so just sort of a, a line of these incredible women, starting with, from memory--not my memory, but my, my mother's memory, Rose, who gave birth to--Audrey, who was my mother's mother.  Audrey gave birth to my mother, Janet and her sister, Yola (ph.).  And my mother--is my mother, gave birth to me.  Now, Audrey, whose mother was Rose, as I said, was, I--there was an interesting story about Audrey, which was, she was--it was back in the day when, when, when you were, when you're going to be married, the banns had to be passed and they had to be recorded in the newspaper.  And my grandmother, Audrey, was then in love with this man, my Aunt Yola's father, who agreed to marry her.  Now, Audrey was--the banns had been, had been placed, and they'd been passed, and, and just before the wedding, he said to Audrey, my grandmother, Rose, and, and her sister--I don't know her real name, which was Ya-Ya (ph.)--that's the only name I know her by, were--they were landowners.  They had several acres of land, a good chunk of which I grew up on.  And this fianc√© of Audrey's said, "Well, you know, I would like that land signed over to me in order for me to marry Audrey."  And they said, "Well, why?"  He said, "Well them one, Audrey is pregnant, and number two, I won't marry her unless you sign this land over to me."  So I guess the women in the family, they got together and talked about it and talked about it, and decided that they were not gonna sign over their land to this man to marry Audrey.  So basically, on the eve of the wedding, he left and abandoned her.  So there she was and, oh, my gosh, I mean if my mother was born in 1934, you know, this had to have been 19--in the 1910, 1912 somewhere in there, the teens.  So--and coming from a highly col--we were still colonized by the British then, you know.  It was just not--it was unheard of to have an unmarried woman like that, pregnant and unmarried.  So my, my grandmother Audrey literally hid in the house for nine months.  But maybe not nine months, by the time she started showing, she didn't leave the house.  And it's reported that when people came to the door to actually visit, there were times when she actually hid under the bed for, for several, several months until, until she gave birth to my Aunt Yola, which--and I can't imagine what that, what that must have done to a child, you know, and to a child's psyche to be born in that kind of shame.  So there giving birth to my Aunt Yola, and then my mother came along--no, my mother's father came along--Mr. Beane, a year later, came along, and wanted to marry Audrey.  They didn't know very much about Mr. Beane except that they knew Mr. Beane didn't want the land, and was willing to marry Audrey with this young child.  So Audrey married Mr. Beane--immediately was pregnant, and within months Mr. Beane was gone.  But at least, she was a married woman and her child was legitimate, which was very important back then.  And so that's my aunt and my mother.  Now, when my aunt--and my aunt was ten years old and my mother was eight years old, Audrey, their mother died of consumption, basically leaving them orphaned with, at the time, their grandmother, Rose.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's tuberculosis nowadays, people would call it.
Speaker 1: Exactly, and so there's my mom and her sister at eight and ten.  Their mother's just died, and they've been left to their grandmother.  Forty days literally to the day after my grandmother died, Rose died.  So within forty days, they--my mother and her sister Yola, lost their mother and their grandmother, and so basically grew up the way a lot of, you know, black kids grew up back then.  They just--the family just absorbed those, those two children, you know.  They, they went from, you know, this house to that house to that house until my Aunt Yuna (ph.) who was a, a very influential person in my life.  Aunt Yuna was, oh, gosh, let me get this right, she was Audrey's sister.  Aunt Yuna was kind of an amazing woman because in the twenties, she was a traveling nurse.  I mean I sort of come from this long line of women that have been, you know, professional women for as far back as I can remember.  Aunt Yuna was a traveling nurse in the Caribbean, which meant that she went from island to island, many of those islands had no doctors or no nurses and no hospitals even.  And so, by boat, she would go from island and island and administer to people and, and became kind of a traveling doctor in lieu of a doctor.  So she was based in Grenada and Carriacou, which is a little tiny island off of Grenada, where there was a hospital.  There was a hospital on Carriacou.  And so that was her base.  So she traveled in--but when her sister Audrey died, and then Rose, who was her mother, died, she pretty much stopped that and came back to Trinidad to take care of these young, these young girls, her sister's children and pretty much gave up what was, what was a real career at that point to take care of my mom and my Aunt Yola.  And my mother, my Aunt Yola and Aunt Yuna raised me.
Story_ID: 14449
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your mother [Janet Angela Beane Toussaint] talk about growing up and going to school and during--you know?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, you know, we were under the British system which was a very difficult system to be a part of. And my mother was very musical.  She was a proper church girl, you know.  She played the organ and the piano in the church, and she was--my Aunt Yola was very, very bright, very, very bright.  As my mother would say, my Aunt Yola had the book sense and my mother had the common sense--I hope my Aunt Yola never sees this tape. (laughs)  Oh, well, there it is.  But growing up, you know, pretty much--school in the, school in the islands then, it was just, you know, it was uniformed and you worn uniforms, and it was under the British system.  It was very, very, very, very strict.  You know, you, you were beaten pretty regularly.  I certainly was, by the time--and that was still in my day so certainly in my mother's day.  But when my mother--she finished what was then high school.  It's a very different system because it was just standards as opposed to grades, and it was--it's, it's based, very differently.  She, she finished off her basic education.  My Aunt Yola went on to university in, in Canada for many years after that.  But somewhere after you could stop, my mom stopped.  And then they decided that she was the one that was going to learn a trade of some kind.  So she became, at the time, a secretary.  So she learned things like shorthand and bookkeeping and went into, went into that instead, and was, and was a sort of shorthand, secretary, bookkeeper kind of person in her late teens.  She was also very handy.  She was also a seamstress.  And my--very musical, because she taught herself how to play the piano and taught herself to play the organ.  And I think I still have my mother's piano.  I, I've lugged my mother's piano around with me (laughs) at every house, every apartment I've been in, including my five-floor, walk-up in Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan [New York, New York]--very good friends that dragged that piano up those five flights of stairs.  And where, where I live here now, it wasn't that easy either.  So yes, it was hard, you know.  My mother was not, she was not particularly any brainy, but boy, she was very skilled and very smart and very savvy, very savvy business woman and highly, highly creative.
Story_ID: 14450
Speaker 1: You've talked about the British system in Trinidad and being difficult, now just before we started rolling we were just discussing all the activists that come out of Trinidad--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Stokely Carmichael used to live right down--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Stokely Carmichael.
Speaker 2: Stokely lived, and we didn't call them blocks, but if you were to refer to them as block, he lived two blocks down the road, maybe two, three blocks down the road because you came down my street, which was Black Street.  I grew up on 10 Black Street, so after that you came down my street which I just went back to Trinidad, and as a child it looked like such--it was, you know, I could, I was never old enough to get to the end of that street.  I went back at, last year, and I drove past the street, and I thought that's like a little track.  It was like barely a street it was so small.  But Stokely--if you got to the end of my street and you turned right for one block, Stokely was on that next block.  I remember when Stokely came, Stokely Carmichael came to Trinidad in 1960s, when he came back to Trinidad and brought with him the advent of Black Power.  Ooh, buddy!  God, you know, they burned all of High Street, and, you know, all of, all of downtown got burned because of the Black Power Movement and, and things were blown up and set fire to--and a little tiny island, I mean it was unheard of.  Well I remember about Black Power mostly was that, you know, we had curfews, I mean, there was a real state of emergency when Stokely came back because he was raising some havoc down there.  I remember wanting an Afro.  I must have been, what--seven [years old]?  And at the time, sort of jumping all over the place.  But at the time my mother had migrated to America and left me with Aunt Yuna and my Aunt Yola and wanted to grow and Afro, to do an Afro. (laughs)  They had Afro picks and, and the closest I got to was my grandmother's kitchen fork.  While she was taking her afternoon siesta nap, I decided to fork my hair into an Afro. (laughs)  And she got up early and caught me in the bathroom with this Afro fork, her forks and this "fro" and just whupped the tar out of me cause she said, "I will not have any of that Black Power stuff in my house, not in my house, my house (imitating with accent) no Black Powders, Black Power people, and ruining the country, they terrible."  Oh, she just whupped me so hard.  That was, that was my memory of Stokely Carmichael.  He got me a whupping.
Speaker 1: Okay, and a lot of black Americans don't realize he's from Trinidad.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: But him and [Dr.] Tony Martin and you go back in the old days, C.L.R. [Cyril Lionel Robert] James--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Sure, C.L.R. was a, was an activist way back--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Ras [Tafari] Makkonen [Emperor Haile Selassie I], Eric [Eustace] Williams--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) George Padmore, I mean we could go on and on of all these writers, yeah--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Extraordinary writers and, and activists came out of the Caribbean.  Oh, yeah, it's--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right out of Trinidad, most--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Out of Trinidad because Trinidad is still kind of a melting pot and it really is still the, sort of Mecca for political activism, and we really do still lead the Caribbean in terms of that.
Story_ID: 14451
Speaker 1: Tell us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name Rolly Cleopheus Toussaint, R-O-L-L-Y, oh, my God--Cleopheus, C-L-E-O-P-H-E-U-S, maybe?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cleopheus Toussaint, T-O-U-S-S-A-I-N-T.
Speaker 1: All right, now, in terms of the name Toussaint, is there a story behind that--is that just the French name, Toussaint, or did it have anything to do with Toussaint L'Ouverture--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) You know, I like to, I like to say it does because my grandfather on my father's side came from Haiti.  And my grandmother's people came from Grenada and Martinique.  So I would like to think that there is, you know--and we certainly were warriors.  My grandfather, I'd like to--I would like to think that there is some affiliation with, you know, "The" Toussaint L'Ouverture.  So I, but I say so, I say it does because, you know, I feel Toussaint in me.  I feel Toussaint in my blood for sure.  My grandfather, my, on my father's side.  My father's father, my God, my grandmother, I believe eighteen children.  And my, my father, I believe, is one of eighteen, fourteen of whom lived.  And so my grandmother's house--and she was a country woman.  My mother's [Janet Angela Beane Toussaint] side was city; my father's side were country.  My, my grandmother on my father's side, with all these children, earned a living by growing produce.  You know, it's the typical with the basket on her head, walking miles with, you know, a string of children in tow to market to sell her goods, her yams and her potatoes and her plantains and mangoes and whatever fruit that she grew because they came from a little village called Moruga, which is in the very, in the furthest South of Trinidad.  Actually--
Speaker 1: Spelling?
Speaker 2: M-O-R-U-G-A, in the town, the, this--it's the section of Trinidad called Moruga and the little part that they lived in is called Lalune, which is so beautiful because it's on the sea.  And I just, this year visited Lalune.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: L-A-L-U-N-E.
Story_ID: 14452
Speaker 1: Trinidad was colonized by the French, the Spanish and then the English, so that you'll find a lot of, a lot of French and Spanish mixed into the language, the patois--just the terms.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The English basically won it from those other European countries?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Basically, it got traded or sold or however they did it.  But the French were there first, then--no, the Spanish were there first, then the French and then the British, because Carnival, Carnival--Trinidad has the best Carnival in the world.  That came out of the French tradition.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And our Christmas celebrations, which is very Spanish came out of the Spanish traditions.  And interesting about Trinidad, it's real, it's a real racial melting pot, which really influenced me because when I came to his country I had no concept of racism.  And that was because I grew up--until I was ten anyway, in a country where, number one, black people were the majority, and now, some forty-plus years later, half the population is East Indian.  And so there's East Indian, black, Chinese, European mix that is, that lent itself not ever realizing that there was, there was any sort of racial prejudice because intermarriage was very normal, to see an Indian woman and a Chinese man or a Chinese man and a black woman, you know, with an Indian grandmother was very, very typical.  So it took me a long time to understand race prejudice when I came to the United States.
Speaker 2: So there's no oppression of the black population by the British, I mean the white British in Trinidad or it wasn't, I mean historical (unclear)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Well, historically there was.  Sure, sure, I mean we, we were born out of slavery.  But I believe it was not nearly as, as, as violent as American slavery.  And also we've had our independence in Trinidad since nineteen--ooh, I'm gonna botch this date, but I think it's 1963 when Eric [Eustace] Williams brought us into independence.  And since then we've been pretty--we've been self-governed and, and primarily black-governed.  I mean that's changed in recent years because it's now black and Indian governed, but no, by the time I came along in 1960--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) So there's none of that stratification like you'd find in, say, in Jamaica at one time, they've had like a clas-, the whites and then they have a class in the middle, as a buffer of coloreds, and then they'd have like the blacks at the bottom and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: No, we didn't have that kind of overt class, class system.  But we still, you know, we still suffered from, you know, light skin, dark skin.  We still suffered from, the lighter you are, the better you were.  I mean there was a time when, you know, you could only get jobs in banks if you were light-skinned or if you had good hair or the more European you looked.  We still, we suffered from that for many, many, many, many, many years, sure.  And certainly when the Indians came in--an interesting phenomena is taking place now because the Indians were brought to the, to Trinidad as indentured servants when the British came, because by then black slavery had been abolished.  But the Indians with their, their men-serve-,  their man, men-servants?  Is that the right word?  But they brought their indentured servants from India.  And so a lot of Indians migrated, continue to migrate to Trinidad.  So now there's a, there's a weird kind of racism going on there based on, on the blacks and the Indians because the Indians were--God, it's amazing how human nature always needs to kind of up itself on the backs of other people because the, now the black slaves found--could find someone that was below them, which were the Indians, who were the, who were the latest immigrants.  So for many, many years, the Indians were the grunts, you know.  They were, you know, what--they were the 'niggers of the Caribbean'.  So now, they no longer are.  So it's becoming very interesting politically, but still racially, it's a wonderful place to be from because it's, it's a real melting pot.
Speaker 2: So there's no civil rights issues of, about where you can go or anything, none of that kind of existed?
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, none of that.  None of that existed, certainly not by the time--Eric Williams is an amazing man because he, he was a real revolutionary in terms of the way in which he, he brought that country out of, of being under the British rule and setting us on our--firmly on our feet.  I think to this day we're, we're still the most economically stable island in the Caribbean, the most politically stable.  So, and that's a great deal of what Eric Williams did from the get go.
Story_ID: 14453
Speaker 1: Now, did your father talk about growing up, cause he grew up in more of a rural part of Trinidad, right, than your mother?
Speaker 2: You know, my dad, my, my parents [Rolly Cleopheus Toussaint and Janet Angela Beane Toussaint]  were divorced by the time I was, what--A year and a half [years old], so then I didn't grow up with my father.  I, I forged a real, a wonderful--God, it's been--I have to, I've got to call my dad.  I've forged a really wonderful relationship with my father, but it's been hard won.  I mean I was very angry with my dad for many, many years, as many kids are when they've, you know, they've been left.  So I don't know my father's side of the family as well as I know my mother's.  Interestingly enough though, the--I've had such a real need right now (pauses) gosh, because, maybe it's because I'm on this--I'm on the verge of motherhood myself, because I'm in the process of adopting, adopting a baby, and so this might be interesting somewhere down the road for--if for no other reason, but for my kid or kids.  But I've, I've been wanting to know about my father's side of the family.  And so just this year went back to Moruga [Trinidad]--well, not even went back.  I had never been to Moruga.  Well, my mother and my father said I've been to Moruga once when my father stole me.  He stole me from my mother, he--technically, he kidnapped me (laughs) and took me, I think it was reputed to Moruga.  But I was so small, I don't remember.  But as an adult going back to Moruga to see where my grandmother raised those children, and, you know, I drove into Moruga.  And I tell you, it was like going back in time, you know.  My--I drove into town, and I didn't know where I was going, and they just said, "Well, come to town and ask anybody.  They'll know where we are."  And I drove in, and I said, "Well, you know, I'm looking for the Toussaints."  She said, (imitating accent) "Yes, yes, which one?"  I said, "Well, I'll take anyone of them."  She says, "Well, yes, there's a big fat, red one down the street; just keep going down, you go around by the church and if you turn left, you will find the big fat, red one.  She got a house--."  So I hope my Aunt Olsa never (laughs) sees this tape.  So she--I go down the road, and, you know, I pull up to this house that I'm supposed to pull up and right, coming out the house is, a big, fat red woman. (laughs)  And red means, for those who, who don't know what that means, light-skinned.  And I swear she's got my face.  She's--all of us have got the same face.  And, you know, she's, you know, missing teeth, and she's just the happiest, fat woman, and she just like scoops me up in these big breasts and just, you know, she knows I'm Rolly's daughter.  And that was my Aunt--now, let me get this right cause there're so many of them, that wasn't Josephine.  Oh, Modestine (ph.), that was Aunt Modestine because she was one of the twins, Modest and Modestine.  I wish I could name all my father's siblings.  I can't.  And so Aunt Modestine was, she's just great.  And, and so I spent this time at my father's brother's house.  His name is Al-, Alwin (ph.), and his wife, Shirley.  And they own a shop, and they live upstairs of the shop.  And downstairs is the shop where they sell, you know, crackers and cheese and, and box lunches.  And she cooks and, and I--it's like another world, you know, and I remember waking up the first morning there.  And I have a clock radio that has chicken sounds on it.  And I--it's dark outside, and I'm thinking well, and I'm hearing this racket outside.  And I'm going, "What is that noise?"  And I thought, "Oh, that must be the alarm.  Why doesn't somebody turn off that alarm?  It's just too loud."  And this thing keeps going and going and going, and somewhere in my half-sleep/half-awake brain, I'm thinking, "Well, that couldn't possibly be real chickens."  I woke up the next morning, and I look out in the yard, and there are maybe thirty chickens in the yard.  And they are making a racket, and, you know, I have a cousin who's out there feeding the chickens and the pigs and the, and, and, you know, Aunt Modestine is the 'Corn Lady'.  I mean I had such a great time.  I love, I love these people.  I can't believe that I've--it's taken me this many years to really connect to my father's side.  I've had my mother.  Aunt Modestine is the corn lady.  She, on a Saturday night, I hung out with her in the corner of town, which is the corner that has the rum shop, which is basically a bar, kind of, that sells other things; dimly-lit, wood, you know, it's all made of wood.  And Aunt Modestine is on the porch of the rum shop, and she's got a big, big pot, a big caldron kind of pot and a table and a bench, you know.  And she's sitting there with her apron, barefooted, and, you know, these are feet that, feet that have worked in the fields.  And she's got a big pot of boiled corn.  And boiled is--you know, you season that corn up with, with pigs feet, and, and chives and, and ginger and garlic.  So it's big pot of boiling corn, and people come along on that corner and buy--for two dollars--two Trinidad dollars, a corn from Aunt Modestine.  So we sat out there awhile, and we just talked about, I don't know, stuff--the cousins, the aunties and, you know, she's the corn lady on the corner.  Well, it was corn that night.  The next night I asked her what was she gonna make, and I asked her, "Well, where'd the corn from?"  And she said, "Oh, I grew, I grew the corn."  So she grows the corn.  The next night she was making souse--pig, pig's, pig foot, chicken foot souse, which is precisely what it sounds like.  It's the feet of the pigs and the feet of the chickens that you, you make into a souse.  And a souse is basically a pickled, brine that's made with onions and cucumbers and, (laughs) it's really good.  It's really, really good.  So next night was gonna be pig foot, chicken foot souse with black pudding.  Black pudding is--I guess that's a British dish.  That's blood pudding--It's, it's sausage made from the seasoned pig's blood.  That's also really, (laughs), really--politically incorrect to eat, but really, really good.  So, you know, every night she's got something cooking on that corner.  And that's how she's known in that town.  You know, I have a cousin who owns a little video shop next door, and I mean my--one of my aunt's is--she's a water carrier, which means she carries water on the road for the government men that are building the road.  So she works for the government as a water carrier.  And her daughter is a bush cutter.  She goes before the men get there, and she cuts the bush.  So you still see them on the side of the road with their sickle cutting the bush with a cutlass, clearing to make the roads.  And so, you know, it's a little village where at five o'clock in the morning the boat comes in with fish, and it comes in at four o'clock in the morning and at five o'clock in the evening.  You get fresh fish 'cause they're bringing it in, and they're, they're pulling the sain.  Pulling sain is watching the fishermen bring in the nets.  It's a marvelous visual because you get the call--you know when the boats is coming in, and if the--it's fish that's been cast in a huge net.  And you, you somehow get the, the first set of the net--no, you, the men swim out and begin to bring the net in.  And you get the first leg of the net in, and men on two sides of the net--you grab and you pull, you grab rhythmically and you pull, and you grab and you pull.  And eventually, a long line of men, I mean on either side maybe ten on either side of pulling the sain.  And as you get to the end of the line, at a certain point of the beach, you run back to the front of the line, and you start to pull again.  So that it's always this unbelievable rhythm of pulling sain, and when they're pulling, literally, I've seen it where the men are almost horizontal to the ground, pulling the sain and digging the heels into the sand.  It's the most beautiful thing, and, and eventually you start seeing all the fish coming up, and you, you go and you choose your fish.  It doesn't get much fresher than that.  And you go home, and you cook it.  And they cook some of it up on the beach right there.  I saw them do that this year.  So it's a very rural--and this what, some forty, fifty year--my dad is seventy-two, so can you imagine what it was like back then?  You know, we're talking no running water, no electricity.  You know, if you had a well in town, you, you went and you collected water and you fished and grew things, and you sold things at market.  And this is how my dad grew up.
Story_ID: 14454
Speaker 1: I think he had a very basic education.  He became--my dad [Rolly Cleopheus Toussaint] was an electrician, primarily.  He worked for the big power plants in the Caribbean.  (laughs) I'm hearing my dog snoring.  And so my father really also got out.  He was one of the ones that got out.  And when my mother [Janet Angela Beane Toussaint] and my father met, my father must have been twenty--my mother was twenty-four, twenty-five, and my dad must have been twenty-six, twenty-seven, and at the time he was a professional weightlifter, because he was just this big, hunk of a boy.  I thought--I always tell my mother, "It was just like lust."  I know it was lust cause he had like the body of life, which she took one look at him and said, "I want a piece of that."  And they were ill-met and ill-matched, certainly because my mother had a certain level--I don't mean the word, sophistication in the kind of classist way, but she was really was kind of a delicate flower.  She was a pianist and a painter and a musician.  My father was just a, a hunk.  I mean he was really a, a man of his time, you know.  He was not a gentle man, particularly.  He was not a--he was pretty rough and tough, you know, and his views on women were, again, a man of his time, which was not always the kindest.  And so--but that's who he was--that's who he is.  He's a country boy, and, you know, he's gone back to Lalune [Trinidad] late in his life because that's where he, I think wants to end his life, right on the sea.  We've just bought a house together, right--in Lalune, right on the ocean.
Speaker 2: Okay, you really didn't see that much of him growing up, and--?
Speaker 1: No, and every so often, I would see him showing up at school when my mother migrated.
Story_ID: 14455
Speaker 1: Do you have a, an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have, I have several.  I have several.  I was a very psychic child.  One of the, my early memories was--I remember my mother [Janet Angela Beane Toussaint] leaving to come to America.  That was a, that was a terrible memory.  I remember--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) You were about seven, you said?
Speaker 2: I was about seven, um-hmm.  But I think somewhere--I don't remember whether it was before this or after my mother left.  It was--I was, I always, what they call 'dream straight'.  You know, they say children, especially in the [Caribbean] Islands and in Africa, you know, if you were "born with a veil [amniotic membrane] over your face," you're supposedly one of those kind of psychic kids.  And I think I, I was one of those, and, and was very, very psychic as a child, and still am, and to the point where, (laughs) they were a little afraid of me because I, I would dream really straight.  I mean like, dead on.  And so I remember one morning waking up, and my, my great aunt, who's like my grandmother, Auntie Yuna, she would sit on the front porch every morning and sun herself because the early morning--the sunrise sun was the best sun of the day.  And so Aunt Yuna was sitting there sunning herself, and I came out, and I sat in the living room, which was kind of next to the porch.  I said, "You know, I dreamt last night that, that this vase broke and the water came running out."  And at the time, there was this sort of very large goblet, a very large orange goblet that my--I think my Aunt Yola had sent from Canada or something, something fancy.  And so she said, "What?"  And I said, "I said, I dreamt last night that this goblet broke, and all the water came spilling out."  And as I turned to her to say that, literally, out of nowhere, this vase just cracked, broke, and it--at the time, it was filled with sand.  And all of the sand just kind of poured out onto the table, and I just remember my, my Aunt Yuna calling me, telling me to go and get the coconut oil.  And I did.  And I would sit on her lap in moments like that, and she would just rub me from head to toe with this coconut oil, and she--I guess she must have been praying too while she was rubbing because she was mumbling something.  And she was (laughs) rubbing me and pulling and throwing away.  She would rub and pull and throw away whatever, there was just--they just had that way of rubbing and pulling and, and, and letting it go; all the limbs out, because she just, you know, thought I was touched, (laughs) and wanted to make sure I was touched by the right thing.  So I have lots of those kinds of dream memories of waking up and being able to foretell, you know, so and so is gonna happen or this person's sick, this one has gone to the hospital last night; this one was in an accident, and I used pray I didn't dream about them.  So those are some of my--walking up the hill from my school, you know, government school, I lived the top of a very steep hill, learning how to walk up a hill.  The only way to walk up a hill was if you walked it like this--you never walk straight up the hill.  You walk sideways on the hill.  It's too exhausting to go straight up, little memories like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sounds--the ocean, cooking on the ocean, spending the night in the ocean, cooking under the sand under the coal pot, coal on coal, with my aunts cooking, burying food in the sand and cooking it under coals.  Sounds were birds, of course; the sounds of [Reverend] Billy Graham coming across on the radio, you know, on a Sunday, oh, gosh, the voice of Billy Graham.  (Sings) "Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine."  And being a little Catholic girl, I had no concept of what that was.  Smells--curry, you know, because by then we had a big Indian population.  So curry was always--roti [flatbread] and curry was, maybe my favorite smells.  Sounds, gosh, yeah, those are some the, the ocean and--oh, my favorite sound to this day, I think is rain on galvanized roofs.  And one of my favorite and unusual smells is the smell of rain on hot galvanized roofs because then they--it will get so hot.  And it would rain in the rainy season, and then the steam would rise from the galvanized, and there's nothing in the world that has that smell, except that.  I can't even describe it.
Story_ID: 14456
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little girl?  What kind of a little girl were you and what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: I was a very repressed little girl.  I was a frightened little girl.  I went into hiding as a little girl because I, I grew up under the British system, which meant that children were seen and not heard.  And the only way to really reach a child, they believed at that time, was through fear.  It was never through love.  You feared your parents.  You feared your teachers.  I remember my mother going to school, the first day of, of big girl's school, which was a--the government school, saying to my teacher at the time, you know, "Beat her.  Don't be afraid to beat her.  You're her parent away from home, you know, if she gets out of line, beat her.  You have my permission."  And they did, every single day.  And so I was now, I suppose an abused child, I mean back then, it was just school.  But I was just afraid all the time and couldn't learn, not because I wasn't bright.  As it turned out, I was very, very bright, but I just so afraid that I was paralyzed.
Story_ID: 14457
Speaker 1: And because my mother [Janet Angela Beane Toussaint] had migrated to America, by the time I was seven, she migrated as a domestic, which is the way in the '60s [1960s]--there was a whole movement to bring up girls from the Caribbean as domestics and mother's helpers and nannies.  You just brought them up, and they came to your house, and they worked pretty much as indentured servants for two years, and at the end of those two years, what they got was their green card.  And so they became permanent residents in the United States after this two-year service.  And through the entire '60s [1960s], this was a, a huge migration here.  And so I actually have great photos of my mother in, in Boston [Massachusetts].  She worked for the, a family called the Nahums (ph.) who were friends with Eric Siegel who wrote 'Love Story'.  I remember my mother coming back and telling me she'd met the writer of the movie 'Love Story'.  The Nahums who were, the husband was a doctor.
Speaker 2: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 1: Oh, gee, I surely couldn't.  They were Na-hums.  The Nahums, and thought that they had gotten a nice little native girl from the [Caribbean] Islands and were most disappointed when they got my mother, who was sharp as a tack and, and musical and creative and (imitates accent) "And wasn't takin' no crap." (laughs)  So, you know, they tried to get her to do all kinds of things that wasn't her job.  And I remember my mother telling a story that, you know, she said, well Dr. Nahum came to her said, "Janet, you just--you don't want to see--don't seem to want to clean the toilets."  And she says, "Well, Dr. Nahum, that's not my job."  He says, "Well, I don't see what's wrong with that, Janette," (laughs) that's what he called.  He says, "I--I'm--at the hospital, I clean shit and piss and pus all the time."  And my mother turned to him, and said, "Well, the difference between us, Mr.--Dr. Nahum, is that you intend to make shit and piss and pus your life's vocation.  I do not." (laughs) So it was--they were most shocked when my mother, at the end of two years not only got her green card, but on the, on her days and her nights off, went to computer programming school and came out a fully-trained computer operator in 1969, 1970, I mean which was kind of unbelievable.  So she was that kind of gal.
Story_ID: 14458
Speaker 1: I gather that your mother moved there [to America from Trinidad] to better her education and to do--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yeah she did, oh sure.  Because when they [parents Rolly Cleopheus Toussaint and Janet Angela Beane Toussaint] were divorced, my, my mom wanted to make a better life for herself and a better life for me.  So, and the way--only way she could come to America was on her own as a domestic.  So she had to leave me behind for those first--for those two years.  And she came back for one year, and then went away for another year, while she got herself together.  And so in that year, it was very tough because I was just very, very sad, very unhappy and so frightened.  I, and I was, you know, this, the soul of an artist was in here, the soul of a, of a healer and a, and, and a, and, you know, I was this psychic, sensitive, artistic kid in this atmosphere of, of terror.  And so I didn't thrive.  I was most unhappy, and being an only child, it was tough.  So my childhood years, I just remember them being very, very quiet and very hidden.  I felt like I was hiding out.  And that's exactly what I did until I was ten, until I came to America, and then I came out, I came out.  I just came out.  Suddenly, it was safe to come out because, you know, I was really being terrorized by my teachers and at that time, there was no place to turn if you were being quote, unquote "abused" in, in the schools because the belief that that's the only children understood was beatings.  So if you came home and said, "My teacher beat me," they'd ask you, "What for?"  And they'd beat for what, whatever the teacher beat you for too.  So it wasn't safe as being--for me being a child.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were able to come to join your mother in America when (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) But here's where--yes, I did, but here's where I became an artist.  My mother was really kind of an amazing woman.  She was--I remember my first concert she took me to.  I must have been somewhere--six, seven.  And it--she made me sleep all day because I had to rest up for the evening.  And she--it was my first violin concert.  It was a violin solo, backed by a steel drum orchestra.  And I heard--and there was also a pianist, and her name was Winifred Accra (ph.)--my God, I can't believe I remember that name.  And I heard violin music for the first time in my life and wanted desperately to be a violinist, and said to my mother, "I've got to be a violinist."  And my mother, God love her, enrolled me at that time, in violin school.  And so I played the violin for a short time until I was--I started failing in school because, primarily, because my mother was away.  I was just being traumatized, and they decided, my aunt, it was foolishly, that the way to get me to do better in school was to stop the violin, not to kill the teacher, which is what they should have done.  Well, not killed her, but maimed her at least.  Mrs. Ryan, oh, my gosh, she was a terror--there's a special place in Hell for her, and I hope she does see this tape. (laughs)
Story_ID: 14459
Speaker 1: So how, how did you feel that you learned that you could actually join your mother [in the United States], I mean, what did you--?
Speaker 2: Oh, my God, it was like, oh, my God, oh, because this particular, this particular Mrs. Ryan used to corner me in school.  She didn't like my mother [Janet Angela Beane Toussaint] for very specific kinds of reasons.  My mother was a great beauty, and was in love a man that Mrs. Ryan objected to, I gather.  Anyway, she used to--Mrs. Ryan used to corner me and tell at school that, you know, that I was so black and ugly that my mother would never send for me, that my mother could never love me, and that she was gone forever, so don't look for her sending for me.  She was just a, a hateful woman.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, that is hateful.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It was, it was just hateful.  I mean when I say that, you know, God help her, because she would sort of corner me at recess and pinch me and just whisper these awful (with emphasis) things to me.  And so I started believing this.  I started believing that my mother was never gonna send for me because, you know, children don't have a concept of time.  And so it just seemed forever, those two years, three years, whatever it.  It was, it was forever.  And so when I (laughs) got the word that my mother had indeed sent for me, I remember the, the most overpowering emotion was, "Mrs. Ryan, you are wrong."  Secretly I thought, "You were wrong, (whispers), my mother does want me.  And I'm, I am gonna get so far away from you."  And I did.  It was glorious.  I was wearing this little--I remember the morning I left Trinidad.  I remember it as if it were yesterday.  I was wearing a little yellow blouse, that I didn't care for, but it was an outfit.  And it was a black jumper--and it was the first time in my life I had worn black, because black was only for grown-ups.  It was a little black jumper that had little yellowish appliqu√©s right down here, (laughs) and it was black with little sleeves here, a little high-neck collar, which I didn't really like, but it was the kind of stuff that I--it was black, and the whole idea that I was traveling in black.  And I had black and white patent leather shoes, which I wasn't quite sure about the white.  I kind of wanted them to be plain black 'cause I thought the black and the white was a little bit busy--real fashion sense, even then, and yellow ribbons, of course, in my hair, 'cause I always wore ribbons even to go to sleep (laughs) and little white socks that turned down, that had a little frill around the ankle.  And I had a little purse, a little black patent leather purse cause that was back in the day when you flew BOAC [British Overseas Airways Corporation], and Pan Am [Pan-American World Airways, Inc.] and there was another airline that flew to Trinidad.  And you dressed to travel.  My mother wore hats and gloves when she traveled.  So I remember that morning and being told that I had to go and "Tell all the neighbors good-bye."  And, ooh, my God, I tried to look sad like I was leaving my neighbors, but Lord, I was so happy 'cause I was going to see my kin, see my mama.
Speaker 1: So you had to meet your mother in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: In New York, that's right.  By then, she had moved to New York.
Speaker 1: So you flew by yourself?
Speaker 2: You know, I always thought I flew by myself, but I was talking to my aunt most recently, and she said, "Oh, no," I flew with her.  I don't remember her.  I just remember being in black and flying on an airplane by myself.  So I believe Aunt Yola if she said she took me.  I vaguely remember her delivering me to my mother, but yes--started flying when I was ten.  And then I, I wanted to be a--after I'd been on a plane for the first time, I wanted to be stewardess.  And my Aunt Yola said, "Don't be ridiculous, they're glorified waitresses in the air.  That's--you will not be a stewardess."  So I, I showed her.  I turned into an actress, which was equally hateful. (laughs)
Story_ID: 14460
Speaker 1: Brooklyn, New York in 1977--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Nineteen-seventy, 1970, okay.
Speaker 1: 1970, that's right.  You're ten years old, and you're going to join your mother [Janet Angela Beane Toussaint], and what did you think of New York?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I grew up in this sort of very middle-class, Caribbean ocean-island, kind of life, very British, high tea at four [o'clock P.M.], that sort of thing.  You know, tea at the Hilton [Hotel] occasionally for my birthday [April 4th], and we moved to New York.  And we moved to Brownsville [neighborhood in Brooklyn], which is like a serious ghetto.  I mean ghet-to (with emphasis) because my mother was working at the time, God love her, ah, my mother, God bless my mother--two jobs--one 'til about three [o'clock P.M.] and then one 'til about eight at night--went from four to eight [o'clock P.M.].  And so it was this flat, downstairs of, I guess, what was a brownstone maybe, that was dark and, and, and bars on the windows in this little one-bedroom.  Mommy and I slept in the same bedroom and just, you know, this little--it was just this tiny little one bedroom, that was just miserable.  I didn't know it was miserable then.  I mean looking back on it, I think it was.  But I didn't, I didn't feel miserable.  I was with my mother and I was in America, but it was very different, very, very, very different.  Snow for the first time and winter for the first time, went shopping for a winter coat and boots, and there were just wonderful--Mr. Softee [ice cream], what a concept.  Oh, my God, the ice cream van comes right up to the house, oh, loved that.  Utica Avenue, shopping on Utica Avenue and, oh, gosh, you know, there's a huge Caribbean population in Brooklyn--still is.  You know, there are more Caribbeans in Brooklyn than there in the Caribbean.  And so I felt like there was a community, but where I lived, oh, my God, and the kids were the hardest thing to get used to because the kids in America were hooligans.  They were thugs, and they were, they were hood kids too.
Story_ID: 14461
Speaker 1: So, you know, I remember the first fight I ever got into was the very first summer I came to America because my mother [Janet Angela Beane Toussaint] had to do something with me during the summertime because she was working all day, and I couldn't--and although I was a latch-key kid, I came home and I cooked and got myself ready for bed by the time she got home at eight [o'clock P.M.].  In the summertime, I--she had to do something with me.  So she sent me to St. John's Day Camp [Cold Spring Harbor, New York], which means they picked me up in the morning on a bus or she dropped me off someplace and they, they took me on outings all day, and then dropped me back.  And then I came home.  And I remember my first fight, it must have been the first week (laughs) at St. John's Day Camp, and I was just, you know, this little Caribbean child and I had the thi--a very, very thick accent.  And I just was very, very shy because I really didn't want to talk to anybody because, you know, every time I talked, they laughed.  This little girl in the back of the bus going back and forth, about the third or fourth day she decided that--you know how kids are cruel, she's gonna, she was gonna get me.  So she's sitting behind me on the bus, and she's telling me, to my chagrin, she's telling me, "You the one going after my man, ain't you?"  She must have been, what, eleven [years old] or something.  "You the one going after my man.  I see you the way you looking at him.  You, you, I'm gonna kick your ass, 'cause you are not gonna take my man."  And this little girl taunted me about "Her man" all, for, it felt like two days, for two days because every time she'd see me, she was gonna, she would threaten, she was gonna kick my ass 'cause I was trying to steal her man.  To this day, I have no idea what this girl was talking about.  And I was so chagrined at the use of the word "Man".  "My man," 'cause nice young ladies never used that term, "My man," not where I came from.  And the fact that she thought I wanted "Her man" was just like, I wanted to dig a huge hole and crawl in it.  I don't know whether I was more shamed than scared.  So we're coming home from some pool expedition one day, and she says to me, "Well, you know, as soon as you get off this bus, I swear to God, I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna kick you ass as soon as we get off this bus; just wait till you get off this bus," (whispers) and get off the bus."  And I thought, "I'm gonna have to do something, I--this girl is gonna, quote, unquote 'kick my ass'."  And so I thought, "Well, okay, this has to be dealt with now."  My mother had bought me some new clogs, clogs, and I so loved these clogs, these wooden clogs.  And I thought, "Well, the only way that I'm gonna avoid getting my 'ass kicked' was if I jumped her.  I need the element of surprise.  She's never going to expect this because I certainly don't expect that I can do this, but I'm gonna have to do something."  So I'm coming home on the bus, listening to her taunts--she's jabbing me, jabbing me, jabbing in the back--my back with her finger.  And so the bus stops and I realize, "I have got to now get off this bus first.  If I get off the bus first, and I get to the front of the stairs, I can trip her when she gets off the bus, and I have some advantage."  So the bus stops and now she's got all the other girls, her posse, and they're all--they all know something's gonna go down 'cause she's got them all riled up.  And I get off the bus and I run off the bus first, and they think I'm running.  I get to the bus, and I hide right by the bottom of the stairs, and as she comes running off the bus--'cause she thinks I'm running away from her, I trip her as she steps off that last step.  And she lands on the ground, and I think, "If I can get her on the ground, I could beat her down with my clog." (laughs) Oh, my God.  And I do.  I get her on the ground, somehow, and I get my clog off, and I beat this girl over, I guess, her head or whatever it was, with my wooden clog and to the point where they have to now pull me off of the girl, which--I'm telling you that's my dog, that bell that you're hearing is my dog, in case you're wondering.  She's right here, that's my Kaia (ph.).  And I beat her with this clog.  And so, they pull--they have to pull me off of her, and I don't know what's worse; the fact that I was so frightened of this girl or that I'm so ashamed that I have gotten into a fight in public, which is just not what I do.  So I remember just getting on my bus to go home and just crying all the way home because that was one of my first memories of being in America was, somebody accused of trying to steal "Her man."
Speaker 2: Well, did that end that?
Speaker 1: It did, it did.  They didn't bother me again for the summer.  It worked (laughs), learned a lesson there too.  You know, sometimes you just got to kick some ass, if you want folks to leave you alone.  Just leave me alone, get away from me.
Story_ID: 14462
Speaker 1: I forgot to ask you the name of your school in Trinidad?
Speaker 2: San Fernando Government School.
Speaker 1: Okay, San Fernando Government School.  And then the school in the United States, your first grade school?
Speaker 2: And the school before I went to San Fernando Government School, I went to Teacher Bailey's Finishing School for Girls.  Teacher Bailey was--
Speaker 1: Teacher Bailey's.
Speaker 2: Teacher Bailey's School was a school that my mother [Janet Angela Beane Toussaint] and her mother [Audrey Beane] went to and that I went to, because Teacher Bailey--they used to call me Auntie Lorraine, even though I was only five years old, six-years, because they thought I was so grown up.  During--I would go to school in the morning, and learn my ABC's, and I would have lunch with the Bailey sisters who were three, at the time, spinster sisters, one of whom had a child, I guess, I gather, but they all lived in this house together.  They lived upstairs, upstairs--the school was downstairs.  And during lunch, they would teach me etiquette, what forks to use, what spoons to use, how to sit at a table, what to do with napkins, just the things that they thought every proper young lady needed to know.  God bless the Baileys because at the time, my mother in Trinidad, before she left, was a Montessori teacher.  She was the first teacher that came--the first Montessori school in the Caribbean was in Trinidad, and she was a Montessori teacher, and she wouldn't let me go to the Montessori school, which was just hateful because the Montessori kids got to take naps.  And they had a petting zoo, but she said, "No, I wanted to teach you independence.  If you're up under me all day, you won't learn independence."  So, I went to Teacher Bailey's School, and then San Fernando Government School.
Speaker 1: Okay, and in Brooklyn, what did you go?
Speaker 2: In Brooklyn, I went to PS-122 [Mamie Faye School, Astoria, New York], yes, PS-122.  And that was the Junior High School, and then while I was there, I auditioned for the High School of Performing Arts.  And then went on to the High School of Performing Arts [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York City, New York], and then after the High School of Performing Arts, auditioned for the Julliard School [New York City, New York] and went on to that.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  Now, did you have any, were there teachers or any other kind of mentors in school that you remember that--?  Now, you told us about some awful people so far.
Speaker 2: There was a, there was--oh, yes, there was a--there were two teachers that I remember specifically, Mrs. Crookshank.  When my mother was away, Mrs. Crookshank was very kind to me, and I liked Mrs. Crookshank because Mrs. Ryan, the hateful one--she also singled out the light-skinned girls and the mixed-race girls and played with their hair and told them how pretty they were and just, this, just fawned (with emphasis) all over the light-skinned girls with the pretty hair and basically called the rest of us, you-know-what's.  But Mrs. Crookshank--I got left back one year because I was too young to keep going forward, and Mrs. Crookshank turned out to be one of my teachers.  And Mrs. Crookshank, I loved Mrs. Crookshank because she looked like me.  She had full lips and she was, she had a figure like my mother which was very round, Mrs. Crookshank, and she had kind of little bow legs, and I loved Mrs. Crookshank's legs 'cause she had hairy legs.  Mrs. Crookshank, she had the hairiest legs (laughs) you could ever imagine.  And I just thought she was the most beautiful--and she was so kind to me.  And she would sort of keep me after school and explain things to me, and I think if you can have a crush on anyone, I think I had a crush on Mrs. Crookshank because her legs were so (laughs) hairy and she had very buck teeth and very full lips.  And she just--I don't know why, I just--she was so kind.  And for many, many years I thought hairy legs were really sexy, but also that was back then when hairy legs were considered sexy, you know, and I guess hairy armpits too, but, you know, trends change (laughs).
Speaker 1: And I think a matter of perspective, I guess.  Now, I remember, yeah, in the '60s [1960s] a lot of people in--,  (Simultaneously) Oh, sure.
Speaker 2: --our neighborhood in the black community, legs were considered, hairy legs were considered--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Uh-huh, absolutely.
Speaker 2: --males considered girls with hairy legs sexy.
Speaker 1: Sexy.  And Mrs. Crookshank was--there was something very, kind of womanly about her, very sexy and very, kind of--oh yeah, Mrs. Crookshank.  When I came to America, my first teacher in junior high school was a, was a little man called Mr. Buchanan, and I could--I remember the American kids being able to talk back to the teachers, which was unheard of.  And I was, I remember here thinking, "Isn't he gonna beat them?  They just are so rude.  They talk back to him, and he just is so cool."  And so I remember sort of trying, trying it out a little bit and trying to be fresh with Mr., Mr. Buchanan, and him just pulling me aside, and saying, "You're fresh."  There was always a twinkle in his eye when he talked to me, even when he was reprimanding me, there was just this little twinkle in his eye, that he liked me.  He liked me, and he kind of--I think he saw how out of place I was and kind of shepherd--shepherded me.  I remember coming home to visit my mother and talking about me, and my mother let me--he might have been liked my mother, thinking back on it because my mother was a fox back then.  But Mr. Buchanan was very, very kind.  I remember that.
Speaker 2: Now, what were your favorite subjects in grade school, and were you in the arts yet when you were in elementary school?
Speaker 1: In Trinidad?
Speaker 2: Well, in--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) No, not really.
Speaker 2: You already said that Trinidad really wasn't (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I learned poems.  You had to learn--"Her arms across her breast she laid; she was more fair than words can say; bare-footed went the beggar maid before the king Cophetua."  That was the first poem I ever learned ['The Beggar Maid' by Alfred, Lord Tennyson].
Speaker 2: Okay, you still.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I don't know where that came from. (laughs) Oh, I must have been six, seven.  But, no, my favorite subject, my, my most hated one was Social Studies, could never get that, never got what Social Studies was.  What is Social Studies, what do--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Did coming to America kind of really throw you off--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) It threw me off.
Speaker 2: --in terms of that?  Because you're coming from a British system to--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Which was a, which was a, much further along.  And so I was bored for the first two, three years in American school because I was so far ahead.  The British system is much more advanced than the American system.
Speaker 2: We did the--we know now, I mean we know--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And they placed you by age here, not by what you knew.
Speaker 2: Well, Americas are, teach Social Studies and History from a very, sort of ethnocentric point of view, and did that--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) There were no black people in social studies or history.
Speaker 2: That's right, there were no black people or any--I mean the British don't really exist on the same level either.  I mean nobody does.
Speaker 1: No, except the Americans.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, so did that kind of shock you or--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) It was confusing, you know, yeah, 'cause all of a sudden I was learning only American history that had nothing to do with--it was so brand new, it had nothing to do with the rest of the world or where I came from or what was important to me.  I couldn't see how any of this stuff was important to me.  (laughs) I still question it, but, yeah, so I, I didn't like that.  What did I like?  I always liked English.  I always read--I read avidly.  I mean that kind of reading is what got me into being an actress.
Speaker 2: Okay, what did you primarily?  What did you like to read?
Speaker 1: At the time, teen magazines that had Michael Jackson, Bobby Sherman and The Osmonds on the cover. (laughs)  That was brand new, the fact, that--because we didn't have a television in Trinidad so suddenly there was David Cassidy and 'The Partridge Family', and, you know, the whole teen thing of posters, you know, you could buy these magazines and pull the posters off and put them up on the wall.  My God, in this little one-bedroom flat that my mom and I shared, you know, the entire bedroom that was my mother's bedroom too, was plastered with David Cassidy and Bobby Sherman and Michael Jackson.  I read, I read everything.  I read books, I read, I read anything I could get my hands on.
Story_ID: 14463
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell me about getting into the High School for the Performing Arts [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York City, New York].  I mean what was the--did you, were you encouraged by a teacher to go there or did you, did you--(Simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: I was--my mother [Janet Angela Beane Toussaint] took me out of--after I, I was--this is a great story.  I was eleven years old when my mother--it was just before my mother fell ill.  I was eleven years old, and because I'd come from Trinidad, it was, it was very typical at eleven to be asking, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" Because there's, there's an, an exam in Trinidad called the Common Entrance Exam, which determined whether or not you went on to university or high school university or whether you took a different track and went into vocational schools.  So by eleven, I was asking myself, "What do I want to be?" Because I was this latch-key kid, I read everything in sight.  But coming to America was huge because suddenly I wasn't afraid for the first time in my life, and I wasn't afraid--I began verbalizing in school with the kids, seeing their level of freedom was beginning to give me permission to have a voice, literally and figuratively.  And so suddenly there was this kind of an awakening happening, literally, where I wanted to--I felt, "Well, what do I want to be when I grow up, now that I'm free from Mrs. Ryan, from school, from--?"  And I didn't know--I had the feeling that America had all this potential.  It held all this potential because, as always, when you, when you don't live in America, it has always been the, the Mecca.  It has always been the place everyone aspired to go to.  It had this lure, this mystery to it.  So here I am now in America, and thought "Well, what do I want to be when I grow up?"  And I thought, "Well, I don't even know what there is to be in America."  And I thought. "Well, the, the 'Yellow Pages' was one of my favorite books."  I loved the 'Yellow Pages' 'cause I thought it was fascinating.  So the, every occupation there is, is listed in the 'Yellow Pages'.  So one of the ways to see what there is to be in America is to maybe look--start reading the 'Yellow Pages'.  So I did.  I got the 'Yellow Pages', and I opened it up and I said, well, let's start at the beginning.  I opened up to A, and it said things like "Accounting," and I thought, "Oh, no, no, no, no."  And then it said, on the same page with Accounting, it said "Acting."  And I said, "Oh, okay, I think I'll--that sounds good.  I'll do that."  And I thought, "Well, I don't know anything about acting.  I better learn."  And there was an ad for--the biggest page and the biggest, the biggest ad [advertisement] on the page.  I call the school.  And I said, and I made an appointment for my mother to come in and talk to the school because I, if I was gonna be an actress, I had to learn how to act.  And my mother came home at that time, and she was, like I said, working two jobs, and she said, "You know, baby, we, we can barely make enough money for food and to keep a roof over our heads.  I don't have time, I don't have money to put you in acting school."  And I begged, I begged, but we couldn't do it.  So about six months later, my mother was going to a wedding, well, she and I were going to a wedding, and we were--she was going to buy a dress for--one for her and one for me.  And I talked her into buying this--going shopping, not on Hoyt Street [Brooklyn, New York], which is where we usually went, but on Flatbush Avenue [Brooklyn, New York] to look for a dress, which also happened to be the street that this acting school was on.  So I walked her past the acting school, and I said, "Mommy, you remember the school I was telling you about?  This is the school, just go up and talk to them, just--."  I talked my mother into going up the stairs at this acting school.  And two hours later she came down, having used the money she was gonna buy her dress with to enroll me in acting school.  And literally, the rest was history because I suddenly--once I got into this school, one of the first things you do in acting school, is you do something called improvisation, which is basically creating a situation out of your imagination and living it out as if it were real.  That was like breathing to me, because I'd spent the first ten years of my life living here, living in my imagination--totally shut out, but totally alive in here behind this wall.  And so the fertility of my imagination was just--I was primed for this incredible imaginative, emotionally available instrument that, and didn't know the difference between make-believe and reality.  I mean I could cross that boundary seamlessly and effortlessly.  And so I studied with them for a while, and then some--while I was studying privately--I don't know how my mother managed to, to be able to do this, I was then shipped off to a junior high school or rather the first year of high--something, the first year of a high school, but it--the one that was my neighborhood was too rough so she shipped me off to Sheepshead Bay [neighborhood in Brooklyn].  And they had a drama coach there [at Sheepshead Bay High School, Brooklyn, New York], but while I was there, someone in my theater school recommended I audition for the High School of Performing Arts, which is the 'Fame' [motion picture] school.  And so I auditioned, I was playing the oran-, I did 'Oliver Twist' in the show.  They were priming Seth Goldman to be the star of the Performing Arts, and they primed all these kids.  And I was one of the few black kids in the school--they were priming all these kids to, all these white kids to go to the Performing Arts because it was "the" school.  And unbeknownst to them, I was the little orange seller, (sings) "Who will buy this wonderful morning; such a sky you never did see."  That was my little solo.  And I was also auditioning for the High School of Performing Arts, but I wasn't being groomed by my English teacher.  They didn't even know I was auditioning.  They were grooming Seth Goldman and dah, dah, dah.  And I remember going to audition--it was pouring rain that morning, and my mother did not cornrow my hair freshly, which I was very annoyed because I was going to audition, and I felt I needed fresh cornrows.  But at the time, my mother was ill, and on this train going from Brooklyn to Manhattan [New York, New York] in the pouring rain with my mom to audition for a school that I wanted to get into.  And I did.  And it turned out I--in--of the class with the Seth Goldmans and the hoda, huda, hoda, hudas, the English teacher who didn't even know I auditioned--was shocked to find out that I was the only person in that school that had gotten into the High School of Performing Arts when she didn't know I was, even an candidate.  So, got into P.A. [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York City, New York] for the first, for four years.  And again, I mean I came alive there because suddenly there was, there was the outlet for all of my internal life and a context in which to place it.  And from there, I auditioned from the high school for Julliard [School, New York, New York] which was an automatic kind of next step.
Story_ID: 14464
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are there any stories from high school [High School for the Performing Arts, later Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York City, New York] you can share with us?  What plays were you in or what did you did you do in high school?
Speaker 2: I was very, very serious in high school, very, very, very, very serious.  I was this serious actress.  I was--it was just, you know, I lived it, ate it, breathed it, everything.  I just--when I say acting chose me, it literally did.  Once that 'Yellow Page' ad [advertisement] came up, and I thought, "Oh, yeah, that sounds good, that's the rest of my life."  Gosh, so many memories of those times of just--the most wonderful training, Mr. Askow (ph.) was the teacher, Mrs. Shine.  Oh, my God, I, I was always late to school.  She kept saying, "You'll be late for your funeral, Lorraine Toussaint."  I've tried to work on that in my, in my later years.  Gosh, Mr. Cappelletti (ph.), and, you know, it really was like the 'Fame' movie because it was this odd little building on, on West 46th Street, where you would look out the buildings from your classes and bet--we would bet on the whores across the street because there was a, a hotel for prostitutes, and right (with emphasis) directly across the street.  And so, you know, you would, you would bet on the, the John's and the prostitutes bringing--you'd see them parading in and out.  I mean it was Times Square before it was, you know, 'Disney-ed', loved it, loved it, gosh, had my first love there, my first boyfriend, Emmett Smith, oh, loved Emmett Smith, oh, should have married Emmett Smith.  But during that time, the most, the, the other side of that as, as I was--as free as I was in, in performing arts, and the other side of the--by the time I came to America, by the time I was eleven, my mother [Janet Angela Beane Toussaint] was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.  And so had come down with this, you know, pretty fast-moving, degenerative disease that was very quickly taking its toll, and you know, for many years, it was, you know, touch and go because she and I were--it was just she and I against the world, you know, battling this disease and my mom trying to still hold down a job while it was getting worse--starting to fall quite a lot because that's one of the symptoms of it, but, you know, you start losing feeling and control of the legs.  And so my, my early teenage years I remember--you know, are filled with memories of feeling so ashamed that I had this mother that just wasn't walking right or walking well or and would fall down all the time--I remember, you know, she was still working those jobs, but I had to go--after a certain time, and go meet her at the subway to help her navigate the stairs up and down, and, you know, take her to the stairs in the morning before I went to school and get her up onto the subway platform.  Those were just--those were tough days for a kid, you know.  And I remember one of the schools I went to and she was, she came with me the first day of school and fell down in the lobby 'cause it was wet and slippery, and feeling so, you know, I was in--thirteen or something, and you just care so much about what other people thought, feeling so ashamed that, "Oh, my mother fell down."  But going, looking back on those days, you know, by the time I was fifteen, I was pretty much running a household because it was getting clearer and clearer that my mom was not gonna be able to be working for much longer.  And there were points where she got very bad, I mean I remember, you know, being on welfare where, you know, before school you get on--you, you got the, the train and went to Hoyt Street, and stood on line to get food stamps.  But you had to be there early in the morning because it was first come, first serve or else you'd have to come back another day, get your name on a list.  And so, and lining up in the winter morning at 4:30 in the morning to be the first or the second or, you know, early up on the line so that we could get food stamps and, and Medicare, Medicaid or Medicare, whatever it was back then.  It was time, it was tough going.  And during this time, you know, I would then get on the train and go to [High School for the] Performing Arts and so, to a great extent, my life as an actress was my salvation.
Story_ID: 14465
Speaker 1: We left you in high school.  Your mother [Janet Angela Beane Toussaint] has got Multiple Sclerosis [MS], and so how do things turn out for her?
Speaker 2: Well, my mom--as, as is part of that disease--that's my dog again scratching, it turned out that she--you know, it got worse.  It just go got considerably worse and worse and worse.  And it just got tougher and tougher.  You know, she--and it was back when there was so little research being done on, on MS and even being able to understand it.  And then certainly as a black woman, and at the time, a poor black woman, good Lord, you know, you could barely even get doctors or hospitals to even recognize it as MS because it was back then when they were just beginning to do research on, on recognizing the symptoms of MS.  So she, you know, she--my mom ended up in wheelchair, you know, she's my mom--was such a fighter as I, I mean I have every, every major lesson I have learned in my life has been--Kaia, Kaia stop. (laughs) Stop--that's my dog.  No, no, no, no, no, good girl.  Don't do that.  Mommy's on T.V. now (laughs)--has been because of my mother.  I have, I, I've turned out to be an incredibly independent, resourceful woman because by fifteen I was running a household.  I have learned--I have an incredible reverence for life because I have been face-to-face with death many times very early in my life.  I mean there were periods in my mom's illness when, you know, she would be in coma for several weeks at a time.  And those were very tough, you know, she was--you know, there were times when she was--I was so young that she'd be hospitalized and, you know--I don't know how we kept doing this.  I was in school, I was in [High School of the] Performing Arts [later Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York City, New York], I would staying with an aunt until she got out the hospital--I'd go from school to the hospital.  It was insane.  But I learned a real reverence for life because of my mother.  I learned how to fight (with emphasis) for life, watching my mother fight for life because she, above all, loved me, unconditionally, and was there for me no matter what.  I remember coming home from Juilliard [School, New York, New York]--Juilliard hours were very, very long.  And my mother would wake up in the morning and make me lunch and dinner for me to carry to school.  So at the time I was, I had--after I got out of Performing Arts, I was--my aunt reminded me of this the other day, and it sounds pretty impressive, so I'll tell you.  I was then accepted, full scholarship into, at the time NYU [New York University, New York City, New York], SUNY Purchase [State University of New York, Purchase, New York], Davis College [Toledo, Ohio], Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and Juilliard.  And I chose Juilliard because number one, at the time, it was the best school.
Speaker 1: Now, this was--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And also it was, it was not far away from home.  I could still be at home and take care of my mom while I was at Juilliard.
Speaker 1: So this was 1977 and '78 [1978]?
Speaker 2: Yes, '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight, [1978], 1978 to '82 [1982] were my Juilliard years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, so my mother's illness was, you know, I, it just got worse, you know, and then there came--you know, then she knew she had to stop working all together, which was somewhere in my high school times.  And then, you know, there were real bouts, I witnessed real bouts of depression.  And yet, I look back on it now, it was probably clinical depression at this point because it was, it was ongoing, and you know, when anyone is, is chronically ill, depression is a huge part of it.  There was some treatment for that and, you know.  I was just, it was, it was she and I.  I, I just learned a lot about life and compassion and caring and, you know, some of it bit me in the butt because I, I turned out to be a sort of chronic caretaker because I'd been caretaking for, for so many years and had to do quite a lot of work to sort of break that cycle.  But the other side of that is that, you know, I never got into anything extraneous.  I was, I was a 'good girl', in the quote, unquote because I had somebody at home that I had, I had to go home every night and help my mother take a bath.  So, you know, any frat-, going out for drinks and bar-hopping during the Juilliard days--oh, gosh, no.  I mean there was none of that kind of, that kind of life, that kind of expenditure of energies because I needed to harness all of energies for my two lives.  My mom eventually went back to Trinidad because once I got out of Juilliard, it was very, very difficult because there were sort of round-the-clock state-hired, state-paid nurses and housekeepers, which were, you know (pauses), not the best situation. (laughs) Again, some of them weren't just--a lot of them were again, [Caribbean] Island women, you know, just a lot of Island women, and working as domestics in, in situations that just, oh, I have such a, a love for the elderly, and was--one of the things that I want to really lend my services to, is speaking out for the elderly in terms of elderly abuse, because I witnessed quite a lot of it.  I witnessed quite a lot of it in the many years that I, that I watched over my mother in different homes and at--when she was at home.  It's--and, you know, I tell you, that's the stuff of my life that I--as tough as it was, I wouldn't trade it for anything.  I wouldn't trade it, because it's what's given me the backbone to be able to endure.  I've learned there's a level of endurance that's redemptive as I watched my mother suffer beyond suffering, that I could even, I don't even know how she did it for most of her life.  But there's something purifying about witnessing that.  She was my greatest gift and my greatest teacher, and to--at the end, literally, literally, taught me how to die because I was with her when she died and intimately involved with her in that, in that event.
Speaker 1: When did your mother pass?
Speaker 2: My mom passed about--gosh, it seemed, you know, time is a funny thing, like I said at the beginning of this tape--my mother must have passed (pauses) now, I think it must be four years, no, maybe even more, four years, five years maybe, yipes, a few, a few years ago.  She's so with me, though, that I forget that, you know, oh, right, she's gone.  And I, I feel her strongly, and she's so even more with me now than ever.  So it's hard to keep as to the actual chronological time that she's left the body.
Story_ID: 14466
Speaker 1: Is there any about the Juilliard [School, New York, New York] experience you want to tell us during those days?
Speaker 2: I loved those Juilliard years.  I was a creature of discipline and Juilliard was all about discipline, I mean it really was.  A lot of people had problems with Juilliard because it was systematically breaking you down in terms of breaking all of the habits that you had developed up until that point as an artist--as an actor.  Artist is a very rarified word, and taking those from you, and then giving you new ones.  But I was so young, I was one of the few people that came right out of high school [High School of the Performing Arts, later Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York City, New York], so I was one of the youngest people.  I had no life.  I had no, I had nothing to break down.  So I was still very malleable and very open and available to that kind of discipline.  I, I felt like the rest of my life, my personal life was, was so scary and so chaotic and so on the edge that to have the structure that Juilliard provided--and it was very rigid, very, very rigid, was a lifesaver to me again because it, it balanced my life.  It balanced the kind of uncertainty that I was living with, you know, while I was at Juilliard, my mother [Janet Angela Beane Toussaint] was in the hospital a lot--Kaia, no (laughs).  My dog, Kaia is--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I don't think we can hear that.
Speaker 2: --a dear part of my life.  So--.
Speaker 1: How do you spell her name?
Speaker 2: Kaia, K-A-I-A.  She's a standard poodle, and my pal and my dear friend.  That kind of rigidity, that, the discipline that Juilliard offered was a lifesaver.  So I, I had a wonderful time.  I, you know, the interesting thing about Juilliard is, all through those years, I didn't know anything about race prejudice.  I began to learn about racism at Juilliard because (pauses) I remember I was doing--in my last year, when you were being groomed to come out.  You were almost having a big coming out party, where agents and managers and everyone sort of came to see the new 'crop'.  And I was doing a play called 'Love's Labour's Lost' directed by Michael Langham, who was a wonderful British Canadian director--ah, what a master in [William] Shakespeare he was because--but I had been trained through Juilliard to do only the classics.  My God, when I got out of Juilliard--I'm jumping around a little bit--when I got out of Juilliard and I tried to go to NEC, the Negro Ensemble Company, to get a job--oh, Lord, I just wasn't black enough.
Story_ID: 14467
Speaker 1: It was a very interesting phenomena of not, of being too black or not being black enough once I got out of school [Julliard School, New York, New York], because I remember when I was doing 'Love's, Labour's Lost' at Juilliard, it was the final project which was open to the, to an outside audience--it was the, a very big production.  The director [Michael Langham] at the time asked the hair and makeup people on the show--I was the only black woman in the play.  The other black woman was Penny Johnson--she was playing a, a boy--if--but I was playing the Lady Rosaline, which was the second lead, whether they could please lighten my skin so that I could--I would blend in more, lighten the hair on the wig, and could they lighten my skin, please, so that I blended in with the other girls who were white.  Then I remember thinking, "What a very odd thing," because coming out, I was eight--I was twenty-two coming out of Juilliard, and at that age, and with the, the, the kind of talent I had, I thought the world was wide open to me.  And coming from the background that I came from, I thought, "I could do anything.  There is not a role on this planet that I cannot play," and I expected to be able to play them.  And so having been--for the first time being faced with, "Oh, that's really, that was a weird request."  And I said, "Well, no, you can't lighten my skin," and having the reviews come out for that show, and for the first time being called 'The Dusky Rosaline', which was, you know, suddenly bringing, attention to the fact that the Rosaline in the show was black, and I, and I'm thinking, "Why is that important?  What is that about?"  That was sort of the beginning of another level of education because by the time I came out of Juilliard, there I was this little black girl that was trained "up the wazoo" to do [Henrik] Ibsen and [George Bernard] Shaw and [William] Shakespeare and [Madame Frida Uhl] Strindberg and, you know, nobody told me you can't make a living.  Neverthe-, I guess you can, not a very good one.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Now, you had--you had to be aware of the Negro Ensemble Company at that time?
Speaker 1: I was.  I got out of school--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And the, they--there's a lot of black theater in New York.
Speaker 1: Yes, there was.  But it was during those days of Frank Rivera still his, his studio there, and, and Douglas [Turner Ward] was running NEC.  And--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And Barbara Ann Teer still had (unclear)---,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Absolutely, what's her name downtown was, La MaMa [Experimental Theatre Club] was downtown, and--.
Speaker 2: And Woody King [Jr.] was still there.
Speaker 1: Woody King was still on the, on the scene, sure.  But for most of these places, I wasn't black enough because there I was, this little Juilliard, classically-trained, perfectly-spoken--because they had, Juilliard had done its job.  And remember, I came from this pseudo-British background anyway.  So I came with a certain quality that set me apart from the beginning, and then Juilliard just refined it.
Speaker 2: Was it that they didn't give you an opportunity to play, I guess black American roles or--?
Speaker 1: Where, Juilliard?
Speaker 2: No, in the other companies.
Speaker 1: Once I got out?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: Or was it, or did you just--I mean could you do--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I would audition.
Speaker 2: Could you do it or was it that they didn't think you could do it?
Speaker 1: I thought I could do it.  I thought I could do it.  Whether I was correct or not, I mean I don't know, but I thought I could.  But they didn't think I could.  They thought I was too refined, too well-spoken, too, too, just too, too.  So there was no place for me coming out of school in the black theater, not in certainly the mainstream black theater.  And so I went into white theater, quote, unquote, I went into regional theater.
Story_ID: 14468
Speaker 1: Now, one of your first big roles was as Lady Macbeth in--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, I know--,
Speaker 1: --a [William] Shakespeare production, right?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --isn't that wild?  Yeah, and, you know, God bless.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) What Shakespeare company was this?
Speaker 2: Joseph Papp, God rest his soul, you know.  God, Joe, Joe Papp--'Uncle Joe'--a fly is in my house. (laughs) Oh, gosh.  I live in country so there are flies and raccoons and skunks and bugs.  I left my graduation ceremony [at the Julliard School, New York, New York], literally, the morning of the ceremony, the afternoon at two o'clock, I went to my first professional job and my first rehearsal which was 'Baptism by Fire', playing Lady Macbeth with a company that was then aligned with the Public Theater to do--called 'Shakespeare and Company' which was a wond--and still is, I think, still a wonderful company based in [Lenox] Massachusetts on the old Edith Wharton estate ['The Mount'].  There used to be this wonderful kind of avant-garde with Christian Linkletter who was a marvelous voice coach at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] and Tina Packard--oh, my gosh, my memory is, is still pretty decent, was running that theater.  And I landed a job of playing Lady Macbeth in their production of, of 'Macbeth' that summer.  And so we were rehearsing at the Public Theater.  What a glorious day that was, to leave graduation and, and then head downtown to the Public Theater.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, that's a--now, you have a certain amount of gravity to yourself.  You said when I came, when I came today, you said, you were born old or something.
Speaker 2: I was born, I was born forty years old, and now, I'm finally like becoming a child, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you do have a certain amount of gravitas or whatever, you know--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and, where you seem to be older, and here you played Lady Macbeth, this--right out of Juilliard, you know, it seems--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I'd like to play her again today at forty-four--boy, I bet I'd have something else to say about that role.  But I was really good.  I mean I was really good, I have to say.  It was a wonderful production.  It was wonderful.  And so I then went on to do a lot of Shakespeare.  I went on to do the regions.  I went back to New York [New York].  I did, you know, oh, gosh, Shakespeare at Lincoln Center [Inc.].  I did it on Broadway [New York theater district].  I did it at the Public [Theater] I played a wonderful, wonderful, 'Midsummer Night's Dream' directed by A. J. [Alfred Joseph] Antoon [Jr.] at--with Carl Lumbly playing the Oberon, and then Joe Morton came in and did the Oberon, and it was [Elizabeth] Liz McGovern and, and Fisher Stevens and [Fahrid] Murray Abraham and A. J. Antoon was the director--oh, just wonderful, wonderful work.  I did two seasons at the Guthrie [Theater, Minneapolis, Minnesota].
Speaker 1: These are some pretty fair actors and--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, the Guthrie.
Speaker 1: F. Murray Abraham, Joe Morton--,
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Carl Lumbly.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, those were the days, you know, and I did the--when Liviu Ciulei was the Artistic Director at the Guthrie, doing 'The Bacchae' and doing another 'Midsummer' there and just traveling wherever, Cincinnati [Ohio] Playhouse [in the Park] and I, I went wherever the work was because, because I had to earn a living at being an actress.  I had nothing else to fall back on.  My Aunt Yola, God rest--God bless her, said, you know, when I first told her I want to be an actress, says, "Have you ever seen any little black girls being actresses?  Don't be ridiculous.  Get yourself a proper profession.  Learn something.  Become a doctor, become a lawyer, do something else, really.  You have no black people being actors."  And I primarily did it to, to prove that she was wrong.  I have stubborn streak, and I will often do that.  And that is, that's something that's bitten me in the butt too.  Tell me what I can't do, and that's exactly what I go do.
Story_ID: 14469
Speaker 1: We were talking about your roles, and I asked you what role models--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: --if you had any black role models?
Speaker 2: I remember when I was in Trinidad, 'Julia' came on television.  There was one T.V. in the neighborhood and you dragged your chair up--all the neighbors dragged their chair from the--the person who had the T.V. downstairs opened all the doors and windows.  And you'd put your chair in the yard, and you watched T.V.  And 'Julia', and I have seen then been able to say to Diahann Carroll, who is the loveliest lady, "Thank you."  Because seeing her gave me the chance to know that--that that was even possible, that that was poss--there was this beautiful, black woman on television.  So, "Thank you Diahann Carroll."
Speaker 1: Now, in the broader community, not just in terms of black actors that were there, who were your--did you have any favorite actors, you know, when you were in school, people that you--whose work you really admired or when you, you know, as a young actor?
Speaker 2: I'm the kind of person that I don't have a lot of mentors.  I remember seeing extraordinary performances.  I remember seeing Zoe Caldwell do a 'Medea' on Broadway [New York theater district] when I was in high school [High School for the Performing Arts, later Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York City, New York] maybe.  Then I thought, "Oh, my God--Wow!"  She had the most amazing curtain call.  They don't make divas like that any more.  I saw James Earl Jones do his 'Othello', and think, "Oh, my God--Wow!" (pauses) Yes, I've always--I don't have very many--I mean I think Meryl Streep has been one of my favorites because I keep (pauses) dissecting her work because it is so flawless.  It's flawless.  But no, I don't--I was never, you know, because I never had that kind of hero-worshipping because acting for me was like breathing.  I came to it so early, and I came to it as a craft.  And I came to it as a journeyman, because early on, when I was in the High School of Performing Arts, I got my first job on Broadway.  I was offered in my fourth year of, of Performing Arts, one of the leads in a show called 'Runaways', [Elizabeth] Liz Swados's on Broadway.  And at the time, my, my mentor, Mr. Askow (ph.) said, "If you leave Performing Arts now, you will not graduate.  We will not allow you to graduate."  It was back then when they didn't let you work if you were in school.  You have to choose between Broadway or finishing Performing Arts and going on to Juilliard.  And he said something to me, he said, "If they want you know, they will want you even more later on."  And I didn't take that Broadway show, which was huge.  And I decided somewhere in there that I was gonna be a journeyman.  Now, which show is this again?
Speaker 1: It was called 'Runaways'--.
Speaker 2: Okay, 'Runaways'.
Speaker 1: --on Broadway, and it was Liz Swados's musical.  And so I never came to it with any kind of hero-worshipping or wanting to be a star or admiring people in that kind far away, kind of aspiring way.  You know, Performing Arts graduates came back and talked to us all the time.  You know, Dustin Hoffman came back, and, you know, huge act--but I was trained to be kind of a purist.  It was a craft.  It was a revered craft.  It was a sacred craft.  It wasn't about, you know, and at the time, they even pooh-poohed on television.  And (makes blowing sound) I mean I've certainly--I don't do that any more 'cause I got tired of living like a college student, which is what you do in the 'theater', although it's my, it's my--it was my first love.  It still is.  So no, I don't--I didn't have any, that kind of mentoring.
Story_ID: 14470
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a--what philosophy of acting were you taught in?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) [Constantin] Stanislavsky.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was taught the method.  That's what I learned at the High School of Performing Arts [later Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York City, New York].  And once you've learned that, you pretty much--there's really nothing much else.  It's, it's pretty thorough, pretty thorough, pretty basic.  And I, yeah, I, I mean I've studied, I went on to Juilliard [School, New York, New York].  I went on--I went to Japan to study because I wanted to study Kabuki [theater] and No theater because I fell in love with a particular Japanese style called the Suzuki training and [Dr. Shinichi] Suzuki was one of the master teachers I met at Juilliard, and I loved his training.  And there was a kind of stillness that the Japanese actors mastered that I thought was magnificent.  And what Suzuki taught was that you don't have real control, you cannot cont--you can't make a choice unless you have control.  And you must first master your body so that a gesture means different things.  But, you know, American actors, you know, we're kind of the 'scratch-and-sniff' kind of school of acting, you know, I feel it, therefore, it's good, as opposed to the Eastern where it really is so disciplined and--and I wanted to, I wanted to, I wanted to explore that.  And so I went and I lived with Suzuki and his company and studied with him--very physically rigorous training, wonderful living in Japan.  I've traveled quite a lot.  I've lived all over the world since--it's one of the things I do also.  So, yes, acting for me was always kind of--it was my church.  It was sacred.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what would you, would you--how would you describe your own, you know, approach to acting, now, I mean, how do you approach it?
Speaker 2: Gosh, funny you should ask me at this one in my life, I'm a little bored with it. (laughs) I've been doing it for twenty-five years, and I'm questioning how I want to continue, and what capacity; how to simplify my work even more.  How to--I can't--I can no longer now lend my talents to things that I don't deeply believe in.  And that's hard 'cause, you know, you can make a good living doing a lot of schlock.  But it has to speak to my soul because it's now inseparable from the thing that is most meaningful to me, which, it has always been inseparable from what I consider to be God.  And so I'm, I'm deeply questioning how I want to continue with it, or even if I continue with it.
Story_ID: 14471
Speaker 1: Now, we were asking you about your acting technique, and you were saying that you're--you may be tired of technique now, and?
Speaker 2: My acting, I'll address the first thing.  My technique is pretty darned simple.  I just believe everything I say.  It sounds pretty--I, I, I simplify it because, you know, I, I'm certainly a master at script breakdown, and I can dissect a scene and know it works and know why it doesn't work and, and put it together in the way that it works.  I certain am a master at this point, and, you know, I say these things with, with, with great humility because I am a master of what I do.  I certainly know how to create an inner life and an inner chart.
Story_ID: 14472
Speaker 1: Sally Field [actress] said something, you know, when, when she's about to start a role that is particularly painful, and she knows she's gonna be doing the role, it's like taking a razor blade and making just imperceptibly, little nicks, you just take, and you start nicking yourself, you start nicking.  And you nick yourself to the point when you know how to do this because--so that by the time you get to the day of shooting, your skin is raw.  And then you don't have to act.  Now, every actor has a way of making those little nicks.  I know that certainly I start an internal process the moment I know.  I just finished 'Their Eyes Were Watching God' [television program], and she was--and it was a small role, and I tell you I was so thrilled to do it because at this point in my work, I want to be left alone.  I don't want anybody fiddling with me too much.  I--because I'm tending to do it for very kind of personal kinds of reasons.  And there are so many people that don't know what they're doing, and it's, it's now annoying to me to be fiddled with someone other than a master.  And then master doesn't mean that you have to be old--someone who doesn't have this, the sensibility to, to understand what it is we do as actors or how we do it or how to speak to actors or even someone who just knows that they don't know and will stay out of the way or will leave me to what I do know how to do.  Anyway, she was an old biddy, Miss Pearl [Stone], loved Miss Pearl.  Miss Pearl is, you know, she's old and fat and undersexed and a gossip and a peeping tom and just, you know, the town biddy and just, preparing for that, there's a, there's a process of just--I identified who I thought this person was most like and going to that place within yourself--within myself, where you bring up the energies that this person lives from.  She lives from smallness, she lives from pettiness, she lives from not-enoughness.  She lives from jealousy, from fear, from insecurities, from all of those kinds of things which are not a part of my everyday existence.  These--this is not where I live.  So, sort of lowering my energies to inhabit that is fascinating.  It's interesting, it's, it--because every character I play, I, I must be in love with them, no matter how heinous they are.  So that process is, is fascinating to me, and, you know, playing someone who is deeply grieved or who's had great loss or, or even some of the fun characters.  I played, played a Haitian woman who ran a Chinese restaurant who is married to a, (pauses) oh, gosh, an ex-Jesuit whose son wanted to be a priest or something--you know, who spoke only French, you know, and so, you know, sort of tweaking my, my brain and my inner being.  It's hard to talk about acting because it's--oh, my gosh, it's, how do you talk about how you do it?  It's magic.  It's magic in being able to manipulate one's internal being, one's memories, one's feelings, one's sensibilities.  I--you become a master manipulator of the self in secret.  And it, it has to be in secret because when you show up on a set and you are ready, you know the internal paths that you must travel for any given scene.  And those paths have been charted in a way that, some of which is done on paper, in terms of preparing, in fairly elaborate histories of the characters and all preparing the history does is puts my character in a context.  It gives it a back life so that it has--and in that imaginary back life that I've created, some imaginary, some real cause for like 'Their Eyes Were Watching God', I listened to hours and hours and hours and hours and hours, hours of tapes of ex-slaves, so that I knew that walking into this was a woman that was in the 1890s.  She, she was in her mind still a slave.  So when you, so I went back and listened to hours of the Zora Neale Hurston tapes from those archives to crawl into that kind of, of mind, which is this big, of that much perception of one's self in relation to the world when one doesn't know one's freedoms.  And then you, you plant those seeds.  You plant those preparation seeds internally.  I do some of it in dream work.  I do some of it in, in, in late-night kind of mystical, kind of imagining ways because it's not, it can't be on an intellectual level.  That stuff has to be grounded in my body because then I have to forget about it and just trust that it's in my body.  I have this, this, this tactile body memory that can be called up without--by bypassing my mind, my mind then functions in the process in terms of "Where's the camera, what's the--what are the technicalities of this scene?  How do I, how do I keep everyone at bay, protecting this, this, this thing, this delicate, this delicate balance that I maintain in, in the process in order to go when they say, "Action?"  It's the thing that one maintains, that my mind is the one that keeps all that stuff in check, my mind protects the instrument.  It--because my mind has no place when I act.  It gets in my way.  So, it's a deeply mystical experience.  It's mystical only because I have such technique at this point.  I have a mastery, I have mastered tech--my own personal technique so that I can now allow myself to live in the realm of mysticism when it comes to acting.  It's a mystical, marvelous process that almost feels like channeling.  But I'm channeling, you know, such airy, fairly, new-age word, but I'm channeling on a, on a, on a foundation of real technique and form.  I'm not wandering a way because that's madness, that's insanity, that schizophrenia, you know.  That's not where I live.  So, I do a lot of the, the form work, giving this, creating a safe space and a bed for this mystical work to happen.  And a lot of that is in journaling, a lot of it is in creating back stories for the character.  A lot of it is in real research.  I do a lot of research.  I work very much visually.  I collect a lot of photographs.  I had like a pile of photographs of slaves and yada, yada, yada.  I mean most of my bookshelves are, are, you know, in some way--I did a thing in El Salvador, you know, where, you know, I was a, you know, a Salvadorian woman where I was carrying guns and, you know, very, very visual.  So, whatever feeds my senses and bypasses my mind is what I infuse myself with in preparation.  So that when I get on the set, I can forget all of that and just be present with, and willing to be surprised, because above all else, I want to be surprised by my--I want to surprise myself.  I don't want to know what's, how it's gonna come out or how all of this has been put together.  I just trust that it is.  And that, that, that unknown element which can only come in, in relation to the other actor, is what sort of sparks it in moments, in, in those moments that you live for where you are out of control, you're reeling down this, this path or you're falling, free falling with another, with another person or in a moment or in a--there's an, you have an emotional moment where suddenly you, you've done this speech.  You know, this is take number nine or twelve, twenty or whatever, and suddenly, a door opens and you are in a completely different room where this other thing takes you over, and act--is acting you.  And those are rare and gifts, and you live for those.
Story_ID: 14473
Speaker 1: Theatrical work is a lot different from television and movies and that sort of things--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but as you said, you got an opportunity to do some T.V. and movie work, and there's a lot more money in that.
Speaker 2: Yes, there is. (laughs)
Speaker 1: And so, when did you get your first opportunity to, you know, get involved in the media? Of television?
Speaker 2: Yeah, television or movies, I don't know which came first, but--(Simultaneously)? Television came first.  I was doing a play at--I was doing a play called 'Emmett Till'--'The Killing of Emmett Till' [sic, 'Dreaming Emmett', 1985], I think was a play by Toni Morrison.  Interesting, she was writing--not a very good play.  Toni is one of my favorite novelists, not my favorite playwright.  It was that, an interesting subject though.  It was about the killing of Emmett Till, and totally at the time we were in Buffalo [sic, Albany, New York].  And she was writing 'Beloved' at night, and rehearsing with us during the day.  So I feel like 'Beloved' has a special place in my heart because certainly once 'Beloved' came out, which I think is one of the masterpieces of, of, of the twentieth century, twenty-first century, and she is a cherished, national treasure, I asked--and it was such a difficult book to read, emotionally difficult.  I don't know if you've read it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've read it, and--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And she would come to the, she would come to theater [Capital Repertory Theatre] the night--each day and sort of talk about how she'd been wrestling all night with these characters.  And I mean probably wrestling, having read the book now, and I, I went to a reading at the, the [American] Museum of Natural History, I think, in New York [New York], when the book first came out, and I was so excited about it.  And I asked her, and I'd read it, I said, "Well, how--tell me, how did you write this book, and I'll you how I read it."  I had to read 'Beloved' and put it down, sometimes for a few days, and I'd pick it up again.  And it had resonance, and it had--it just was just so rich and deep and, and frightening at times.  And she said, "The way you read it, is the way I wrote it."  She said, "I would regurgitate that book and have to put it away."  And as it--regurgitating, vomiting is a great, is a great thing because as it--I suffered with migraines for most of my life, and with it--sort of classic migraines with an enormous amount of vomiting accompanying with it.  And with, in my teens, acting was like vomiting.  It was--
Speaker 1: Purging?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  It was that--there's a point in vomiting when you are so out of control, and your body is at the mercy of something else that is bigger than it, that is coming out in ways that you have no control over.  But there's a kind of ecstasy and a kind of freedom, and this--don't get me wrong.  I'm really not into vomiting.  But it's, there is something to it, (laughs) in terms of the way in which I act.  It is body and soul.  I said to Dianne Reeves once, I said, "You sing the way I act."  She, she sings that way also.  You could--you recognize each other.  We recognize that source, we recognize it.
Story_ID: 14474
Speaker 1: I was asking you about your first opportunity to do something in television?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was doing this play by, with Toni Morrison, called 'Emmett Till' [sic, 'Dreaming Emmett', 1985], and she was writing 'Beloved', and it was a terrible play and was--half of it was done in masks with Joe Phillips.  That's where I, [Joseph C.] Joe Phillips, met Joe Phillips, wonderful actor and Mel and, oh, God, what's Mel's last name?  But I got this call to do--had I auditioned for it?  I got this call to do--oh, yes--I got this call to audition for the lead in a movie for television with Richard Crenna called 'The Case of Deadly Force' [1986] for CBS [Columbia Broadcasting System] at the time, when primetime television was still doing 'Movies of the Week', which they don't do anymore--which has killed all the bread and butter work for regular actors--but that's another story because we hate reality T.V.  Let that be on the record.  They flew me up to Boston, [Massachusetts] to audition, and then Michael Miller, who was my first T.V. director.  I got the job two days later or it was the next day or something, and had to quit that show in Bos--in, in Albany [New York] to go do my first T.V. lead in a, in a--my first lead in a movie.  And Bruce Bouchard at the time, the Artistic Director [of the Capital Repertory Theatre], let me go, (laughs) I think with threats of suing me or something.  But I was, I was out of there because it was my first T.V. gig and flew to--they flew me from Buffalo [New York] to Boston in the tiny, little plane that it was so small, I had to put my purse in the wings.  I've never been so frightened in my life.  But I was--if I thought that was frightening, my first day on the set was even more terrifying because I had come from the theater, and I thought we were going to rehearse in television.  I--how could you possibly act without rehearing.  And I thought, "Well, when we rehearse, somehow I would know my lines after we rehearsed," because I was taught at the High School of Performing Arts [later Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York City, New York], you don't have to learn lines; you learned--you don't learn lines.  You learn the activity of the scene and the need for those words will inform you of the lines, and it's even more mystical, and you don't sit down and learn 'lines'.  So I had a clear sense of my character, but I hadn't learned the lines.  So I got, (laughs) to the first morning of blocking, and in television, you know, they, you don't rehearse--if you rehearse, you're lucky.  I can count the number of times I've rehearsed.  You, you camera block.  So we camera blocks, and the Director, Michael Miller, at the time realized, "She doesn't know her lines."  He came up to me, and he said, "Do you know your lines?"  I said, "Well, no, aren't we going to rehearse?"  He snatched me, and in the worst way says, "Young lady, I want you to go back to your dressing room right now and learn those lines.  There are no rehearsals.  Go learn your lines.  You are shooting in forty-five minutes."  I have never been (laughs) so terrified in my life because I had no concept of what that meant.  So I must have learned the lines somehow, got through that first day and realized, "Oh, this is a whole different kettle of fish.  There's no rehearsal."  You come to the set fully ready, fully prepared, fully learning your lines, full character, ready to go, knowing exactly what you're going to do, pretty much, because oftentimes television directors are traffic cops.  They pretty much make sure you don't get hit by the camera.  That's about it.  So, (laughs) that was a rude, rude, rude awakening.  Oh, God bless Richard Crenna, he taught me so much on that.  Richard Crenna and Burt Reynolds taught me a great deal about what it's like to be on a set, how to behave on a set, set etiquette.
Speaker 1: Now, what year was this and what was the name of this again?
Speaker 2: This was called 'A Case of Deadly Force' and gosh, what year was this?  I was still living in New York, which means it had to have been before, oh, maybe 1980-1990--oh, gosh, I got out of Julliard [School] in '82 [1982].  It must have been in the late '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Yeah, and 'Beloved' came out around, what '88 [1988]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would say like '87 [1987], '88 [1988], somewhere in there.  Yeah, because I was still very much in New York.  It was before I was married, which was '87 [1987] so it must have been like '86 [1986] or so.  Eighty-five [1985], '86 [1986].  Eighty-five, maybe.
Speaker 1: Okay, was this--when was, did you like the role you played or did that make any difference at the time?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved the role.  It was a lead, it was fabulous.  I was playing a woman whose, whose husband had been wrongly killed, and it was a case of deadly force.  And she was a poor, black woman with children, and Richard Crenna was, was an attorney.  It was a, it was a family law firm.  Actually, at the time, it was a backdoor pilot.  I didn't even know what that meant then.  And I played--I was really good too.  I remember watching that and thinking, oh, you could do this.  You could.  I had a, an innate kind of sensibility for that medium, which was really nice to see.
Speaker 1: And, you know, you don't have a--did you have a sense of watching yourself before, I mean, on stage, of course, you can't watch yourself.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Unless somebody--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) This was the first time I had seen myself, was on this.  It was the first time I had actually, objectively seen myself acting.  It was big and thought, oh, I'm good at that too, excellent.  So in 19--in, in the year 2000, when my then husband, Ron Dortsch--good guy, should have never been married--New York had dried up for him.  I was having a thriving career in New York, and he wanted to move out to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and moved out and said, I, "You know, I'm heading out there.  I hope you, you know, I hope you come along, but I'm heading out," and left.  I cried for about six months and realized, okay, if you want to have a marriage, you've got to move out to L.A., and moved out in the year two--no, in the--yeah, 2000.  No, what, what year are we now, 2004?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, 1990.  I moved out in 1990, yipes, 1990.  And at thirty years old, learned how to drive. (laughs)  That was another--that was something else, coming out to L.A., and then it was really the best thing to have done because I'd got--I'd done theater for all of my life until that point for twenty years and suddenly came out here and was happy to try another medium.

Speaker 1: Now, some of the roles, now, you've played--I know you've been in quite a few historical roles--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Some, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's three--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I have a real proclivity for period pieces.  I, I like playing dress-up.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were in Alex Haley's 'Queen' [TV mini-series].  Is this, in our chronology here, is that like closer to 1990 than-- ?
Speaker 2: You know, I have no idea what I did, when I did, anymore.  You know, that's the blessing of working as much as I, I have because I've, I, I again say this because I'm blessed, and what that means to me is that what God seems to have wanted me to do is, is also what I seem to want to do for--with my life.  There isn't any kind of opposition and many people are, you know, what their hearts desire is, is not what the reality of their lives are.  My, the reality of my life has been realizing one of my heart's desires.  So I, I don't even remember what I've done anymore because I'm so--I'm also very not, I'm not attached to it.  I rarely even watch what I do anymore.
Speaker 1: You know, that movie, I remember, I think that's the first time I remember cause the whole, everybody watching this will remember seeing you, I mean will probably have some idea when they've seen you on television.
Speaker 2: Sure, I remember it was--Halle and I just, Halle Berry and I just did 'Their Eyes Were Watching God', and we were reminiscing about 'Queen', which is when we were down there in South Carolina.  You know, she was just kind of, just kind of on the scene, and, you know, and we were just, you know, both kind of young actors, and that must have been--'Queen' was in the nineties, maybe ninety--I think 'Queen' was after (whew) 'Hudson Hawk' [1991].
Speaker 1: I think so, and I think--(Simultaneously).
Speaker 2: I think 'Queen' was like '95 [1995], maybe [sic, 1993].
Speaker 1: Right, I think you're right.
Speaker 2: Somewhere in there.
Story_ID: 14476
Speaker 1: Now, you were in 'Hudson Hawk' [1991], now, this movie was a, supposed to be a blockbuster, 'Hudson Hawk' was, and it was like one of the biggest Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] flops--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) One of, one of the sort of first huge Hollywood, multi-million dollar flops.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --Bruce Willis the vehicle and he was super hot after that--,
Speaker 2: He was big, um-hmm, sure.
Speaker 1: --and everybody thought this was gonna be the big, summer blockbuster.
Speaker 2: And they spent an enormous amount of money on it, and it was, it was kind of a disaster--great locations, lived in, you know, lived in Italy for a while and Budapest [Hungary].  And it was New York, London, [England], Italy, Budapest.  But it was a disaster, I mean we were shooting, you know, we ended up being--we were supposed to go to Russia, ran out of money in the middle of the film.  The script wasn't finished.  It was, oh, it was chaos and bedlam.  Myself, David Caruso, Andie MacDowell, Bruce, Danny Aiello-- we had a great time in Italy because, you know, Danny, and at the time Danny Aiello was the king of, of--the Viva del Corso [sic, Via del Corso].  You know, he was like, 'The Man' in, in Rome [Italy]; great times, but yes, it was huge flop.  We ended up going to Budapest to a studio which had no heat and very little lighting bec-, to shoot interiors in this studio that hadn't been used in over a decade.  And the first day we got to Budapest, the entire country went on strike.  So there was no, there was no transportation to even get out to the countryside to shoot this movie.  It was just one thing after another.
Speaker 1: So this kind of caper movie, and I think you're killed in this movie and poisoned and (unclear) or something?
Speaker 2: Um, yes, yes.  I played Almond Joy.  We were all named after candy bars.  I played Almond Joy.  I was eventually killed by a poisoned dart.  Wasn't it my own poison dart? (laughs) That was really--it was actually really fun.  It was a fun movie.
Story_ID: 14477
Speaker 1: Okay, now, there's actually a website that has all the movies where you were killed on it.  I don't know if you know this.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) In the case of 'Point of No Return' [1993], which is the remake of, of that wonderful 'La Femme Nikita' which is a wonderful French film.  And I think that we did a pretty decent job on it also, where I played an assassin and Harvey Keitel, 'The Cleaner', kills me and pours acid all over my body.  And I still have people coming up to me and saying, "You know, girl, they done you wrong.  They didn't have to do you like that.  They did not--he did not have to do you like that.  You know, you were a little freaked out, but, you know, he could have calmed you down.  He did not have to kill you." (laughs) Ah, well.
Speaker 1: You know, I can't holler during these interviews or anything so I have to keep a straight face.
Speaker 2: (Laughs)
Speaker 1: But, yeah, there's a website, like I think three times where you're killed--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, that's so funny, you know, the web is interesting.
Story_ID: 14478
Speaker 1: Now, 'Queen' [TV mini-series, 1993]--if I'm correct, you played a character that aged over time in 'Queen', was that?
Speaker 2: I believe I did, yes, yes, yes.  She did, yes.
Speaker 1: And someone who--you know, and you were very convincing.
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you.  I, I like kind of stretching myself like that.  There was one episode of 'Any Day Now' [TV series, 1998], which is a show I did, now, two years ago, that ran for, a nice run, four years on Lifetime [cable television network], where I got to play my own grandmother in a flashback episode of my character.  And so I got to be my own grandmother, which was wonderful.  I looked like my Aunt Yola.  I thought, "Oh, my goodness.  Ooh, I thought I'd look like my mother [Janet Angela Beane Toussaint], I know I look like my Aunt Yola [Beane]--and a little bit like my poodle [Kaia].  She, she wasn't pretty.  I hope I age better than there.
Story_ID: 14479
Speaker 1: Another historical movie that you were involved in was 'Nightjohn' [TV movie, 1996], directed by a black director, Charles--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm, Charles Burnett who did 'To Sleep with Anger' [1990] and a wonderful, wonderful director.
Speaker 1: Before we talk about it, I just wanted to raise a question, what was your first opportunity to work with a black director?
Speaker 2: Ooh, oh, gosh.
Speaker 1: That's got to be--.
Speaker 2: I wonder if Charles Burnett was my first black director.
Speaker 1: I wondered if he was.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: They're few and far between in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California].  I--Charles Burnett may have been the first one on camera because I can certainly count them on one hand.  Oz Scott, Charles, Paris Barclay (pauses) maybe, maybe, maybe Charles.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this movie was produced by [Walt] Disney [Company] of all companies--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, for youth.  It's based on a book by a guy named Gary Paulsen, I think.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, it was, very good.
Speaker 1: But, yeah, Carl Lumbly, yourself and--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Beau Bridges and a wonderful little girl, Alison [Jones], what's her--I don't know her last name and a wonderful, wonderful cast.  Gabe--Gabrielle Casseus, Gabrielle Casseus, played that, oh, but 'Nightjohn' was wonderful, wonderful, and Carl Lumbly was wonderful.  He's one of my favorite actors and one of my favorite actors to work with.
Story_ID: 14480
Speaker 1: Now, well, just give us kind of a review of things you've been involved in, I mean things that you want to talk about that you think are highlights of--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --of your career.
Speaker 2: You know, once I moved out to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] I got to do the first, several episodes--a good handful of episodes on the first five years of 'Law and Order' [TV series], which were thrilling, thrilling, thrilling.  I'd never had that kind of writing anywhere but on the stage, and to--it was the days when Michael Moriarty was at his best.  And he adored me, and I adored him.  We, we would see each other coming and knew it was on.  It was like on--and as actors, we just indulged ourselves with each other.  It was like playland because anything--it was all about what we could throw at each other and how fast or hard and--or high we could hit the ball back.  And those were wonderful, wonderful days in New York [New York], I mean guerrilla, guerrilla T.V., you know, in the snow and the, in Midtown [Manhattan, New York] traffic.  It was Oh, you know, being paid at the time, very little, but wonderful work, and lives on.  I mean there are people today, some fifteen--twelve years later that come up and talk to me about, 'Law and Order' things.  'Nightjohn' [TV movie, 1996] was certainly one, another piece of work that I really am proud of.  I've been, you know, the queen of doing pilots, many of, many of which have not survived. (laughs) Of the series, I've done five series to date.  There was one that was very short-lived that was called 'Leaving L.A.' [TV series, 1997], which was Bay--which was the precursor to that one on, on HBO [Home Box Office, cable network] now that's about death and the funeral home.  This was all about death.
Speaker 1: 'Six Feet Under'.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was the, it was the original 'Six Feet Under', and I--it was a series well before its time.  Nancy Miller wrote and produced it, what a wonderful--who also wrote and produced 'Any Day Now' [TV series], which is where we met.  And she then wrote the role of Rene Jackson for me in 'Any Day Now'.  But that was a wonderful series, where it was all about death, and but death is a fascinating subject to me personally.  I, I'm rather fond of death.  And it was really nice to be a part of that.
Story_ID: 14481
Speaker 1: I was at the theater last night with a--watching a South African play, and I'm going--it's not Sakes Mikiram (ph.), I'm, I'm--forgive me for not remembering this wonderful actor's name, called 'Nothing But the Truth', and it was a one act about South Africa.  And at the end of the show, there was a discussion with the actors, and they were talking about South Africa and the reconstruction of South Africa.  And it was so interesting, and to see how they're progressing and it was a wonderful discussion with the audience.  And at the end of it, I, I made some comment that I was getting up to leave, and the actor [John Kani] came running up to me and said, "No, no, no, you can't--don't leave, don't leave.  I want to thank you."  And he was magnificent last evening, and he said, "I want to thank you because of 'Any Day Now' [TV series], because it's one of the most watched shows in South Africa, and part of our healing.  And within the black community they don't miss it, because it deals with issues that we are presently dealing with in South Africa."  And so I, I made a comment a while back about not wanting to do certain kinds of work anymore because my spirit can't--I don't have the energy to spend on things that don't mean anything, that don't uplift, that aren't, that don't speak to me spiritually, emotionally, that don't involve me, body, mind and soul.  Work like 'Any Day Now', which has such far-reaching ramifications, then that, that is so far beyond me, that's the kind of work I want to do now, to hear that, you know, some, what?  Two years and three years later, this thing is actually part of the solution.  My work is part of something bigger than just a paycheck or being famous or--I'm not--don't get me wrong, I, I want to be comfortable.  I want to do things, but I, I can't do it at the price of my soul anymore.
Story_ID: 14482
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: The African community at large?
Speaker 1: The African American community, yes.
Speaker 2: Well, oh, gosh, I became an American citizen, oh, four years ago (laughs) because I, I felt it was important when [President] George [W.] Bush was, was, was running for president, I, I felt it was important that I have the power to vote.  I'd been a, a resident for thirty years, and my mother[Janet Angela Beane Toussaint] nagged me to become a citizen.  And I didn't know why I should.  I now have dual citizenship, but I wanted to, to have a say in this country, a real say.  I think, you know, to a great extent we still, we're still under the, the--not the shroud, but the pall of slavery where we are still operating under beliefs of entitlement, indebtedness that we're owed.  We're still looking for the "forty acres and a mule" in some way or another.  We're, we're, we're still looking for, for our experience to be one of fairness and one of justice and one of--and I think nothing in life is fair.  There is very little justice to be gotten on, on planet earth.  I think that is a divine quality that we still look to each other for.  I think opportunities are growing.  I have great hope for us, but--and I also believe that we've got a long ways to go.  We've got a long ways to go, I think.  Relationships between black men and black women are, are, are--we're, we're in trouble there.  We're in real trouble here.  I think it's very difficult.  I think it's difficult because the context of, in which we find ourselves in terms of what black women are wanting and, and more and more black women are, are seeming to move ahead in the professional world.  I mean I think it becomes very tough, I mean, to find common ground.  It's getting more and more difficult to find common ground between black men and black women.  I find that to be a real--that's kind of a heartbreaking struggle that I'm finding.  I think our youth are--I have great hope for our youth.  I, I always have hope for youth.  I think just the way our parents looked at us and thought, "Oh, my God, what are they doing with the world, they have no idea.  They're making all these mistakes.  What are they doing?"  I think we're looking at them, going, "My God, rap music, oh, my God, thugs, hip-hop, yada, yada."  I trust, I trust our youth.  I have hope.  I have hope for us.  I think we're moving forward.  I think the opportunities are opening up.  I think we're, we're becoming more and more empowered, internally empowered in terms of who we are and what we, what we're capable of doing, and we're not looking to people to give it to us as much as we were before.
Story_ID: 14483
Speaker 1: Certainly in this town, in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], you know, I've become a producer because I am tired of sitting around waiting for things to be handed to me.  And it's a tough road.  It's a very tough road, you know.  We still don't have--we don't have a black Meryl Streep [actress].  We still don't have a black leading lady.  You know, Halle [Berry] is close to it, but she's not--she's, she still isn't really green lighting films.  We don't--we're not there.  We're not even close to being there.  But quiet as it's kept, it's building.  There is a, there's a network of, of, of like-minded folks who realize that a great deal of your power is behind the camera, and they're writing and producing and creating independence.  We're beginning to fund our own films.  Reuben Cannon is just funding--you know, Reuben is really moving forward in this, and so many, so many black producers are really beginning, beginning able to find our own work and find our own niche and create our own markets.  That's the good news.  It's a struggle.  There's a long--I was nominated for, four, five, I've lost count, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Awards.  And for the first couple of years, before I realized that Della Reese was gonna win every year while 'Touched By an Angel' [TV series] was on the air, because that's what black people were watching, that were voting.  And Della would sit behind me every year.  And it's so funny, I just actually interviewed Della who is the most magnificent woman, for The HistoryMakers in Atlanta [Georgia] a few, about a month ago.  I used to rehearse my speech for the NAACP Awards, but it's something that I really believed, and I hoped to have the opportunity at some point to say back then--I don't know what I'd say now, but there was a point in my career where I wanted to be--it was important to me to be 'The One'.  I had aspirations of being 'The One', 'The Meryl Streep', 'The One', 'The First One', 'The First Black One'--the first black woman that was a force to be contended with as an actress.  And I certainly came out the gate with the, with the capability and the talent and the ability to do just that.  And to find that the arena that I was working in was not welcoming of that, and the time in which I am, I am bringing forth my artistry is not the right time for that.  I realize that I'm not interested in being 'The One' any more, any more, that I'm really invested in being 'One of the Ones'.  And that's a powerful thing, just as Diahann Carroll was one of the one's, just as Halle is now--is going to be one of the ones as she's opening doors, as Angela is one the ones--[Angela] Bassett is one of the ones.  C.C.H. [Carol Christine Hilaria] Pounder is one of the one of the ones.  I'm one of the ones.  Loretta Devine is one of the ones.  You know, and there's a whole new generation of, of young actors and actresses that are coming up that are also, we are passing the baton to.  It will not be in my lifetime.  I know that, and I'm at peace with that.  But I--we are--I'm, I'm not the only black face on television the way Diahann Carroll was when I was growing up.  There are young people who are looking to me, and have gained courage by the steps that I have taken, and they will do the same.  So, yes, it's changing.  It's changing enormously.  It fastly changing.  I have enormous hope.
Story_ID: 14484
Speaker 1: When you look back over all the work that you've been involved in and done, you know, since you started your professional career, is there anything that you would, any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I would come out to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] sooner.  I would have done less theater, because what, what I wasn't taught back then is that the power of the camera, that is a powerful medium in terms of, of creating work and it is about--it's, it's--it isn't even about talent.  It's about perception, and it's a business for, for the very young, and so I would have used--I would not have spent such, that much of my youth, and to them youth is twenties in the theater.  I think I would have come out and I might have gotten famous faster, and the only thing that fame does is it gives one power to, so that I, I might have been in a more powerful position to have my voice be heard to the kind of work that I wanted to bring forth, the kind of work that I'm forging as a producer.  There are so many voices that I want to bring to the forefront.  There are so many of our stories that I want told that it takes a certain level of power.  And one of the ways in which you have power in this town is, is by fame, how much money you can bring in; how recognizable you are; what kind of a commodity you have made yourself and what makes this commodity is the camera.  And so I, I probably would have been savvier about that.  But, you know.  As the great [Edith] Piaf used to say "Je [ne] regrette rien" (speaks French), you know, I regret nothing.
Speaker 1: And now, how did your mother [Janet Angela Beane Toussaint] and your aunt [Yola Beane] and your relatives and family members react to your success as an actress?
Speaker 2: Oh, they're very proud. (laughs)  My mother, my mother was very, very proud.  She saw some of it.  She didn't see a whole lot of it.  She didn't see like the, she didn't see this part of it.  But my aunts, they're very proud.  You know, I'm a little girl from Trinidad, from 10 Black Street, Trinidad, you know, walking to school with books on her back, fulfilling my purpose, my dream.  They're proud, they're very, very proud, and it makes me very happy to make them proud.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what projects do you have for the future that you're working on that are, that you're really excited about, as a producer and an actress?
Speaker 2: Um, there're several films that--movies that I'm, gosh, I'm trying to move forward.  It's like at a snail's pace.  They've been in at Lifetime [cable television network], they've moved them.  These were in turn-around.  There's one project called 'The Joyce Ann Brown Story', which is a project I've developed from the scratch from the book of, true story of Joyce Ann Brown who was a woman falsely accused in Texas, the most extraordinary case, and a wonderful script written by Dianne Houston.  That was at Lifetime for many, two years.  Now, it's in turn around, and I have it back.  I'm trying to sell it again, and I'm in partnership on a project right now that I'm waiting to hear about also at Lifetime, which is--it's untitled, but it's the story of a homeless woman and a, and a police officer and a police woman who develop an extraordinary relationship.  And that's the--I've got another project, 'The Class of '57 [1957]', which again is--this one has nothing to do with me even that I'm trying to sell.  It's just to do with a, a particular football team that, that revolves around Pearl Harbor [Hawaii].  It's a wonderful, wonderful story, so.  And there are books that I'm reading and, and trying to get the rights to, and it's, it's, you know, it's a big, starting up a very steep hill, but it's okay.  These are things I believe in.  In terms of work, nothing at the moment, just finished 'There Eyes Were Watching God' [TV movie], and I'm resting.  I'm, I'm sort of asking myself deeper questions--again, "What am I doing with the rest of my life?"  I'm about to bring a child into my life, and that's gonna change things significantly.  Hope, hopefully, not hopefully, I know deepening, deepening who I am as a woman, as a, as an artist, obviously, because they're inseparable.  I'm just looking for a deeper place from which my work emanates, and in order to do that, I find I am deepening my life.  I've, I've just become licensed as a Spiritual Therapist.  I might hang out a, a therapist's shingle and do that because I'm passionate about that.
Speaker 1: Now, what is a spiritual therapist?  I mean we've, we hear about Reverends and so forth and, and Counselors, but what's a spiritual therapist?
Speaker 2: The particular medium that I work in, it's, it's through the [United] Church of Religious Science and as a licensed practitioner, I am licensed to counsel individuals, families, couples as one might in a therapist, in a traditional therapist office.  The biggest difference being that I don't work in the realm of the psyche.  I work in the realm of prayer.  And anybody that knows anything about prayer, knows that prayer is a very real thing and it actually does work, and it's a scientifically proven thing, and it's--you know, I'm, I'm fascinated as I'm watching the world of science and the world of metaphysics come together in a way that [Albert] Einstein certainly knew a long time ago, and watching that now.  I went to see a movie the other day 'What the 'Bleep' is it All About Anyway?' [sic, 'What the 'Bleep' Do We Know!?', 2004], where it's all about the fact that there's only this one thing, this one entity that exist, period.  And within that is--we have the ability to co-create with that.  And one of the ways the old people always knew of co-creating was with prayer.  It just has different--it's called by different things now, but--so, to make a long story short, I use prayer at the center of my therapy sessions.  That is a spiritual therapist.  And it's, it's, it's not as simple as that because it's something that I've studied for the last six years.  But it is something that I'm passionate about--living in the spiritual realm.
Story_ID: 14485
Speaker 1: What at this point in your career, in your life would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  Awfully young for legacy conversations.  But here's the thing, the party can be over any day now. (laughs) Isn't that interesting.  The party could be over, you never know, you never know when they stop wanting you, where they stop thinking of you as a commodity.  If the party is over, this may be my legacy moment.  I don't think so--I think there's another round in me.  And I'm kind of curious as to what that looks like myself, but my legacy, I think--I will tell you what people tell me, is that, I guess, you know, it sounds so superficial, but people have always looked at me as role models.  The roles that I have taken, I have chosen as much as actors have a choice.  Sometimes, you know, as an earlier, as a young actor, you don't have a whole lot of choice.  You do whatever they give to you, but I have attracted kinds of roles that have been reflective of, of the human spirit.  And I have honestly and wholeheartedly went about representing that unapologetically and without much vanity.  And if there's something I'm proud of, I am proud of the fact that there's a level of selfless abandon with which I approach the work and deliver the work that doesn't very much involve certain aspects of my ego.  So I'm, I'm, I'm--I would say that my legacy was a certain level of truth.  I think I've been able to be fairly truthful with my--in my work.  That's important to me.  That's, I think that's the most important thing to me--and I fight for that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there anything that we haven't asked you or covered that you think that we ought to cover?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness.  Where am I going now?  You know, I don't know.  I, I'm, I'm very curious as to where I am going.  I love acting.  I want to do it some more.  I'm, I'm also starting to write.  I think I might even be a novelist, which is surprising and not surprising me.  It's something that I've known for a long time, and I'm actually now having the courage to actually do it.  So I would say, you know, check me in, in, you know, another twenty-five years, you know, there might be a few books on the shelves, and this might be an interesting--an equally interesting, hopefully, conversation.  And I think we're, we're pretty good.  We've covered it.
Speaker 1: Okay, our last question is, and you're still sort of, still active for this one, but how--it's similar to legacy, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  As a healer.  Isn't that interesting?  I didn't expect that, but as a healer, as a soulful woman, as, as someone who cherished, cherished life and passionately lived every moment.  I don't, I don't, I don't let a lot go by without savoring it.  And that's pretty glorious.  And I, I think I've always done that, even in the, even in the tough moments.  I would like to be remembered as being awake.  If there's one thing I am, it's awake.
