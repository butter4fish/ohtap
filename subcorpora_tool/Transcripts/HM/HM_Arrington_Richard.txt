Speaker 2: Well, I love to travel if I've gotten a partner, so I have--of course, I, I go quite often to the Bahamas, but I, I also travel some in Europe.  I've been to much of Europe and most of the Arab countries.  I once served on Arabic affairs board by President Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.], so I traveled there in most of the Arab count- world.  But I guess my, my, my favorite is probably Egypt.  I, I enjoyed it.  I learned more there than most other places.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite season?  What time of the year do you like best?

Speaker 1: Do you have a, a favorite quote or saying?
Speaker 2: I have several, but for many years I often did the George Bernard Shaw quote because Robert Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] used to use that: "Some men see things as they are and ask why.  I dream things that never were and ask why not."  And that's always one--been one of my favorite quotes.
Speaker 1: That's gonna be one of my favorites also (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 652974
Speaker 1: Let's begin by talking about your ancestry.  And let's start with your mother's side of the family.  Would you tell me your mother's name and spell it for me please; and where and when she was born, if you know.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Mary Ernestine Bell Arrington [Mary Bell Arrington].  She married my father, Arrington [Richard Arrington, Sr.], but Mary Ernestine Bell.  I do know her birth date.  I just don't recall it at the moment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She lived until she was about eighty-three years old before she passed.  And of course, she was born also in Sumter County, Alabama, to, to the Bell family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your mother share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, plenty of them.  She talked a lot about her time in Sumter County high school for Negroes in Livingston, Alabama [Sumter County Training School], where she grew up.  She oftentimes talked about her friends.  She talked about her uncle, D.S. Jones, who was supposedly one of the first blacks to graduate from Selma University here in Alabama [Selma, Alabama].  She oftentimes talked about her mother, Cleo.  And so I--though I never knew my grandma Cleo, who passed be- before I was born, but my mother talked about her often.  And it was--so I had some picture in my mind sort of what she must have been like.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so what--tell me about your mother's education.
Speaker 2: My mother graduated from Sumter County Training School for Negroes in Livingston, Alabama, and that is the extent of her education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I must, I must add that many of her family, however, went to school at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and Alabama A and M University [The State Agricultural and Mechanical Institute for Negroes; Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama].  But for her, just through high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did she have an occupation?
Speaker 2: Just a homemaker, a great--the toughest occupation there is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you did say that your grandmother was Cleo and that--was that Cleo Bell?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cleo Jones Bell [Ella Jones Bell].
Speaker 1: And what about your grandfather, Cleo's husband?
Speaker 2: I never knew him.  He was, he was killed in a, an accident cutting trees, so I'm told, named Fleece was the name, Fleece Bell.
Story_ID: 652975
Speaker 1: What about your great-grandparents?  Do you have any knowledge of them or their names?
Speaker 2: Oliver Bell was my great-great-grandfather [sic. great-grandfather].  And I had the good fortune of knowing him, spending many summers with him, as my parents sent my brother [James Arrington] and me down to the farm every summer after school was out.  And we lived down in the country during the summer.  And so many of those summers I've spent with my great-great-grandfather, maternal grandfather, who was Oliver Bell.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and what was his wife's name?
Speaker 2: Betty Bell was his second wife, was the one that I knew.  My, my, my Uncle Oliver--my great-great-grandfather, Oliver Bell, was, of course, was born on a slave plantation in, in Livingston, Alabama.  In fact, he told me he was five or six years old when [President] Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.  And I have also read some interesting interviews done on the slave narratives in Alabama.  And he, he has done several of those interviews and talked about his time, you know, in--as, as a slave.  He was born on the, the DeGraffenred plantation to--
Speaker 1: Say, say that again please.
Speaker 2: DeGraffenred was the name.  And he oftentimes talked about Lula, Ms. Lula DeGraffenred.  That was the woman who owned the plantation.  But he changed his name after emancipation.  He said he had a tough time learning to spell DeGraffenred, so he changed his name to Bell, and so known as the Bell family (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you, do you know how to spell DeGraffenred?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I know how to spell--
Speaker 1: Can you spell it for me please?
Speaker 2: --DeGraffenred.  That's a popular name here in Alabama.  The DeGraffenreds are active in politics here, and it was D-E-G-R-A-F-F-I-E-N-D [sic.], Graffen- R-I-E-N-D [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, and okay, so he changed his name to Bell, okay.  And do you remember any of the stories that he, that he told you about life on the plantation, anything in particular?
Speaker 2: No, he talked most, mostly about, you know, what he remembered about his mother, and I have heard a few of those stories.  Most of the times, I, what I've heard about it--because he lived on what the black people in that area called the, the, the Bell plantation.  They really thought our family owned it, but it was the DeGraffenreds that owned it.  And my grandfather [Fleece Bell] and his brothers all grew up on that, and they lived there e- even after the slavery was over.  The DeGraffenreds let them live on that-- what was formerly the plantation.  It's always interesting to me, because in Birmingham [Alabama], I run into people who were from that area, and they think, well, you're a Bell and you're from the Bell plantation.  They thought we owned that.  We never really owned that.  It was simply where my family had grown up, and, and they had been slaves there.  And my father [Richard Arrington, Sr.] when he married my mother [Mary Bell Arrington], they, they lived on that land there too and farmed it as sharecroppers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you mentioned that Oliver talked about his mother.  Do you remember her name?
Speaker 2: No, I, I really don't.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I sometimes think I get a little confused because I have read his slave narrative.  And reading that and then trying to recall what he told me, I, I sometimes get the two mixed up.  I'm not sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 652976
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Mary Bell Arrington] have siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes, she had a brother, Clyde [Clyde Bell], and a sister, Eloise [Eloise Bell].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They both lived with us for a while once we had moved to Birmingham [Alabama].  And I knew--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --both of them well.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And let's see, and any--okay, Cleo [Arrington's maternal grandmother, Ella Jones Bell] and Fleece [Arrington's maternal grandfather, Fleece Bell], do you know of--those would be your aunts and uncles.  Did they have any siblings that you know of?
Speaker 2: My, my aunt Eloise had a son.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my uncle Clyde had no children.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  All right, is there anything else about the Bell family that you'd like to share or that you might know?
Speaker 2: Well, the Bell family in Livingston, Alabama, Alabama, it's a pretty well known name, 'cause there are quite a few Bells there.  And a couple of my great-great-uncles were fortunate enough to go to school, at least for a while.  I'm not sure they graduated or got degrees.  But we have some taught at A--and went to A and M, Alabama A and M University [The State Agricultural and Mechanical Institute for Negroes; Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama]; some went to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], and they both taught school along with marrying school teachers.  And so among black families down in Livingston, Alabama, the Bell name is--family is sort of well known because they taught school; and they was among a few blacks who had had the benefit of some college education.
Story_ID: 652977
Speaker 1: Before we go forward, w- let's talk about your father and his, his family.  So, tell me your father's name, spell it for me please; and when and where he was born.
Speaker 2: My father was Richard Arrington [Richard Arrington, Sr.] (cough), and he was born in Livingston, Alabama, really on a little suburb called York, Y-O-R-K, York, Alabama.  But (cough) he was one of thirteen children, twelve of them I, I knew--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --(unclear).  One of his brothers died young, before I knew him, died as a result of an athletic competition.  But my, my father was very gifted, but he only had a third grade education in a one room schoolhouse.  But he was, he was steel worker here in Birmingham [Alabama].  He started out as a tenant farmer or a sharecropper in Livingston, Alabama, he and my mom [Mary Bell Arrington].  He moved us in nineteen forty--somewhere around 1941 or somewhere, there.  He--after he had come to Birmingham and gotten a job in the steel mills in Birmingham, he moved his family to Birmingham and where of course I grew up here in, in, in the city.  And I was about five years old when my father moved us here, moved his family here.  My father has built a number of homes.  He was a gifted, a brick mason, a carpenter, auto mechanic, only a third grade education, an avid reader.  I oftentimes recall my dad every evening coming home from the steel plant, sitting on the porch, porch light on, reading newspaper.  He loved to read the newspaper.  And he would often read and lip read and (makes sound)--I could hear his trying to sound words out.  He would oftentimes call me out and say, "Bae," that was his, what he'd call me, on the porch reading, "what is that word?  Sound that word."  So, I, I always thought my dad was a very brilliant man who had limited amount of education--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but a very wonderful man.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me about his parents.
Speaker 2: Matthew, my, my father's father was Matthew Arrington.  And as I said, there was thirteen of them.  He was married to, first to Barba- Barbara Arrington.  I never knew Barbara.  She died, and, and I didn't know, I didn't know her.  His second wife was Willie Gray Arrington, and I did know her.  And so during the summers we spent, in that area down in Livingston, some of the time was spent with my paternal grandfather and--Matthew Arrington and his wife and his second group of children, who were about five or six of them.  And some of the time was spent with Oliver Bell, my maternal great-grandfather.  I also knew my grandfather's mother, who was Ann [Ann Arrington (ph.)].  Ann was born a slave, and I always thought when I first saw her that she was absolutely white, I always thought, 'cause she looked absolutely white to me.  Her father was a white man there in Livingston.  And even today when I look at pictures of her, she's one of those, one of those of us who were black but have a lot of white features.  And I, I didn't know much about her, but I would see her during the summer 'cause my, my granddad had her living next to him in a small cabin.  And I just knew her as Grandma Ann and didn't say much to her but thought she looked very strange always (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay and all right.  And, and her last name was, was Arrington?
Speaker 2: Arrington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, my family tells me that her father was Leland Nixon [Leland J. Nixon], a white man, and that she looks just like her sister, who was also white, a white woman, that you could, could hardly tell them apart is what my family said.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and so Matthew's father, you did not know?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, because he was, supposedly was a, a, a, a, a white slave owner.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Well, his, his, his, yeah, his mother was a, was a slave.  That's Grandma Ann.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we're just thinking that--well, what people say is that Leland Nixon was--would have been of that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They say that was, yeah.
Speaker 1: --would, would--okay, I got--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what they say.  I, I don't--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --know that.
Story_ID: 652978
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Mary Bell Arrington] and father met?
Speaker 2: My, my mother told me that when she--her, her mother [Ella Jones Bell] had died of a heart attack.  And she just--as she was finishing high school [Sumter County Training School, Livingston, Alabama], and she shortly thereafter began dating my father.  She was living with her father [Fleece Bell], and she said a year or so or less after she graduated from high school, her father was working, cutting trees, and he was killed.  A, a tree fell on him.  She was dating my father at the time, Richard [Richard Arrington, Sr.].  And at--shortly, about less than a year after her father died, my father married her, took her, her brother--she was their oldest child.  She had a brother, Clyde [Clyde Bell], sister, Eloise [Eloise Bell].  Then my father married her and, and she said raised her, her sister, and her brother.
Speaker 1: And what, what year was your father born?
Speaker 2: I don't remember a year.  My father lived until he was--he would have been eighty years old when he passed.  And I have all that kind of information I keep, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in this advanced stage of life, I can't call all of it off--recall all of it off top of my head, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was, was he older, much older than your mother?
Speaker 2: No.  My (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, okay.
Speaker 2: --my, my father was about, what, about seven, eight years older than my mother.
Story_ID: 652979
Speaker 1: Let's talk about what would be your earliest childhood memory.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I tell people I remember, though I was only five years old when we left the farm and my dad [Richard Arrington, Sr.] moved us to Birmingham [Alabama], but I still have in my mind, you know, memories of the farm and what it was like.  Some people question that, but I, I do, you know.  I've tried to tell them I, I, I remember the house.  I remember the windows.  We didn't have--really had windows, just open windows.  I remember my mama [Mary Bell Arrington] used to do the wall with sheets from catalogs is what they covered the wall, wallpaper in.  I remember a lot of things.  I can remember where the, where the, where the hog pen was and where my daddy's carpenter shop was down the hill and things of that sort.  But I guess the real thing that I remember is when my dad moved us to Birmingham.  I remember his coming--I think it was--they tell me it was his brother's car, and, we--I remember him tying a, a mattress to the roof of the car, and we drove to Birmingham.  And we got into Birmingham that evening, just slightly after dark.  And I, I have never forgotten that.  For me it was the most fascinating thing.  I, I got there that, that night, and that house that we moved into is still right where it was.  In fact, I have pictures of that.  And, and--
Speaker 1: Do you remember the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) it stands there right now, a double tenant house my, my parents moved into.  And I remember that night hearing something.  I, I thought it was maybe a train.  And, and I asked my mama, "What, what was that?"  And she said, "Baby that's a streetcar."  I didn't know what a streetcar was.  And it turns out it used to be a streetcar, and it was number seven car, used to come down in--about a block from my house and would turn around.  And I remember that evening 'cause I wanted to get the next morning.  I wanted to see a streetcar.  What, what, what was a streetcar?  I had never--and then, course I remember seeing and thinking, well, it's sort of like a train.  I had been to a train station once or twice down in Livingston [Alabama], but I had not seen a streetcar.  So I always remember that trip that we made when we moved to Birmingham, and my dad was, of course, working in the steel mills here.
Speaker 1: And you remember the hou- do you remember the address of the house?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, 5618 Avenue H.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so describe the house and how--
Speaker 2: It's a--
Speaker 1: --how different was it?
Speaker 2: --it was just a double tenant house, you know.  We rented it from a man, Mr. Studerant [ph.], who owned several houses (unclear), a black man named Studerant.  He owned several houses there in that block.  We lived in a double tenant house.  It was just three rooms.  We had a living room, a bedroom, and a kitchen.  I remember it quite well.  We, when we first moved there the toilet was out.  There was a dry toilet out back.  Some years afterwards we got a toilet (unclear). I guess the city--we were in the suburb of Fairfield [Alabama].  I guess the city mandated it, but eventually we had to get toilets, so we got a toilet on the back porch.  I, I remember it well, and a kitchen with a stove and the tubs we took our baths in and the icebox.  We bought ice and kept it in the icebox, and the rollaway bed that my brother [James Arrington] and I slept in that we rolled it out of the living room into the bedroom every night, the fireplace (laughter).  I, I remember it all.  But it's, the house is still there today.  Some young couple just bought it.  I drive by occasionally because it's out near where I teach sometimes at the college.  And I drive by just out of memory--drive by the street, and there's that double tenant house.  We lived on one side.  Another family called the Reid family [ph.], they lived on the other side.  They had, they had three children, and they lived on, on that side.  And so it all--you know, it, it just stays in my memory and occasionally when I'm driving by, I just drive down that street and drive by that house.  In fact, I was doing--after I was mayor, one day I walked into the archives office of the city.  And the archivist there, Dr. Baggens [ph.], says, "I want to show you something."  And he goes and pulls out the file, and there's a picture of my--of the home.  I mean, he had gotten it from the tax file, the home that I, I grew up in.
Story_ID: 652980
Speaker 1: And you did mention your brother.  Tell me your brother's name.  And when was he born?
Speaker 2: I'm two and a half years older than my brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: May 29th is his birthday (clears throat).  His name is James H. Harold--James Harold Arrington [James Arrington].  He now lives in South Carolina.  He is--he recently retired from South Carolina State University [Orangeburg, South Carolina].  He was a academic vice president there.  And before that he was chairman of the science department at South Carolina State, yeah, University.  There's just two of us.  We both were, somehow ended up in science.  He's a graduate of, of Georgia--University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] and spent much of his time--he started off in Clark College [Clark Atlanta University].  I mean, that's sort of where we differed.  He, he left home as soon as he could and went to Atlanta [Georgia] in Clark College and got his master's degree there in Ohio.  And anyway, he ended up--he ended up down in South Carolina, where he's retired.  But we stay in touch.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, great.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 652981
Speaker 1: This house on Avenue H, you gave us a description of, of the house.  So now give me a description of the neighborhood.  If you were to take me on a square block, tell me who are your friends that live in that area, what stores, and who owns them if you know?
Speaker 2: Well, the neighborhood has changed somewhat.  First of all the streets are now paved and been paved for a long time.  When I was growing up there they were, they were not paved.  They were just dirt streets.  And when it rained, you had to come slowly up the hill, the incline.  I lived--we lived in--I lived on the street Avenue H.  My father [Richard Arrington, Sr.] would later build a home two blocks down the street himself.  He built a brick home on the other side of the street.  Our street always divided the City of Birmingham [Alabama] from the suburb of Fairfield [Alabama], so I lived on the, on, on, on, on the Fairfield side, which meant I went to the Fairfield public schools.  My friends across the street lived on the Birmingham side, and they had to go to the Birmingham public schools.  That was (unclear) always I thought interesting about that particular street.  But all the people were steel workers, and most of the mothers stayed home.  A few of them did housework for other people, but most of them stay- stayed at home.  So it mainly the steel workers.  And we, we knew, you know, everybody on the street.  We--I grew up with many, many of the kids there.  We played, and that's just the way the family were--families were.  Later on, some families would build homes in that area, but most of the people were tenant or farm- or people who had formerly farmed and had moved to the area, and they just rented.  They were, they were renters there.  And they were renting their homes just like the ones I, I lived in.  There were a few families on the street there, as I recall, three or four families that owned their homes, had what I'd call nicer homes.  But that's sort of was the way the neighborhood was, I, way I recall it.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember or do you still have any childhood friends from that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I stayed in touch with many of my friends from high school and on.  And we oftentimes had class reunions.  In fact, we still have class reunions, believe it or not.  I'm eighty-three--going on eighty-three years old and--but every July 4th, the graduates of what was the black high school, Fairfield Industrial High School for Negroes [Fairfield Industrial High School, Fairfield, Alabama], where I was educated, we, we, we have our reunion every year.  For example, most of the people in my class, most of them have passed now.  I can tell you that I have to think there are four or five of us living.  Even when I look at the graduation picture, most of them have passed.  But we still have our reunions.  All of the different classes come back from the old high school before there was desegregation following the Brown decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], but this is like about 1960s.  They closed the school now.  I had graduated from the high school in '51 [1951].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, so we, we kept in touch, because it was a high school of families of steel workers, mostly just about all the people who worked in the steel mill.  A few of the, the women, a few of the mothers worked in homes.  But it was a pretty close knit family in, in Fairfield, so we knew just about all of the families, particularly in the, what we called the black area of Fairfield.
Story_ID: 652982
Speaker 1: Tell me about your elementary school.  What was the name of the elementary school?
Speaker 2: My elementary school, which is still in existence today, is Robinson Elementary School [Fairfield, Alabama].  It was, when I was there, it was called 61st Street Elementary School.  The principal was a lady named Robinson, so they later--after she passed, they later renamed the school in her honor.  So it's still there today in the same site, called Robinson Elementary School, just a block and half from the high school which I grew up in, which was Fairfield Industrial High School [Fairfield, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And who were some of the teachers that you remember that might have been influential while--during your elementary school years?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I would immediately think of Mrs. Cooke [ph.], who taught history and some government.  I think of Angelina Ray, who, who is the mother--who, who is the mother of Condoleezza [Condoleezza Rice], Angelina Ray [Angelina Ray Rice], who taught me all the grammar I know to this day, 'cause when I was in her class in the eighth grade I had never heard about conjugating the verb and the stuff like that.  And I get in her class, I, I learned, as I have told Condoleezza a number of times, every bit of the little grammar I know is that your mama taught.  I didn't know anything about conjugating a verb until I, I was in Angelina Ray's class.  Angelina Ray with--in marrying a high school basketball coach, Reverend Rice, Amos Rice [sic. John Wesley Rice, Jr.], and that's Condoleezza's father.  And my brother [James Arrington] played on his basketball team there in the high school.  I remember (unclear), but most of all, those of us who graduated from Fairfield Industrial High School remember our principal, E.J. Oliver.  Some of the streets in that area now are named for him, and we still think that he was very firm, ran the school with an iron hand.  Most of us testify today, in adulthood, that he was probably the best educator there ever was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in elementary school, what were some of your extracurricular activities?
Speaker 2: Well, I--it, it turned out well.  I started out--my, my mom [Mary Bell Arrington]--I had just--we'd moved here when I was five.  And, and so I remember my mom taking me to register in elementary school, and I still remember how terrible it was.  I cried and all every day.  My mom would walk me six or seven blocks from the house to school.  And soon as she get me to school ground, turn around and leave me I'd cry.  I was a--at that time, believe it or not, I look at pictures, first grade, I was a redhead.  I was probably the only redhead in my--in the whole school.  The kids made (unclear)--made fun of me.  But I'd cry until I, I--I must have done it for a week, until my mama threatened to whip me if I didn't stop crying and my teacher too, so.  I started out in first, first grade.  And I, I finally had Ms. Wilhite.  I'll always remember my first grade teacher.  And so it worked out well with first grade teacher.  And by the third grade, they decided to skip me a grade.  I got Ms. Williams [Mary Williams] was teaching me.  She, she thought she skipped me, and she skipped me a grade, so I skipped out of the third to the fifth grade.  And I remember that teacher 'cause I didn't know my time tables.  I'll never forget that, how hard (laughter) the time I had trying to remember my time tables.  But it, it all turned out well, elementary school.  Ms. Gray [ph.] was my seventh grade teacher, and she was very demanding.  But these are folk, when I look back on it, who shaped my life and the way I thought about things, and.  Them plus my mama putting me on the porch every day when I got home after school and would go over the homework and make me read, try to read, it's, it's, it's amazing when you look back on your life how thing- my mom used to have me reading, and you know, I and I'd try to read and I'd get--I, I'll never forget when I'd get to a word--it was--I think it was is, and every time I get to is I couldn't say it.  I'd forget it.  I had a block, 'cause she had a switch (laughter), and she would hit me.  I'll never forget that, but it all paid out in the long run, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so did Robinson Elementary, did it go through the seventh grade?
Speaker 2: Yes, seventh grade (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 652983
Speaker 1: And so, Fairfield [Alabama], so, tell me about the transition from elementary school to high school.  Now, did you become a, a better student?  Did you (laughter) learn to read and--well, of course you learned to read, but I mean did it get easier for you as a student?  And, and tell me what were your favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, I, I sort of think I, I felt like from the fifth grade on I was a pretty good student.  But really, my mother [Mary Bell Arrington] was pretty demanding, so I was always a good--I had to bring home good grades.  I mean, it was just no question about it.  And during that time, I had to always make A in conduct.  You know, you--and that's just the way--not only my parents; most of the parents were that way.  You couldn't give--create any problems in school.  So I have always been pretty good.  I only had some difficulty in elementary school.  I had been pretty good.  When they skipped me a year, as I said, I didn't know my--I didn't memorize the time tables, and I, I had a little trouble there.  That's the only time I had any difficulty.  But my mom drilled me and drilled, and I, I learned that, and from there I only was pretty good.  I got seventh grade Mrs. Gray [ph.], and she was just very demanding.  And you know, they all used corporal punishment during that day.  You'd get the strap.  You'd get whipped in your hand if you didn't know things and all of that.  And I, I think I was scared to death, so I, I was, you know, I was always pretty good.  And so I went through the seventh grade at Robinson [61st Street Elementary School; Robinson Elementary School, Fairfield, Alabama], and then from there we all moved a block and a half to the high school, Fairfield Industrial High School [Fairfield, Alabama].  And I did well at Fairfield Industrial High School, except, you know, it was a--all the black schools were called industrial high schools.  Like, Parker High School here was the largest--once the largest black high school in America was Parker High School in Birmingham [Alabama].  But the name for it is really Parker Industrial High School [Industrial High School; A.H. Parker High School].  It all falls back to the idea of how you educate blacks, and you teach them to use skilled hands and so forth.  And so though we had a, an outstanding principal who ran his school with a firm hand, who, one of the few schools that taught Negro history way back then--we all had to take a class in Negro history--but it was an industrial curriculum.  And so when you, you, you, you get--you finish your tenth grade, it'll--in the tenth grade you have to decide what trade you're gonna take.  And so the principal would take the tenth graders in and get them ready for eleventh grade, and he would ask, you know, what one you wanna do.  And some of them went in upholstery, some went in auto mechanics, tailoring, things of that sort.  Well, my buddy and I, in high school, in the tenth grade, we decided we wanted to be in tailoring.  And so we went--we wanted tailoring.  Well, when the principal was taking the names of tailoring, there were a whole bunch of people who wanted tailoring.  So he says, "Put the name--," and we put our names in the hat.  And the first--I don't know--it was seven or ten names were the ones chosen.  Well, my name wasn't chosen.  So I looked at my buddy who influenced me a lot, Thomas Harden, and I said, "What we gonna do?"  And he said, "Well, let's go in dry cleaning," (laughter).  So, sure enough, I started eleventh grade taking up dry cleaning.  In the eleventh grade, in the morning I took dry cleaning half the day.  In the twelfth grade, in the afternoon I took dry cleaning.  That was crazy.  The principal had asked, "Are y'all--you know, anybody going to college?"  We, no, we had said we weren't going to college.  I think that was the influence mainly of my friend.  My, my mom and them had already said, you know, "You're going to college; you're going to college," and--but I, here I am studying a trade.  And I guess it sort of paid off.  I did--my first job was to work in--the way I got through college was working as a dry cleaner.  It paid my tuition to go to college [at Miles College, Fairfield, Alabama].  But anyway, it was, it was a trade oriented curriculum.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And most of us, 95 percent of us, of the black kids, took the--had a trade, took auto mechanics or upholstery or shoemaking--shoe repairing, stuff, stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you participate in any extracurricular activities?  Did--were you in sports or band or--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.
Speaker 1: --anything like that?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I loved to, to play football and basketball with the kids, but I was never good enough to make the team.  I, I went out for a basketball team, and I was very disappointed.  I, I still to this, this very day at eighty-seven years old, I still think the only reason I never made the basketball team is because I was considered to be a good student academically.  And a lot of the athletes there with me and were buddies of mine, they were a little louder than I was, a little more active.  And, and I thought I was pretty good.  But I went out for the basketball team, and I didn't make it, and the coach made me the manager of the team.  I became the manager for our football and our basketball team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so in the eleventh and twelfth grade I was the team manager.  And so I knew all the athletes.  They were all my buddies.  I'd tape their ankles and I did things like that and of course, there with all the games, which I guess was the next best thing to not being on the team since I didn't have the ability to make the team.
Story_ID: 652984
Speaker 1: In high school [Fairfield Industrial High School, Fairfield, Alabama], now your parents [Mary Bell Arrington and Richard Arrington, Sr.] wanted you to go to college; your friends, not so much.  So, what made you decide that you would go to college?
Speaker 2: Well, nobody in my immediate family--you know, I had some uncles who had done a year at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and a year at A and M [The State Agricultural and Mechanical Institute for Negroes; Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama], he's a--studied agriculture or so, and then they had taught in the black schools down in Livingston [Alabama].  But nobody in my immediate family had gone to college.  But my mom had always said you know, "You're gonna go to college, go--," and so I just never thought of anything else.  I mean, it had been hammered into my head.  And, and, and so when I finished high school and college started, I applied for the college.  The only one where I could--I was able to go to at the time was right there at--I live just about two blocks or three blocks off of the campus, Miles College in Birmingham [sic. Fairfield, Alabama], the black college [HBCU] there (clears throat) so I went there.  There was no--and I paid my tuition by working at the, a dry cleaners.  I worked there for, for four years until I was fired in my senior year, with about a year to go.  I worked there, and that's where I paid my tuition.  It wasn't very much tuition.  My parents didn't have--contribute any cash.  Of course they supported me a lot of other ways.  But I, I, I'd leave class every day.  I'd work in there during the school year, afternoon, catch the bus, go downtown.  Howard Cleaners [Birmingham, Alabama], that's where I worked, and in the summer I worked there full time, and I paid my way through college.
Speaker 1: Who owned the, the cleaners that you worked in?
Speaker 2: Charlie Howard, a white family, he, he owned a, a major cleaners downtown, and they had branch- branches throughout the town, what they call branch offices.  And I did everything there.  I, I worked on the machines, all of that.  I did the plumbing work.  During the summer I drove the truck.  I delivered the laundry and the dry cleaning to the different plants.  I did everything in the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in, in, in the dry cleaning industry there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you remember how much you got paid?
Speaker 2: Oh, about twenty-five dollars a week and during the summer when I worked full time.  I got less than that when I was part time 'cause I would finish class, jump on the bus, ride downtown to the, the cleaners, and then in the evenings I'd work until about seven or eight [o'clock].  My job was to clean the place up, dressed the machines where you press the plants and things of that sort, keep them dressed, do odd jobs.  And then in the summer I'd come in.  I was what the Howards called the round man.  I, I would spell people on vacation.  When the man who ran the dry cleaning was on vacation I did the dry cleaning.  I was over that.  When the man who fired the boiler was on vacation, I was the boiler firer.  Some of the guys, truck drivers, I would drive truck.  I did a number of things.  In fact, I'll never forget Mr. Howard, Charlie Howard, Jr., you know, he, he tried to get me to drop out of college.  I never forgot.  That's funny, think about that sometimes.  And he said, "Richard [HistoryMaker Richard Arringto], what are you doing?  Are you studying the birds and the bees?  You don't need to be there, do you, I mean--," and thank goodness, you know, by luck and my family, I was smart enough to stay in school instead of dropping out and staying at the--working at the dry cleaners.  But I still think about that (laughter).

Speaker 1: Did your family attend church in--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You did?  What church did you attend?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a Primitive Baptist, foot washing Primitive Baptist (clears throat).  My dad [Richard Arrington, Sr.] was a member of the Primitive Baptist church.  And my mama [Mary Bell Arrington] said when they got married she switched over from Missionary Baptist to Primitive Baptist.  I grew up in a church right here in--out in Fairfield [Alabama].  To this day, I am still a member of that church [Crumbey Bethel Primitive Baptist Church].  I'm a deacon on the deacon board of that church.  And I went there when I was six years old, and that's a church I'll belong to all my life.  I've lived other places, but I've never been a member of any other church.
Speaker 1: And, and as you got older, what activities--before you got to be a deacon, 'cause I know that took a, a little while.  But as a, a youth, what were some of the activities at the church that you participated in?
Speaker 2: Well, I--Vacation Bible School, I always recall that.  It was a fun time and a lot of kids involved every summer.  And then my aunt, you know, was one of the teachers in Vacation Bible School.  So my brother [James Arrington] and I were--always attended a Vacation Bible School.  But I was a regular Sunday school attendant, attending through my mom, wanted to make sure I got the--then I became at a very young age the secretary for the Sunday school and things of that.  So, so, so I sort of grew up in the, in the church, yeah, started out when I was like six or seven years old.  And there was just no question; on Sunday mornings that's what you did.  On Sat- when--on the weekend on Saturdays you got your clothes ready.  Mama got everything ready, sometimes cooked.  On Sunday you do, then you go to church.  You get up and go to church and that.  So that's the way the family was, and that's how we grew up.
Story_ID: 652986
Speaker 1: You're attending Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama]; and who is the, the president at the time that you attend?
Speaker 2: When I first enrolled in Miles College--let's see--W.A. Bell [William A. Bell] was the president at that time.  I went to Miles.  I, I graduated from high school [Fairfield Industrial High School, Fairfield, Alabama].  I think I was sixteen years old when I graduated, went right in and went, went right to Miles that, that, that fall.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so what, what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Fifty- yeah, '51 [1951].
Speaker 1: Fifty-one [1951], okay.
Speaker 2: And, and Miles in '55 [1955].  And--
Speaker 1: And what were you studying at Miles?
Speaker 2: I, I, I, I, I stu- I ended up studying biology.  I, I, I was just fortunate again.  As I said, I was working, going to school, and I just fortunate enough that, that that a few teachers took interest in students.  And I had no idea what I was gonna do, but I just knew I was going to school, didn't know what I was gonna, what I was gonna major in.  And I, I never forget I had a woman who taught psychology, and she just stopped me one day.  I was--said, "Richard [HistoryMaker Richard Arrington], you know, what, what are you gonna major in, son?"  I said I didn't know, and she said, "Well, I think you got an aptitude for science.  I want you to go talk to Mr. Jones."  And that was a key time in my life.  I went and talked to this biology teacher.  And it was then I decided I'd major in biology.  And it was then and there he took an interest in me and his other students, and he said to me, "You ought to go to graduate school."  I didn't have any idea what graduate school was.  I was trying (laughter) to get through undergrad but I had never heard of graduate school.  But you know, he impressed and pushed me, and I ended up applying up at the University of Detroit [University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan] for graduate school.  And sure enough, I was accepted there and worked--after I graduated from Miles right up to Detroit [Michigan] to University of Detroit in graduate school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Traumatic experience for me.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) First time in my life had left--ever left Alabama.
Speaker 1: Wait--
Speaker 2: I'm just--
Speaker 1: --wait, we're gonna talk about that, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --let's, let's finish up at, at Miles, because, be- the teacher that stopped you, the psychology teacher, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Verdell Martin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And once you started in the field of biology, were--did you become just fascinated with, with science?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, indeed, I did.  I had not thought about that before.  I'd had biology in high school.  In fact, I still remember my high school biology teacher and who she was.  But I, you know, I hadn't thought about being a biologist.  Then I started in my junior year at Miles College majoring in biology.  I became very interested in biology--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and became sort of fascinated with it and started really studying biology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the competition was pretty keen there.  But as I said, we had two or three good biology teachers.  And, and I had one, Emmett Jones, and he was encouraging some of us to go further.  And of course, I was one of the students he encouraged to go to graduate school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he sat down and helped me fill out the application.  I, I got a teaching fellowship to teach freshman biology at University of Detroit.
Story_ID: 652987
Speaker 1: You said this was a new experience because you had never left Alabama.  And so tell me about the experience of going from Alabama to Detroit [Michigan], to the big city (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah (unclear), it was, it was traumatic.  I was twenty years old, never been out of Alabama in my life.  And I go down to get a--Greyhound bus station, go to Detroit, with my family.  I, I cried 'cause I don't want to go (laughter).  I go to Detroit.  I'm in school [at the University of Detroit; University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan], about, about twelve, fifteen thousand students there.  Only, only about fifty or sixty of us black.  I'm the only black in the biology department, the only one.  I'm very conscious of that.  The other students there were very kind to me, the other teaching fellows, you know, but I wasn't accustomed to that.  The relationship with whites, I just--in, in, in Birmingham [Alabama] I didn't--only white folk I knew were those I'd worked for.  The only contact I ever had with white people was when I bought something across the county.  That's the way Alabama was, so I didn't know white folk.  I--and here I am here with--all the other students were white.  And they kid around and play (unclear).  All that was strange to me, very traumatic.  I was also very aware of the fact I'm black.  When the genetics class or something, they asking questions, I just felt I had to know the answer every time.  If I didn't know the answer, which I sometimes didn't know (laughter), I had let the whole black race down.  I mean, I went through that for almost a year be- and then, then the end of the year I see I was doing as well as the others and better than a lot of them, and so I began to get some sense of who I was and all of that.  But twenty years of racial segregation and bigotry in Alabama had really scarred me.
Story_ID: 652988
Speaker 1: We didn't talk about any discrimination or bigotry during your years growing up.  Are there specific incidences that you can talk about that you might have experienced?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I, I, I think I was fortunate.  My family--my mom [Mary Bell Arrington]--first of all, (cough), even in the neighborhood I lived, kids had to be pretty obedient.  Parents were pretty strict about that.  And parents, particularly black parents, worries about what happened with kids, particularly boys, what's gonna happen with police officers, because really there were lots of unpleasant experiences that we--I was a paper carrier.  I used to carry the Birmingham Post-Herald newspaper when I was a young kid.  And (cough) of course this place was originally segregated.  I can remember one day we were down where we pick up the newspaper.  I still think about it when I drive through that area now.  We'd go down every day to pick up papers and come back.  Through--one day we got there early, waiting for the truck to bring the papers, the white carriers and the black carriers.  So then we started playing football, black boys playing the white boys, football.  I can remember the police coming and cussing us out, I mean, just stopped (unclear), something you would think wouldn't happen today, but they did.  And I, I remember things like that.  My cousin and I were the paper carriers.  His, his, his, his grandfather had gotten a paper route for us.  And so we'd start out and then we'd--coming through Fairfield [Alabama] there was a great baseball park over there.  It was a white park.  Everything was, you know, segregated.  So we stopped and put our papers down and watched them play baseball, set on the on edge.  And police come along two or three times threatening to cuss us and threaten--move.  I mean, I had those.  But the, the experience really gets me, and I still think about it.  Of course I wanted a job.  All my buddies would get a job during the summer, and I wanted a job and we all get--most of them had a job.  They would cut the grass, cut lawns for folk, and we'd even talk about it, "It's my lady; I'm gonna cut her grass every--," you know, we'd just--and I was trying to get--so I, I got a, a job for the spell to work in place of a guy who delivered groceries on a bicycle, just had a bicycle with a basket on it in a small store down there.  And he would--people who traded with--and he would take the groceries to their home.  And I will never forget it.  So, Mr. Lewis [ph.], who owned the grocery store down there, white family, and a lot of us traded there.  So they let me work there because the guy who was the delivery man, young fellow about seventeen, eighteen years old, was gone on vacation, so he let me work during the vacation period.  And I will never forget it.  I was so excited.  And the first day, I--the first order I had to carry out from the store was about a block down the street on the bicycle.  And I went to this lady's house.  And I drive by that house today and I still think about this.  And I, I'm so excited about this job.  I get the groceries out, come back with the groceries, and I go to this front door and I knock on the door.  That lady opened that door, and she--that was the meanest woman I've ever seen in my life.  She called me all kind of things.  And she told me, "Nigger, don't come to her front door.  You'd better get to the back."  I will never forget that.  That was shocking thing for me.  I, and I don't know whether I might have been about fourteen or fifteen years old.  And I think about that even today, 'cause I drive by that house even today and I think about that experience.  But you know, that was what it was like; Alabama was like that, and--yeah.
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that your parents told you to keep you safe as a young man growing up in, in, in Birmingham [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Stay out of trouble, come home.  I had a curfew.  My brother [James Arrington] and I always had a curfew.  We had to be home, even when I was going--even after I--I didn't get past a curfew until I got in college [at Miles College, Fairfield, Alabama] a year or two.  But in high school [at Fairfield Industrial High School, Fairfield, Alabama] I had to be at home.  But even when I--my freshman year in college, I, I'll never forget.  I was dating a young lady, and I had to catch a bus to get to her house, I did by a bus.  But I always had to be home by eleven.  I'll never forget one, one evening I let the bus--little bus, whatever--run by, and I missed the bus and I had to walk all the way.  So I was running and walking trying to get home.  And I, I guess about five or six blocks from my home, here comes my dad [Richard Arrington, Sr.] driving in a car.  He's looking for me.  My mom is--insisted he come find me, 'cause it's after eleven o'clock.  I hadn't made it home.  And I'll never forget that.  And of course, my mom, oh, man, she talked to me something awful.  I never again got home after eleven o'clock.  My dad didn't say that much.  My mom just--but I now realize, you know, they were just s- s- scared to death--"You got to be at home at eleven o'clock.  Don't have any trouble," you know, and it paid off for us.  But that's what life was like.
Story_ID: 652989
Speaker 1: So now we're back in, in, in Detroit [Michigan] in, in grad school.  And you stayed there from--you go there in 1955.  And when is it that you finish there?
Speaker 2: Fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 1: In '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, before you, you leave there, what are your thoughts about what you'll do with this now, this postgraduate degree?
Speaker 2: Well, by this time I'm thinking I'm gonna be a, a teacher.  I'm gonna do--I mean I'm thinking I'm gonna do research and teach biology.  I'm teaching freshman there at the university while we worked on our master's [degree].  I also worked in the evening at the Ford [Ford Motor Company] plant, on, on the three to eleven [o'clock] shift at the Ford factory out in River Rouge [Ford River Rouge Complex] in, in Detroit [Dearborn, Michigan].  I got that job because during the summer actually my uncle--one of my uncles got me there.  I went to the Urban League, and they were trying to, you know, get black kids work during the summer.  And the Urban League had arranged it, and I got a job in the, in the plant that summer.  Well, the money was so good and I was enjoying it so, when school started back in the fall I wanted to stay on.  So I shifted over.  They took me out of the, what they called a crib.  Before I was just handling out stuff, and put me out on the line where the--nasty, dirt- but I was trying to stay on.  I worked there for six or seven months in, in the foundry, which is a nasty, dirty foundry there, until I got laid off; and then I just didn't go back.  I finished up my work at the University of Detroit [University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan].
Story_ID: 652990
Speaker 1: When you graduate, what happens next?
Speaker 2: I came back to Birmingham [Alabama] to teach biology at Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama], teaching under the--chairman of the department was the same man who had sent me to--helped me go to the University of Detroit [University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan], Emmett Jones.  And so they hired me and paid me $390 a month.  I was teaching.  I thought, man, I've made it; (laughter) I'm doing great.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so you come back.  It's 1957, and what is the climate in, in Birmingham?  What's going on here?
Speaker 2: Well, we're in the midst of some changes down in Birmingham.  This 1957 Birmingham is still a rigidly segregated place.  But my life is lived mainly around the college in, in, in 1957.  But they are, you know, beginning to push desegregation somewhat in the city.  But I'm sort of cloistered at the college, and, and I'm, I, I'm, I'm living just a couple of blocks off the campus, and that's, that's my life.  I spend my time teaching there for, for about three years, until I decide to go back to school and start doing research.  I became a National Science Foundation research fellow.  I went to medical school the university, state university of Iowa [Iowa College of Medicine; Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa], studying radiation biology at the medical school, and then from that at Washington University in St. Louis [St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay, let's take them one at a time, so you could--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --tell me about the experiences--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause they, they all have to be different experiences, so.  So what made you decide now I, I want to do research and to move in that direction?  Was there--
Speaker 2: Well, I decided when I was getting my master's [degree] in Detroit [Michigan] this is what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I even thought, even at that time in 1957 when I graduated that I wanted to get a--hopefully get a doctorate.  And I wanted to be a teacher and a research scientist.  So I had finally decided this is what I want; this is the kind of career I want.  So I returned to Miles College as a teacher, and, and I, I, I teach there for three years, and then I get a grant from the national--apply for and get a grant from the National Science Foundation to do further graduate study, become what was called a research fellow, to begin training.  And with that I ended up going to, as I said, to medical school, not as a medical student, as a radiation person, bu- but in the medical college, learning how to use radiation, treat patients.  Today they do chemotherapy, but during that time, my, my thing--job was how do you do radiation and you--how do you make a mannequin, and--somebody's got cancer in the stomach, gotta make a mannequin and how you determine how much radiation you're giving, all that kind of thing.  So that was very interesting to me because I worked a lot with people.  People had goiters, I'd give them radiation iodine, things of that sort.  And so I was learning all about radiation, radiation biology.  And it was all because of what had eventually happened with Russia, had put Sputnik out.  And, and we were way behind, and the federal government suddenly decided in this country that they had to train math and science teachers.  And that opened up the opportunity for me to be--get training.  And so, under the science foundation grants, I was able to go to get all of this training.  I was able to learn about radiation biology.  We were given a lot of equipment on radiation biology, learned how to teach it where I was, how to do research in it.  And so I did that and returned; and I would later go to some other schools.
Story_ID: 652991
Speaker 1: Once you got that degree working there--going to school there, you came back to--
Speaker 2: Miles.
Speaker 1: --Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you taught once again before going where?
Speaker 2: I, I--as a research fellow, I was able to then go to Washington University in St. Louis and to study molecular biology and do research in molecular biology in St. Louis [Missouri].  And I stayed there for a year and a half and applied to several schools to become a doctoral student in biology.  And I was accepted at a couple and turned down at a couple.  But I was accepted as a doctoral student at, in Illinois and Oklahoma, and I ended up going to the University of Oklahoma [Norman, Oklahoma] where I stayed for three years studying, teaching and studying and earning a doctoral degree in zoology and biochemistry.
Speaker 1: So what year--
Speaker 2: So in '66 [1966], I, I get a doctorate and I come back again (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: --to Miles College, chairman of the science department and later on dean of the college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, wait, let's, let's--we'll take it step by step here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you, you do the biology.  And what year do you get that?
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966]--
Speaker 1: We--
Speaker 2: --I get a doctorate.
Speaker 1: I know, before then--okay, we leave Detroit [Michigan], okay.  And first of all, I'm just trying to get the, the years on--correct years on the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on the record.
Speaker 2: Well, all right.  Yeah, see, I've gone to different schools.  I--'cause I, I get a doctorate.  Then I go to--I won't even talk about later.  I have a--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I go to University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] for administration.  Then I go to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for administration and--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: --come back to Miles, so--
Speaker 1: --you get from the--all right, so it's '57 [1957] is--that's when you get your master's degree in biology from University of Detroit [University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Detroit.
Speaker 1: And then three years later you go to--what did you say the--that's for the research for--
Speaker 2: State university of Iowa.  I, I--
Speaker 1: State university of I--
Speaker 2: --I taught at Iowa State University [sic.] in Iowa City, Iowa, medical school [Iowa College of Medicine; Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa].
Speaker 1: And what year did you complete that?
Speaker 2: I, I did research there.  I didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.  You just--
Speaker 2: --earn a degree.
Speaker 1: --went to do the research, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did work there.
Speaker 1: Okay, you worked there.
Speaker 2: I did research there for a year.
Speaker 1: And you--for one year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and then, then you go to--
Speaker 2: Back to Miles--
Speaker 1: --to Mich--
Speaker 2: --College to teach.
Speaker 1: Miles (laughter), all right.
Speaker 2: And then I go--after another year I go to Washington University in St. Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're in 1960.
Speaker 2: That's 1960, yeah, oh yeah, '60 [1960] or '61 [1961]--
Speaker 1: That's 1960.
Speaker 2: --I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So 1961--
Speaker 2: And I'm there for a year and a half studying molecular biology.
Speaker 1: Molecular biology, okay.
Speaker 2: And back to Miles College and teach.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: And then in '63 [1963], I'm off to a, a doctoral program at Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: In Oklahoma?
Speaker 2: Yeah, University of Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think we're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's 1963.
Speaker 1: We're in 1963, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 652992
Speaker 1: So now before you go off in 1963, you're back at Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama].  And of course, you know, Birmingham [Alabama] is going through a lot of changes as far as the civil rights.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Are you involved at all?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I'm very much--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --aware of it because I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, I've been (unclear) aware of the struggle for blacks to vote and how we study questions to try to get registered to vote.  There's a lot of activity going on right here in this area where are seated now, Fred Shuttlesworth [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth], Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in 1960s--there's a lot of upheaval here, demonstrations.  I left in '63 [1963].  I left Miles College that August.  That September they bombed the church right over there [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama], killed the four little girls.  I had just gone to Oklahoma in that August.  And that one morning I was watching the television, and that's when the young girl at the church was bombed.  But during that time there had been a whole lot of violence here in Birmingham.  There had been about forty homes, black homes and churches bombed, and nobody had been arrested for it.  All of that was during the change in Birmingham, change of city government.  Bull Connor was the police commissioner.  The story of the dogs and the water hoses and all of that was occurring.  Your questions, what were you doing?  Nothing.
Speaker 1: You were going to school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was aware of it, but I was--I never marched, I never did.  But all the people marching, protesting, all of that kind of thing, I never did any of it.  I stayed on the campus and taught.  Miles College students were very much involved down here.  Before Dr. King came here, it was all--Miles College students started all the demonstrations down here, with some of them were jailed, stopped it--started it, I--my college president at the time, at that time was Lucius Pitts, he was very active, supported his students, and--but I didn't get involved in any of it.  I had never done a march in my life.
Story_ID: 652993
Speaker 1: Do you remember when you registered to vote?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I very much (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me about that day.
Speaker 2: See, I grew up in a time when it was hard for black folk to vote here.  We all knew of--we studied--you, you had to go before the board of registrars and--not too far from here--three people sit- three whites are sitting on the board.  And they, they only let a few of us vote.  I mean, I don't care what kind of degrees you had and all of that.  If you were black, they just kept the number down.  And so I had grown up and I'd--always in the black community I simply--we had a list of questions we--the churches would try to get people to go register to vote.  We would, all right, we're gonna take folk down on the bus.  We're gonna take a bunch of them down to the registrars' office, and they'd try to get us ready and study questions the registrars would ask.  And the way we--so we eventually had a, a, a, a legal sheet with questions on both sides because what they'd do was they'd debrief you when you come back, whether you passed or not.  If they turn you down, they still ask you, "Well what questions did they ask you?"  And they'd, they'd do that with all the people.  So after a while in the black community--on a legal sized sheet on both sides of the page were all kind of questions that black people had been asked when they got down there.  Some were more trivial, important; some weren't so important.  Some were like, "Well how many courthouses are in Jefferson County [Alabama]?"  Just all kinds of questions.  So, they'd give you that and you study it.  I always saw people studying it, but I wasn't old enough to vote.  You had to be twenty-one then, and I finished college [Miles College, Fairfield, Alabama] when I was twenty, went off to Detroit [Michigan].  So I very much wanted to vote.  I very much remember.  I came home for Christmas break, and I had turned twenty-one in December.  And one of the first things I did was to go down to the Jefferson County courthouse not too far from here to register to vote.  I was nervous.  I have--about to get a master's degree [from the University of Detroit; University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan].  And I go down to the courthouse.  I've studied the questions, and I go down there.  And I get a registrar, and I get this woman, this white woman, and she just starts talking with me, you know, "Where are you--," just like you're talking to me now, you know, "Where are you?  What do you do?  Oh, you're going to school?"  "Yeah." "All right," I'm saying--I'm answering her questions, but I'm waiting--I'm answering her questions, but I'm waiting for her to start asking me some questions about government and [U.S.] Constitution.  She never did.  After she talked to me a few minutes, she said, "All right, raise your right hand," (laughter), and she swore me in, never asked me any question about voting or anything.  I, I always remember that.  I be- I became a registered voter.  But that's the--also the authority that the registrars had.  They ask you anything they wanted to ask you.  They decided whether or not you answered adequately, and they turned many of us down.  And there were a lot of people who were teachers and doctors who couldn't vote in Alabama.  They just wouldn't let black folk vote.  They kept the numbers low, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I grew up right in the midst of all that.  And I sometimes wonder, given my life and the way I eventually ended up going and my involvement in politics, how I ended up there, because I was not a--to this day, nobody who knows me considers me to be militant, you know.  I wasn't that courageous out on the front line.  I wasn't raising sand and all of that.  And it's just amazing where your life takes you.
Speaker 1: What about your parents?  Did they eventually register to vote?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mom [Mary Bell Arrington] registered early to vote.  But they became very religious about voting once I got into politics, even my dad [Richard Arrington, Sr.], who we could never get to go register, he even went and registered to vote after I, after I got into politics.  But it was late in years and later in life that my dad started voting.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, so, so now we can go on to--that's where you go to University of Oklahoma [Norman, Oklahoma], in '63 [1963] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sixty-three [1963]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I'm there 'til '66 [1966].
Story_ID: 652994
Speaker 1: So now you go to, to Oklahoma--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and this is for your doctoral program, correct?
Speaker 2: Doctoral program, yes.
Speaker 1: What did I say?  Okay, and, and that was in what?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-three [1963] I go to Oklahoma.  I got a family, but I've been teaching at Miles [Miles College, Fairfield, Alabama].  I got a family, and I load them all in the car in August.  We drive to Oklahoma, which was also a very interesting experience because (cough) Oklahoma has an interesting history too.  And part of Oklahoma we call Little, Little Dixie.  It's called Little Dixie bec- so, I, I, I end up there and it, it went, went pretty well.  At, at the university [University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma] it was like a fishbowl.  Long as you stay at the university it was great.  You got down--you went downtown Oklahoma it was totally different.  It was just like being in Birmingham [Alabama] with, you know, race and all of that kind of thing.  But I first got there--I, I got there that evening, and I had (cough) my, my family, and they had--I had applied for housing, married housing.  And they, they had said well, by mail, that they didn't have any available off--it was full (cough).  But they had a list of housing in the city, in Norman, Oklahoma, and you could get the list when you got there.  So I got there that afternoon.  We got there and I rushed up to the dean housing office, and I wanted to get their list 'cause I wanted to find somewhere with my family and, to live.  And I (laughter) noticed the woman, she hesitated in the office.  She didn't give me the list.  She says, "Wait a minute."  So she goes into the back.  She comes back.  Instead they decided they'd give me some housing in the married housing thing on the--at Oklahoma, which was just great for me.  I was so pleased.  But what I didn't know, after I'd moved in I met one of the students, and I would--another graduate student there, and he was explaining to me, "Well, they don't, they don't--they won't rent; they don't lease to blacks out in Norman.  You can't live out there."  I thought it was very strange.  As long as you stayed around that campus you were fine.  When you got outside--and I also thought it was strange later on because I, I noticed that black students, like from Africa, some of them lived out there.  So some of the family would, would lease to foreign black students but not to American black students.  That was part of Oklahoma, and I had some interesting racial experiences.  But I did well there.  And I, I got, I got to know the place.  And I be- I was a fairly decent student.  I won the award there as an outstanding student in, in, in, in zoology at--when I was at Oklahoma.  So things were pretty well.  I was really blessed, just going to school every day on a bicycle, back home, and studying and teaching.
Story_ID: 652995
Speaker 1: I want to back up a little bit because we didn't talk about when you got married--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --and who you married.  So let- let's talk about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that's one of the failures of my life.  I, I married when I was eighteen years old, heading to Detroit [Michigan], and I married a, a young lady.  Barbara [Barbara Watts] and I, we were married for twenty years and divorced after twenty years.  And I can't remember the year but divorced after two years and four, five children.  And, and then I, I, I married again, Rachel [Rachel Reynolds Gilmore] for twenty-seven years.  And so that's forty-seven years of marriage.  And, and then a divorce, and I've been divorced ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and when did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I got five, six, six, six children.
Speaker 1: Six children, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, let's go ahead and, and tell me who your children are and their names.
Speaker 2: Okay (cough).  My oldest son is Anthony [Anthony Arrington].  He was born in Detroit.  And he's still here.  He works for the airport authority [Birmingham Airport Authority] in the City of Birmingham [Alabama] and has a couple of kids, and he lives here.  He's married with a couple of kids.  I have a son, Kevin [Kevin Arrington], who lives here, who is a department head of one of the city's departments, City of Birmingham and is a minister.  And my oldest son--both of my oldest sons are ministers.  Kevin is a minister--one son is a minister in the Baptist church, where, where I go [Crumbey Bethel Primitive Baptist Church, Fairfield, Alabama], and my son, Kevin, is a (unclear), what do you call them?  We call them holy rollers--
Speaker 1: Pentecostal?
Speaker 2: Pentecostal.  I'm sorry.  I couldn't think of it.
Speaker 1: Or Church of God in Christ (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Pentecostal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's a Pentecostal--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --member and has a church and is, is, is a department head in the City of Birmingham.  I have a son who is a--lives in Atlanta [Georgia], Matthew [Matthew Arrington].  He's named after my [paternal] grandfather [Matthew Arrington].  He's an investment banker.  He does work for the, for the (unclear) and the college of Morehouse [Morehouse College], Spelman [Spelman College], City of Atlanta.  And I forget the other city.  But he's an investment banker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have a daughter [Jennifer Arrington] who over in Atlanta, in Mableton, Georgia, that little suburb, and she is a real estate--she's in charge of this bunch of apartments near Buckhead [Atlanta, Georgia] and all of that, Lincoln realty [Lincoln Property Company].  She is the manager of about thirty or forty of those.  And she has a family, four kids.  And, I have to say, I'm trying to keep up with my kids.  And had another son is passed.  He died just last year--
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: --Kenneth [Kenneth Arrington].  He was my second eldest.  He died up in Ohio [Cleveland, Ohio].  And I have a daughter, who works at the hospital here, Angela [Angela Arrington].  And that's--that's my kids.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what year did you marry Rachel?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm trying to remember, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, it's not important (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I can't recall.
Speaker 1: Okay, that, that, that's fine--
Speaker 2: It's, it's like 1970, somewhere like that; but I was married--we were married for twenty-seven years.  I do remember that.
Story_ID: 652996
Speaker 1: So now--and you said in Oklahoma that you were in the zoology--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --program.
Speaker 2: Zoology department--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --department.  So tell me about that.  I mean--and well, I just, just want to know about zoology.  Why zoology?
Speaker 2: Well, it's--you know, I had been majoring in biology.  And even when I went from undergraduate to graduate, you, you, you then have to become more specialized.  And I began--at De- Detroit [University of Detroit; University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan] I began be, be what's called an invertebrate zoologist, and I studied bodies without backbone.  I studied the amoeba, and you know, my research for my master's was the--studying the amoeba and why do it--why do the cells divide and things of that sort.  And so I started doing that as--that was a master's degree, so that's how they get you into research.  The further you go into the field, the more they expect you to know, and you specialize in certain areas.  So when I go to Oklahoma [University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma], I go in as a, a invertebrate zoologist, one who studies animals without backbones.  And you have to get you a, somebody to accept you, a professor that accepts you as his or her student and do research in that area so that you're becoming a (unclear).  And so I became a invertebrate--my specialty was invertebrate zoology, and I studied, I had studied amoeba and things of that.  And then I started studying what's called beetles, the riffle beetles.  They are small beetles, about like a pinhead and some of them big as a match head, that live in, in water, in fast flowing water.  And of course, I've studied as, you know, how do they live, how they breathe, you know, how they have hairs on their body, and how they keep the air around their bodies and all that.  We call them riffle beetles.  And so I started studying riffle beetles here and in Mexico.  I'd go down in Mexico just doing research on animals.  You know, you, you find something you're interested in, and you try to (laughter) become a specialist in, in that particular area.  In the meantime, you, you know, you're getting trained--I'm getting training in genetics and things of that sort so that, understand all of that, but you, you trying to specialize.  So in Oklahoma that's what I'm doing.  And so I went there and I was, I was admitted, and they were somewhat doubtful.  In fact, one of the professors said to me when I first got there, "You know, I hope you do well and all that, but you know, a lot of the students coming from the South," and we're out in Oklahoma there, and there (unclear), "a lot of students come from the South, they just don't do well in (unclear)."  But what he was really telling me is that a lot of black folk coming here just don't do well.  He didn't say it that way, so, but.  So I'm--so shortly after you get there, you've got to get you--you've got to be accepted by some professor to be their student, that's who you'll work with.  Every, every doctoral student has a professor, and you work under that professor.  You're trying to become what that professor is.  And so I got to decide, you know, who I'm going to go to.  And so that, that, I get there and there's a guy named Harley P. Brown, a professor who had been doing research, I'd read some of his work, turns out I didn't know at the time, he's from Mobile, Alabama, but I didn't even know that.  And--but he had a terrible reputation of being hard.  And I just, just decided at the point, I, I, I thought to myself, well, you know, if I can get to be Dr. Brown's student and do well, nobody can question it, and that's what I did.  And so I ended up being, I think I was his second student, 'cause he, he, he was supposedly so tough, but really he wasn't.  He turned out to be a great friend of mine.  He was academically tough, but he took my family under his wing.  He and his wife [Dorothy McGregor Brown] had me and my kids over to his home.  He did a lot of things for us, guy from Mobile, Alabama.  And so I, I just, I studied that and got, had a minor in biochemistry, and as I said, I was fortunate.  I, I won the award, the--I was voted by the faculty and the students in the, in the department as the, what they call--Ortenburger Award, an outstanding student.
Story_ID: 652997
Speaker 1: It wasn't that I was the smartest student there [University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma], but somehow I had learned to get along with everybody and you know, and I did well.  And I--they thought I was smart 'cause I--you know, you had to learn a language.  You have to have a foreign--well, I had learned French in--I would say I can read French.  I couldn't, couldn't speak it that well, but I know how to do that.  I had to, had to pass a French exam to get a master's degree.  So as soon as I got to Oklahoma--if you're in science, you must, you must have French or German, 'cause most of the research papers are written in French and German, a lot of them in German.  So as soon as I got there, I, I took the exam in French because I had studied French at Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama], and I could read French.  But most students, when they had difficulty getting their degree, they would finish up in science, but they couldn't pass the language then.  And in science, you're gonna either have to do it in French or you're gonna have to do it in German.  They won't let you do it in Spanish.  And so I just decided I had not studied German, but I had--since I had studied French I thought, yeah, that's sort of like--Spanish is sort of like French, so I started studying Spanish on my own.  And so I took the exam in, in Spanish.  And my plan was to apply to my committee, you have a committee of three faculty members, and ask them to accept my second language, you have to be able to read two languages, accept my second language be--Spanish.  They usually wouldn't, wouldn't turn you down as a student.  So then I happened to run into a student from Miles College who was getting here, working in math, and he mentioned (unclear) that there was a book you could study in German and had ten rules called Pollard's 'Key to German Translation' ['The Key to German Translation,' Cecil Pollard] from a guy at University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].  He says you learn these ten rules, you can translate German.  You can translate anything, and all you have to do is build your vocabulary on German words.  And German is very difficult, because the subject is here and the verb is way down yonder at the end of the sent- it's tough--so I learned the ten rules.  And by grace of God, I went over and took the German exam, and I passed it.  And I'll tell you, everybody in the department thought I was brilliant.  I had taken (laughter) the French, Spanish, and German and passed them all.  (Laughter) So they thought I was absolutely bri- by the grace of God, I had passed all of them.  And that, that, that just gave me a reputation and some respect in that department, not because of, of biology, but because I had been able to do--been able to do some languages.
Story_ID: 652998
Speaker 1: What was your paper--in the zoology, what was your paper?
Speaker 2: My doctoral thing [at the University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma] was on dryopoid beetles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's just what I called it, 'Morphology of Dryopoid Beetles' ['Comparative Morphology of Some Dryopoid Beetles,' Richard Arrington], in which I described them at different stages of development.  And, and I described them, the morphology of--the shape, how they--from fertilization on, how they grow into adults, and followed them through.  And some people have done other work on it.  I even have a species named after me (laughter), a beetle.
Speaker 1: What's it called?
Speaker 2: The species name is Arringtonia [ph.].  It's a species, a beetle, riffle beetle in, out of Mexico that we discovered down in Mexico.
Speaker 1: And, and, and how did that come about, that they would name--
Speaker 2: Well, my professor [Harley P. Brown]--
Speaker 1: --it after you?
Speaker 2: --under whom I was working, I did the work on it, he--I had gone with him.  We collected beetles down in there.  And we found that we collected some that had never been found before and had been named.  And he named a couple of species, and he named one after me since I was his student who had done the work on it.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  And, and how did your family, how did they fair while they were in Oklahoma [Norman, Oklahoma]?
Speaker 2: They did well.  My wife [Barbara Watts] just tried to raise the kids.  We had a bunch of kids, and that's what she did there in Oklahoma.  I, and I spent all of my time at the, in the department there in the zoology building.  That's the entire building.  And my job, you know--classes that I was taking in the morning, in the evening--I'm, I'm teaching freshman classes, and I'm setting up the laboratories, and that's what most of the doctoral students are doing.  You're doing your research; you're taking your classes; and you're teaching undergraduate classes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 652999
Speaker 1: All right, so you finished there in, in 1966 [at the University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma].
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And--
Speaker 2: --I really finished, yeah, in '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: --and then you come back to Miles--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --College again, okay.
Speaker 2: --I come back in Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama] as--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --chairman of the science department.  And I'm immediately asked to also take on a job as the dean of the college, academic dean.  So for a while I am chairman of the science department and the dean, academic dean.  Then I moved into academic dean.  And from '66 [1966] to 1970 I am the academic dean at Miles College, same time I am working for the office of education as the consultant for the black colleges [HBCUs] and administration in South Carolina, all of the black colleges there, which meant simply I just go in, try to work with them on administration, strengthening the administration, doing research.  And so I stay at Miles.  And then in 1970 (cough), I leave Miles to become the director of what you call the Alabama Center for Higher Education.  That is the--there were eight historically black colleges in Alabama.
Speaker 1: Eight, okay.
Speaker 2: Alabama A and M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama], Alabama State [Alabama State College; Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama], Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], Spil- Stillman College [Tuscaloosa, Alabama], Miles College, Oakwood College [Oakwood University, Huntsville, Alabama].  I probably left one out, but there were--and they set up a--the foundation set up a center where all of them could work together, do research and stuff together, and I became the director for them.  And my job was to raise money for all of that stuff they want us to do together, which put me in the business of New York [New York] and all of that to all the foundations, getting money.  I had a staff of about twenty people.  We got--raised the money for whatever the eight colleges wanted to do together.  For example, if you wanted to be a veterinarian, you could start out in any one of the colleges.  Tuskegee would automatically accept you into it in the third year, or whatever it was.  So we had cooperative programs between eight black colleges, which was being pushed by the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] as a way to strengthen black colleges, was to get them to form what they called a consortium, working together and doing some things together, sharing archives together.  We set up an archival program at every one of the black colleges to begin getting their history and that--what their people had done, things of that sort.  And so from 19--I went--in 1970, I moved to downtown Birmingham [Alabama], with an office down there and a staff of about twenty people, working as executive director of the Alabama Center for Higher Education; stayed there.
Story_ID: 653000
Speaker 1: While I was there [Alabama Center for Higher Education], around I think 1972, some Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama] students come.  They want me to run for office--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --political office.  I had never thought about running in my life, politics, never thought about it.  But I got three young men in my office right downtown.  They asked me to run for mayor [of Birmingham, Alabama].  I said--1972--said, "No, I can't do that."  "Well, if you won't run for mayor, would you run for the city council?"  Well, we had one black on the city council that time.  We all had to run at large.  And we had only had one black, Arthur Shores, who outstanding civil rights attorney, home had been bombed three times here by the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK].  He was the only black.  He was courageous, lawyer, very quiet man.  And so they--I said, "Well, I might run for the council."  I had--really didn't intend to run.  And I said to them, "I'll tell you what," just the three young, "I'll tell you what: come back tomorrow and see me; let me think about it."  I was really thinking they won't come back.  Sure enough, the next day, boom, they're right back in my office again.  So I finally said to myself, "Here are these guys are concerned about the city, young black guys.  I don't have the nerve to say no to them."  I said, "Okay, I'll run for the council."  Sure enough, I ran, and to everybody's surprise I won.  And then we had to run at large in the city.  And, and they had--we didn't have blacks.  They had one black out of nine, so I became the second black to sit on Birmingham City Council.  And the black community was fairly well excited about it, that we got--now we were getting two blacks out of nine on the council.  None of them, particularly young folk, weren't particular excited about me.  I didn't have a record in civil rights.  In fact, they had always thought Arthur Shores, who I thought was one of the most courageous there was--as I said, his home had been bombed, and he had done all, used to be the--we got a lot of black attorneys now, but it used to be just a handful of them.  And--'cause he was quiet at city council meetings, they didn't like him.  They wanted him to be militant and raise sand.  And so here I am, I get elected, and then I listened to the talk shows, and they, they weren't excited.  And they just say, "Well, the white folk got them--this time they got them a, a black with a Ph.D. degree, and he never marched; he never done this; he never done anything."  That's what they were, you know, saying.  And I was hearing all that.  But anyway, I got into politics, and I became sort of the voice for the black community.  I raised all of the affirmative action programs, all the--I, I did all of that.  And all of a sudden, the black community was politically in love with me (laughter).  Here's a guy, you know, they thought this man has never done a thing to win his spurs; he never marched; he never demonstrated; he nev- and now here I am, and all of a sudden, oh, well I (gesture)--
Story_ID: 653001
Speaker 1: But you--but by you running and some of the things that you just mentioned that you were able to get accomplished--
Speaker 2: I did everything.  I led--
Speaker 1: What, what was the--
Speaker 2: I had--I'd--
Speaker 1: --very first thing--what was in your mind when you realized that you had won?  What was your first agenda?  What did you want to do first?
Speaker 2: When I got on the city council, Birmingham [Alabama] was at a point of beginning to make change.  They made--the elected two liberal whites.  Birmingham City Council had been very conservative, Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] very powerful--was very powerful here.  When I was elected to the council, the local newspapers headlined it that, that three of us were elected, two white liberals and, and a black, the three of us.  And that was sort of a turning point.  That was really news here.  And once I got on there, I began--my strength as an administrator is--I'm good at administering things.  I'm not good at speechmaking.  I don't--ain't none of that kind stuff, 'cause I'm just not good at that.  But I started looking at hiring.  I started doing studies on how many blacks were recommended and passed the test for city jobs and how many they hire.  I took on police brutality, which was a terrible thing here.  Police were terrible on blacks here in Birmingham.  I became the voice of the black community.  I fought police brutality on the council.  And the, the minute I said that, the black community just fell in love with me.  And I used my position on the city council to focus attention on the treatment of blacks, how the police department [Birmingham Police Department] was treating, how the city did not hire blacks, not just to talk about it, but I'd do the studies; I'd get all the facts and come in and bring it in, bring some blacks in who'd been beaten.  I did the--and as I said, the black community, they just (laughter) fell in love with me, and I became their voice in this city.  And so for--I served my four year term, and some people say, "Well, you can't be ele- reelected 'cause, you know, you have been a voice against the police.  The police union's against you," and all that.  Lo and behold, I get reelected and by more votes.  And that's all the story.  And then later on, you know, when the black community, led by the black ministers, decided there got to be a black mayor, they--
Speaker 1: It was your turn.
Speaker 2: --they said to me, "You got to run.  We've been backing you.  You've got to run," and that the way--how I got there.
Speaker 1: So the first time you, you run is in, in '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: Seventy-one [1971] or '72 [1972], yeah, seventy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, and then reelected--
Speaker 2: --seventy--
Speaker 1: --in, in '75 [1975].
Speaker 2: It was a four year term and yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 653002
Speaker 1: There's some progress, because you just talked about the police brutality and trying to make a difference there.  But in 1975--you want to talk to me about Bonita Carter, because that was something that, that happened during that time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what triggered my running for full time as a, as the mayor (cough).  I had--during my time on the council [Birmingham City Council], I had, as I said, focused on certain issues of racial discrimination in this city, which was very rampant (cough) not only calling attention to it but introducing bills to bring about affirmative action, doing investigations actually, not just talking about mistreatment of people but getting the details, researching the background on police officers, 'cause there were certain ones who had--after you get in the business, you see right away you're gonna find out--you know, like we had seven hundred officers, and you--we had ten or fifteen of them was all--every time there was a problem they were always involved in it.  All you have to do was go and dig in and look at them, and you'd find out they'd beaten somebody up before.  The city has paid out money 'cause they did this.  Nobody took them on.  And I did; I took them on; I took on the police union.  And I was able to do it because the black vote was--you know, after the Selma [Alabama] thing and the black vote was growing, and so I was able to do it and had that strong support.  We didn't have a majority of, of black--the majority of the votes wasn't black, but we--blacks had about 40 percent of the votes, and they voted solidly.  And, and so for eight years on the city council I introduced every affirmative action law.  I fought for contracts.  I did all of that.  I was the voice, which I guess surprised a lot of people 'cause, as I said, you know, I hadn't been--I wasn't militant.  I never knocked on the desk and raised the sand.  No, I didn't do that kind of thing.  So, because I had fought against police brutality and police reform on the council, when one of the worst police officers we had, George Sands, ends up killing a young black woman through a, almost a terrible mistake case--he shoots her in the back several times in a car--and of course, they're rioting and all of that, and my good friend was mayor then, David Vann, and who I thought was the smartest guy I ever met in politics, and the black community insisted he had to fire the police officer, who had, had a terrible record, and now he's killed this girl.  And Vann didn't want to do him.  He's getting pressure for the police union and in the white community.  And what he ends up doing is he's gonna--he just puts the police officer on desk duty, wouldn't fire him.  So the black preachers here in the city got very angry with him and start protesting.  And they called me to a meeting and decided that it was time to run a black.  And they, they, they just told me, "You've got to run," you know, and about fifty of them.  I met with them, and they say, "We're gonna have a press conference this week, and oh, we want you to announce you're gonna run.  We've been supporting," and that's the story.  I announced and a lot of folk were surprised, newspaper and all.  And they didn't, really didn't think I was gonna win.  The newspaper, Birmingham News [The Birmingham News] carried editorials and said, you know, "One day surely Birmingham [Alabama] shall have one of his black sons or daughters as mayor of this city, but we're at least ten years away from that."  And two weeks later I was the mayor (laughter).  That's, that's an interesting story, but it's a true story.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well--
Speaker 2: And so I was elected.  I--we had a--we ran an election and with six or seven people running for mayor, and I got 47 percent of the vote.  And it was pretty clear that in a runoff I was likely to win.  I mean, the white business community got very busy, hired consultants.  They turned out the white vote, bussed the kids in who were off at the different colleges back in here to vote and all that.  They turned out 67 percent in the runoff; 67 percent of white vote turned out.  But 70 percent--72 percent of the black votes turned out.  I won by two thousand votes, largely because of the whites around the University of Alabama [University of Alabama at Birmingham] area worked, worked at the University of Alabama here in Birmingham, they vote- they, they crossed racial lines and voted.  And so I--that's how I ended up winning, yeah--
Speaker 1: The, the popular vote--
Speaker 2: --for that.
Speaker 1: --because--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it, it wasn't like you were unknown.  People knew who you were.
Speaker 2: Oh, by that time, yeah, I, I--they knew who I was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They knew who you were.
Speaker 2: I mean, the black community was, of course, solidly behind me.  And some, some--a few whites were, mainly, as I said, those around the university had been attracted--lived in that area, they would cross racial lines in their votes, and they had gotten to know me.  And the difference in the race votes, it went almost along--the first mayoral race I was in--along racial lines.  The white candidates that was in the runoff got most of the white votes, and the black--I mean we got the blacks.  The turnouts were very, very high.  But the fact that I was able to pull around two thousand some of the white votes, helped me to get a--to defeat them.
Story_ID: 653003
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the little money I got I raised at black churches--
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: --that's another story, how the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] finally came in, tried to undercut us, but all that, stop them from raising money (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wait, okay, yeah, let's, let's start with, with the--back, go back to, to the campaign.  You say--'cause I--my, my question is, did the whites support you as well, because there were some whites that, that voted, of course, but did they support you, or who supported you as far as campaign funds?
Speaker 1: Okay, well, when I ran for--well, even if I, if I go back, even when I ran for council [Birmingham City Council], you know, it didn't take a lot of money.  You had to run in the city as at large.  Unlike today, we didn't have districts.  Everybody, if you were running, you ran--had to run at large.  But you could by with a small amount of, of money.  When I ran and was elected to the council for the first time, I got one contribution of five hundred dollars, and it came a white businessman, Emil Hess, who headed the--owned Parisian's department store [Parisian], Jewish fellow, and he was, by Birmingham [Alabama] standards, very liberal.  And the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] didn't like--and, and David Vann, who was running for council the same time I was, and we were elected to the council together, and was Emil Hess' lawyer.  And Emil Hess had sent five hundred dollars.  I didn't even know Emil sent it, gave it Vann, told him to give it to me.  That was extent of se- support I had.  By the time I--eight years later I'm running for mayor.  And you know, Vann is mayor, and I'm running against him and several other people, and they're raising pretty good money.  And I raised--I don't know--I might--thirty, forty--I don't--very little money, but I raised it mainly at the black churches.  By that time I'd been on the council eight years, and the black vote's very much behind me.  And so the black ministers at their churches begin take- having me come to their churches and taking up a little collection.  In fact, I kept a complete record of that.  I had one guy to do a story, a whole history on it, the financing, how the campaign was financed, and it was just black churches.  And that would lead eventually to the whites complaining to the IRS that the churches were raising money in the campaign and IRS having--holding sessions here with church leaders, telling them that you can't raise money, you know.  Of course, the churches still did it.  They would end the church and take up--everybody did it different ways.  But I ran the first time I had--altogether I think got about forty thousand dollars, weren't, weren't any money.  But what, what was really behind me was a fired up black community.  I had so many volunteers.  And for once in my lifetime and for ten, twelve years of my time in politics, the black community was solidified.  I mean, they were just behind me, they just (gesture) out voting.  And this other thing was that I was--my strength has always been in administration and organizing things.  I mean, I just like to do the nuts and bolts of how do you get things done, how you having--and so I used that ability as mayor to, to get a lot--to first of all form a strong political organization.  And black people here were so excited and pleased about it that we just--I could almost tell you almost to the point of which black boxes were--how they were gonna vote, 'cause they were terribly excited.  They lost that after a while, you know, but, but I was mayor for twenty years.  And I will tell you, for about ten or fifteen of the, of those years, I was the most powerful political figure around here.  Black folk got accustomed and got tired of me after a while.  The last five years they didn't vote like that.  But that's the way it started, you know, it, it, it started out.
Story_ID: 653004
Speaker 1: I think it's--you know, when I ran the second time for mayor I got--started getting support from the white community.  And the third and fourth time I had no problem, you know, could easily raise about a million dollars, and most of it would come out of the business community people.  And, and they--once the white business community go to know me, I was sort of the devil they knew.  And they didn't--they'd rather deal with the devil they know than one they didn't know, and so they would come and support me.  In fact, one of the things that happened here in Birmingham [Alabama] is that when I ran for them the second term as mayor, the top black businessmen and white businessmen in this community came out publicly for me and ran an ad and all, that was unheard of.  But they had, they had been scared of me, you know, what kind of mayor I was going to be and what the issues I was raising and all that.  But after four years, I think they had sort of decided, "Well, we at least know who he is, and we can at least talk with him," and so they became supportive.  But it, it all worked out well because, you know, when I became mayor, even in Birmingham, you had one--out of twenty some departments, you had one black.  It was a lawyer.  During the time I was the mayor, I appointed about sixteen department heads, fourteen blacks.  I, I promoted women.  Women--the highest ranking women they had when I was--in this city, black or white, when I became mayor, was two white sergeants, police sergeant women.  All the other women were secretaries.  I, I changed all of that.  When I left city hall--when I came to city hall, 12 percent of the employees in the city were black, and most of them were working for streets and sanitation, cleaning the roads, picking up the garbage, cleaning city hall [Birmingham City Hall, Birmingham, Alabama].  That's what most of them were doing.  When I left city hall, 50 percent of the folk working at city hall were black.  I had twelve or fourteen black department heads.  Sixty percent of the blacks had administrative responsibilities over--that doesn't sound big, but for Birmingham that was way out.  Birmingham was a place where--first of all, we had, had to fight like crazy to hire blacks, to get through the personnel system here.  And then to put blacks in charge of administering and overseeing whites, that was terrible in Birmingham.  And that all happened under my administration, not because of me, but because of times changing and because of a solidified black community and because of all the struggles that had gone on here, folk like Shuttlesworth [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth] and all them laying the groundwork for it.  And so much of the change took place while I was in office and while I was the mayor.  And the major contribution I had to it was, you know, just administrative ability.  How do you get things done, and helping our communities to understand, you know?  What do you do about a city?  How do you run a city, you know?  What's important?  You gotta look back--yeah, we got civil rights.  We got to look for jobs.  Where are the jobs gonna be?  What's the task?  So during my time as mayor, we got a record number of jobs; we got crime down, lower than the city has ever had it.  I was just, you know, I was lucky, but I had strong support.  And even the business community began doing that.  And it wasn't 'cause I was so brilliant, but you know, it's just how times and things happened over a period of time.  And so we changed--we, we had the most diversified labor force of any government, including the state, in, in Alabama.  When it comes to race and sex and so forth, we had the most diverse--and it all happened under my administration.  And so a lot of things people talk about the (unclear) institute, is one of the things that we did, but I mean, it's, a park, that's something we did.  I mean, most of the stuff you read out there, really stuff I wrote tell you the truth.  But you know, I--wasn't a big deal, because I, I learned if, you know, if you don't care about who gets the credit, you can get a lot of things done.  And I always look around at other folk whose shoulders I was on, and people like Odessa Woolfolk when we got ready to build this thing [Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, Birmingham, Alabama], get her in front, she'd get folk to do a lot of the work for you.  Plus I put together one of the best, you know, staffs, administrative staffs.  I lost one of my administrators who went to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  He left and went there.  I had an MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] gra- I had--just some, you know, got some young folk in, and when you turn them a loose and let them do stuff, they make things happen; and they did.
Story_ID: 653005
Speaker 1: So in the, the terms that you had, each term you did a little more and a little more and a little more.  And a lot of, of, of what happened downtown, the change in the structure down in the, in the downtown area, I mean, it looks like a real metropolis city now.  So, talk about some of the improvements that were, were done during your administration as far as the city itself.
Speaker 2: Well, we had to immediately stop, when I became mayor, to stop white flight as best we could.  It couldn't stop a lot of individuals from moving.  And many of them start going to the suburbs.  I focused my atttention on trying to keep the jobs in the city.  And that gets to be very important, because the only money the city or any government has is tax money.  And if you--and, and you have to--the first thing one must understand, that the tax structure.  If you, if you mayor of a city, you'd better know your tax structure.  You don't know where do this money come from, which taxes are important, how do I keep them here?  How do I keep the jobs here?  That's where you really--I mean, all the time I'm fighting for minority participation.  I'm fighting to get contracts to minorities all--but I'm also saying, you know, how do I keep the jobs here?  For example, the federal courthouse down there, there are two of them, but the one down there, a big fight because we could build a new federal courthouse, and they wanted to build it down--too close to the black business district, black--I had to fight that battle.  I went to Washington [D.C.].  I had a good relationship with the senator, Heflin [Howell Heflin] from here.  Plus I--when I was elected, Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] was president.  In fact, the night I was elected the headline the next day was his call; he called me on the phone that night.  I'd just--had just (unclear), we were about to go out and celebrate and phone rings, says it's president of the United States on the line.  And so the next day the headline in the papers is what Jimmy Carter called me and what he said to me that day.  But Jimmy Carter had also pushed policies to try to keep federal offices in the inner city and stop them--and I knew that.  A lot of mayors didn't pay much attention to that.  So once I knew that, when IRS [Internal Revenue Service] got ready to move out, I stopped them by, by going to Washington and complaining.  I stopped them from moving.  They moved and built new places, but they had to stay in the city to do it.  When social security payment center for the Southeast, they weren't gonna--I mean, that's the kind of thing I had to do.  I put my staff on it, "All right, you look through here.  You find out which agencies are trying to move, when they're asking for something."  If they're federal agencies, they are supposed to stay in the city.  They want to get out.  We'd make them stay.  I mean, it's that kind of thing.  So I kept, you know, IRS when they wanted go out of here.  The Federal Reserve, I got--kept them here.  They built new facilities.  They moved out, but they couldn't move outside the city line--limits.  I, I kept a lot of jobs here because of that.  And that, that's paying off for our cities, even paying off, off today, because you really have to look at how you create jobs.  When I came into office as the mayor, Birmingham [Alabama] was--the whole country was still--Carter was president, the unemployment was, nationwide, was above 10 percent.  It was bad.  In Birmingham it was higher then.  We had just lost all our steel jobs.  This used to be a steel town.  We used to have thirty some thousand steel jobs here in this city.  When I got--came into office there was three thousand jobs, steel jobs, left in the city, just three thousand.  And believe me or not, I hadn't been in office three months and we lost every one of those.  U.S. Steel [United States Steel Corporation Fairfield Works, Fairfield, Alabama] shut down.  Today have rebuilt, and they have about four thousand people working here.  But this here sto- steel made this city.  I come into office, the--we in terrible shape.  We got folk like my dad [Richard Arrington, Sr.] who had been working in the steel mills, they could make seventeen, eighteen, twenty dollars an hour as laborers, and now the steel mills shut down, and they don't have any skills.  They are losing homes, jobs, all of that.  So we had to redo that in working with the university [University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama] and medical center [University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, Birmingham, Alabama] and all that in here.  We just changed the economy.  We are not as strong today economically as it was when I was the mayor, quite frankly, 'cause we had ten of the Fortune 500 companies here when I was mayor.  And I--you know, I, I worked at it.  I stayed with them, "Stay in the city."  They've lost them.  Now they've got maybe two or three Fortune 500 companies.  But I was fortunate.  Really, my eight years on the council [Birmingham City Council] and my training, especially in science, the two together people may not know, but really helped me a whole lot.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It helped me to understand how government works, the nuts and bolts of how something works, and how do you keep it going.
Story_ID: 653006
Speaker 1: So you figured out how, how you fit into the scheme of things before and after.  You know, before you came into office [as mayor of Birmingham, Alabama] you looked at what was going on, because, like, like you said, it--the city was in a bad, bad shape.  And at the time that you were elected, there were, by 1995--from, from 19--you, you came into office in '79 [1979].  Until 1995, there were probably four hundred black mayors all over the United States from that, that era.  And a lot of the cities have not re- recovered--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --from that.  But this city is still, still doing a lot better than most of those who did not recover.  I mean, what's your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --thoughts about that.
Speaker 2: --one, one of the things that, you know, still concerns me is what happens to cities when they get the black government.  I mean, it's just a question you have to look at.  You know, in some cities--I mean, you live in Atlanta [Georgia].  Atlanta's done pretty well with what they've been able to do.  It's still a growing city.  It's doing very well.  But you look at a lot of cities and when we get black governments, the cities go down.  I mean, we don't like to say, but it's true.  I mean, I've looked at Gary [Indiana].  I've studied Detroit [Michigan].  I've, you know, I just see them--the cities right here, Fairfield [Alabama], they get a black mayor, black--folk, the jobs go; the city go; the crime goes up, and, and it starts raising the question, you know, can black folk really run cities?  I mean, you're gonna have hard times, but can, can you black folks really run cities?  Can you keep them going?  And people don't like to, you know, deal with that.  But I've always thought about that from the very beginning.  You know, how do you, how--you gonna--if you're gonna be the--I was elected mayor during what I call the era of black mayors.  Cleveland [Ohio] elected their first black mayor [Carl Stokes].  Gary came on with [HistoryMaker] Richard Hatcher.
Speaker 1: Hatcher.
Speaker 2: Right behind that we got--Atlanta got Maynard [Maynard Jackson].  Detroit got Coleman Young.  Los Angeles [California] got the only black mayor they had, Tom Bradley (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Bradley.
Speaker 2: New Orleans [Louisiana] got Dutch Morial [Ernest Morial].
Speaker 1: Morial.
Speaker 2: And the year I was elected, in '79 [1979].  During that eight and nine year period, first time medium sized cities in America and large cities in America got black mayors.
Speaker 1: Black mayors, um-hm.
Speaker 2: And that started a change.  Now we got a lot of black mayors today.  But luckily, I, I had--I worked with some folk, and I--immediately when I got in politics I started to trying to learn.  That's why I got to be a good friend of David Vann, 'cause I thought he was smart, and he knew how to do stuff.  And I wanted to say, "How you do it?"  We got to be friends.  You know, I ended up running against him.  In fact, the night I was elected he and I both cried 'cause I beat him (laughter), but you know, I mean, it was, it's just that kind of thing, learning how to do things and--but you do have to have enough courage to stand up, because people, they're gonna fight you every step of the way.  So we still have our problems, our school system.  You know, when I was elected there was fifty some kids, fifty some thousand kids in the school system.  Today there are twenty, so, and they all--it's 99 percent black.  Most of the whites have left the school system.  We've had I don't know, X number of superintendents.  We just got a new one this week.  We got a black, predominant, you know--two thirds of the school board is black.  And they fired the superintendent.  I mean, I don't know what's going on there.  I mean, we have our problems now.  We--you know, but economically this city is doing pretty good and even under a new administration.  I'm out of it.  I've been out of it, but you know, they are, they're doing things.  I don't like sometimes, but I keep my mouth shut, you know, the way they do things.  The young people have different ideas about how they ought to do things, how they run them.  And I don't have the influence I once had, so I keep my mouth shut about some of the things.  But, you know, that's, that's part of the elephant in the room when we want to talk about race in this country.  Part of the elephant in the room, folk don't like to talk about race.  Part of the elephant in the room, black folk don't like to talk about what's wrong in the black community.  So you know, it goes (laughter) both ways.
Story_ID: 653007
Speaker 1: So when you leave--well, no, is there anything else that you want to tell us about during your tenure as mayor, because you had five terms.  And like I said, we, we were talking about the progression of, of the things that you improved each time.  You know, each four years something else was improved--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I was mayor, like you said, for twenty years.  That's a long time.
Speaker 1: It is.
Speaker 2: So I got elected five times as, as, as mayor.  And, and during the first three, three and half, four years, I had just solid political support.  I mean, I had a black community that was just solidly behind me on everything.  But as time goes by, you know, you lose some of your support.  I left office 'cause I thought it was time to leave.  I didn't wait for them to defeat me.  I just resigned.  I had tried to push through a, a big program.  I had had a tough fight early--years earlier trying to do the, this institute [Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, Birmingham, Alabama] and things like that.  And--but I had had a lot of other successes.  We had gotten a lot of jobs in here and things that we had.  So then I, I, I ran a big, a big project that was gonna try to bring about some consolidation in governments and all that.  But anyway, we lost.  I didn't even get strong support from the black community I mean.  The support was pretty good, but the turnout was lousy and you know.  And so I, I had gotten the business community behind me.  They put a lot of money in and pushing big projects, and we lost.  It was a program called MAPS program, Metropolitan Arts Projects Program [sic. Metropolitan Area Projects Strategy].  But it was terrific program.  It'd have built a new dome stadium.  Oh, it'd have done a lot of things, and we lost.  I was very disappointed, and people had really worked hard.  So I just knew it was time for me to, to leave.  So I, I made--my last push was to try to--the school system [Birmingham City Schools] was having trouble with money, so I wanted to sell our water system to fund the school system for life.  And I was spending heavily on the black vote 'cause I thought they would back that because the school system by this time was 90 percent black.  And I thought it had to do with black kids, and I was very, very wrong.  Black community chose--they'd rather have their water system rather than put the money for the black kids.  And so I, I had lost that support, and I thought it was time to go.  So I just, after a couple of weeks later, I just announced that I was leaving office, and I did.  And I just left.  I, I--the people had done well, and they had carried me while I was there.  And I just thought, well, it's time for me to go.  It's--nobody else been here as long as (laughter) I've been, and it's time to go and let somebody else take it.  And I think that was the right decision.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so who did you--who was the interim man?
Speaker 2: Well, the guy who is mayor now [William Bell, Sr.] was the guy I sort of handpicked, which turned out to be a political problem.  He was the president of the Birmingham City Council, and, and under our law, when the mayor is out of office for any reason, if a mayor dies or leaves early, the president of the council becomes the mayor.  And so I, I said I was gonna, going to resign, and I worked it out with him where he would become mayor, and he could remain mayor until the next mayoral election.  I timed it that way.  And lo and behold, everybody thought he would be elected, and he lost.  Somebody beat him by about a couple of hundred votes, was a shocker.  He would later come back later on and, and get elected.  But anyway, I left in '99 [1999], and that was sort of it.  But up until that time, I also had a strong political organization.  And that was my other strength, is that I organized here in this county [Jefferson County, Alabama], and to some extent, statewide.  Just, how do you get folk to vote?  How do you turn your vote out, how do you organize the communities?  How do you get your block captains and everything very--you know.  Who do you get on boards?  How do you--you just have to look at all of that.  So, so many times when people get elected to office, a lot of the young guys or young blacks, they are very--most of them are well educated, better than we were.  They're just glad to be there.  And they don't have any goals, say, "This is what we're gonna do; this is what we got to accomplish here."  They just, they glad to be there themselves and don't get anything done, and that just bothers me, you know.  And I, I think in time we'll change.  But we still got a lot, a lot of work.  I want--people in public service need to think about how you serve folk.  We had a council in--this council here the last time--this is an election year this year, but it's gonna be interesting to see how people work.  We had, in the council they've had fights, literally fights.  They've had--council wants to kick its salary up so it'll be a part time thing.  They, they wanted to pay themselves more than we pay educators, more than we pay police, more than we pay--that's crazy kind of stuff.  I mean, you know, we--sixty some years we've done well.  And instead of looking at how do we keep these jobs here, I think they just--a lot of them lose sight of why they're there, and they start thinking, it's about me, and you're not doing--delivering anything.  And somebody's gonna wake the people up I think, maybe this time.  I don't know.

Speaker 1: One thing I did want, want to talk about, because we have done some other interviews this weekend, and, and you know, it was spoken about.  And that's when you left office, and, and the city council [Birmingham City Council]--well, you know, wait.  Let me, let me go back, because I had asked you a question off camera about how--before you got elected mayor, because of course you've changed a lot of that, but before that time, that the whites wanted to keep kind of status quo, the way things were going.  And anyone who was going to be--that was black that was going to be elected, they wanted to handpick those people so that they can still kind of control things.  I think that, that changed with you, because they didn't control what it was that you wanted to do.  But like you said, they knew who you were, or they got to know you after a while and then began to trust you.  But as far as when we were talking to [HistoryMaker] U.W. Clemon about that situation, did you want to speak to how you think that whole thing played out?  And was--in your opinion, was it the reason why he was passed over was because of a compromise?
Speaker 2: Who was passed over, he was?
Speaker 1: U.W. Clemon, like, when he was going for city council.
Speaker 2: Oh.  Yeah, well, U.W. was, of course, a civil rights attorney, very, very able young fellow.  He's been somewhat of a, an activist and so forth.  So, early on, when, when I was e- elected, fir- particularly when I was elected mayor, I just think it was really a shock to people, because even though the black vote was growing some, nobody really thought--I, I think they, even the professionals, thought that Birmingham [Alabama] was ready to elect a mayor, because it still was a majority of white voters, but it was changing fast.  About 40 some percent of the voters were black when I was elected.  The, the key thing was that white crossovers, that had never happened in Birmingham in a race.  And they didn't think that whites would cross over and vote for a black.  And so I think that really shocked even the business community once it happened.  They were a bit concerned when I was--got to be mayor.  They didn't know quite what to expect.  As I said, I wasn't--I didn't have--I wasn't a radical, but they still didn't, you know, know, know quite what to expect.  I remember A.G. Gaston calling me to his office.  And he would tell me things like, "Richard [HistoryMaker Richard Arrington], you need to smile sometimes.  Why don't you ever smile?  These white folk think you mad because you don't ever smile," I mean, things, things like that.  And I had him.  I mean, he, he was trying to work for me.  He had--he was the influential black businessman in this city.  He worked with the newspapers and all of that.  And when they wanted to do someone black, they'd go to A.G. Gaston and all of that.  He didn't support me even when I ran for mayor.  He opposed me.  He supported Vann [David Vann], and I'll never forget.  I, I tell that story.  And you know, when I, I was elected he called me early the next morning, woke me up, wanted me to come out to his house that morning (laughter).  And I went out there, and A.G. said, "Oh, Richard, you know, I just never thought the white folks let (unclear), boy, I can help you," I mean.  And we got to be great friends.  But I'm saying that's how times change.  U.W. had been a civil rights attorney, and so I, I people sort of feared him.  But when he got up to be federal judge, by that time I was pretty influential as mayor with the black vote here and President Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.].  I was serving on a committee with President Carter.  And I really had to push to make U.W. a federal judge, 'cause U.W. and another black were up, and the other black did- didn't get it.  But you know, I, I had to--I dealt with the Carter White House a lot and all of that, and that's how U.W. got in and became the first black federal judge since Reconstruction in Alabama, a very able guy 'til he retired a short time ago.  But early on, you know, he had been sort of--he had been an activist, and even as a student.  You know, he--Bull Connor had told him to get out of town (laughter), out of town when he came before the, the county commission--I mean the city commission.

Speaker 1: You were talking about U.W. [HistoryMaker U.W. Clemon].
Speaker 2: Well, I, I just--you know, it's, it's been important for us to get people like U.W. in, in positions.  One of the problems we had to deal with early on (cough), when the strong black vote here put me in office, was how to get blacks in different positions, even on city boards.  When I was elected mayor, you know, there weren't many blacks on the board, whether it was Park and Recreation Board [Birmingham Park and Recreation Board], the Airport Authority [Birmingham Airport Authority].  And, and a part of my job was to make sure that we started getting fair black representation on all those boards.  One of the first problems I faced, and I guess it was, who's been out doing the work?  And a lot of them--the people who had run the old civic--black civic leagues and so, they had done all the work.  A lot of young blacks who had got educated, young lawyers and so forth, they hadn't paid any civic dues.  You know, their folk--parents had helped them get educated and all that, but they don't go to the civic league meeting.  They--so when I look around to the civic league folk who are supporting me and they say who ought to be on this board, a lot of these old guys my age and older, they wanted to be on there, 'cause they had been paying the dues.  Some of them couldn't read all and understand all that instruction from--on the housing authority [Housing Authority of Birmingham District], but they wanted to be on the housing authority.  They wanted to be on this.  The, the--they felt they had paid dues, and they were right to an extent.  And so we didn't always tap all of the young talent we had, because a lot of young blacks hadn't been politically active or civic league active.  The older blacks had been, and they had brought us to this point, and they wanted to have some of the benefits.  And that's a part of what we had to do in trying to set up boards.  We have slowly transitioned here in this city to--most of your people sitting on boards, you know, are people of--fairly educated.  They're younger blacks, the, the millennials today.  I don't always agree with how they do things and so forth, like they don't agree with the way we were doing, but that's just, that's just transition we're going through in this city.  And we just have to recognize how the transition occurs and, and how people work.  And all--I st- the--my--the only--one of benefits what I did were early on as I, I brought young blacks into politics here.  I came in, and once I was on the--elected on the city council [Birmingham City Council], that automatically made me a member of the inner circle for the black political organization here.  I had not been, but once I'm elected--I'm just the second black, so they automatically pull me into the tent; then I'm part of that.  They don't push to bring in young blacks, and I immediately start fighting that.  And as a result of that, I ended up breaking away from the major political organization and forming my own political organization and bringing in a young--a lot of young black folk and building our organization based on that, the strongest organization of mine.  But that was a good thing to do.  It was--was--wasn't without some problems, but we slowly begin to bring young black talent into positions.  And I think we're doing fairly well today.  I don't know how we're gonna do with elections when it comes to electing folk.  We'll see.  We'll, we'll just have to see what--how we can make black voters aware and how you hold accountability.  And let me close it out this way.  It's just accountability.  How do you hold folk accountable who you work for and put them in office?  How do you make them accountable to you that they try to get some things done?  Too many of them get into office and they have no goals except to get there.  They have no goals about how they're gonna make anything better, I mean, and all politicians, not just black poli- politicians are just that way.  You have to keep pressure on those of us who are in office so you're gonna get something done.  You've got to hold us accountable.  If you don't do it, you know, we don't really produce like we ought to in there.  We need to do more of that.  And that's one of the big problems I think with black political control of cities and so forth.  Sometimes we don't elect the best folk.  Sometimes people think, oh, that's my neighbor.  I know him.  Oh, you're gonna run, okay.  I'm support- ." I got neighbors and friends I love, but some of them I'd never vote for 'cause I don't think they could--they'd do the work.  You got to hold folk accountable.  And we're going through a transition.  It's get- getting better.  We're getting better at what we're doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think in a couple of generations it'll even be better.  We still have a lot of race issues, particularly in places like Birmingham [Alabama].  There's whole lot of race issues in this town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But times are changing.
Story_ID: 653010
Speaker 1: So what's next for you?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  For me, I'm eighty some years old, so (laughter) ain't much for me.  I teach now.  I--when I left office I went to the University of Alabama [University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama], contracted with them to teach for--contract for six or seven years.  So I went there, taught there, and I still occasionally--certain semesters I still teach in that master's program in administration for people getting a--and I teach at Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama].  It teach the honors class there in government and in African American history.  And that's what I like to do; teaching is what I love to do.  And you know, that's just it.  I'm just biding time to get my reward (laughter).  That's all I'm doing now, and I'm, I'm satisfied.  I, I look back, as all folk will do I think.  You look back over your life, and even during the time I was mayor, I--there were--I look back, and I thought, you know, I could have done so much better here and there.  But that just happens with you.  You know, you don't know at the time.  I think I did a lot of good things.  I mean, you--I, I would--if I were running I'd brag about it, but I'm not running for anything, so I don't.  But I did a lot of good things in this city.  I don't think any other mayor--'cause not many mayors served twenty years, but I don't think any other mayor be--sit down and say economically, what happened in this city?  Well, this changed, that--the things that people boast about here, oh, we just got to be something that they just made up, something the federal government just made this a some sort of--something for this institute [Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, Birmingham, Alabama] and all--all these things.  These are all those things that (unclear) when I was there.  I mean, I don't mention it.  I just let them go.  I--that's, that's fine.  I, I, I, I don't care.  You, you just--you know, we just got to keep doing things and making things happen in this city and (gesture).
Speaker 1: What do you--well, I'll tell you, from the folks that were involved with civil rights, they all attribute a lot of what has made Birmingham [Alabama] great to you.  So it's not--you may say that, you know, all of these things are, are being done, but they know that it's because of you that it's happening.
Speaker 2: Well, I think some of the older folk really do.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do.
Speaker 2: I think the young folk don't know.  I teach African American history out of the college, and I know young black folk have no idea of their history.
Speaker 1: Right.  Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean, I--
Speaker 1: --that's true.
Speaker 2: --I try to hammer it all the time, but I know a lot of them just don't.  I even teach kids--young folk out there.  Sometimes they've been in my class a half semester before they recognize--, "Oh, were you the same Arrington [HistoryMaker Richard Arrington] who was mayor?"  You know, it's just things like, or they--sometimes somebody'll walk in my class, "There's a street downtown named Arrin- . Is that you?"  I mean, you know, it's just they don't, don't know history (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Put it together.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they don't, they, they, they don't--but the older black folk, you know, yeah, they, they remember because they sort of told it me.  They know whatever I did was because they were there backing me, so, so they sort of remember.

Speaker 1: W- what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't--just that I, I hopefully overall I made a, made a positive difference, some contribution.  Birmingham [Alabama] is a city that's always been--folk have always said it's got great promise and it just always lag behind; it always has.  We started out trying to compete with Atlanta [Georgia], and Atlanta just left us in the dust.  When I first got on the city council [Birmingham City Council], I had folk from Charlotte [North Carolina] and so forth.  We had them coming down here from the chamber trying to look at us.  Charlotte just left us in the dust.  All those cities--they just ran away from us.  And, and Birmingham is now sort of--Birmingham and Memphis [Tennessee], you know, we're still trying, trying to make it.  And I'd like to, you know, just think we made, we made--it's a positive difference.  A lot of things we didn't do.  I rec- you don't recognize it until you get older.  But we tried and we ma-

Speaker 1: If you had to send a message to the future generations, because this inspirational story of your life will be in the digital archive and is--of course, the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] for generations to see, so if you had to send a message to the future generations, what would it be?
Speaker 2: To remember where we have come from and to focus on where we still have to go.  We're half home--we're halfway home, but we still got a long way to go.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Is there anything that we have not spoken about, mayor, that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: No.  We've talked about everything I know (laughter).  That's good.  No, thank you.  I, I've enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you so much--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for sharing your story.
Speaker 2: All right, very good (simultaneous).
