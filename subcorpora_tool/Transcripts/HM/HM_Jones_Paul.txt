Speaker 1: My name is Jodi Merriday, and I'm the interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  The videographer today is Scott Stearns.  Presently observing today would be Mr. Larry Crowe.  Can you state your name and its spelling at birth?
Speaker 2: Paul Jones.  At birth they called me Paul R. Jones or Paul Raymond.  And I was born a few years ago.  My number is one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: June.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I was born in the year 1928.
Speaker 1: Can you spell your name?
Speaker 2: My name is P-A-U-L, R., J-O-N-E-S
Speaker 1: And your current age is?
Speaker 2: Age is mature seventy-five.
Speaker 1: And the city that we're in right now would be?
Speaker 2: The great city of Atlanta, Georgia, new capital of the South, soon to be of the nation, I expect in the near future of the world.
Speaker 1: And your country and state city of birth.
Speaker 2: Best country in the world, United States of America.  I was born in a very interesting little town, Bessemer, that's spelled B-E-S-S-E-M-E-R, Alabama, about twelve miles south of Birmingham, Alabama.  And I went from there.
Speaker 1: Okay, and can you tell me what your occupation is?
Speaker 2: Gosh, I'm sort of a beachcomber and a vagabond.  In between I do a little collecting of act.  Years ago, I was more of a public servant, having worked in federal government throughout several departments of government and agencies, and once served even in a municipal capacity as a first black city department head in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is June--sorry--today's date is August 16th, 19--2003.  Want a repeat on that?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Today's date is August 16th, 2003.

Speaker 1: So just to warm up, can you tell me what your favorite food is?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh, years ago, there was no doubt about what it is.  It's a little bit more difficult now.  Years ago, my family sent me from the South to the North to live with a brother and his wife and children to attend school.  And for our birthdays, we all had a chance to pick what we wanted.  My favorite always was roasted leg of lamb with mint jelly, and cauliflower, and broccoli, and homemade yeast rolls.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I enjoy warm weather, and so spring, as everything begins to, begin to take shape, trees that have been dormant, flowers that have been dormant begin to pop up, leaves begin to come out.  I'm particularly pleased that spring sort of heralds a new era for each year.  And so that gives new birth to me, and to ideas, and to projects I'm working on.  And it's one of my favorites.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Undoubtedly it used to be blue.  I find that I've fell in love with a Chinese red once when I walked into someone's home who would dare to paint a kitchen in enameled red and black.  And since then I have a tendency to enjoy a dash of exciting color, so that I'm even thinking in terms of remodeling and redoing.  And so I'm thinking that I'm gonna bring in some kind of colorist or decorator that can say hey, let's do a splash of this over there and another splash of that over there, to get away from the humdrum of one off white, eggshell all throughout the house.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite vacation location?
Speaker 2: I have a tendency to favor locations throughout the United States that I have not seen, or those that I've fallen in love with and revisit, although occasionally, I like sojourns abroad.  But I like to go where I feel welcomed.  And, and I'm a very sensitive person, and sometimes I've felt that although people look for the tourist dollar, the, the complete welcome mat hasn't always been out, as I've gone abroad to Europe, Southeast Asia, other places.  One of my favorite places is, of course, was the times when I lived in Bangkok in Thailand in Southeast Asia, where I felt very comfortable; I had gained a certain acceptance.  And I learned my way around fairly quickly and had studied some of the language.  That at least gave me enough (unclear) with the language to be able to interpret and to communicate so that that worked out very well for me.  But I still love exploring new places.  For instance, while I don't rush to wanna go back to New York [City, New York] to live, I enjoy going back every year or two, and among other things, going from places like SoHo [New York, New York], and all the way up to Time Square, and finally winding up in Harlem [New York, New York].  It gives me a touch and flavor of something that I enjoy going back to and can't get enough of.  It's always exciting, and I fear won't ever be quite the same following 9/11 [September 11, 2001] and the more recent power outages, as they are struggling to get back on their feet and to return to where they were.  I think it'll be a long struggle.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A thing of beauty is a joy forever.  Love it very much, believe in it very much.  Love the beauty of simplicity, but a thing of beauty is a joy forever.

Speaker 1: What were your parents' names?
Speaker 2: My mother was named Ella, maiden name Reed, R-E-E-D; my father, always known as Will Jones.  I suspect that because it was William.  Some people call him WM., for William, WM., sort of abbreviated, and even some who knew him very well called him Uncle Bill.  They were beautiful people, my mother very active in the church as a Sunday school teacher; my father was a deacon.  I grew up going to Sunday school and in the church, and of course we had our Sunday meals afterwards.  And we'd go out for the Sunday ride.  And the girls, who were older, would always stay home and do other things.  And they'd grab me and throw me in the backseat of the car, while my mom and dad up front, who would just take off and visit neighbors out in the boonies, and stop here.  And if somebody had an interesting flowerbed, and there were some things my mother didn't have, she'd get a little sprig if each and bring back and plant in her yard.  And when people would come to visit us, we'd do exactly the same thing.  If she had something they needed or wanted or didn't have, you could always pull up a little sprig of it with a little root, and they'd take that back and they had a start of that.  My mother had such beautiful flowerbeds and, and vegetable gardens that each year the neighborhood and city we lived in would give a prize for the best flower garden.  And she would win that prize every year, until they finally asked her to please not compete so that somebody else could win.  My father was interesting.  He came in and went into what was a mining area, where the iron, iron ore was mined, limestone was mined, and pretty soon became a mining captain and then a mining contractor where the company [Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company], which was a subsidiary of U.S. Steel, would contract with certain people to mine ore and pay them by the tons.  He told me, as I grew up, that there were times when he'd mined so much ore that they'd have to pay him increments, couldn't pay him all at one payday, and it worked out to be quite an interesting opportunity for him economically.  He later, following the organizing of labor and the organizing of the workers in and around those area, went to work for the company in their offices in labor relations.  And after they had made some decisions not to hire anymore persons of color who were coming up from the rural areas and the farming areas to an industrial area for better jobs, he was able to make a breakthrough there and get people hired.  So, it was not too uncommon for me to witness people coming by the house, them helping with my sisters writing for those who were illiterate, filling out applications to get them an application in and helping him to help them get a job.  It was an interesting time for me.  We grew up, that mother and that father and those sisters of mine, in a company town, where we lived in company housing, where they had company camps, where you had a company commissary where you bought most of your things, where you had a company dispensary where you went for medical treat, where you had a company community center, and a company school system considered superior to the public school system, which was segregated in those days.
Speaker 1: Can you state the name of your father and your sisters?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Will, William Jones.  My sisters were Safronia [ph.], we called her Sal Phillips, and then Maggie, we called Moach [ph.] Phillips, and there was Luella Pip Phillips [ph.], and finally, Leah, L-E-A-H, Kate Phillips [ph.].
Speaker 1: And what was the order of birth of--
Speaker 2: In exact--
Speaker 1: --your siblings?
Speaker 2: --in exact--in exactly the way I stated it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I started with the oldest, Sal; the next was Maggie, "Moach"; the next was "Pip," Luella; and the last, the youngest, the baby was Leah Kate.
Story_ID: 136570
Speaker 1: How far can you trace back your ancestors?
Speaker 2: I would go back to grandparents comfortably.  Rumor/hearsay carry it back further, but my memory is of grandmother on my mother's side, grandmother on my father's [William Jones] side--very interesting, in that we'd go down to what we called the country.  My mother's [Ella Reed Jones] first husband had been killed working in the mines, for which that was often the only little money that people got when--from insurance money.  She took that money and went back down to the far that my grandmother, her mother was living on with her brother, an uncle of mine, and bought a hundred and sixty-acre farm that they lived on and worked.  I remember going down at least once a year with her when they would collect rent.  The rent came from the amount of cotton they would gin.  And occasionally, you know, they'd get three, four, five, six bales of cotton, and you'd get a third of the cotton.  So if they had six bales that year, we'd get the money from two bales.  If they only had three, we'd get it from one, and that was it.  Oft times, I've listen to conversation of the adults, and there was a strong suspicion that sometimes my good Uncle Murph [ph.] had gone out and ginned a couple of bales before we got down, so that they didn't have to account for being a part of the rent that he paid, because he later on accumulated enough to buy his own spread of eighty acres.
Speaker 1: So they were free?  Your parents were both free?
Speaker 2: They were.  They were on the cusp of having been freed, and living still though in what amounted to an area for tenant farmers that may have been slave quarters.  Very interesting, as I used to go down with my folk, who pulled me out of school to go down to the country, and we'd get down there on these muddy roads.  And if it rained, you know, you've got these ruts you had to drive in, and you had to know how to drive in them, or pretty soon you'd stop.  Sometimes we'd get stuck in there, and the old overseer of the plantation would come along, who was supposed to be pretty expert on navigating those roads, big in driving, so he'd come along and get under the wheels.  People would get behind the car to push him.  Never will forget an uncle had come down from West Virginia where he was living, he was down with us, had his clothes on, and he was behind (unclear).  As the wheels spun, I can remember the mud went straight up his little suit--that day very interesting, but we got out of it.  And often they'd cut branches from the trees on the side to put under those wheels in order to give them traction.  But we'd stop at those places on the way to my mother's farm to see her mother and uncle, where we would stay, and we'd go down into those quarters, where you'd have the gates go down into them.  And there was the little shacks made out of the worst of the lumber, number two and number three, things that were made from mills that had come around, very little insulation, if any.  So that's all you had, was a board, and you could almost see through some of those boards put together the cracks of daylight outside.  So you can imagine sleeping in those.  Often those people done quilting, and in their doing the quilting, you'd go in there and spend the night with these people.  And after the fire went out in the fireplace, it got pretty cold.  So you know, you're stacked one, two, three quilts on you, and they're pretty heavy.  And you'd get you a warm place in that mattress, which was stuffed with cotton, the mattress ticking was from the fields that they had picked cotton from.  And so they weren't really very strong innerspring matters that we might have today.  And so you'd get in the middle of those mattresses, and they'd almost fold up on you (laughter) and cover you.  And once you got a place warm in there, you did very little moving overnight.
Story_ID: 136571
Speaker 1: Are there any other stories, legends, or songs that you'd like to share that were passed down in your family?
Speaker 2: Well, those were the kinds of things that were of interest.  My dad [William Jones] would always go down there two or three times a year to hunt.  He enjoyed hunting, was a great hunter.  And I'd go down with him on that, and we'd enjoy doing that.  So we'd go to another uncle of mine who was an older brother of my mother [Ella Reed Jones].  And he had accumulated six or eight hundred acres of his own, and had tenant farmers living on his place, and a cook had worked for him and took care of his house.  And we'd go down, and gosh, they'd get up early morning before he'd go out hunting, and they had a little kitchen off, off--and the kitchen was off of the house, covered through the back porch exit to it because it was so hot in the area where you cooked, and so you didn't want that in the house proper.  So they would cook there, and bring that food inside.  But they'd have a breakfast ready by the time you got up, ready to go, and then the guys would go out and hunt.
Story_ID: 136572
Speaker 1: Pretty soon what was so interesting with my father [William Jones] were the people that he'd worked with in the office at the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company, which was a U.S. Steel subsidiary, got to know each other very well.  And they would go hunting with him down there, spend the night, and get up early in the morning, and all go out hunting out for birds or for small game, rabbits, squirrels, the like.  And they'd come back and some would be cooked, and others would be cleaned, and they'd bring them back home.  They'd gotten to know each other very well, these guys. What was so interesting was, I came along at a time when Joe Louis, the Brown Bomber, was sort of on his way up the ladder as a fighter.  He initially had been Alabama.  Family had moved to Detroit [Michigan].  And in those days, everyone was very, very strongly racial conscious.  And so we would sit often, when those fights came on, the neighborhood or the block, on a porch during those summer nights.  And they'd open up a window, whoever had a radio, and not everybody did, and they'd plug it into one of the little holes, and stick the radio on the ledge of the window.  People would sit at a (unclear), and on chairs, on the porch, the others there was on the steps.  And they'd turn it up loud, and we'd listen to that fight.  And it was if, for us persons of color, that everything hung on this guy fighting for the race.  And these men that were working with my father, or vice versa, would always pick whoever his white opponent was, and he'd always have Joe Louis.  It got so as they paid him so often, that little five dollars each would bet, to that whenever they started fighting again--I never will forget it.  It was the first [Max] Schmeling fight--they just paid him the five dollars in advance.  Well, as you know, Schmeling beat Joe Louis, and he had to pay their money back and the five that he owed each one of them.  Luckily, in the second fight luck was reversed, and Joe Louis beat Schmeling, and the rest is history.  But it was an interesting set of events, that in spite of the system in which we grew up, there were patterns of relationships that transcended those persons who would say often, you know, we don't abide the whole group of the race, but Will Jones is all right, or Paul Jones is all right.  These are the kind of people at 12:00 high, or at 12:00 midnight, if there was a need for help, you could get people to respond to you and vice versa, you would respond.  And that was the kind of circumstance that I grew up in.
Story_ID: 136573
Speaker 1: Would you say that your father [William Jones] was race conscious?
Speaker 2: I think he was extremely race conscious.  I used to sit with him as a child when he and a group of the older men, more mature persons, formed the first NAACP, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People chapter in Bessemer, Alabama.  And I'd sit there and listen at these men talk, and, and develop strategies, and read the materials that had come down from the national offices.  And it gave me some undergirding and some fundamental grounding in what I think later helped form my roots, my values, and my disciplines.  But my father was always conscious of it.  I can remember him telling a story of having, having gone into a mob crowd, coming out of the camp where a majority of the blacks lived that worked for the company [Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company].  And they had taken some black fellow and was about to string him up, hang him, or lynch him.  And he stopped his horse and buggy, and he said he just drove through the crowd very deliberately and grabbed the man and wanted to know what he was doing there, told him he ought to be at home, and escorted him to the buggy, and went away before anybody said anything, and saved him from a sure-fired lynching.  I can remember he was the one person that they relied on, on payday nights, on Friday nights, when everybody got paid.  There was always the bootleggers who made their living off of selling home brew or homemade liquor, untaxed liquor.  And you know, you'd go from one to the other.  So I'd ride with him as he would visit the camp to make sure everything was orderly.  And everybody would greet Uncle Bill, or they done greet Uncle Bill's son, and so Uncle Bill would always--have a drink with us.  So you know, they'd buy a half a pint of this or a drink of that.  And so he'd have a sip with them, and we'd move on.  But it was interesting.  Everybody's barbecuing; they're out with a tub, with a sheet of, of iron that they cooked on, and their charcoals working in the bottom.  And you buy yourself a rib sandwich or something and then go from there, very interesting time.  But you got to know the people, get the feel of the people, know the regard he had for them, they had him.  And often if officers from the city would come out to that camp and want to go out there to arrest somebody, or to see somebody interrogate him, they were afraid to go into the camp alone, unless they first checked with my father, who was able to intercede, and to pave the way for them to be able to interact.
Story_ID: 136574
Speaker 1: Can you describe the kind of man that your father [William Jones] was?
Speaker 2: Probably the smartest man I've ever known with a limited education; was a Biblical scholar, knew every inch of the Bible, had read it back and forth, which was not uncommon in those days.  But I can set--remember sitting listening to he and ministers or a Bible scholars always sitting and discussing certain books of the Bible and chapters and verse that he could refer to.  Then he'd get it and check it out, and there he was, right on the dot.  So I was particularly proud of him in that regard, as I remembered his prowess in that regard, books that he'd read.  We had a practice with our kerosene lamps and fireplaces of sitting and taking the afternoon paper.  After work he'd come in, and after dinner we all sit around the fireplace, and nothing else to do, he'd read the paper out loud.  And so I remember my early days of listening to what was going on with Haile Selassie in Ethiopia, when the Italians were running through, and the valiant fight he put up against them, and the appeals to the League of Nations back in those days, sort of an old--because the--free--the pre-runner to the present day United Nations.  And there (unclear)--(unclear) into the pleas of the Ethiopians to come in and intercede.  And I think it was that failure on their part to respond that began to lead to the demise of the League of Nations.  That was an interesting thing.  I just had dinner last evening with--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Would you say that your father was a Garveyite as well?
Speaker 1: No, I wouldn't say that he was a Garveyite as well.  I would say that he was more a supporter of a number of things.  For instance, let me give you what happened when organized labor came into Bessemer [Alabama] and came out to Muscoda [Alabama], which is the name of the mining area in the mineral rich mountain area that I grew up in.  And running up that mountain [Red Mountain] were several different areas where they had company towns that, or villages, that were worked.  Like there was Muscoda, M-U-S-C-O-D-A, that I lived in; there was Escuda [Alabama, ph.]; there was Wenonah [Alabama], there was Delonah [Alabama, ph.], all Indian-named, very interesting time in which we all lived there--
Story_ID: 136575
Speaker 1: I just wanna tell you, back when organized labor came in, it was a very interesting time.  I was there as a child growing up in the midst of this, people who knew each other; we were closely knit community, families that knew each other, children who played with each other, men who knew each other, women who knew each other, all there, suddenly found themselves with a split.  Half of the people saying yes, we need a union in here.  The other half said no, we don't need to.  We're loyal to the company [Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company].  It was an interesting time in the life of organized labor, in the time in the community of Muscoda [Alabama] in the city of Bessemer, Alabama.  I saw the union make overtures to my father [William Jones], said listen, come with us; help us organize, you know, we're hire--he said the company said stay with us, we need you.  And had to make some decisions, and it was a difficult time.  I remember running into a man once who said the pickets were across a big bridge that had led from where they did work and where the office was, over to the residential community, company housing.  And he said they were there standing there, and a man came along said, "Geez, what are you guys staying out here this late?"  They said, "We were waken and waiting on Uncle Bill--that's my father--to come along.  We wanted to accost him and see what's going on," and said, "we know he's not at home, that he'd been somewhere."  He said, "Yeah, didn't you see that lady come by here in a red dress about twenty minutes?"  They said, "Yeah."  They said, "That was Uncle Bill, said he's already gone by."  But it was it was interesting time to listen to, but those were the kinds of things that came out it.  But I do remember even more seriously, the time when they decided Sunday evening, just before work, that they were gonna have a showdown.  They said it's a strike, said we're not letting anybody go to work.  People had to go up toward the mines where they went down into the mine underground to, to do their work, and go to what they called the bathhouse, which is where everybody went up and changed clothes, put their better clothes on, put 'em on the hangers and run 'em up to the top of the roof of the building, and, and then put on their old red clothes from the red or iron ore, and get ready to go to work.  You had half these guys up there with guns, pistols, the other half are in ditches and trenches on their way to work, and stop them, and all the rest of the camp, the ladies, the non-working, and the children, waiting intensely to see what happened.  And you could hear the shooting and then the firing, and you could more.  And pretty soon an ambulance or two is up there, and they were bringing people to the company dispensary.  And the women and the children went down toward the dispensary, waiting on the bodies to come in.  And they were covered in so much blood that all of a sudden, here we were, people not knowing whether it was their son or their father or their husband, everybody's crying and (unclear).  It was a tough day.  Nights, we would also listen to forty or fifty rounds of ammunition hitting the top of somebody's tin house, and that also was sometimes frightening.  Eventually, we came to see that community come together around what was an organized effort.  And as I grew up and went off to college, I'd come back and get a job with the company to earn money to go back to school that fall.  And I worked with some of those same persons in those mines, both inside them and outside of them, and got to know them, and they all approached me, obviously as Uncle Bill's son, seeing whether or not I'd join the union.  I joined the union, used to go into the unions, which were very interesting in those days.  They go into one hall the blacks were sitting on one side, the whites were sitting on the other.  They'd have a white president and black vice president.  They'd have a black, black assistant secretary, and a white secretary, a white treasurer, and a black assistant secretary.  And that was the beginning of it.  It was interesting.
Story_ID: 136576
Speaker 1: Where was, where was your father [William Jones] born?
Speaker 2: My father was born down in the Black Belt of Alabama--well, my mother [Ella Reed Jones] also came from--they knew each other there, although they didn't marry there.  Both had prior marriages.  My father's first wife had died.  My mother, her husband moved up to the area where I was born, and he was killed working.  She had four little girls, and it was those four little girls that my father married my mother.  And so, they'd always wanted a brother, and I was born.  So it was a great position to be the youngest and that boy in the family.  And not only was he proud of it and my mother, but the girls had always wanted a brother, so they tended to try to spoil a little bit.  They always would say they were so happy I wasn't older than they were, or I really would have kept them in line.  But it was a good place to be in, being relatively comfortable, but meager means.  I never knew that I wasn't well off, because everything I wanted, I got, and that kind of a living.  But my mother was a very special person, loved by everybody who knew her, had that kind of beautiful disposition that attracted you to her, taught Sunday school, was active in the church, active in the community and meetings, loved her gardening, flowers as well as vegetables.  During the summers we'd hunt and knew what it was to have to buy fresh vegetables; we raised them.  We had out back a chicken yard and a hen house where we had our own chickens.  And she would send out sometime and buy a hundred chickens, at the time from hatcheries, and raised them.  'Cause it was nothing to step out in the backyard and grab a couple of fryers or broilers, and--
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born down in the same area, the Black Belt, down in Perry County, Alabama, near a little town called Newbern [Alabama], and my father came from the same place.  They came out of both Hale County [Alabama] and the Perry County area--and noted for its heavy farming, heavy cotton farming--and made their way up to the Bessemer [Alabama] area, and seeking better circumstances for themselves and for their families.
Speaker 1: Do you know around when they were born?
Speaker 2: It's kind of difficult for me to tell you now without looking in the old family Bible, where they recorded all of the ages.  But my mother was considerably younger than my father.  And it was an interesting time in which they were born, shortly after the slaves had been freed, and they grew up in that area down there.  My mother went to school into the nearest largest town, which was Marion, Alabama.  Incidentally, it's the same town and area in which [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s wife, Coretta [Scott King], family lived and she grew up in and Andy Young's [HM Andrew Young] wife also had come out of.  But she'd gone into school in the school there in Marion by the school that was a privately run school, Lincoln Normal [School, later Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama], by (unclear) whites who had come down from the North were a part of what had might have been the American French Service group [sic, American Missionary Association] and had a superior education to the public schools.  So the family would sacrifice and see that she got into that, and that sort of kick-started her interest in education.  And when she left then and came up, she was, she didn't--and still the same and the girls, and so that they all went on and finished high school, but went to college and then all became teachers.  But, in addition to that, I can remember getting up with her at nights, one or two o'clock in the morning as a baby, as a young kid toddling around, to go out.  And she would move the hose pipe from one flowerbed to another, just leave it in there to soak the roots of those things that she had fertilized was manure from the chicken house.  And she had just prize-winning roses, prize-winning dahlias, and it was a joy for me to grow up with that, that love for the beauty of those flowers, rubbed off on me.  I expect it carried over to my love of art even, and of course my love still for gardening, and for flowers, and for the beauty of it.
Story_ID: 136577
Speaker 1: How did your parents [William Jones and Ella Reed Jones] meet?
Speaker 2: They had known each other by growing up in the area of the South in the Black Belt [region of Alabama], where they both were born. And my father would know of--you have heard through visiting the families and working with the families.  It wasn't a, wasn't uncommon in those days for families that had large numbers of children, when it came time to plant or it came time to harvest or to pick cotton, to say hey, what about getting your team over here to work with me for the next week and vice versa, or we'll go over and work with you for a few days?  And they would do that with each other, and would help them get (unclear) at the right time to keep from leaving things out there overly exposed and unpicked cotton or potatoes not plowed up so that they could gather then and have potato banks where they could live off of those all the winter, un--not uncommon in those days, you know, for a meal to consist of almost one or one or two items.  You'd you have a nice, big, thick cake of cornbread made from grinding the meal that they'd gotten from the corn that they picked and put in shelter, and taken to the mill where they would take it--if you took a bushel of corn in, they'd take a peck of it and keep for themselves and grind the rest up for meal for you.  Or if you're feeding your hogs, they'd grind it up in a different fashion for chops from the hogs.  And then you'd go in and get a pot of butterbeans and cornbread and offer 'em sweetened water, which was nothing but a glass of water with sugar, no ice, no flavor, but it was a meal.  You'd do the same with black-eyed peas or other peas, crowder peas.  You know, when the greens were season, you'd get a bunch of greens, throw a sliced tomato over it, some onions over it, or you would've taken peppers and pour a bit of vinegar over 'em, and you've got pepper sauce, and you'd sauce it down.  And you'd always throw a little strick of lean, strick of fat, white meat, into it.  And as a result of that, you know, there was a little meat that you got with those greens and with that cornbread.

Speaker 1: Who do you think you take after?
Speaker 2: Ah, maybe a combination of people, some say my father [William Jones], some say my mother [Ella Reed Jones].  I'd suspect a little bit of both sort of rubbed off on me.  And I like to think that there were positives coming out of my close relationship with both of them that stayed with me.
Story_ID: 136579
Speaker 1: Years after I had grown up a little and gotten around fourth or fifth grade, my mother [Ella Reed Jones] and father [William Jones] went up to New York, and left the girls who were older to take care of the house, and took me with them to the World's Fair.  We stayed up there, and they got a chance, my mother, first-hand, to look at the kids and how the schools were impacting them, and came back and said to my four sisters that she thought it might not be a bad idea for them to think about sending me up there instead of staying in the segregated school system I was in, in, in the South, in Alabama.  And my father was alone to setting vote, thinking his son should stay at home and be close to home.  And I remember the girls and then my mother must have outvoted him because I found myself being packed up after they got in touch with my brother and his wife, his sister-in-law--my sister-in-law.  And they said yeah, we'll take him.  And I went up and they paid for my going up, and went to school there.  I never will forget the first day my sister-in-law took me over to the school, which was predominantly white.  It was up in the Bronx [New York, New York], where we lived up around 220th Street, which was pretty country and rural for New York in those days.  So, she said to the teachers there at admissions, she said, you know, he's just coming up from the South.  Maybe, you know, with the level of education you get, you may need to put him back a grade or so.  The teachers said no, we'll see what, how he makes out, and if the need come to be, we'll discuss it with you at that time.  It wasn't bad.  Pretty soon I fit in, absorbed it.  We never talked about going back a grade anymore.  And it was an interesting thing--went up with a sort of Southern accent.  Children are interesting.  It was a matter of weeks, three, four, five, six weeks.  You associated with those kids on the playground, in the classroom, pretty soon you're talking like everybody else is talking.  So you pick up a sort of Northern brogue.  Comes June, I'm going back South to spend the summer with my family.  So I go back with this Northern brogue, and everybody looking at me.  A little white girl who sells ice cream over at the commissary--and I'd go get a nickel ice cream cone, two scoops by the way, big as you could put on there--and she'd always say, what do you want?  And I'd tell her, and she said oh, said, wait a minute.  She, she called another girl or two over, two other people.  She said say that again.  I said they wanna hear this guy with this Northern accent talk, very interesting experience--
Story_ID: 136580
Speaker 1: Somewhere in my having a foot in the North, and a foot in the South, I begin to get a blend of what worked better tilting North and tilting South, so that years later the comfort factor of living in both places played off very well, as I got a job with the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] right after the Civil Rights Act of '64 [1964] was set up, working as a conciliation specialist, a community relations specialist for CRS, the Community Relations Service, which was created by the Civil Rights Act of '64 [1964] as a conciliation agency to bring about compliance with the law all over the country, with no weapon other than moral persuasion, nothing else.  But you could go in (unclear).  It was an interesting time.  They hired blacks from the North and sent them South, and they were tremendously fearful that anybody who went south to try to do anything would be lynched or strung up and hung, and so they were frightened.  They took whites and sent them from the North to the South.  Whites in the South in power hated them worse than they did blacks.  I went back as a native of the South, as a black, used the white man pretty well in power, and knew how to develop a relationship, how to get out of him what I wanted without pushing his back to the wall so that they felt threatened, without embarrassing them, giving him a face-saving way out.  And I would never take no for an answer.  When I (unclear) things, so that if they couldn't say yes, we can do this, or that could be done, they would say maybe, never pushed 'em to the extent that they had to say sorry, no, can't do, and developed one on one relationships there.
Story_ID: 136581
Speaker 1: Will never forget once, going into Birmingham, Alabama, and got a job there shortly after coming out of Howard University [Washington, D.C.] after, after finishing coursework on master's degree in political science, government.  And there was executive secretary director of interracial committee for Birmingham [Alabama] in Jefferson County [Alabama], said to the county commission chairman one day, who I knew on a one on one basis, said look, I just came up the bank of elevators.  One has a little black sign on the marble saying colored only.  I said isn't there something we can do about this?  Can't you bring that up at the next county commission meeting and re, remove it?  He said oh, let's don't bring it up at the county commission meeting.  He said come back, and let's think it over and talk about it next week.  I go back next week, and there's a nice clean spot where the little black sign was saying colored only.  And so I get up to his office, and he reaches in the drawer and pulls out the sign, and gives it to me as a souvenir, much more effective than having said to some little white fellow who they'd probably had a hand in getting hired as a janitor or an elevator operation, said look, after work this evening, why not just remove that sign for me down there.  I'm not sure that it matters, and bring it up to my office.  And so without the press being alerted, without the public being alerted, the move had been made.  What I'd wanted had been accomplished.  What he did had been accomplished.  He wasn't on the spot, hadn't been threatened politically, and there was no backlash.
Story_ID: 136582
Speaker 1: Do you have any other early memories from childhood that you'd like to share?
Speaker 2: Oh, from childhood, I grew up in a climate where you very often as we played, you know, we'd bike ride all over the city, all over the mountains, all over the area [Red Mountain], and often played ball together, blacks and whites together sometimes, 'cause there was--we were close in terms of the living in the camps.  And it was a situation where we grew up and played with each other.  It wasn't a bad scene.  I can remember wanting to play football.  I can remember going out at age fourteen, and my father [William Jones] had to go and buy me a uniform almost to get me out to play on the high school team, or to go out and try out for it.  And he'd known of an old uniform in one of the whites homes where one of their sons had grown on, had left, practically unused.  He talked to them and got that from them, and those were the first football togs that I played in; went out for the team; made the team; and later became known as Muscoda Red, and I played for that team, Muscoda, which was at a--made into a high school for the county, and later transferred to the city, to Dunbar High School [Bessemer, Alabama], that has a little bit better team.  And they called me coming from Muscoda, Muscoda Red also.  So it was an interesting time of playing in that.  But as a child, I could remember a number of things, of having to go to the icehouse sometimes.  We grew up initially, most of those families, with iceboxes instead of the refrigerator.  And so you'd go to the one icehouse and go up and buy five or ten, twenty-five cent worth of ice.  And you'd get that, and they'd put a little string around the corner around it.  And you'd (unclear), and by the time you'd get home, switching it from the right hand to the left hand and carrying.  You know, it'd be rubbing up against you, and you're wet down here or over here, but you'd get it there.  And that's what we'd chip off with an ice pick, and do your--pitcher of lemonade or iced tea for dinner or lunch.
Speaker 1: --And what were your--
Story_ID: 136583
Speaker 1: What were your dreams and aspirations as a child?  Given those experiences, what did you dream to be, or did you ever think you would become who you are now?
Speaker 2: Early dreams was of going to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York], had read a lot of books on West Point and on how to even get appointed to West Point.  So I said to my father [William Jones] one day, you know, it's gonna take a congressional appointment to get there.  Not sure my father knew, knew the congressman from that district, but he went to the superintendent of the company he worked for [Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company], mentioned it to him.  Don't remember him having said that he know that he'd intercede and get it.  But the likelihoods in those days of getting a congressman, all-white congressman then with all predominantly white voting constituencies, to nominate a black out of one of the positions they had, and so I never got that.  The other route to West Point would have been if you were the son of a serviceman who had been honorably discharged could get that kind, (unclear) that kind of nominee.  But those were early things, thought about it, thought about Annapolis [Maryland, United States Naval Academy].  But West Point had appealed to me, both from what I'd read and from the movies I'd seen of it, and even in those days when they had good football teams, it appealed to me, but as that was to be denied, and so I sought other routes--
Story_ID: 136584
Speaker 1: Early on, I felt I probably would be good presidential material, that one day I'd be president of the United States.
Speaker 2: And you initially ran for president of the United States.
Speaker 1: I ran for president as a black long before any other person of color even offered the idea to the press.  As a matter of fact, I was in Montgomery, Alabama, for a South-wide meeting of black Democrats who were organizing.  And it was very interesting time because I got to meet an awful lot of people from other areas, other states, and a young man from an area in Georgia, Savannah [Georgia], who'd been very active with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and voter registration was there and was running for the chairmanship of that group, and someone nominated me.  And I never will forget when it came time for me to make the nominating speech, speech, responding to my nomination, I strolled from the back of the room slowly up the aisle.  And those people I hadn't met, I'd reach across seats and shake hands, slap 'em on the back, give 'em a smile, and a wink.  And by the time I got up front, I knew I had enough votes to win, and so I did win it, hands down--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: Goes back into the end of the '50s [1950s].
Story_ID: 136585
Speaker 1: And did you and your family attend church at all?
Speaker 2: Church was so strong because I grew up going to church.  My mother [Ella Reed Jones] was very active in the church.  My father [William Jones]--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: --was very active in it.  New Salem Baptist Church [Bessemer, Alabama], New Salem Baptist Church.  In that--
Speaker 1: In Muskegee [ph.], Alabama.
Speaker 2: No, in Bessemer, Alabama.
Speaker 1: In Bessemer, Alabama.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What was so interesting about it was that there in that company town with all the acres and the land owned by the company, had been land dedicated for a Baptist church, land dedicated for a Methodist church.  Well, low and behold, one of the churches burned down, and so they started alternating Sundays in that one church that was left.  And so we'd all go to church; we'd go to Sunday school.  Certainly, if we didn't stay for the services, (unclear)--church later.  And so they all sort of melded together there, as we went to church.  So, it was that kind of a circumstance we grew up in.  I never will forget growing up at home, you know, they took turns in having augmented the salary of the pastor by a family always inviting him out after he'd preached his sermon that Sunday to one of the homes for Sunday dinner.  When it came time to bring him out to our home, he'd come and whatever we'd have, you know, he'd get there and he'd pass the meat around.  Never will forget one of my sisters loved pork chops, and she said that she'd always look forward to getting that second.  And here comes the minister and my dad and mother would offer it to the minister, and he never refused it.  And she always said she would always look forward to working so that she could buy all the pork chops she'd want.
Speaker 1: Do you have any memories from church, any kind of experiences, or visions, or anything that happened in the church or related to your family in church?
Speaker 2: Only that they were always very supportive of whatever, fundraising they needed.  They were there for whatever meetings that brought--any crisis that brought them together at the church, and they were supportive in that way.  Father for a long time active as a deacon and my mother as a Sunday school teacher.  It was those kinds of impacts that made a mark on me early on.  And it was a good circumstance and a discipline also, and an exposure to what is a fabric of regard and respect for each other, for religion, and for belief that has stayed with me.
Story_ID: 136586
Speaker 1: Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: Elementary school had me at Muscoda [School, Bessemer, Alabama].  It was an elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very interesting school, and--
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: Pretty good student.  I didn't set the world on fire, but thought I was a pretty good student.  I can remember that I told you earlier that my father [William Jones] loved reading, reading out loud.  And we'd all sit around the fireplace and (unclear) doing that.  We'd sit around that same fireplace and do homework.  And then as we got to learn to read, my father would throw the paper to us or a book too.  We'd all read out loud, so that practice got there.  But I would never forget that I thought terribly unfair that young girl from across the street from a family that was a relatively (unclear) when the father had left and gone North and left the wife with the children to make out on their own.  And Juanita [ph.] was an extremely bright young girl, was a year or two ahead of me, and read well.  He'd bring her over to read and then throw me the book to read.  And I thought Juanita being a year or two ahead of me had an unfair advantage, but I'd sit there and read as best I could and, and (unclear) to the cause and to the competition.  But it was a beginning of trying to read and then to learn, and to absorb what we read.  But put--my mother [Ella Reed Jones] (unclear) put me in school at age five, very interesting time, so kids (unclear) at age six going into school, found me at five in school with them.
Story_ID: 136587
Speaker 1: Do you remember your teachers?
Speaker 2: Remember them very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Beautiful thing about them, while they weren't paid much and you know, had very little to go in, were a dedicated bunch of teachers who always wanted the best possible education for those children.  I can remember that they had a great deal of pride in race, that we had an inordinate amount of discussion around black achievers who were in the history books and those who weren't.  You got a good dose of that, that I'm not sure we get in kind now in the school systems.  But it was a good fundamental girding for me, brought a lot of pride in who I was, what I was about, and stayed with me, always was happy to be who I was, African American, black at the time, Negro at the time.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher that you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I had a favorite teacher, but some of them were.  There was a Mrs. Bobbie [ph.], that I liked, who not only was a teacher, but also was a music teacher, and always said listen, I want you take the piano, said I'll give you lessons free.  I don't know why I didn't quite stick with that.  You know, we ran a few (unclear) up and down the bars and everything, but I didn't really catch on to it very much.  But then there was Mrs. Fisher [ph.] and my first grade teacher, Mrs. Patterson [ph.], all of them tremendous teachers, had tremendous impact on us all.  I look back on the numbers of people who with that education got their start to go on up to Atlanta [Georgia] and finish high school, go up to colleges, and to begin to achieve and make a name for themselves, tremendous.
Story_ID: 136588
Speaker 1: Where did you go to middle school?
Speaker 2: I stayed in Muscoda [School, Bessemer, Alabama] until I went to school in New York [City, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My family thought it was a better school system there than the segregated system in the South.  And so each year they packed me up, put a little tag on me the first year or so, to/from, got on the train, people looked at that, brother was to meet me at one train in New York, Penn Station [Pennsylvania Station], and he (unclear), came later and met another one.  And porter saw me with these signs on me.  He said where you're going?  Who are you looking for?  I said my brother was to meet me here.  He said where's your brother?  I said he works across the street at the post office.  He called over to the post office, and they found out what post office he worked at and said he's off today.  So he said look, let's go in here and we cut these tags off of you.  You sit in here with your bag until I finish working for the next hour.  If he hadn't come, I'll see what I can do to help you.  That porter took me and my luggage.  We hit the subway, and we got on.  I'd gotten in there that mid-morning.  All of a sudden the train pulls out from the train station, and all of a sudden it's dark in the tunnel.  I said geez, it's gotten to be night awfully quick.  And pretty soon we pull into another station.  After a while I'm saying it's night, and I reconciled with that, and we pull up and it goes elevated.  And here I am, I'm in the middle of daylight riding up above the city, right?  That's my first experience and memory of New York.  Got there and was playing with his two sons, riding their tricycle when here he comes back, having looked everywhere for me, given up, and there I am.
Story_ID: 136589
Speaker 1: And how did you spend your time in these early years from elementary to middle to high school?  We know you went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], but how did you spend those early years?
Speaker 2: Well, those, those were years in which I did a variety of things, very active.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, enjoyed doing things, you know.  Got up to the point where I played a little football, thought I could run track, did that.  Never will forget when I went to New York [City], used to go down to the Boys Club, which was (unclear) and the gym of one of the high schools nearby and box--never--first time I'd ever put on boxing gloves, tried to take on boys who'd been boxing (laughter) and box them out.  So and that, you know, those were some of the early years.  Got around and organized myself a sandlot base, baseball team.  Never will forget played the (unclear), which was a predominantly Italian team that played there on the same field.  They wondered whether we'd even show up.  We went down there and played; got clobbered, but it was an interesting time.  Very interesting.
Story_ID: 136590
Speaker 1: And how did you enjoy Howard University [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: It was a different experience.  My first two years in college had been at Alabama State--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Teachers College, which is now Alabama State University--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Montgomery, Alabama.  Went down there, having taken a statewide academic test that they give to the top students in each school, from each school from all over the state.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And one--I don't--second, third (unclear) prize in most areas you got a scholarship there.  So, went down there and played football, got elected president of the freshman class, president of junior college, played in the band, took me an instrument and played drums, and, and played a little saxophone, played a little bit of trombone.  But never will forget for the first time that a black band, the band from Alabama State, had marched in the gubernatorial inaugural parade.  We were tagged to the end of it, and so the mighty Hornets from Alabama State College were there.  And we marched up the same streets that the crowd marched up later that came from Selma [Alabama] into the state capitol in Montgomery [Alabama].  It was a good moment to be a part of it.
Speaker 1: Did you pledge a fraternity at all?
Speaker 2: Pledged while I was there.  You had a pledge club for Alpha Phi Alpha and the speech club, and was president of the speech club.  Used to take the boys up after meetings to a little pub about a block or two away from the campus, and we'd get a little beer.  And we'd sit around and drink and shoot the breeze.  So the owner said to me one day, bring your guys up one day, and I'll throw you a case of beer.  We'd given 'em so much beer--business.  So I said to the boys, come on up, the beer's is on me.  And that night he threw that case of beer out, and we had a good time.  They thought I was a great president.
Story_ID: 136591
Speaker 1: So prior to going to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], where did you attend high school and what, what made you go to Howard, as distinguished from the other schools that you possibly could have gone to?
Speaker 2: Interesting way how I got there.  Let's go back to high school for a minute and look at that.  I had gone to school as a child, younger person, because my family wanted me to in New York [City, New York].  Well, I was there in an integrated situation.  I'd been in a segregated situation in the South, so it was an interesting time adjusting.  As a child, you adjust fairly quickly, did that and it worked it very well.
Speaker 1: So you attended high school at Dunbar High School [Bessemer, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Absolutely, Dunbar High School.
Speaker 1: Where is that located?
Speaker 2: In Bessemer, Alabama.  Well, I'm returning from having been in school in this North--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in an integrated school situation, and suddenly I'm back home for high school in Bessemer, Alabama.  And I go over there, and of course, I've come in with a little bit different orientation than junior high and elementary, and it, it made a difference in the classrooms.  Well, I'm not sure I worked very hard, but the fundamental exposure that I'd had sort of had an impact that made for an excelling in high school.  So I went there and teachers took a liking to it.  And I played an interesting role, from the dramatics club, to the track team, to playing football--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and interestingly enough, enjoyed my stay at Dunbar High School, which was in the city of Bessemer, Alabama.  And I was living in an unincorporated county area outside of the city limits, and as a result of going there, had to use an address somewhere else.  Never will forget when I decided to go to Dunbar, which was an accredited high school that I used a relative's address, one of whom taught at the school in the elementary/junior high school division of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so here comes the principal looking at a new student using that address, and he obviously knew the people who lived at that address.  And he was--so I got put back a whole grade, that they had promoted, had jumped me.  I had been skipped they called then over a grade.  They put me back to the regular grade, and I went on to school at Dunbar.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was from Dunbar that I took the high school exams, statewide exams, they have academic exams for those students who were in the top of the class at each high school, rated very high on those, and so got a fellowship--not fellowship, but scholarship then--to Alabama State.  It was then Alabama State Teachers College [later, Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And it's now Alabama State University [Montgomery, Alabama].
Story_ID: 136592
Speaker 1: So I went there [Alabama State Teachers College, later Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama], after looking at where all the other kids who were going off to college were going.  A number of them were coming to Atlanta [Georgia] to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or other schools.  The boys tried to convince me to come over here, and a lot of the girls were going to Alabama State [Teachers College, now Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama].  I decided to take the scholarship and go to Alabama State, went there.  We had the academic scholarship, also played football, which gave me some additional aid, and then got a work study program that had me working in the registrar's office.  And so those things combined meant I had very little to pay to stay on campus and pay for tuition and all of that.  Got elected to president of the freshman class, running against the son of one of the science chemistry professors.  And we beat him, all the girls from my home campaigning for me, all those who came from Jefferson County [Alabama] or Birmingham [Alabama], which is my county--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --all were supportive of me.  And we even picked up a lot of the country folk from around the state that came from all the county training schools.  They sort of related more to me from Bessemer, Alabama, than they did to the professor's son.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so we won hands down and clobbered him.  It was an interesting time for us.
Story_ID: 136593
Speaker 1: So you've taken me on a journey from your early years through your middle, through high school.  In your recollection, what are some of the sights, and sounds, and scenes that you were reared with during this, these phases?
Speaker 2: Sights are interesting.  Let's take, take 'em one at a time, sights, sounds, scene, let's look at the sights.
Speaker 1: And smells.
Speaker 2: Even the aroma (laughter).  Interesting sights, you know, were being out in this company housing and the company camp and going into what we called town on certain days was interesting--shopping, and we'd go into the old dry goods store, they'd call 'em, where you'd go in and do the shopping.  And of course these folk would know the family and other folks and interesting.  They'd address my mother [Ella Reed Jones] by first name, and we'd go in and buy whatever it was we wanted.  And as they tried to form some accord with them, you know, it was an interesting kind of respect, and yet a subtle lack of it, in my opinion.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I can remember that very vividly.  Also, finally going to the bigger city, to Birmingham [Alabama], where then you begin to see the taller, higher skyscraper-like buildings, the hustle and bustle of everybody running red lights and stop signs and across the streets and seeing people.  This begin to give you another bit of feed into it, and that, you know, sort of sights.  Sounds, you got the--was growing up in Muscoda [Alabama] in a mining camp, couldn't help but hear the dumping of ore into the cars that went down through what we called crushers that would take the larger stones and crush them into rock-sized, pea-sized that dropped then into railcars that they'd drop them down. And you could hear from home these things being crushed.  You could say the crusher was on.  You could hear the whistle.  We knew when it was three o'clock, and men were coming out of the mine changing shifts.  We could tell what time it was wherever you were, when you were out riding a bike, at home, up in the little mountain there doing some hunting, you know, wherever, or playing, you knew it was three o'clock.  Then if that same horn ever went boop, boop, boop, boop, boop repeatedly, we knew there'd been some crisis, somebody in the mine had been hurt, there'd been a fall in the mines from the roof of it, there'd been a car going down, that it run over someone, and somebody was brought in, someone was hurt.  So it wasn't always a very pleasant sound to hear.  So that was a kind of sound you'd get.  Another sound was hunting.  We'd take dogs out of the camp.  The boys would go up into the mountains where you could always kick up a rabbit or do something.  Those dogs would take off and --(unclear)--sound and sights of dogs running and baying as they chased the rabbits.  It was amazing.
Speaker 1: What are some of the smells?
Speaker 2: Interesting, as we'd ride around to different places, you know, you'd get different things, and going into areas away from Bessemer, Alabama, as I'd ride with my mother and father [William Jones], for instance, going down to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] was, where Stillman College [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] was.  I later served on that board of directors for a short period of time at Stillman College.  But we'd go down there to see relatives.  Amazingly, they did an awful lot of work with paper making with pulp, bringing in the pulp from all over there to mesh into what became paper.  They fed paper all over the world from there, and you could smell those paper mills, pulp mills. The stink smell stayed with you.  You knew it was there.  Interesting--
Speaker 1: Are there smells from your home?
Speaker 2: From home, at home, nothing like the--
Speaker 1: Favorite foods or--
Speaker 2: --nothing like good old chocolate cake my mother would make; nothing like Sunday dinner when there was a banana pudding cooked on the coal and wood stove, and then with that placed up in what we called the warmer up over that stove where it would stay; nothing like that banana pudding; nothing like that dinner.  But there was also the smell of going outside where occasionally we'd go down in the country to bring back a couple of pigs.  They called them schulz [ph.], and you'd put 'em in pens outside and feed 'em all the slop and all the chops, and then all the corn you could to fatten up before the killing.

Speaker 1: One of the things that always stayed with me was lying in school--in bed before going to school.  And a group of men would come in early in the morning, six, six thirty, seven o'clock, when they were gonna kill hogs so they'd have meat that they would salt down, if not smoke, so they'd have meat all winter long.  And so you'd hear them go into the pen and get a hog.  And of course the hog is squealing from being led off, and you could hear that sound of the squealing of the hog.  And it was lying awake that you'd hear what had to be imagined, and that was that hog squeal suddenly muffled by the sound of blood where a knife is used after they take an axe, hit him in the head, which blunted him.  While he's stunned, they'd take a sharp knife and go across the neck, which opened that up, and they'd bleed.  And then they'd start hanging him up, and that--run that knife down in that opening and hit the heart.  It wasn't long before it was dead.  They had boiling water waiting, and they would take that there and then dip in very well, having hung him up on (unclear) that they'd had hanging.  And they would, after dipping him, would scrape all that hair off of the back of him, then cut him down the middle, and gut, and take everything out.  The women then would step in and take those guts, the intestines, and clean those, and they became chitterlings.  They stripped that fat off of that that they'd made soap out of.  They'd take the liver and something they called lites, L-I-T-E-S [offal, often spelled "lights"], and mix it into what was the first meal you'd get off of that freshly killed hog.  Amazingly, I didn't like lites, don't know why they ever used it and then throw it away, but that was it.  And then they would take that fat, and as they cook it, what was left after they got all the fat off it, put it in the containers, and they became lard that they cooked with.  We had the cracklings that were left, and so you'd have a chance to eat crackling.  To this day, I still love to go in store and pick me up a package of skins and nibble on 'em.  Usually I'll open 'em while I'm running a buggy through the supermarket and begin chewing on 'em before I get up to the cashier.  So those were the kinds of smells, the kinds of sights, the kinds of sounds that I can remember early on.  But the others were things like the rooster crowing from the chicken yard into the day.  You could hear 'em early on as they'd come down and see it; one of the sights, seeing roosters fight.  Here's a young rooster growing up out of the chickens you raised and kept.  Pretty soon one challenges the other, and you've got a fight on your hand.  Very often now I think about it when I see footage on television where ther're raids someplace where they're having chicken fights, dog fights.  Dog fighting was a favorite sport in those days.  I can remember going to some of them, seeing those dogs fight, thinking how horrible and terrible it was, but pulling for a dog, you know, that either belonged to us or went with us.  It was that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 136595
Speaker 1: Can you describe your adult life professionally, your career, your family?  I know you kind of started running a segregated restaurant and--
Speaker 2: Let me back you up--
Speaker 1: --lounge.
Speaker 2: --just a moment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to Alabama State [Teachers College, later Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama] for a couple of years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I researched law schools.  One that I researched was the University of Alabama [School of Law, Tuscaloosa, Alabama].  They were taking students, all white of course, and after two years of college.  Fine print said everybody coming in with a law degree had to take the Alabama [State] Bar Association's exams in order to be certified as a lawyer, the practice, except those who graduated from the University of Alabama's law school automatically were blanketed in as lawyers without having to take any tests and exams.  So I applied to the University of Alabama years before the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision in '54 [1954] [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483] integrate--he called it for integration of schools.  And so, around 1949 I wrote to the dean of admissions saying I'm interested in pursuing an education, getting a law degree at the University of Alabama.  I have a letter that says, from him: fine, we'll send you under separate cover an application and catalog.  And so it came back, and they asked for the application completed with a transcript from the college that I'd gone to.  And so I sent that in, and they saw it was from Alabama State.  A flag went up and said woo, he must be black.  And so, I got this long letter in there now in my scrapbook that says, essence: we would hope that you might persuade yourself not to push further your application for admission to the University of Alabama's law school that had been set up for persons who are white; he said we're entirely aware of the problem it presents and that the Supreme Court can conceivably say to us, either admit him or set up a separate and equal school for him to attend in the state.  But we think the better thinking people of both races would deplore any such insistence on your part at this time and that it would damage race relations.  For that reason, we hope that you can persuade yourself not to press your application further.  Well, this was in 1949 when the doctrine that prevailed legally was separate by equal.  You couldn't get an attorney to represent you seeking admission on an integration basis to the school that had been hither forth reserved for whites.  So as a result of that, I could get nobody to represent me there, and then applied at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  Howard said fine, you know, we'd love to have you, but we just moved to a four-year system where you need a four-year degree, undergraduate degree, to get into law school.  Why don't you think about coming on up anyway?  So I wrote and said hey, I'll come up and finished my undergraduate work there.  They admitted me, and I went up to Howard--
Story_ID: 136596
Speaker 1: Obviously, moving from Alabama State [Teachers College, later Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama] to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], you generally, I don't care what schools you're moving from to, don't have identical curriculum, and so your move lose some credit.  I went there and I went down after they'd given me the little credits they were gonna give me, and sat down in the registrar's office with him.  I said look, this course--he said well, we don't give it.  I said this course is the same as that course, just under a different name, and that course is the same as this one under a different name.  And I'd gone through the catalog, and they gave me credit for those.  What I didn't get, I went out and instead of taking fifteen quarter hours I took twenty-five quarter hours.  I made up for that time and graduated regularly on schedule four years later from having entered college from Howard [University].  It was an interesting time going to Washington, D.C., and being in school there at Howard with the cream of crop of persons from black schools all over the world, but from black families who had achieved doctor, lawyer, businessman or woman that send their kids to private schools that came in there.  I remember very well a group that came from a school like Palmer Memorial [Institute, Sedalia, North Carolina], which was founded by Charlotte Hawkins Brown and was located up in North Carolina.  And the girls would come out of there rather sophisticated, but when you had to hold a teacup, knew how to dress, knew how to stand.  You know, I'm coming out of Alabama, and stand didn't matter as long as you could hold your own in standing with a swagger.  And it was an interesting time.  I'd go over and sit around at the student council office when they would have meetings.  And somebody either resigned or was put off or put off.  I don't know what happened.  They had a vacancy.  I said geez, I'm interested in that.  So what happened was, on the day they had a parliamentary thing come up, I'd put a little interest in parliamentary procedure.  You know, we studied Robert Drews (unclear) and all those little things that come up with it.  And so all of a sudden, they were all around the table, and I'm sitting over on the side of the room.  And nobody knew how to solve that problem when the issue came up.  And I just simply volunteered the answer, and everybody bought into.  It wasn't long before they filled that vacancy with Paul Jones.  And so I think cut my niche on the student council; was an interesting time.  I got in class and we had a great time.  I was majoring in political science or government, which it was known as.  And the head of the department at that time was a man by the name of Ralph Bunche; very interesting time.  During that time, the UN [United Nations] looked for somebody as secretary general.  Bunche's name rose to the fore, and he became that secretary general.  The head of that political science government department became a guy who'd been there for years, Dorsey, Emmett Dorsey, quite a guy, smart.  He'd--we'd all take our political science courses from Dorsey.  And Dorsey would come in after you'd been in class sitting there five minutes late.  And he'd walk from the door across the room to the windows and back across the room and stayed on his feet for forty-five, fifty minutes talking, you're taking notes.  And once in a while one of the eager students, bright students would challenge him and get shot down, or they'd get into a dike (unclear); they'd kind of discourse with him, but very interesting.  Dorsey had done everything but get his Ph.D. for years.  Suddenly, the administration then had said look, man, you've gotta have it if you're gonna be chair of the department.  So he went back and started working on that.  But I'd remember him advising me when I was getting my master's thesis done as a writer, and I'd go down and see him on Saturday mornings in the Dunbar Hotel [Washington, D.C.] where he kept a room and lived.
Story_ID: 136597
Speaker 1: Did you ever--
Speaker 2: Interesting.
Speaker 1: --have the opportunity to talk with Ralph Bunche?
Speaker 2: Just a little, talked with--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Ralph Bunche more when I visited New York [New York] after coming out of school where I made a beeline to the UN [United Nations] to say here's the guy who was head of my department.  I'm looking for where I'm gonna land and what I'm going to do.  I'm gonna go up and see him.  And I made my way through there and somehow up to him and got through to the secretary general, and there he was and we had a nice talk.  But those were the kind of things I'd brave to do during that period of time.  But it was a nice moment in the history of being in Washington [D.C.].  Never will forget, came home and did some work during the summer, and gained my money and got my few little clothes that I got there, and said geez, I need me a--getting ready to go over to Washington, right.  So going up to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], I wanted me a new topcoat or overcoat, and I bought a nice little gabardine coat.  Got up in Washington, first cold shot up there knocked me out (laughter), shot me down.  I had gone off campus after I asked them, and they didn't have any campus housing for me--so they had the people who had registered with them--and wanted to rent a room or something.  I went down to the house, where I found out from the lady, Carter G. Woodson, the historian, had lived, where he did a lot of his writing; stayed there for a couple of years.
Story_ID: 136598
Speaker 1: --Very interesting.
Speaker 2: --And how did you end up in California?
Speaker 1: That's a long story short, you know.  I came out of college and really after doing undergrad, finishing undergraduate school at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], had decided I was gonna go to Catholic University [Washington, D.C.], was accepted there to do graduate work.  Went back home, and while there, I don't think they had enough school--students going into graduate school at Howard.  Went by to yell at my old people in their offices, and they said look, we got a little money.  Why don't you come on over here--persuaded me not to go to Catholic University, and went to school back at Howard, doing graduate work instead.  So, then I came out and started working.  First work experience going back home was to get myself a job as executive secretary for the Birmingham and Jefferson County Interracial Committee [sic, Birmingham Interracial Committee of the Jefferson County Coordinating Council for Social Forces].  I had gone back to graduate school after finishing undergraduate school and going home, and said to my dad [William Jones], I gotta have a job.  No need of going back in the mines like I'd been doing in between years in school, time to see if I can't move it up a notch.  He went down and did the only thing he knew to do, was to talk to the powers that be who ran the company that he had worked for [Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company], for years before he retired.  The guy said look, well, we've got a job over here driving a truck, delivering groceries from the commissary, said your son can have the job if he want it.  I said thanks, but no thanks.  I'll go back and do graduate work.  I'd wanted to go to law school, had enough money to do a year's work to try to get a master's.  And that's where I wound up doing the graduate work.
Story_ID: 136599
Speaker 1: Came back--you'd asked the question earlier about fraternity, very interesting 'cause it--I was a bit more active in undergraduate school, fraternity-wise, Greek-wise, than I was as a graduate person in graduate chapters, but had gotten to know the first lawyer of color there who was an Alpha [Phi Alpha Fraternity]--gotten to know the head of one of the major insurance company's branches there, Alpha.  Went into a--both were members of the Birmingham-Jefferson County Interracial Committee [sic, Birmingham Interracial Committee of the Jefferson County Coordinating Council for Social Forces] and interestingly enough, were on a committee that was to seek the new executive.  They had boiled down their candidates to two persons, myself and the young lady that had married a young fellow who was from Bessemer [Alabama], but lived in Birmingham [Alabama], who was a social worker.  Logically very well-qualified for the job because the person she would be working for, who were white and who ran the agencies, were primarily a social work-oriented.  Never will forget, I think, the price of being members of that fraternity and maybe being male made a difference with those two members who had some influence on the committee and who wound up with Paul Jones being selected as the executive for the federation committee.  With that, we proceeded to set up, among other things, the first statewide Race Relations Institute on the campus of the all-white Birmingham-Southern College in Birmingham [Alabama], very interesting.  We brought labor people and leaders; we brought in corporate people; we brought in university people from white universities, people from black universities and colleges.  And it was a tremendous moment in the history of it all.  The white chief of police was in the audience.  I remember a reporter asking him, "Chief, isn't this something that might violate the laws, the segregated laws of Birmingham, Alabama?"  He said, "That's exactly why I'm here, to make sure they don't,"--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --person I knew very well, but who sensitively had to walk a tightrope.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: And was this during your work troubleshooting with the U.S. Department of Justice?
Speaker 1: No, that--
Speaker 2: This is--
Speaker 1: --preceded that.
Speaker 2: Preceded that--
Story_ID: 136600
Speaker 1: --And what was that like, the community relations piece that you did?
Speaker 2: Well, went from, went from the accomplishments of the Birmingham-Jefferson County Interracial Committee [sic, Birmingham Interracial Committee of the Jefferson County Coordinating Council for Social Forces] to the tail end of which we had that Race Relations Institute that got publicity.  Then we had our annual meeting, twenty-five white, twenty-five black leaders made up that committee.  And we were sitting in the Episcopal church downtown where the bishop was hosting our annual meeting, in walked a photographer.  My chairman then was from the family that owned Birmingham [Alabama] news--newspaper and radio and TV station.  He took pictures of the chairman sitting at the table with me, then turned and shot both sides of the audience, which was an integrated audience, and walked out.  I said hmm, with him being from the family that owns the paper, he probably sent a photographer over to get a picture of this for the paper.  He said hmm, Paul must have gotten the photographer to come over to document the meeting.  It wasn't until a week later that they got the White Citizens' Council Bulletin.  And there plastered all over the White Citizens' Council Bulletin was this interracial committee with an article that talked about the amalgamation of the races and this Negro, Paul Jones, bent on integration and using the monies that we give to the then community chest, which was the forerunner of United Way, and raised that question so much that it wasn't long before the leaders of the white workers out in the various mines, and mills, and smelting places around Birmingham and other areas began to say to the community chest leaders, if indeed you are going to use these funds to force the integration, we're gonna think seriously about whether we're gonna continue to do check off of our payroll contributions to you to support the cause.  They called me in after having had private meetings without my attending and said they were sorry.  Rather than jeopardize all the other social agencies, we have decided to disband the interracial committee; at that point in my life, probably one of the most disheartening things that could have happened to me.  We had made progress.  We were achieving things, and all of a sudden they yanked the rugs out from under me.  They gave me--
Speaker 1: We'll pause at this time.
Speaker 2: --parting funds.  And I came to the conclusion I would never work for anybody else again, and so we left.
Story_ID: 418055
Speaker 1: So you say you decided at that time that you weren't gonna work for--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --anybody else after--
Speaker 2: --absolutely.
Speaker 1: --that experience.
Speaker 2: I was completely blown out by the lack of their ability.  These were people who were the powers, who were conservative by nature.  But if they pushed a button, things happened, and yet they caved in.  And incidentally, we had been talking social work.  This was shortly after the director of my agency [Birmingham Interracial Committee of the Jefferson County Coordinating Council for Social Forces] and the staff brought me and said, you know, I'm a part of your social work.  We think you're probably the most outstanding social worker of color in the State of Alabama.
Speaker 1: What years are we talking about here?
Speaker 2: Oh, we're talking about the latter part of the '50s [1950s] over to early '60s [1960s].  And so I took the severance pay, went out and decided I was gonna look around and see what I could do for myself, went around looked for a place to open me up a package store--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Story_ID: 418056
Speaker 1: I looked around for property to buy in downtown Bessemer [Alabama], and found on the edges there a building that an elderly black lady owned.  Her family had been very prominent in the undertaking business.  The husband had died, and the son had ran the business and he died, and then the building was.  And said geez, I'd love to buy it, and I--it was up for sale.  And she had another building down in the middle of the block also for sale that they'd accumulated.  And so I went her, and I said I'd like to buy that building.  Well, it was interesting because about that time someone else had come to her.  (Unclear)--wanted to buy it.  While I was offering her asking price for it, she sold to whoever was white.  She said you can have the other two buildings if you'd like to buy 'em.  And I bought the ones in the middle of the block.  And so I went out and applied for an ABC [Alcoholic Beverage Control]; I call it beverage commission license.  The guy came by and we hit if off somehow and away, and waltzed each other around until he approved my license for a package store to sell beer by the case and the carton.  And I didn't have a great deal of cash, so the beer trucks would come by, and I had a--(unclear)--me up (unclear)--make a counter.  I would stack a few cases of this and a few cases of that in there.  And it was off the beaten path just a little, because at that time, Alabama had state stores where the state controlled the liquor.  So on Fridays and Saturdays, folk who were getting paid would make a beeline to the state's liquor store and buy their fifth, a pint, a quart, whatever they gotta drink for that night or the weekend.  It was a ritual almost.  And they'd go next door to the guy who had a package store, get their carton or case or two of beer that they were gonna take home and buy.  So I decided I'd close up my business, not having any help, and drive down near the liquor store.  I'd get out there and this guy would come out.  I said, "Listen, did you know there's a black fellow who's got a package store here in the city?"  He said, "No, I didn't know that."  I said, "Yeah, here's his card.  He's right down there on 21st Street."  He said, "We'll go by there."  So they jumped in their car and head towards the package store instead of going to the one next door, and I'd jump in my car and try and drive twice as fast to beat 'em down there, open the door, and jump behind the counter and say what do you have?  So they got to know where I was.  I built up a business--
Story_ID: 418057
Speaker 1: Pretty soon that other building that I'd wanted that the lady had sold became available, and I was able to buy it.  I went in there and got not only the package store license, but an on-premise license, split the building in half.  And in the back, you go back and sit and drink.  On the counter you could sit and drink, and guy, guys would come in and do that.  Well, people had come home from the war, right, and they could sit around and talk about all the glories of what they had experienced over in Europe or over in Japan.  And so the guys coming by selling beer from the various distributors they'd say to me, "Hey, you wanna try some of this, Asahi from Japan, a Lowenbrau from Europe," and so on.  I said, "I'm not even sure it would sell, plus it costs more per case," and all that.  I said, "Look, let me just try a case this and a case of that."  And I'd talk to those guys who'd been in the service who'd been to Europe, who'd been to Japan, said you know, "I'm getting a Asahi."  "Man, no."  "And I'm getting Lowenbrau, Carlsberg."  "You're kidding."  And they, they'd tell everybody sitting up and down, best beer you've ever tried.  Give me one.  So everybody started buying it.  Then I got bold, and I put about an inch ad, which is all I could afford to pay for in the local Thursday issue of the Birmingham News, which was Bessemer [Alabama] oriented section.  And the little thing said in there, "imported beers, Paul's Package Store."  Well, I get a call from the guys who run the largest department store in Bessemer around the corner.  "Hey brothers," said, "listen, are you sure you got imported beer?"  I said, "Yeah."  "Positive?"  Said, "Yeah."  Said listen, "We close up at six o'clock.  At 6:10 or 6:15 I'll be driving by.  Have me a mixed case of beer, imported, when I come by."  So I didn't have much more than a mixed case of beer there.  I mixed that up for him and threw it together.  Sure enough, on the nose he drove by.  Whipped that case out to him, he paid for it, and that became my regular weekly client.  Well, here comes a big truck by, and here comes this white guy and his wife out.  And they come in, and they stand at the corner of my bar down there and didn't sit down, stood across.  Give us a Bud [Budweiser].  And I popped the top on a couple of Buds down there for 'em, and they guzzled them down.  Meantime, they said be getting us a case of this or a case of that.  Threw the case or two in the truck, took off.  They were house movers.  They were great.  They worked hard.  They moved houses when they were gonna be torn down.  If you had a lot, somebody got 'em, you know, they'd move 'em for them.  Got to know them very well, they were regulars.  Wasn't long before the volume was up, and I was buying more beer.  And paying for it was no problem, so distributors had all this mom and pop guys out in the boonies, and they'd buy three, four, five cases of beer.  Comes Friday night, people would go in there and drink that all up.  They had nowhere to go to buy wholesale again.  These guys said how about you take it on sub-distributorship, and we, we'll ship you off twenty-five cases of this, fifty cases of that, and said we'll tell these guys when they run out they can come down to Paul's Package Store and buy it for a quarter or fifty cents more on the case.  And they cut my price to what they were giving it to me wholesale.  So I made a little money on both ends and became a sub-distributor for all the major beers.  And these guys would come in there eleven, twelve, one [o'clock] at night, if I'm still around, and get beer from me, or the next day on Saturday, getting ready for Saturday night, very interesting times.  I can remember a girl came to me and said, geez, I'd love to have a party in the back there Sunday evening, celebrate my birthday.  Well, we're at Sunday (unclear)--you know, nobody legitimately sold beer on Sunday.  So I went around to the chief of police, said look, I got a problem.  I need to be open Sunday, and I just wanted you to know so that I wouldn't have any problem.  He said fine, no problem.  I said what do you drink anyway, chief?  He told me.  I (unclear)--I put him--I'll put you a case of beer out there at the back steps at your house, dropped him off a case down the beat, never bothered.  We went on with it--birthday celebration, it was an interesting time, but it was a way the small town ran and operated.
Story_ID: 418058
Speaker 1: And you were an entrepreneur--
Speaker 2: Well, I was beginning--
Speaker 1: --of sorts.
Speaker 2: --to try to be a sort of an entrepreneur.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: They thought so anyway.  Very interesting, I never will forget during those days sitting on a porch one summer day, and up drives the commissioner of public safety who was over police and fire, but also worked full-time employment agent for Pullman-Standard Car [Manufacturing] Company, came in.  Name was Thompson [ph.], very interesting.  Sat on the porch and just talked to me.  I couldn't believe it.  He said you know, I just bought not too long ago a lot down at Dawson Avenue--(unclear)--from Mobile [Alabama], in Mobile Bay [Alabama].  He said I've gone down and built a nice cabin, house down there, and said, he said I'm not using it much.  The family's not using it much.  He said anytime you want the key and you wanna go down, let me know and you got it.  I don't know whether he was looking for votes.  It was suddenly becoming (unclear)--increasing the black vote or what, but out of the clear blue it was an interesting relationship that developed from that.
Story_ID: 418059
Speaker 1: Interesting footnote to this is that there was a black Thompson [ph.] from a black family that my sisters had known when they'd gone to school with the girl in the family.  And Thompson worked through the other Thompson at the Pullman-Standard Car [Manufacturing] Company.  Well, the white Thompson would give him five to ten thousand dollars cash every Monday morning.  After payday these guys will have spent all their money, needed money to make it to the next payday.  And at twenty-five cents on the dollar, they were lending him twenty-five, fifty, a hundred bucks.  He'd lay 'em out.  So he was standing there at the payroll place when he came by.  And as they got paid, they'd pay him off.  If they didn't have the money to pay him or needed it, they'd pay him at twenty-five cent interest on the dollar.  For weeks you paid the principal, still owed him a hundred dollars, or fifty dollars, or the twenty-five you borrowed.  He made money that was untaxed.  It was an interesting time in the life of that, but that was not uncommon out at Muscoda [Alabama], where I told you I grew up.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: At payday, I can remember, we talked about sights, sounds amazing to look at, those guys waiting twenty-five, fifty, a hundred yards away for these guys to go up and get paid in case, come down and pay them what they borrowed or what they owed 'em for furniture that they're paying for with interest rates that were astronomical.  Most of the time--most of 'em had very little to take through.  They'd gone to the commissary and spent it all up in food, furniture, whatnot, so it was that kind of a system that we grew up in there.
Story_ID: 418060
Speaker 1: So you went from Alabama to California.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and in between I left doing that, and a judge who I'd known when I was with the Birmingham-Jefferson County Interracial Committee [sic, Birmingham Interracial Committee of the Jefferson County Coordinating Council for Special Forces] had gotten to know me very well, and we talked once or twice about coming to work for him in the courts.  And so he called up, had somebody find me one day and said hey, we've got a vacancy coming up.  Why don't you go down and take the test and said love to have you on my staff.  I went out and took the test, passed it, he hired me, you know, went in as a probation officer and worked with him and transferred kids down to the state reformatory and back.  And one day, after having been there and carving a niche, I had applied to the Alabama Commission on Alcoholism.  A guy down there had fellowships to the Yale School of Alcoholic Studies [sic, Yale Center of Alcohol Studies, later the Center of Alcohol Studies at Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey], and I was awarded one of those fellowships.  I hadn't said much about it to anyone.  And soon the word got out around the courts that the solicitor's, who's white, an attorney, had this fellowship to the Yale School of Alcoholic Studies.  Great (unclear)--going to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], and it was all set.  So finally I stepped up after all of that died down and said me too, I'm going to Yale.  So it wasn't long before I was getting ready to head up to Yale that he found himself busy, had something else that was a conflict and did not want to go to school with Paul Jones, African American.
Story_ID: 418061
Speaker 1: And from there you went--
Speaker 2: Came back to the courts and most interesting thing happened.  The judge called me up once and said look, we've got a (unclear) judge who sits over domestic cases, and solves them for us down there, and said you know, I've got to appoint somebody there while he's out for five or six weeks; said I was thinking about you handling that if you think you can do it.  I said no problem, I'll do it.  So I went over to the chief probation officer, old-timer who'd been there, so he said oh, you don't want that job.  So I took the job anyway, thinking he was trying to discourage me, but had a great time.  I'd read my law books, had a great time with the lawyers who came in representing.  So (unclear)--we handled domestic relations cases, custody matters, and I sort of did a good job with it.  It wasn't long before I was on a fundraising committee with A. G. Gaston, who was an eighth grade educated black multimillionaire who had founded an insurance company [Booker T. Washington Burial Society; Booker T. Washington Insurance Company] and a motel, restaurant, and instrumental in founding, with my help, a savings and loan association [Citizens Federal Savings and Loan Association].  And we're driving out together to this fundraiser at Miles College in Vinesville, Alabama [sic. Fairfield, Alabama].  And coming back, he said you know, I've got that motel and restaurant over there, and said you know, that restaurant's tough on me because everybody expect me to pay the highest salaries because of my money.  And he said I'm not there because I can't do that.  I've got other businesses around, and people think they can take, and that it's rightfully theirs, the management of it, said I gotta do something with it.  So I said, "A. G. look, I could never work for you, but I'd consider leasing the business and running it."  He thought about it, and then said, "Okay, why don't we work on that."  And so for a month I would sit in there and eat or drink just to observe the help, from the waitresses, to the cashiers, to the kitchen.  And so came the day before they were to close down, and I was to take over the next day, he decided to close early and call all of the people together, said we're relinquishing operation and ownership of the restaurant and lounge.  And Paul Jones, he's gonna be the new owner, manager of it, and I said great.  We'll open tomorrow.  And I had talked to those people I wanted, hadn't said anything to the other.  I said we're ready to go to work tomorrow and so and so and so and so and so and so, expect you to be with us.  And I'd hired a few other people that I liked from the outside.  Well, word had come down to me from all the businessmen in town, when they heard I was going to be going into business and doing business with a Gaston.  Don't do it.  He said we've all been in business ventures with him, and he always wins, said he doesn't give any quarter.  He always takes advantage, and said you can't beat him, but I went on into the business anyway.  Day I--before I got started, here it is lieutenant came over and said look, you're getting ready to go into business.  If you need to borrow some money, we'll lend it to you.  I said thanks.  If I need it, I'll let you know.  So, I struck a contract with him that said look, I'll pay you a percentage of gross, which meant I didn't have to pay anything up front, only after the first month did I pay him a percentage of the month's receipts.  He had staff there, utilities were already on, and just switched, and then some food was there 'cause he had started on.  And I then decided I'd take all the old menus that said A. G. Gaston's Restaurant and have 'em reprinted with using just Paul's, apostrophe "s", A. G. Gaston Restaurant, and the sign remained the same.  So I called up downtown to the suppliers and said look, Paul is out at A. G. Gaston Restaurant, need a hundred chickens, seventy-five steaks, so much of this, so much of that.  Said fine, Mr. Gaston.  I never corrected him.  They sent 'em down.  I said bill me at the end of the month, and I'll get to you by the tenth.  So I didn't pay a thing to get stocked to begin with; opened my business with zero cash down.  Went in there and the little person who'd been calling me saying don't go into business, those who'd been boycotting him, came in, and hadn't been there before.  And so it was from the day one, jam, word had gone out it's Paul's.  We're going down to Paul's to keep you from failing.  It was a David and Goliath story to them.  And I'd go in there with a menu, and we'd play with it every day, and you know, I go on and we'd--everybody in there, you know, had come out of the country or migrate to the city or knew about it.  So we'd have, instead of just chitterlings on the menu, which they never would have under the old regime, I'd say Perry County chitterlings.  They loved the accent on that.  And we'd do the same with other things, you know, so we went through that, and they loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 418062
Speaker 1: And the beauty of being in that kind of business was that with thirty-some employees I was always on hand.  People would come in with folk from out of town, relatives of friends or business associates.  They wanted to be greeted.  You knew them by name.  You'd say to the girl or waitress or hostess, see that they get a good seat.  Ten minutes later you'd go by, pat 'em on the back, call him by his name, see if everything's all right.  If it was, great; if it wasn't, you saw that it was, kept people coming back to you.  That was the way it went.  As quickly as that happened, I got a called year or two later from the chief probation officer in the federal district court in Birmingham [Alabama].  I had been lobbying him for years back when I was with the Interracial Committee [Birmingham Interracial Committee of the Jefferson County Coordinating Council for Social Forces], in fact, saying when are you gonna integrate your staff?  When are you gonna hire me?  He said you know I can't hire you.  I'd do it in a minute, but you, you'd have to have an intecated [ph.]--grated case load, can't do that here now.  Maybe one day it'll come.  So he called me up one day to come down and see him.  I said maybe they're putting pressure on him from Washington [D.C.], from the attorney general's office or somewhere to do something.  [John F.] Kennedy is coming into power.  You know, I said maybe it's a new day.  Got down there and he said look, my counterpart in San Francisco [California] was chief probation officer in the federal court, Northern District of California, called me.  They'd been friends at the national meetings in Utah.  He said "Look, I'm getting ready to add a black (unclear)--(unclear), and a vacancy I've got here on my staff; said I was wondering if you knew anybody down there who might be a good well-trained person to get along with?"  Obviously he's thinking getting a black from the South might have been a mudda--much better dip than grabbing one of those out of the [San Francisco] Bay area.  He said I'll look into it.  I've got somebody who might be in--so he said if you're interested, I'll call Al Wall [ph.] back and let him know.  I said I'll go out and interview and talk with him.  Sure enough, went out.  His supervisor and deputy chief and all was interviewed.  And they said, "Can you be back in two weeks?"  I said, "I got a business back there.  I can't be back in two weeks unless I'm gonna go back later to, to close it up and wind it down."  He said, "Just take another week and take three weeks, and come on back and start work."  I came back and announced just as quickly to [Arthur George A.G.] Gaston and company that I was giving up the business.  And in three weeks I was back in San Francisco, out in California working, great opportunity to establish a whole new network of people.  Al Wall and I, the chief of--(unclear) take a few of the staff down to the German restaurant where you go down for lunch.  You know, we'd go somewhere.  I said we'd all go down there and eat our sauerkraut, whatnot.  Al and I got to be very good friends.  I'd hang with him more in political things than some of the others would.  He liked that.  I'd go out to the first day of baseball when the [San Francisco] Giants had moved to San Francisco.  He was there.  So these were the kinds of things that made an impression on Al Wall.  And he sat with me and said how much he had learned from a person of color, from a person who was a Negro, a person who was black.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I said, Al, I've learned a lot from you.
Story_ID: 418063
Speaker 1: And from there did you go on to HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]?
Speaker 2: Worked there [in San Francisco, California] until a team came through touring the country after legislation had created the Model Cities Program, very interesting time.  Here we got a program designed to take our inner cities and take an infusion of money from all the major departments of the federal government, use them and fuse them with local resources, and began to make a significant change.  Nothing had made much of a dent in it up to that point.  And I listened to them as the assistant secretary from HUD led that team around, and afterwards said to them, you know, I might be interested in it, and here's my resume.  They got back to Washington [D.C.].  Wasn't long before one of the guys got on the horn and said, "Hey, you got the job with us if you'll answer me one question."  I said, "What's that?"  He said, "What guy in his right mind would leave San Francisco [California] or any job anywhere?"  I said, "You're right, it's a hard call, but I'll take the job."  So before long I was flying into Washington.  I hit the ground one day.  They said look, we've got a team all-white down in Alabama, in Selma [Alabama], said we need an interracial presence down there.  And take the next plane flying tomorrow, and go on down to Selma and join them, and we'll let 'em know.  Well, these guys are down there, and I fly into Selma, and all of a sudden no team meeting.  I didn't know what to do, where to go, so I go over to the sheriff's office.  This is where Sheriff Jim Clark, the Clark who gained a great deal of recognition and infamy when he with the horses that he led blocked the marches over the [Edmund] Pettus Bridge, was in the sheriff's office.  I had met him years back when I ran the restaurant.  When he came I said look, George Wallace needs some support in his race for governor, and we need all of the black support we can get in votes.  But it's difficult for him to go out publicly and court it.  He'll lose more white votes than he'll gain black vote.  But he said I can assure you as the representative of the governor you'll have access to the governor's office if he wins.  So we had gotten to know each other, sitting there in the restaurant talking to each other.  So I went down to see him, not knowing that following the bridge incident he had said I never wanna talk to another fed in my life.  So I said, as I walked in his office, I want to see Sheriff Clark.  They said he's up in the probate judge's office.  They pointed out his office up on the fifth floor, told him I was coming up.  Got up there, and here's the probate judge and here's the sheriff, Jim Clark, sitting there.  He introduced me to the probate judge.  I sat with them, and they are in the process of explaining to me what happened when they were double-crossed they said about the Pettus Bridge incident and the march.  And they said it all came about because the then head of the community relations service working out the White House, having been nominated and appointed by the president [Lyndon Baines Johnson], who was a former Florida governor, [Thomas] LeRoy Collins, had come down and talked with them, and they had agreed on a route and strategy.  Then came SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] in there with Stokely Carmichael and company and others and then SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], and he said they were pressuring him.  And they changed their mind and developed a different strategy that he acquiesced to, that they were not privy to.  And so as a result of that, came the march, which was not to been in the original plan and thus their attempt to thwart the march and thus the famous Selma day.
Story_ID: 418064
Speaker 1: It was an interesting time because they concluded, had Paul Jones come down there instead of [Thomas] LeRoy Collins, the Selma [Alabama] story would have had a different ending to it.  And so we sat there and the phone rang, and it was Pat Stew [ph.] from the sheriff's office, and it was the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] on the phone looking for Jim Clark, the sheriff.  And they said to him, "Jim, we're looking for Negro Paul Jones, who was supposed to have flown in today and joined his colleagues over in Greensboro, Alabama, and said he hadn't show up.  And we're wondering whether you know anything about him, seen him, or whether you know if anything has happened to him."  He said, "He's sitting right here with me."  So he got the word back to them, and they beat a path over to Selma.  Well, as I tell you, Jim Clark and the feds had said we ain't speaking to each other.  He wouldn't see them.  So, they came over, and from then on as we worked Selma and region, I became the liaison between the federal team and the sheriff's office and the powers that be.  And so I'd take messages from them over to him and him over to them.  And that night I--first night I decided I'd stay where these other guys are staying over at the Holiday Inn, and up to that point had not been integrated; went over and registered, had no problem.  Jim Clark is the sheriff--their team somewhere milling about on the grounds outside sure to make sure everything's all right and that nothing went wrong.  And so I integrated the Holiday Inn there in Selma, very interesting.  It was Jim later who said to me, said look, when you get a break, you know, I got a five hundred-acre farm out here, said come on out and we'll go hunting.  Well, I thanked him, never did take him up on going hunting out at the farm, but I was there when we brought in federal registrars to register Negroes, blacks.  And the population was heavy.  There was a county commissioner over public safety there, police chief, so to speak, named Wilson [Baker].  And he then decided to run for sheriff and challenge Jim Clark.  Though the blacks getting registered say, "Hey, we'll vote for you; we'll support you."  Sure enough, on the eve of that I was in there the election day.  Jim Clark, who was slated as an officer of the National Sheriffs' Association, to become the new chair of the sheriffs' association nationally, got defeated.  And that led to his demise there.  And Wilson, who was a little bit more moderate, got to be the new sheriff.  I had gone into the mayor's office.  A man named [Joseph] Smitherman stayed in there as mayor for years during that period and later with black support for a long time shifted gears (unclear), but was a staunch believer in segregation.  When I walked into his office to see him, didn't mind saying it; felt comfortable he had the vote base that would secure him in office, and it did.  And so that's where we went with that.  And so, pretty soon, as I left community relations service, was getting ready to leave, the attorney general gave me one of the first Sustained Superior Performance Awards that they'd ever given it for my conciliation there in Selma and in Watts [California], where I went for the attorney general to solve the problem out there when there was a collision course between police and the Watts Community Alert Patrol that was monitoring the police.  He'd been given a thousand tickets.  I rode with him at night to see what they were doing.  Police stopped somebody they'd jump out of their car and start snapping pictures of the police.  The police turn around and give them a ticket for illegal parking.  I got to know police sergeant there very well, who introduced me to the chairman of the Los Angeles Police Commission [Los Angeles, California].
Story_ID: 418065
Speaker 1: Are there other awards, or honors, distinctions that you'd received up to this date that you'd like to share with us?
Speaker 2: Well, that was one.  One that I got that's most recent has been award from the Brandywine Print Workshop [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], one of the oldest and most prestigious of black art, fine art print workshops.  Each year in the fall, in October, they have their annual black tie fundraiser.  Last year they went into the Kimmel Center [for the Performing Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], new center for the arts, performing and otherwise, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and gave me the Van Der Zee Award, named after the famed chronicler [James Van Der Zee] of things in Harlem [New York, New York], as a photographer.  And I got the Van Der Zee Award for lifetime contribution to the arts.  They announced at that ceremony that for the first time in their thirty-year history they were going to give $350,000 worth of their prints to the Paul [R.] Jones Collection to go to the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware], where I am now, donating several million dollars worth of art, and where that university is now, taking an old building that's on the historic register, spending five million dollars to make it museum ready.  I'm literally giving them the art--
Story_ID: 136612
Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Observing is Janelle Jennings.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: I'm Paul Jones of the Paul Jones Collection, infamous in its own right, known for having been touted by arts and antiques as one of the top one hundred collections of art in the country.  Most people know me for the art and know very little about the career that I've had in political appointments, government, professional and, and a number of other things.  And being with The HistoryMakers gives us a chance to show you both sides of that coin.
Speaker 1: Okay, we are finishing up an interview that we started about a year and a half ago I guess.
Speaker 2: A little over a year ago, I know.
Speaker 1: A little over a year ago.  And sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date?  Today is June the 24th, and the year is 2005 [June 24, 2005].
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at my home in Atlanta, Georgia, at 1331 Cascade Falls Drive, and that's Atlanta, 30311.
Story_ID: 136613
Speaker 1: Now, all right, so we're gonna resume where we left off, and that we, we had you with CREEP [Committee to Re-Elect the President].  And tell us how you got with the prestigious CREEP organization in 1972.
Speaker 2: And I think, you know, we need to spell out what CREEP stands for.  CREEP became that acronym for the Committee to Re-Elect the President, which really sort of narrowed it down or represented the committee for re-election of [President] Richard Nixon, who had won.  And as his first term was nearing an end, decided to run again for re-election.  And he established a committee and aptly named it Committee to Re-Elect the President.  Well, with that and all the activities that surrounded that presidential run that year and then the ensuing Watergate incidents and the activities and publicity that followed that, the name CREEP became very popular and was thrown around by the news media all over the country.
Story_ID: 136614
Speaker 1: All right, so, before you got involved in CREEP [Committee to Re-Elect the President], you were with--you were the--a Peace Corps director in Thailand, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, I was--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --stationed in Bangkok [Thailand].  We had at that time probably the largest contingent of Peace Corps volunteers than any country in the world out of over sixty nations at that time that had Peace Corps volunteers in Peace Corps programs.  And I had studied the pe--the Thai while in Washington [D.C.], then went on my way to Thailand and stopped at the University of Hawaii's language school in Hilo [Hawaii] and studied a little more.  So when I hit the ground I knew enough Thai to be able to converse with the Thais, and it amazingly made a difference with the Thai people that someone had taken time to learn their language when most of the Westerners they had seen that came over from the United States or from Europe, you know, generally did not do that.  And they expected to take--you know English.  On the contrary too, to the contrary, you found that the Thai wanted to speak English because they thought that helped give them some kind of a ticket to some (unclear), some development, some job opportunities, and maybe some way out.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any, any Thai that you could--
Speaker 2: [Speaking in Thai].
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: [Speaking in Thai].
Speaker 1: Good, thank you.  So, how did you come to leave that position to come back to the U.S.?
Speaker 2: Well, I was there as deputy director of the Peace Corps program as a part of the U.S. Embassy team in Thailand.  And the director's term was up, and I was interested in ascending to the directorship, which I thought I logically should have and deserved.  And I found out from sources in Washington that they were considering sending over someone else as director of that program.  So I had a trip back to Washington to lobby for that position, found they had an astronaut that had just come down from Albany [New York], and apparently nobody wanted him in Washington, but felt as a result of what had been done, they needed to reward him with something.  And they came up with the bright idea that they could send him over as director of the Peace Corps program, and that they had enough professional staff over there to run the program so that he wouldn't really be much of an interferer with programs that they had developed.
Speaker 1: Which one was it, the--can you tell us?
Speaker 2: Can't remember who it was.  I would have to do a little bit of research to find out--
Speaker 1: It was [John] Glenn, was it, was--
Speaker 2: --which one it was.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: But they wanted him about twelve thousand miles away from Washington (laughter)--(unclear)--but how he landed there.  But I came back to lobby for that position.  And in touching base with the (unclear) contacts that I had at the White House, had a special assistant to the president who is in the community then political affairs said that they had meeting in preparation of a re-election effort with the president [Richard Nixon] and decided as a group policy-wise that they would pursue some of the black vote and would not just simply yield black vote as in past elections to the Democrats without some fight.  And so they created a top level position, director of the black vote division nationally, and were interviewing candidates for that when I got back to Washington.  Well, long story made short is they were saying that everybody they interviewed on the way up the ladder had made friends and had made enemies, and so somebody would always lead to them.  I'd been out of the country, so they said why don't I go over and interview for the job?  I said well, I'm really not interested going back overseas.  But my friend who worked at the White House persuaded me to go over and interview so that at least it appeared that he was--at least having sending some candidates over for serious consideration.  I went diagonally across the street from the White House and the Executive Office Building of the White House to the headquarters for the Committee to Re-Elect the President.  The other (unclear)-[Clark] MacGregor and others where they had just setting up shop, and they interviewed me for a better part of a day.  And when I was about to leave, said that, that--they huddled, they'd love for me to do one more thing.  I said what's that?  They said go over to the Justice Department [U.S. Department of Justice] for an interview, a meeting with the attorney general, then John Mitchell.  Apparently John Mitchell was running the Committee to Re-Elect the President out of his here pocket before he had resigned as attorney general to take on full time directorship of the Committee to Re-Elect.  And so they sent a limousine around, picked me up, ran me over to the Justice Department.  I sat there along with the attorney general thirty or forty minutes.  Then he picked up the phone as we had wrapped up our conversation and said get him back from Thailand.  This is our man.  So I didn't know what I was coming back to, exactly what would be what and all the other things.  But before I knew it I was back over there, and they had (unclear)--(unclear)--to the embassy and to the Peace Corps program to get me back.  I was packed up and shuttled back in through Paris [France] and back into the United States in short order; got in and set up off and began to recruit and get my staff.
Story_ID: 136615
Speaker 1: A week later they moved in someone into an empty office next to me as they began recruiting others.  And the person they moved in next to me became known to the American scene as G. Gordon Liddy.  And--
Speaker 2: Now what was he like?  I mean did you get a chance to know him at all?
Speaker 1: We got a chance to meet each other and be cordial to each other in coming and going, but very quiet and secretive and, and away a lot, planning, plotting, and caring about his mission, and came in as the man who was to pull off some things, and apparently got in and hit the ground running to do just that, and later, of course, as you know, was involved in the Watergate break-in.
Speaker 2: That's right, I wanna ask you--I don't wanna get this out of sequence, but--
Speaker 1: It's okay.
Speaker 2: --I wanna ask you when you first heard about this, what you thought.  I mean what you thought was going on when you heard about that Watergate break-in?
Speaker 1: My first thoughts were that whatever they were doing to try to ensure re-election of the president [Richard Nixon] appeared to be unnecessary because every reading I could get on the Democratic candidate, who was George McGovern, was that their camp was in such a disarray that the Democratic Party and its fight over who would get the nomination had become so split that it would be impossible for him to, to win the election.  So it would be unnecessary to really go out of their way to do anything that smacked of being illegal, such as breaking into Watergate.  One of the other men who was involved in that was James McCord, who I'd gotten to know as head of security for the Committee to Re-Elect the President.  I liked Jim McCord, had a good relationship with him and wondered how he got drawn into that.  The other were, of course, good people that had been brought up from Miami [Florida] that had been in the clandestine affairs with these people before.  And apparently they had been involved with--from the Cuban community with some of the efforts to get back into Cuba that had been aborted.  And so they were part of those who were arrested.  And the rest of course is history that led later to the after the successful campaign that we ran in the president getting re-elected to the, the now famous Watergate hearings.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 136616
Speaker 1: Let's see, I--so did you--what did you think about--George McGovern was described at one time as the most honest man in the [U.S.] Senate.  You know, I think one of the Kennedys said that about him.
Speaker 2: I personally had absolutely no problem with McGovern as a person.  He'd been in the Senate, had to some extent distinguished himself as being on what people would always call the right side of some of the questions, sometimes against odds.  What did happen--I'll give you a good example of that--was that delegation split over who to support at that time.  And Illinois, where you're from, is a good example of that.  The governor had taken his support and the delegates in support of someone else. [HM] Jesse Jackson had a group of delegates committed to them and was support of McGovern.  They helped in swinging the delegates from other places to McGovern, and McGovern got the nomination.  When McGovern started campaigning and went into Illinois, which he considered a key state, he made a beeline initially straight to the mayor's office.  And this didn't set well with Jackson, who had been supportive of him, and seeing him go into the mayor and courting him for his support, as he had been an, an opposition person before--led Jackson to get in touch with someone who later contacted the White House and the Committee to Re-Elect [the President].  They called me over to the White House to say they got word that Jesse Jackson had admitted that he might consider supporting [Richard] Nixon, the Republican, for president.  I said at that point in that meeting that I didn't think it was necessary, that it was needed, that we already had the election pretty well wrapped up--(unclear)--a special assistant who I worked very closely with to the president, had said let's go out there.  So, over my mild objections, we both flew to Chicago [Illinois] and to Jackson's home, sat there with him and discussed a proposition.  It boiled down to him saying look, we've got [Operation] PUSH [People United to Save Humanity], a nonprofit.  We can get certain grants for PUSH and other things.  We'll consider being more negative toward McGovern and maybe more pro things that are surrounding Nixon.  And we went back to that and, of course, I ran into a copy of the paper I had from that.  And I had written to the higher up saying I didn't think we needed him make that kind of commitment at that time.  But that was the kind of thing that surrounded the McGovern camp.  It was another interesting aspect to that, and that was that the highest black in the McGovern camp was a fellow who I had known his family in--from Montgomery, Alabama.  And being an Alabaman myself from Bessemer, Alabama, I had gone my first two years of college on athletic and academic scholarship to Alabama State [Teachers] College, which is now Alabama State University [Montgomery, Alabama], and his name was Martin.  And he seemed to sense--
Speaker 1: Louis Martin, was that, was that Louis--
Speaker 2: No, Louis Martin out--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, that's--
Speaker 2: --of Chicago with the Democrats.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Lou--this is two different--
Speaker 1: This, this is another Martin.
Speaker 2: --two, two different Martins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no relations.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: It's all right.  But he said let's stay (unclear) again.  Let's stay in touch with each.  You get elected, your man get elected, you can look out for me.  If my man get elected, we'll, we'll do the same for you.  At any rate, we kept some contact.  And I sensed he must have had a sixth sense that said just maybe McGovern wasn't going to win, while he did everything I'm sure to, to help elect him or get him elected.  And I had even another call from a fellow in Tampa, Florida, who I had known for years, used to work years ago for one of the earlier black magazines nationally, colored magazines, In Our World, would call me.  He was in the McGovern camp.  He'd give me A, B, C, and D of what was going on in terms of strategies and whatnot, sensing I think also that while he was in the McGovern camp and accepted it would be taken care of if they want, that they would lose, and that he wanted to hedge his bets.  And I can remember the last contacts I had with him from the Democratic National Convention.  And when they were going in there, he'd call me, give me some of the lay of the land from that.  So those were the kinds of relationships during those days (unclear).
Story_ID: 136617
Speaker 1: One of the other things that was interesting before we leave this era is that at that time we'd had a number of blacks who'd risen to the level of what we call militancy.  And we looked at them, and being that way they'd take strong stands, they were outspoken.  They were quoted in the press and the media a good bit.  And so many of them made contact with me and some of my lieutenants at the Committee to Re-Elect [the President], to say look, we have to see what we can do to be a part of a team to get selected to the (unclear) where politically, the strongest of advocates and civil rights activities of the world when it came to looking at politics.  I had contacts from the law firm group in Atlanta [Georgia].  And one of the members later went on to be a mayor of Atlanta, and they were saying then we'd love to get in on being active in supporting the candidacy of the president for re-election, and--
Speaker 2: It sounds like, it sounds like opportunism or--
Speaker 1: Well, the, the, the politics is a game of opportunism.  You wanna get with a winner.  You wanna see someone elected.  How else to you get appointments, grants, legislation introduced that favors you and your group?  That way, and it isn't opportunism in a negative way all the time.  But it's access to the decision makers.  I have always been an advocate that blacks needed to have enough support of Republicans and Democrats so that whoever got in the White House, someone of color had access to it to be able to get that in, to be able to get some things done, to be able to get some activity and support of the agenda.
Story_ID: 136618
Speaker 1: So, in terms of this, in terms of all this political pragmatism, was--did [HM] Jesse Jackson ever get anything for, for [Operation] PUSH [People United to Save Humanity], I mean, since he offered 'em up, would--
Speaker 2: Not, not as far as I know and certainly not through channels that I had anything to do with.  We did go back to a PUSH affair that was touted as having representatives from both major party camp had to speak and--
Speaker 1: Oh, the [Black] Expo [Black Business Exposition] or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Something of that sort, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then there was a big, big, big political national black political convention here for the first time in Gary [Indiana].  And at that time they had a black mayor, and when--
Speaker 1: [HM Richard] Hatcher, mayor--
Speaker 2: --went to that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right, Hatcher was the mayor.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that--and people from all over the country--
Speaker 2: Came from all over.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they formed a national--
Speaker 2: They did indeed.
Speaker 1: National Black Political Assembly.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I think, yeah, it was called the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --National Black Political Assembly--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --which was formed there, right, in Gary in '72 [1972], right, right.
Speaker 2: Right on target.
Speaker 1: Right.  Yeah, yeah, well, these are times, these were some in, some interesting times politically in terms of how--
Speaker 2: Tremendously interesting.  One of the most interesting things that I think history needs to record is that when I went in and said to them it's gonna be impossible to convert a large number of black folks that represent a number of votes to Republicanism in the short period of time without a number of things having been done to prove they--(unclear)--worry of their support.  I said what you can expect is some success with the kind of campaign I purport to run, and that is to go after black Democrats in support of [Richard] Nixon, black Republicans in support of Nixon, and black Independents.  Why?  Because there were people who were just beginning to try to get businesses started; there were people who were looking for assistance from SBA, the Small Business Administration; there were people who were interested in the program that was just being set up by the Republican Administration of [Small Business Administration Section] 8(a) [Program] set aside contracts that awarded them without competition to minorities and females.  And these persons were pragmatic politicians of business persons and would support, and we did attract a number of them.  And that was the only way we were able to make some increase in the percentage of votes that they got.
Story_ID: 136619
Speaker 1: Another one of the things I said early on to the team around me that I assembled was that two things really matter in politics: money and votes.  And I said that in the past, too often those persons who were black and managed to get a foot in the door with the camps, nationally when someone is running for president would say for so much money or for this or that or a job, I can deliver votes.  But some of them couldn't even deliver anything other than their own vote.  But, at the end of all of that, they could turn to the powers that be, and they could say, look, we don't owe you anything; we paid you.  So I'm saying if you can deliver money and votes, or money and votes, or money or votes, that you stand in a strong position then once your candidate is elected.  And so, despite the need to really raise money with the Committee to Re-Elect [the President], we went out to bring in about three thousand people, Democrats, Independents, Republicans, from all over the country.  And they came in, beautiful set of people, and we spent a weekend in Washington [D.C.] in workshops on what to do and what not to do, and then culminated with a major Saturday night black tie dinner affair, cartel and dinner at the Washington [D.C.] Hilton.
Speaker 2: Now what was this called?  What was this event called?
Speaker 1: The National Black Committee to Re-Elect the President.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And what was so great about that was that I sought to get a cabinet officer and a sub-cabinet officer, secretary, assistant secretary, deputy secretary on each one of the tables so that blacks would have somebody in a position of power that they could create--relate--to.  And it worked out very well, well-covered, and we raised money, and we got contributions from around the country.  So in addition to this being probably the committee's re-election at that time to raise more money for a presidential campaign than had ever been raised before in the history of presidential elections in this country, but we raised money, gave money to the committee, and we increased the vote.  As a result of that, I developed with my team what was called a policy of parity to understand what needs to be made up by the Republicans, if indeed they were gonna continue on a track to try to gain more end roads with the black vote, and left that there.  But I, I backed off after the election.  We set up some machinery so that this group could stay inactive, and then I took an appointment and came down to Washington--I mean from Washington to Atlanta [Georgia] as regional director of one of the federal agency's action, which umbrellaed all of the volunteer agencies, the Peace Corps, VISTA [Volunteers in Service to America], senior old American programs of ACE, Active Corps of Executive, to SCORE, Service Corps of Retired Executives, to senior citizens' program like the Foster Grandparents, and they worked with children all over.  So these were the kinds of things we did--
Story_ID: 136620
Speaker 1: Now, now, I had a couple of questions, but the first one was why--what went wrong with [George] McGovern's candidacy do, do you think?  I mean, I could say--I mean I, I can see the blacks could see he was gonna lose, but that, that meant basically that a whole lot of white people were not gonna vote for him.  And what do you--what, what did you see as the major reason for--
Speaker 2: You have got to recognize that you were at the beginning of seeing what became very popularly known as a Southern strategy evolving, where historically in this country Democrats in any national elections started out with a solid corps of Southern states' electoral votes in their pockets, in the bag.  You were beginning to see that crack.  You were beginning to see the solid South no longer so solid.  You saw in McGovern a candidate, who, by very virtue of what you've described and I've talked about, about McGovern, didn't sit well with Southern politicians.  Put that combination together and you're looking at good, nice, clean McGovern who wasn't in my opinion the strongest candidate, and failed to surround himself with the election chairman and officials that were--had that strength necessary to run a campaign that could attract some of that South back and could involve a base of holding the black vote together.  So that in itself sort of killed him off--good man, solid man, might have been very good for the country, but you are, in politics, no better than the people you surround yourself with.  And that is what I think part of that downfall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 136621
Speaker 1: And the other thing is that there's a, there are a number of high profile African Americans that, that were in support of [Richard] Nixon I remember in those days, Charles Hurst of Malcolm X [Community] College in Chicago [Illinois] and--
Speaker 2: That was all a part of the--
Speaker 1: --Betty Shabazz and--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: --Sammy Davis, Jr.
Speaker 2: It was amazing that you remember all of that.  You, you're a good student of, of the history of presidential politics of that era.  Anyway, I remember coming out to Malcolm X College in Chicago where Charles Hurst was then the president, had a tremendously interesting moment because he jumped on board with us and early, and not only that, was instrumental in bring Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow, down to us, and she joined in with the support group and would (unclear) most of the affairs there.
Speaker 1: Sammy Davis, Jr. was one--
Speaker 2: Sammy Davis, Jr.--
Speaker 1: --was very--
Speaker 2: --I went out on a trip to his home in Hollywood Hills out in California, and--(unclear)--and his wife, Altovise [Davis], and it wasn't long before we had brought Sammy in.  And the most famous thing that took place after he'd come in--and we were running people through every week endorsing.  The most interesting thing that occurred in Sammy's situation was that they brought Sammy in to be a part of the delegation that met Nixon when he flew into Miami [Florida] after the [Republican National] Convention started in Miami Beach [Florida], and then they helicoptered him over from the airport to the Miami Beach side.  There the newspapers and the wire services picked up a picture of Sammy Davis, Jr.  Nixon's up here, Sammy's down here, reaching around with hand around Nixon's waist hugging him and welcoming him to the beach.  Well, that hit the front pages of papers all over the country.  After the election, I remember very well Sammy trying to fulfill an engagement in Chicago, went in there and they picketed him and boycotted him.  He got on stage with tears in his eyes and said never again.  I'll never do it again.  I've had enough.  But I was escorting him, and I (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You had people like James Brown that came in.  When James was in his prime I never would forget James owned about five or six radio stations at that time.  Today I don't think he owns one station.  But his things were in trouble; they were in disarray.  Whoever was running them was siphoning the money off.  They weren't paying the taxes.  He had a tax problem with the government.  He said here, here's a man who's the president, and he may get re-elected.  If I lend my support to him, maybe, you know, just maybe they will understand my tax situation, and we can solve some of the problems.  You see, these are the practical aspects of things that draw people to politics or to a politician.
Story_ID: 136622
Speaker 1: We were saying before, there are a lot, there, there are a lot, there's a lot of high profile support for, for [Richard] Nixon in '72 [1972].  But it was--the substance of it is that Nixon was willing to make deals and to kick down some benefits to people in the black community for the, for that support--
Speaker 2: Let me, let me put it to you a different way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know historically how much support blacks have given to the Republican candidates in recent elections.  It's been very little, right?  For the percentage that Nixon got from black support in his first successful run for the presidency, it is amazing his number of appointments to blacks, the number of grants and contracts that went to blacks, and the number of loans that went out for those who wanted SBA [Small Business Administration] loans to get businesses started.  So proportionately, you know, they saw things coming down.  One of the key things, whatever else is said about that Nixon Administration that was set up, was set up under a man named Maurice Stans, who became secretary of commerce, pretty good man as I got to know him.  But they set up the Minority Business Development Agency called MBDA, headed at first by a black, [Abraham] Abe Venable, who later came to Detroit [Michigan] to work for General Motors.  But they was there and were giving grants out all over the country to assist minorities with their businesses, to strengthen them or to get into business and to be successful.  So this was an interesting era that has not been duplicated in years since by any candidate of any party, however many votes they've gotten or a percentage of the votes they've gotten from the black electorate.
Story_ID: 136623
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember the Model Cities Program kind of morphed into revenue sharing and where the cities are getting the money, the CETA [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, signed by Richard Nixon in 1973] program.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: CETA was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Model Cities Program really--
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: --came in, as far as I can remember, on the tail end of a Democratic--
Speaker 1: Right, right, a da--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --administration.
Speaker 1: --right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, I was around and helped develop some of the (unclear) for citizen participation for that program.  It was a demonstration program, and cities had to submit major applications on what would be done if they were successful in getting this infusion of resources.  And the resources were coming not just from HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development], that umbrella'd the Model Cities Program, but from all the federal agencies.  It was [U.S. Department of] Transportation, some of the other, Labor Department [U.S. Department of Labor] and others.  So, this was an interesting time.  They rushed that through after the election and the Republicans had run, to try to get some of those first cities picked so the program would be in motion before the Republican came, since the Republicans had not been strong supporters of that program in [U.S.] Congress.  And so they did, they made that first round pick of cities.  One of those cities was Charlotte, North Carolina.  And I had worked with HUD in the regional office down here as citizen participation adviser, and was on loan to Washington [D.C.] to help develop the citizen participation component nationally.  And then after we reviewed those programs and Charlotte was a successful one, went up and gave them technical assistance to get their program going because the model neighborhood residence were about to stymie that program if they didn't get the kind of concessions from the city administration at that time where they had a fairly strong city manager form of government and a fairly week mayor program.  So after going up and helping him in resolving that successfully, they turned to me and said what about you coming up here and serving as director of the Model Cities Program in Charlotte and said we'll match whatever you're making in the federal government.  We went back and forth, and I did leave the feds and, and headed up the first Model Cities Program in Charlotte.  It was one of the first then doing the planning period.  We got a planning grant to submit our proposals.  And it was considered one of the best that they got from the entire country, and it was one of the earliest ones that we funded with an infusion in there from a variety of agencies.  And it triggered what is now been that re--at that time urban renewal, with the renewal of downtown Charlotte.  Two of my best corporate supporters at that time was a bank called NCNB [North Carolina National Bank] and one that was First Union, both still in Charlotte.  One now Bank of America, one of the leading banks in the country.  The other Wachovia, where First Union had merged into it, although First Union was the dominant one.  They would give me loaned executives, a slew of vice presidents they had to work on components of the Model Cities Program.  I used their dining room when I'd bring in my national Model Cities directors board, having been elected national president of the Model Cities Directors Association.  And they would, would wine and dine and hold our meetings there.  So there were real corporate supporters of what we did, and I feel real strongly that what I did there then helped kick off some of that expansion and growth of Charlotte, being the dominant city between Atlanta [Georgia] and Washington on the East Coast.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's something--
Story_ID: 136624
Speaker 1: Now, so how long were you, were you with Model Cities--
Speaker 2: I was there with the--so about a year with the Model Cities Program and, and the feds.
Speaker 1: And this is about '74 [1974]--this, is this '73 [1973], '74 [1974], or I guess--
Speaker 2: I'm thinking that had to precede the president election, which wouldn't have been in '74 [1974].  There were a '72 [1972] election and a '76 [1976] election--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and ran every four years--one of the other.  I'm not sure which, but I'd do some homework and research--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So it was before '76 [1976] election.  It was, it was before '76 [1976], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: What, was [Gerald] Ford president by, by, by that time?  Was, was Gerald Ford the president by that time or--
Speaker 2: See, Gerald never ran and, and won.
Speaker 1: Oh, I know, but he became the president--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he became president--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --after [Richard] Nixon had--
Speaker 2: --after Nixon--
Speaker 1: --had to resign in '74 [1974], yeah, yeah.  So, I just wondered if it was during--
Speaker 2: But, but Model Cities came in under a Democrat.
Speaker 1: Yeah, un- under LBJ [Lyndon Baines Johnson], yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah, about ten years earlier, right, right.  So, I'm just trying to figure out like, so, so you were there up until--were you there until '76 [1976] or what?
Speaker 2: There in, in--
Speaker 1: In Charlotte [North Carolina].
Speaker 2: --in Charlotte?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, I left, I left Charlotte [North Carolina] literally--I went to Charlotte late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so we're talking about--
Speaker 2: I left HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]--
Speaker 1: Oh, we're jumped out of, out of sequence.
Speaker 2: I left HUD as, as they, as they revved up the program.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I--
Speaker 2: Got me?
Speaker 1: --we're speaking out of sequence then, 'cause I was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --trying to get us from--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I got--
Speaker 1: --from--
Speaker 2: I came in the late '60s [1960s] and stayed till '71 [1971].  And--
Speaker 1: Okay, well, in terms of our chronology, then we're still with CREEP [Committee to Re-Elect the President] right now (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --going, going from CREEP to--all right, so what, what, what, what, what happened after the NicNixon was elected, of course.  And shortly thereafter, they discovered this, the Watergate break-in and that sort of thing.  And they, they were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, let's--
Speaker 1: They started really--
Speaker 2: --let's--(unclear)--this.
Speaker 1: They discovered it before he was elected--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's it.  Right now--
Speaker 1: --but they--
Speaker 2: --you're putting the sequences right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they--
Speaker 2: This is during the middle of the election, and wake up one morning and headlines are all over the country of that Watergate break-in, Watergate being a major upscale apartment development near the Potomac [River], heading from downtown Washington [D.C.] toward Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.]; and very interesting.  And I thought it was not necessary because I thought every reading we could get confidentially internally pointed to a victory for the president, for re-election of the president.  So it was unnecessary to, to resort to anything that would bring any adverse publicity on the re-election effort.
Speaker 1: Well, the, the break-in kind of haunted the administration and ca--
Speaker 2: And yet--
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: --and yet he won overwhelmingly.  And then--
Speaker 1: But it kept coming back up.
Speaker 2: --the Watergate hearings began to commence, and [U.S.] Congress wants to look into it.  And the rest of that is history.  You had the old wise and sage country lawyer--who was it--Sam, what, Ervin [Sam Ervin]--
Speaker 1: Sam--yeah, Ervin.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sam Ervin, right.
Speaker 2: --who chaired it down--
Story_ID: 136625
Speaker 1: --I'll give you the interesting story for [The] HistoryMakers.  I had, with all of the tapes and--(unclear)--Watergate hearings, and I was gonna stay there and look, was looking at getting an assistant secretaryship in one of the departments, government, and decided I'd take employment South, come back South where I was from, and took a regional director's job, and got out of Washington [D.C.] because they were pulling everybody into the Watergate hearing.  Well, the day the hearings opened and Sam Ervin gathered it to order, everybody glued to TV's all over the country, all over the world.  And I had accepted the regional directorship of Action [Citizens Service Corps] here in Atlanta [Georgia].  And I'd usually go to lunch late, and staff my office and other federal offices in the building had gone out to restaurants around.  And I went down that hot summer day and was descending the steps outside the building.  A group of guys were coming in from lunch and said (unclear) were you watching on your TV the opening shots of the Watergate hearing?  I said no.  What happened?  They said they called your name on the (unclear).  I said what, what happened?  He said--asked him, so I went and checked out what was going on.  I hadn't been watching it.  And it seems the opening shots were where the counsel said: We've done our homework, and we've got our researchers out, gathered materials, and I want you to be, be honest with us.  And this is the administrative officer for the Committee to Re-Elect [the President] that they're talking to, named Bart (unclear), and, and said, give us a layout up here of the map of what CREEP [Committee to Re-Elect the President] looks like.  And he put his--(unclear)--(unclear)--all up here and (unclear)--line of directors right under there and then the other stuff under there.  And so he put in some names, A, B, C, and D, and here's over here is Jones and one of those directors.  And he said now, look, said, did you handle any money during the campaign?  He said no, you got me wrong, said I'm administrative officer, remember?  And that would have been the treasurer.  He said now look, investigators have been out.  We wouldn't wanna see your perjure yourself, said now think very hard before you answer this.  I'll give you one more chance, said did you handle any money while you were with the Committee to Re-Elect?  He thought and he said maybe a few thousand dollars.  He said well, what did you do with that?  He said I gave it to Paul Jones.  The truth is, there had been a group that was concerned about the growing demonstrations in Washington of those who were anti the Vietnam [War] efforts.  And that was gaining such momentum, they wanted to see what kind of reaction they could get from people who were pro-Nixon and pro the, the Vietnamese, Vietnam effort.  So, through contact such as you had mentioned before, [Charles] Hurst at Malcolm X [Community] College [Chicago, Illinois], said we've got veterans here.  One was a boy named Jerry Green [ph.], clean cut, nothing guy who'd been in the war and been (unclear).  And he said listen, if they get transportation to Washington, (unclear) they can come down there and they'll hold a press conference--(unclear)--in support of the president [Richard Nixon].  And so, the money, money went in there to pay tickets, buy tickets for those guys to come in and have a place, hotels to stay.  And they'd have their press conference and go on back.  Real footnote to that that would be of interest to you particularly was that, comes the election, on election eve, guys around Chicago [Illinois] apparently, with the Chicago politics being what's been in the old day of the machine (unclear), we used to part some money being passed out to those who delivered votes and things.  And this group of boys out where Malcolm X College was had gone in and taken over the office of the president, and was sitting there with Hurst, who begged them to let him call me down in Washington.  He said, "Listen, will you tell these guys you haven't delivered any money to me and given me anything, that they're waiting, sitting here waiting on their cut of the money that traditionally goes out for those who support candidates?"  And I had to tell him--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --they thought might have met with foul play (unclear) badly bruised up or something at that time.  But that was a footnote to that.
Speaker 2: So they thought the whole world was, was Chicago?
Speaker 1: That is--no, it wasn't, you know.
Story_ID: 136626
Speaker 1: Like Chicago [Illinois], like the rest of the world, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know--
Speaker 1: That's exactly what they thought.
Speaker 2: --you know, Mayor Richard [J.] Daley would say that--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --that he--
Speaker 1: I've always been fascinated--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, though, with Chicago politics all the way back to old man Daley and the role that I studied most was that [William] Bill Dawson, the black congressman played.  He would deliver, traditionally, a higher percentage of voters from his district with Daley, which isn't commonly known, than any other area, in spite of all of that ethnic communities you got around Chicago, like the Polish community.  But this was a (unclear).  So, it was an interesting time.  They felt that this was the way they ran (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So they were supposed to get paid off.
Speaker 1: What I did find in, in going into Dawson's area years ago, back when I was doing the master's thesis on the congressional lobbying system, was that Dawson would fly back, like most congressmen, to their district every weekend on Friday.  And he had these storefront political offices around the district.  And he'd in there, and they'd have him all set up with fifty people to see him, wanna see the congressman.  So they'd run, run in there, and you've got five minutes.  Well, my son is in jail.  You take this down to the jail and tell 'em Bill Dawson said give this man out on his own recognizance.  I need a job.  You go down to city hall, and tell this guy I said give you an elevator operator's job and get that.  And they're taking the names of everybody who's gotten that phone number and where they are.  And then, comes Election Day, they pull in every one of those troops and march 'em out to the polls.  And they voting any way Dawson and team said vote--(unclear)--and kept that Daley machine going, which made Dawson a powerhouse in the old original Daley machine.  Dawson had run first as a Republican, and when--then ran--he--as president and then run as a Democrat and won, went to Washington [D.C.], became a very powerful senator--I mean a congressman, and became one of the first blacks to head up a major committee of the house, which gave him tremendous staff there.  Had a girl named Christine Davis, had been his secretary, then became the clerk of that committee [House Government Operations Committee], which was a very powerful position.  And it was a house operations committee, government operation, and they a long time ran that.  Then they made him a vice chairman of the National Democratic Party, another powerhouse.  I remember when blacks from all over the country began going into Washington to try to get to this agency if it can get some, a grant or a loan or an assist, or appointment, new position.  You didn't go in to see anybody in Washington unless you went through Bill Dawson's office.  And they'd call over and say Paul Jones is coming over to see so and so--ran him ten, fifteen minutes or whatever.  Now I went in there shortly after all of this was taking place.  What was so interesting then was that everybody that I had talked to before that, was to go over and see this black--one or two blacks were beginning to be at mid-level positions in every department of governmental agency, and see if they can't help you.  I found the average black in those positions wanted to remain the one black in that position, in that agency or department, because every time they'd turn to somebody (unclear), they'd turn to them.  And so I got a lot more help out of others than I did out of the brothers at that time who were in those positions.  And it was to be expected.
Speaker 2: Now, that, that's some interesting stuff.
Story_ID: 136627
Speaker 1: Now, all the while that you're involved at ACTION [Citizens Service Corps] and, and, when you're involved in the Committee to Re-Elect the President, and all the way back in the '60s [1960s] in Model Cities, you, from what I've read, you started collecting art in the early '60s [1960s].  Now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --now, these are, they, they're seemingly unrelated.
Speaker 2: Seemingly, yes--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --seemingly, yes.
Speaker 1: But, you know, tell--
Speaker 2: And not necessarily so.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So, so tell us how this, how this evolved, the art collecting evolved.
Speaker 2: Briefly I started out simply one day on a hot summer day going up (unclear)--(unclear), and that was one of the things you did then.  Back in those days you, you know, that was fun, exercise, recreation.  A lot of places didn't even have air conditioners, so you know their doors are wide open with the ninety-plus degree weather.  We stopped somewhere for a soft drink, or ice cream bar, or hot dog.  And then those that had a little art prints or whatnot for sale, usually had a bin of shrink wrap prints right in the front.  So you're walking up the street, you stop and go on through them, see anything you want, take it back.  I looked through a bin one day.  There were three little prints that appealed to me as I went through everything in there, [Henri de] Toulouse Lautrec, [Edgar] Degas, Marc Chagall.  I picked the three of 'em up, took 'em back to the counter and paid for 'em, didn't cost much.  I stretch it when I say prints.  They were reproductions.  Took 'em out to someplace where they (unclear) back I those days, whether it was Targets or Kmart or something, got three unstained frames, bought me a can of stain, paint brush, went home; on newspaper in my living, matted, stained those frames and put 'em together, then hung them over my couch, lived with 'em for months, enjoyed it.  It was figurative.  I could appreciate and understand figurative works of that time--hadn't studied art; hadn't may--majored in art, wasn't an artist, so these appealed to me.  If let alone, I'd probably would have continued to collect figurative work, loved human form, might have had as large a collection as you've known of, of nudes, which I liked.  But I said let me look around at the art world, the museum world, and the gallery worked and see if they're any gaps so I can I develop some structure on what I wanna collect, the direction I wanna go in, and I did this.  It wasn't long when I looked at the museum world, especially in this area, where I found quickly that they were not spending any of the monies they were getting for permanent acquisitions through their collection on works by artists of color.  I said surely some of these artists are museum quality or mature enough to be collected by the museum.  Then I looked at the gallery scene around the country, with a few exceptions where one or two bold New York [City] galleries or others would grab a superstar and give him a show, and not always keep him as a member of their stable of artists.  There wasn't much going on there.
Story_ID: 136628
Speaker 1: So, that began to help shape the direction and focus of my collecting.  I said if I'm gonna be serious about collecting: one, I need some original works of art; two, I'm not exclusively--I wanted to concentrate on works by African Americans who have been under-collected and needed exposure.  And so I couldn't go to the museum that didn't have a curator of African American art to get any advice from there, couldn't go to any of the galleries who were less than expert in works by African Americans.  So I put out word with people that knew and said if you run into artists you think are mature enough or good enough for me to look at, let me know.  And got a call one day from a lady who's working in special collections over Atlanta University [later Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], said this is a good time for you to get in touch with an artist named Herman Kofi Bailey, said he needs a roundtrip ticket from Atlanta [Georgia] to Los Angeles [California], where his parents live, for Christmas, and said he's willing to give art for a ticket.  So he and I met on mutual grounds, and he said take any two of these canvases he unrolled for a roundtrip ticket.  I said fine, I'll take any three.  He said no, I said two.  And I said three.  He said two, and I said three.  The last time I said three, he rolled his canvases up, put 'em under his arm, and left.  And that was a big one that got away.  And I determined after that I'd never miss anything I really wanted.  I later bought some of his artwork, got to know him and befriended him, and paid more for what I think might have been lesser quality work than those original ones.  Bailey incidentally was a guy who had become sort of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and, and SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and others, artist in residence.  You know, he'd do art for them and did prints that they could sell and raise money and things of that sort.
Speaker 2: About what year was it, this, when you approached Kofi Bailey?
Speaker 1: I'd say it was somewhere in the, between '65 [1965], '70 [1970], in the latter '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Mid to latter.
Story_ID: 136629
Speaker 1: But I then began to get referred, artists referred to, and I'd buy.  And pretty soon an interesting phenomenon took place.  Artists began to network among themselves.  And they'd say, look, this guy is serious about collecting.  He's spending money.  And they would beat a path then to my door.  And I'd buy sometimes quality, as I developed an eye, and even sometimes just to, as an encouragement incentive, to those artists who weren't selling, who were in despair and about to give up on their art career.  And in some instances this made the difference.  But what happened out of--as a result of this was that every three, four, five months I'd invite a group of artists over at my home, and we'd have some--break bread together, have something to eat, something to drink, and just sort of kick it around.  I got to know them, and they got to know me.  And I learned an awful lot directly from the artist who were creating the work, rather than from a middle man of people who were selling it for them.  And that was part of that education for me.  And we'd sit and kick it.  Got so that one day I even said to them, I said look, you guys are trying to chronicle an era here, the Civil Rights Movement and all.  It's important that we document that, and I know the importance of it.  But I said you're an artist and you wanna sell.  I said think about who the art collecting public is.  Who are the major collectors?  Who got the resources to really buy art?  Are those the persons who wanna live 365 days a year with a raised clenched fist or an afro painted in their living room?  And I think to some extent I had some impact on seeing some of them begin to do things that had some hope in 'em, instead of children always in housing projects in despair or drugs that were bringing 'em down.  There was a little bit more of some future to look forward to in some of the work.  Some were doing landscape.  So some began to do the work that was non-figured, and so that made a difference in there.  Soon as I got enough of their work, I decided I was not gonna hold my art close to the vest, that I was going to share it in my home and in lending it out for exhibitions as much as I could to get exposure for the artists and to wet their appetite of others, to connect, and I did just that.  I loaned not only to museums, but the galleries on college and university campuses, to galleries on high school campuses, to churches, to nonprofit groups.  Some of the art took a beating was in less than ideal circumstances, scratched frames, a cracked glass, but it was well worth this to get those artists before more people, who then began to be supportive of them, who would often come to me and say how do I get starting collecting?  One of the things I did was to collect from those who I really liked in multiples; I'd buy multiples, six pieces of his work, five of another, seven from another, ten from another.  And so when they'd come to me and say, "How did you start," I could let them have a piece, at an appreciated price, and that plowed that money back into buying other art.  And I still had a good representation of art from those artists.  But we were getting them out, getting them better known, raising the level of what they were able to--could get for their work, and that mattered.
Story_ID: 136630
Speaker 1: I can remember sitting in an audience in the auditorium during a February Black History Month program at the High Museum [of Art] here in Atlanta [Georgia] that--and used to do annually.  And they'd always bring somebody down like from the North to speak, implication being to me that perhaps they thought the Northern blacks knew a little bit more about art or things than the Southerners who'd been oppressed.  And they sat there in the back of that auditorium that day as this person spoke.  And, and the director got up and was thanking everybody after questions and comments, and was about to dismiss them.  And I stood up in the back of the room and said I don't think we've made much progress.  Everybody got quiet and turned around 180 degrees, looked at me.  I waited a few seconds, then I said I don't think we will have made it until we get some persons of color, some blacks on the board of directors of this institution in the museum.  And then some of those ought to be on an exhibition committee to help determine who gets exhibitions, and on an acquisition committee to help determine whose work they purchase.  I left.  Not a lot of people gathered around me after that.  (Unclear)--I said to the museum, and they certainly weren't thinking to be enamored with me.  Few months later--
Speaker 2: What, what year is this?  I'm just, just--
Speaker 1: In the middle '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Okay, it's still, this is--
Speaker 1: Historically--
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--art collection.
Speaker 2: This is when you first got started--
Speaker 1: Yes, that's correct.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'd, I'd started may, may have been the early, in the '70s [1970s], but it was in that period when I began collecting.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What happened was that I got a call a few months later from the director of that museum.  He said the board has deciding to--the executive committee's board has decided to expand board membership side, and wondered if I was interested in serving on the board.  And I said to myself I wonder if it was to muzzle me from saying the kind of thing I just said or whether it was recognition of the genius of what I'd said.  At any rate, I said okay, I'll serve.  So I went in.  I said gee, I can push at the seams from inside and bring about more desirable change than I can bouncing off of a steel wall or a brick wall from the outside and not making a dent in it.  So I got inside, not to be a rabble-rouser, but to win and gain friends in support for the agenda I had, and that they had a number of support groups.  I said I'll join the 20th century support group 'cause I'm collecting 20th century art, and I did.  Later, I was elected the first black chairman of the 20th Century Art Society.  But in the meantime, I looked at the support groups and found the most prestigious one was the Collectors' Club.  Cost much more to join, so I dug deep in my thin pockets and joined it.  It was an amazing thing, got in there, and that was it.  I just got to know the collectors; they got to know me, and that made a difference for the change I brought about later.
Speaker 2: Okay, perfect.
Story_ID: 136631
Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Paul Jones, that's P-A-U-L, J-O-N-E-S.  And most people associate me with the Paul Jones Collection of Fine Art [University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware].  That arts and antiques is called one of the hundred top collections in the country.  But I guess a bigger or better part of me has spent, except professionally earning money to buy art with, and that's led me into a, an interesting pursuit of careers, and that I think is equally as challenging.
Speaker 1: That's right--
Story_ID: 136632
Speaker 1: I mean you were--you served in the [Richard] Nixon Administration.
Speaker 2: Served in Republican and Democratic administrations, but really Nixon Administration, having worked as one of their directors nationally for the famous Committee to Re-Elect the President, known as CREEP [CRP].
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So, yes, didn't you share some space with G. Gordon Liddy at one time?
Speaker 2: Well, here I am.  After they brought me back, he had heard it from overseas in Southeast Asia to take over the top slot in terms of going after black vote in the presidential run for re-election.  I looked up the next week, and an empty office next to me.  They were moving in another staff.  And I looked up and we introduced ourselves, and it was G. Gordon Liddy.  And the rest, of course, has been history, as we follow G. Gordon Liddy, rather than talk, went to jail or prison, and who has since written him a book on the whole experience, and now has him a syndicated radio show that he does.  So he's managed to survive it all and keep going.
Speaker 1: You, you run for president and run for Congress.
Speaker 2: Did run for president, yes.  That was years ago, before any persons of color had dare announce they were running for president or to attempt to seek the presidency.  I preceded [HM] Julian Bond, or Shirley Chisholm, or [HM] Jesse Jackson, any of the others.  Years ago, in Montgomery, Alabama, we brought together a South-wide contingent of blacks under the Democratic umbrella to organize a South-wide Democratic movement.  An Associated Press guy named Joe Azbell was working out of the Montgomery Advertiser at that time came through and was interviewer various people for me to the states, saying well, since we got the convention coming up soon for the major parties in order to pick their candidates, what candidates do you favor, who will you be supporting.  So he finally got around to me and said, what's your take on this?  Who are you gonna be supporting?  I said look, since we've got every possible group, including the states' rights groups out there with a candidate of their own to go into the convention so that they can go in with some votes to have some weight in the convention, I've been seriously considering running for president myself.  In fact, I wanna take this opportunity to announce that I will be a candidate for president.  I told him at that time that I didn't flirt with the idea short of a miracle of winning the nomination, but I did think I'd be successful in garnering some convention delegate votes that would allow us to be able to appear before the platform committees and others, and to see if we couldn't influence the direction of the platform that was adopted.  And so that was announced.  The Associated Press picked that up.  It went all over the country, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now what, what year is this?  I'm sorry, what--
Speaker 2: That was the year that there was a [Adlai] Stevenson-[John] Sparkman ticket, Stevenson having been--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Adlai Stevenson--
Speaker 2: --governor and--yeah, Adlai Stevenson being governor of Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's 1956 [sic 1952] I believe.
Speaker 2: And [John] Sparkman having been senator [from Alabama].
Speaker 1: That's '56 [1956] I believe.  Is it, is it, is that, does that sound right?
Speaker 2: Around that time [sic, 1952].
Speaker 1: Yeah, when Stevenson ran for--okay, 1956, okay.  And the name of the party was the South-wide--
Speaker 2: No, we, we--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --established the South-wide Association of Demo--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --crats [South-wide Association of Democrats].  And what did happen, after the convention [1952 Democratic National Convention], and they'd nominated Stevenson and Sparkman, was that Bill Dawson, William Dawson, who was a black congressman out of Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --and pretty powerful, called together a group of blacks from all over the country.  And I was one of those that he invited to come up for a meeting with the vice presidential candidate, Sparkman, and to play an active role in helping their ticket get elected, with some promises of some input and influence with the administration if it was successful.  I came back and worked as a co-chair South-wide of black Democrats for the Stevenson/Sparkman ticket, along with then Attorney [A.T.] Walden, W-A-L-D-E-N, in Atlanta [Georgia].  And the two of us sort of manipulated, and maneuvered, and handled that campaign, which was a fairly interesting campaign early on for blacks to be playing a prominent role in.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  We probably got some of this last time.  I'm just making sure--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --that we get it, yeah.
Story_ID: 136633
Speaker 1: I'll give you a little quick--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) and the, the, the congressional run, now, what happened that time?
Speaker 1: Well, that was a point at which I had been very active when it came back to Atlanta [Georgia] to live and work in, and then after, had to go into business for myself, that wanted to see some activity in a newly redefined congressional district, which would have given a black a chance to win that district.  And that was difficult to get someone to run.  And I laid back and we're gonna run as a Democrat.  The Republicans had said look, we've never had a good candidate.  We'll raise some money for the campaign if you'll run under that banner.  Against my better judgment, I qualified to run in the Republic [Republican] primary, and it drew two other candidates, white male Republicans.  And I made it to the run-off and was leading in that and in the run-off, beat the other candidate.  So I had written some history in going into the Republican primary and beating two guys, and they were Republicans as the candidates there at the candidacy.
Speaker 2: Now what, what year was this?
Speaker 1: It was about in the late '70s [1970s] or '80 [1980].  It was the year that [HM John] Lewis first went to [U.S.] Congress.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't.  It's the year before that, two years before that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because the incumbent then was Wyche Fowler.  And Wyche had a strong bit of support from the white in the Democratic Party and from blacks in the Democratic Party.  I found during the campaign the biggest drawback to drawing a larger support group among black Democrats was that they could not see themselves voting for anyone that had, had a party that was headed by Richard Nixon at the time or Ronald Reagan, whichever one was president at the time.
Speaker 2: It was Reagan I guess then--
Speaker 1: Yeah, at that time.
Speaker 2: --that time.  So this is like in the '80s [1980s]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay, so maybe in the--
Speaker 1: And that was a drawback to it then--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, was it the '88 [1988] or '86 [1986], '88 [1988]?
Speaker 1: Can't tell you what it exactly was.
Speaker 2: But it was the year that, that John Lewis was elected.
Speaker 1: It was the year before Lewis--
Speaker 2: Before Lewis.
Speaker 1: --was in there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because Wyche Fowler was re-elected.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Part of some of the votes that I might have gotten also was siphoned up by a black state legislator, Billy McKinney, who had run and saw his chance as better for not being knocked out of the Democratic primary by running Independent.  So, he was in the final run and did siphon off some votes, primarily from the district he had been elected to the legislature.
Story_ID: 136634
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let, let's catch up from where we were.  We were--when we ended last time, we were talking about the, we're talking about the High Museum [of Art] here in Atlanta [Georgia].  And you were talking about becoming a member of the Collectors' Club and said that--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --said that you had to dig deep in your thin pockets you said--
Speaker 2: Well, that's exactly what I had to do.  You know, there were several support groups at the High Museum at that time.  And I think I'd already told you that joined the 20th Century Art Society because what I was collecting was primarily 20th century art at that time.  But I looked around at the various support groups, and in order to be as influential as I possibly could, recognized very early that the most prestigious of those support groups was the Collectors' Club.  So I delved pretty deep into thin pockets and came up with a fee, which was higher than the joining fee for the other support groups, and joined the Collectors' Club.  And the curators, who were staffed for the Collectors' Club, every three of four months would have us out to one of the collector's homes.  We'd wine and dine, and they'd talk about their collection, and interact with each other as we looked at their art collection.  And it wasn't long before after three or four session--trips--they began to get used to seeing my face, and getting to know me, and exchange a bit with me, and find out the whole world wouldn't collapse.  And so I made a few friends, and I guess they found a new friend.  And shortly a few of 'em began to say, when we're gonna get a chance to go out to Paul's home and see his collection?  So I waited a few months and then got with a, the curator and said when you got a break in your schedule, get with me and let's see if we can't bring 'em out to my home.  So I got 'em out there, and in addition to giving 'em a good meal of soul food, I decided then to take 'em on a good tour of the house on three levels and introduce 'em to art by artists of color.  And I feel good about taking some credit for having broadened the base of those heavyweight collectors to begin to be more inclusive of who they collected, so that so many of them now boast of having artists of color in their collection.  One had told me at a later date, said look, I'm trying to find me a good Horace Pippin, said I wanna a good one now.  But if you ever run into one, let me know.  I said Horace Pippin's work is expensive now.  He said look, money's no object, 'cause if you find a good one, let me know.  But to this date I haven't found him that (unclear)--Horace Pippin yet.  But it changed a good bit of what was going on at that time, just as showing and lending for exhibitions, my collection, as I began to get enough pieces to lend, made an impact on people of color.  Doctors, lawyers, businesspersons were beginning to have more than just enough to provide shelter over their head or food, clothing.  They were beginning to have some expendable cash.  They were making money.  And it became of interest to them to begin to look at collecting art; they were seeing it was beginning to be fashionable.  So a number of 'em beat their paths to my door and say, hey, how do I get started?  What do you recommend?  Is there something you can help us get started with?  And so that began to broaden that base that I take some credit for, having broadened, whetting the appetites of others to collect.  And I was happy to be able to do that, even if the art did take a beating when I'd lend it to a high school in their gallery, or a college in their gallery, or a nonprofit group, or a church, as well as to museums.
Speaker 1: That--
Speaker 2: Sometimes you get a broken glass; you get a scratched frame, but it was worth it to expose a broader array of people to this art.
Story_ID: 136635
Speaker 1: Do you have a specif--I mean a, a specific horror story about doing that, that you can tell us?
Speaker 2: I can tell you a story about a man who was working at a college down in central southern Illinois and teaching art educator.  He was looking for an exhibition, which he was over at the school, and came down and persuaded me to let me borrow some art to show.  And he wasn't able to even take it and have it pro--appropriately crated, and wrapped, and picked up by art handlers, but took it in his wagon and wrapped it as best he could and to pack.  But when he came back, I'd had noticed some of my better photographs of [P.H.] Polk and, and [James] Van Der Zee and others had been opened and hadn't been put back (unclear) very well, I expect ostensibly to shoot and make negatives of to reproduce.
Speaker 1: That is a horror story.
Speaker 2: A real horror story.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  But the work was, wasn't damaged, was it or was it?
Speaker 2: Well, one piece was and one piece by Roy DeCarava was terribly damaged--
Speaker 1: He's a great--
Speaker 2: --beyond being--
Speaker 1: --photographer, right?
Speaker 2: --being able to use, very difficult situation for me to swallow and to still keep lending, but I did.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a policy about that now?  I mean when somebody shows up, and they say well, I'll just back my van here and just load 'em up in the van.  And, and they--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm, I'm concerned now that we get some insurance by them (unclear) from the time it leaves my door to the time they bring it back, so that it's covered from the time they pick it up and transport it.
Story_ID: 136636
Speaker 1: And with them, I loaned to the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute [Birmingham, Alabama] last year for King Week and Black History Month.  And it helped legitimate them as a museum.  And since then, that has helped them in gaining accreditation, one of only three such museums of color that are accredited now, that museum and the one in--civil rights museum in Memphis [National Civil Rights Museum, Memphis, Tennessee], and the Harlem Studio Museum [sic the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York], which was accredited much earlier than either one of the other two.  But to make a long story short, their insurance carrier, when they filed with him to cover that art that I'd loaned, said you brought it over yourself, said we, we'll have to insist that you have art handlers wrap it and transport it if we're gonna have insurance covering it, and so they did.  Incidentally, the irony of that is the art handler that they dealt with did a poorer job than they did in wrapping and delivering.  And I wasn't at all satisfied with what he did, certainly not as satisfied as the one--with the way they had meticulously came over and wrapped, and handled, then carried it back.  But that's part of the deal now, that I do everything every time I lend I wanna see is it adequately covered by insurance, and that it's where I have a possible handler--by art handlers that are professionals who transport art regularly.
Story_ID: 136637
Speaker 1: Now do you make, make recommendations to people about what, what they ought to borrow or, or--
Speaker 2: Sometimes I have input into it to try to make for the cohesive show.  And I also am very sensitive to lending to them things that they seem to like, that strike their fancy, or fit a theme that they have for the show, whether they're looking for all artists from their state or from the region--(unclear)--the South, over there looking for the predominance of female, or a male, or a folk artist versus trained artist, just such a variety of things here that--(unclear)--going, whether we're looking at abstraction, or whether we're looking at figurative (unclear), where they won't lead to photography.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it won't--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--up, so there's a mix sometimes (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Okay, so the--
Speaker 2: --but sometimes we're able to influence that to make some suggestions.  And I think it, it's all positive.
Speaker 1: So you're saying that if you're gonna loan, loan a mix of things so that nobody photographs a collection like, like P. H. Polk's collection or--
Speaker 2: Well, not loan--
Speaker 1: --I guess.
Speaker 2: --I've got a--we, we, we loaned P. H. Polk photographs, in excess of a hundred of them, to the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware] for--(unclear)--(unclear)--the Delaware school with anything.  They did a nice catalog that accompanied that and then traveled that show for over four years, longest traveling show in the history of that school.  And it really puts Polk's name out there before the public.  If anything, I think there's some truth to what some people say to me: you made Polk; you know, you, you had a good photographer, but he needed exposure.  And that helped get him out there, also allowed the Southern Art Federation [later South Arts, Atlanta, Georgia] to have some copies of my Polks made.  And over a period several years, they are still traveling at the small venues around Southern states primarily, and it's still traveling.  That is further exposure the deserving photographers had.  Polk, you know, sort of chronicled the Rural South, out of Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama], while [James] Van Der Zee was chronicling the Urban North out of Harlem [New York, New York] during the period of the Harlem Renaissance.
Speaker 1: So, they were contemporaries on some--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Was Polk a little younger than, than--
Speaker 2: Slightly.
Speaker 1: But, but the--slightly, okay.
Speaker 2: Slightly, but they were both contemp--contemporaries and giants in their own way.  These guys were working with equipment of that day, which doesn't parallel what we've got today.  They were taking it and shooting, and not rolling up film and giving it to somebody who's expert at developing for them to do, but would go into their own place and develop, and then print.  I've stood in the ark with some of those photographers.  They were geniuses; to do at that time what they did was amazing.  So I have my hat off to them.  They were fabulous.  It's been a pleasure for me to have been an early collector of photography as a fine arts form, so I got into it early and was pleased whenever I would lend and had some influence into what was loaned, to include photography in it.  That began to whet the appetites of others who hadn't been collecting photography.  They would generally talk about art and photography, and I talk of photography as art, as fine art.  And so, we begin to see a change; people are beginning to collect photography.  So I'm pleased to take a little bit of credit for having stimulated a little more of that.
Story_ID: 136638
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did--you have a photo of James Van Der Zee and P. H. Polk together?
Speaker 2: I certainly do, yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And those are two of my favorites.
Speaker 1: --we just saw it--
Speaker 2: I got to know 'em both very well.  And I was pleased to get that when they both came down here to Atlanta [Georgia] and appeared at the High Museum [of Art, Atlanta, Georgia] when there was a national black photo show going on.
Speaker 1: Now about what year was that?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, that was many years ago.
Speaker 1: Was it in the '70s [1970s] or--
Speaker 2: I'd, I'd say in, maybe in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: In the '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Oh, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: When it was a tremendous impact on so many of us.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what were their personalities like?  I mean did they--you know, were they alike, or were they different, or?
Speaker 2: A little bit different guys.  Polk was quite a charmer, talker, dapper, and lady's man, used to say he'd never take any photographs before it's time.  He'd talk and cajole the child or a baby until he got 'em right where he wanted the next split second.  He got his photo.  Van Der Zee, I've got a watercolor of his that I got from a, a North Carolina folk artist, of Van Der Zee playing the violin--trained in the violin, came up in a family where that was stressed, but did a tremendous job in Harlem [New York, New York], you know, chronicling everything from people's weddings to people's funerals.  In fact I've got a rare book of his that I've been able to find that I own.  It's in my library of book on funerals by Van Der Zee.  And it shows many funerals in there, elaborateness to which we go to put them away nice, which brings to mind how I used to cringe when I grew up in a mining came where about the only large chunk of money a lot of women would get was when one of their husbands died or got killed in the mines working, and they'd get five, six thousand dollars insurance money.  And the next thing I'd know, the undertaker would be sending a limousine out for them and nurse them along to the undertaker and say, you wanna put your husband away nice so he'll be remembered that way?  And they'd spend a good bit of their fortune on burying, putting it in the ground.  The rest was left, but somebody who'd come along and talk 'em into saying although you can't drive, you need yourself a nice new car.  And they'd go out and buy a car, and somebody else would dog it out and run it out for them.  Pretty soon they were broke.  It was an interesting moment.
Story_ID: 136639
Speaker 1: Now, there's a story behind a photograph called 'The Boss'--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --by P. H. Polk.  And you told that story to us, I think in the--
Speaker 2: Fabulous story.
Speaker 1: --off-camera, but when we first came here a couple of years ago--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know 'The Boss' is Polk's signature piece.  And--
Speaker 1: Just describe it verbally right now.  We'll, we'll just, you know, those who--
Speaker 2: You've got this woman who obviously looks like she comes from meager or poor circumstance, but hadn't let it beat her down, still has that verve, head hung high, bandana tied around her head, but tattered holes in her sweater that she had pulled over under her coat, but with hands on her hips, and she talks to you.  And so, Polk, looking out of his window one day as she stroll's across Tuskegee's [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] campus, coming in our city, go over to the agriculture department, where they were holding a number of seminars for people who were farmers in the region to help them learn how to rotate crop, how to fertilize, how to enrich, how to get better yield.  And so he ran out of his office that day, and accosted the woman, and said, "Madam?"  She looked at him.  He said, "I wanna take your picture."  She said, "Oh, you don't wanna take my picture."  He said, "Why?"  She said, "I don't have any money."  He said, "You don't understand.  I don't want you to pay for my taking your picture.  I wanna pay you a few dollars to let me take your picture."  Thus, 'The Boss' was born.  He took that picture, looked at that woman, came away with it, and said look, that woman could boss anybody.  Thus, all over the world we know Polk by 'The Boss.'
Story_ID: 136640
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are there, are there any interesting stories from [James] Van Der Zee that you heard?
Speaker 2: Van Der Zee's, as you know, favorite piece--sort of his signature piece is 'Couple in Raccoon Coats.'  Here you have, in that day and age, fine looking black man and woman, struts bare cat there with them on--feet on the running board, two major fur coats on, rumble seat back there where people use to sit in the back of the car, but looking like they were just out of a Rockefeller Center, Rockefeller Plaza [New York City, New York], instead of out in the tenements in Harlem [New York, New York], but had that verve, had that beauty, had that gumption for living.  And that was beginning to tell us who Van Der Zee was.  He went on, you know, to become, to a photographer, official photographer, for people like the Back to Africa Movement of Marvard--Marcus Garvey.  And so whenever they would march and demonstrate in, in their soldierly uniforms, go down the streets of Harlem, he was there shooting it, chronicling that, fantastic stuff, amazing.
Speaker 1: You mentioned another artist.  It's really an artist with a cameras, Roy DeCarava--
Speaker 2: Roy DeCarava, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --absolutely.  I can never forget (unclear) where Ansel Adams, who so much of America looked to as sort of a leader in the field of photography, set up Ansel Adam--I mean Ansel set up Roy DeCarava, that he's obviously one of the ten top photographers in the country, which was quite attributed in that in time for him to pay to Roy.  But he's a fantastic photographer, captured all kinds of things, and the pleasure of getting to know him, meet him, to hear him talk, and it's made a difference.  But those are the people who were pioneers, did so much with so little to pave some of the way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Proud of them, I'm proud to have collected and exposed their work to a large number of people.
Story_ID: 136641
Speaker 1: Now were, were you able to collect any--gosh, I'm--[HM] Gordon Parks, you know?
Speaker 2: But it--got more books of Parks than I have photography.  And in late days, as I've been seeking work, I've been very sensitive to Gordon being ill, and he passed his ninetieth birthday.  So it's gonna be nip and tuck to see what I can come up with, and at this date, to see what I can afford.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Excellent photographer and excellent history of him and photography, and film, and writing.  He paves a lot of when he did his work with Life magazine, when he pioneered with 'Super Fly' in movies, and been a genius on several fronts.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the world seems to be waking up over the last ten years to a lot of black photographers that, you know, had been working for the black newspapers, like the [HM] Ernest Withers in Memphis [Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you got--
Speaker 2: I've known him a few years, and the last couple years gave some money, made a donation to the High Museum's [High Museum of Art, Atlanta, Georgia] photography curator, who was looking for funds to try to purchase some Ernest Withers' photographs for the High Museum.  And I'm pleased to contribute to that.  And Ernie, you know, had shot so much, went back during the old baseball league stuff, when, when we took it for granted.  But it's history now, and was broken up when all of a sudden you looked around and the major leagues begin to siphon off that talent, which did away with an institution.
Speaker 1: That's--did you--were you able to collect any of the Smith's brothers' [Morgan Smith and Marvin Smith] photos?
Speaker 2: No, you know, I, I know their work well and have studied it, but loved it, and, and, and had once an opportunity to because I was with one of 'em when a group of people out of Chicago [Illinois], and I was there or a holiday, said come and go with us up to the resort up there between there and Michigan.
Speaker 1: Idlewild [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: That's exactly--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --where it was, Idlewild, exactly.  So I had a weekend up there (laughter).  It was a holiday about that time, but didn't get any, but respect their work tremendously.  They'd get people like a fellow that shot--I just got a picture of Gordon Parks that he did.  It was very good, Adger Cowans, who does a lot of work and knew him--
Story_ID: 136642
Speaker 1: All right, now, before we were talking about Ming Smith and Andrew--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Kianza [Andrew Kianza (ph.)], some of the other photographers.
Speaker 2: And some of those I collect.
Speaker 1: And who are some of--I mean, who were are some of the others that--who was your, do you have a favorite?  I don't wanna get you in trouble, but I guess I probably may.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I, you know, I love them all, but times I have favorites, and things that I liked that sometimes I take out and hang and live with more than I do others.  But I, from time to time, wanted to have a change, so I rotate.  And Ming Smith, for instance, Ming Smith-Murray, good photographer I'd known her for years, and we've talked before, but never had really hooked up, but had sort of gone into a hiatus.  And Ming would call me and said she needed to sell some photographs.  And I think after she and her husband, she had got some money and bought a home out in California, notes were fairly notorious.  And so I began to get interested in her photography, and also in, in, in trying to respond to her need.  And it was an interesting time.  But I found if we went back and looked at some of her stuff, it was an amazing career, having been right there, having been married to a major musician, and right in the midst of some of the world's greatest musicians and was able to photograph them all off record, at ease, on stage, and off stage, backstage.  It was accumulation of things, and then of dance, which she was fond of.
Speaker 1: Now she was married to David Murray, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The saxophone player--
Speaker 2: She was married to David Murray, the--
Speaker 1: --who played with Jack DeJohnette, and Arthur Blythe--
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely--
Speaker 1: --and a lot of those people.
Speaker 2: --recorded even on his own, now with a group of his own--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --absolutely; think he's been spending more recent years in Europe.
Speaker 1: Right, he's a, he's, he's on the edge of jazz.  You know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the cutting edge, so.
Speaker 2: You got him (unclear), you got it.
Speaker 1: That's, that's, you go to Europe--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --for that these days (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--we are--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --cutting edge.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Very well said.  But that was one, one example of what I'd done.  And, and I've, I've put her in the exhibitions that we've had at the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware] and other places.  And as it (unclear) other interested in her work, and it's also encouraged her to come out and to begin to do some more shooting, and printing, and printing some of her other stuff up, and she'd got some shows.  And I've been pleased to see that happen 'cause she's a great talent that needed to be out there.  Adger Cowans shoots a lot of stills for the film and movie industry, but all--is a great fine art photographer.  We had a number of things there.  We got paintings of his, as well as photography of his.  And the latest thing that I bought from him was at the 19--I mean the 2004--of 2005 National Black Fine Arts Show at the Puck Building in New York [City] that tells every--winter.  And it was a photograph that he'd taken of [HM] Gordon Parks.  And I'd bought it, and he signed it for me, and I bought it on the spot, been very pleased to have it in my collection.
Story_ID: 136643
Speaker 1: Now, you've been around a lot of artists and photographers.  Do, is it common for an artist to be a photographer too and vice versa, or, or--
Speaker 2: No, I would not say common, but there is some overlap where there are a number of photographers who are also painters.  And I've found a few people who paint, draw, sculpt, do other things, find themselves shooting.  So it's, it's, it's an interesting extension of the artistic sensibilities here.  And so you do see some of it, and it's good.  Now, the quality of one may not equal the quality of the other, but they document, which is what I initially looked at photography as.  Before I came 180 degrees to seeing it as fine art, I saw photography as basically a good way of our documenting eras, or an event.  We knew by seeing that photograph that Tuskegee, Alabama, where P. H. Polk photographed, literally had blacks down there who played the harp, who lived in nice homes, who had a higher level of income and education than the whites in the area had.  He was in segregated Alabama, in South, and segregated Macon County [Georgia], and Tuskegee [Alabama], but you had Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee, Alabama] that had brought in professors and staff.  They had the federal government establishing the only VA [Veterans Affairs] hospital in the country for black veterans in Tuskegee.  Well, you had everything from medical doctors to psychiatrists, to technicians working there.  Their level of income and education was much higher than that of whites in the area.
Story_ID: 136644
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell us about you--we mentioned off camera your TV show.  They said during the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --fifties [1950s], the 1950s--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --this is pre--
Speaker 2: It was back to the '50s [1950s] when it was unheard of.  I--what had happened was that, I think I told you much earlier that I'd been the executive for the Birmingham-Jefferson County Interracial Committee [sic, Birmingham Interracial Committee of the Jefferson County Coordinating Council for Social Forces].  The chairman of my committee, Henry P. Johnson, was a member of the family that owned the daily newspapers, and a TV station, and radio station.  And the TV station had a major strike mounted against them.  It lasted for a long time.  They were unable to bring it to a quick settlement, despite all their efforts.  And they were moving around, scrambling to do something to hold onto a listening audience, and came up with the idea of possibly appealing to a broader section with a show that featured variety from persons of color.  And they're looking for somebody to emcee their and asked me would I do it, so I did volunteer to, to work with that and did that.  But that lasted for a long time.  And each Sunday evening we'd come on with a cigarette in the ashtray over there, lit, smoke going up, camera would follow that over to me picking it up and bringing it over--(unclear)--down beat and we were on, and there you go.  We'd have the group over here singing and another group over here dancing, somebody else performing.  And then we'd go off with that cigarette going back to that ashtray that folk can follow down to the next week, and that was it.  But that was great with high ratings.  I couldn't walk the streets without people white or black knowing me.  And we began to pave the way.  What did follow was an awful lot of people buying radio stations that they beamed toward a black audience, toward a black market.  And they began then to get black DJs, and that became an interesting phenomenon.
Speaker 1: So what, what were there black DJs in Birmingham [Alabama] before the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, so before '63 [1963]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and the bombings--
Speaker 2: Absolutely right.
Speaker 1: --and all that, there--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Matter of fact, I remember one little DJ used to come by a little place that I had over there when I had my beer package store and the lounge.  And he'd always bring his musicians in when they'd come in for a show.  And they'd come by the radio, and they'd have 'em on and promoting them.  And so he'd always bring [HM] B. B. King down.  And B. B. King was coming in from Mississippi way and had a--was home.  And he'd always sit there and we'd have a beer, had a drink and talked, and we'd--(unclear)--(unclear).  I'd never go see his shows.  It just didn't never quite appeal to me at that time.  It was interesting for me to watch once there's a guy up on the highway who was the promoter black--(unclear)--little club, and had B. B. King there that night.  And the city auditorium up in Birmingham miles away had Dizzy Gillespie in his show.  And we'd just heard about Dizzy, so I got my friend, a boy that used to always go with me--(unclear)--(unclear)--said let's go up and hear Dizzy.  So we went up to the city auditorium, got tickets, went in and heard Dizzy.  On the way back, we pulled up and stopped over there at the Madison night spot where B. B. was supposed to be, nobody in there, empty.  The owner was mad after we said we'd been up there--what he mean going up there, and you didn't come in here?  So it was an interesting time, but it was interesting more so for me to see years later B. B. persistently out there, getting to get recording, then to begin to get gigs that were up to it, and become a legend.
Speaker 1: You think we can--you kind of took him for granted in that situation, or?
Speaker 2: Not sure.  I, I, I think I looked on him as--let me tell you what I really looked at.  I'd see B. B. Kings all around me, guys who'd grab a guitar and could sing on Friday nights, on pay nights, around a fish fry, and so here was one more guy.  I didn't see him standing out above the crowd.  It's like baseball used to be to us before blacks broke into the Major Leagues, a la the Jackie Robinsons of it all, right?  We had guys who were playing sandlot ball who probably could have given the [New York] Yankees and [San Francisco] Giants a run for their money.  Some of 'em came out of the old Negro Leagues, right?  When they finally siphoned off an over-the-heel [Leroy] "Satchel" Paige, who's still pitched (unclear), right?  Willie Mays is a kid.  I heard him on TV the other night say hey, at the age of fifteen we're out there playing.  (Unclear) say--(unclear)--say, we wanna take you in and give you a contract, pay you X number of dollars.  He said--(unclear) me--(unclear)--you wanna do that for me?  He's a kid who enjoyed playing ball, right?  Amazing, but that's where it comes from.  And so I'm saying we had a lot of Joe Louises, and Willie Mayses, and B. B. Kings, you know, who died for lack of recognition.
Story_ID: 136645
Speaker 1: Someone, you know, when you described the athletes and the performers, I mean that's similar to a lot of artists who, you know, work and don't get recognized--
Speaker 2: No doubt about it.  Listen--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --there are a lot of good artists.  Now, they don't all get the exhibitions; they don't all get bought for permanent collections in museums; they don't get to major galleries always that's gonna handle them so that they know they gotta, a clientele that's gonna purchase them.  And they don't make the books art historians are writing, and so they sometimes die for, for lack of recognition, but talented.
Speaker 1: Is there, is there a real specific example you know of somebody that really didn't get any recognition when they were alive, and who is now worth a lot--work is worth a lot of money?
Speaker 2: I've seen that happen with an awful lot of people.  One of the guys who I have enjoyed a relationship and friendship with was Herman Kofi Bailey, who became sort of artist in residence with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and before that, SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], and who later with to Ghana when [Kwame] Nkrumah was in and was almost state artist, never got the big exhibits, never got to major collectors.  And so I've tried to put a piece of his work in a number of my exhibits to get him out there, get his work known, his name out there where people wouldn't forget him.  He did the hunger poster for SCLC when they had that March on Washington--came back here when Nkrumah was in, dethroned, looking over his shoulder, real paranoid, felt I thought, in my conversation with him, that the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] had, had something with Nkrumah being dethroned and that they were always chasing him.  Then he found out I was working for the federal government at that time.  And amazing, he'd go home to see his parents in California, Los Angeles [California], and I'd be on the same plane.  He'd swear I was following him.  I'm going out to see my son.  He's going out to see his mother and father.  But we developed a friendship that grew stronger down through the years, and, I did all I could to befriend him (unclear) to support his efforts, and to get him out there.
Story_ID: 136646
Speaker 1: Okay, now how, how many pieces of art have you collected?  Do you, do you have any--you, you're pretty organized.  Now you might have an exact number.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: It, it is now in excess of two thousand.  Last time we did a good count, we went back and decided to update what I had and what I got rid of.  And the excess, it had been over two thousand.  Now I'm still buying, unfortunate--(unclear)--fortunately, and so it has exceeded that now.  And I'm, after having given some sever hundred major pieces to the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware] to make a difference in this country in the art world, I find myself in a position wherein I'm now contemplating perhaps another gift to some other institution.  And--
Speaker 1: Well, tell, tell us about the University of Delaware gift and the, the--
Speaker 2: I'll be very frank with you.  I'd looked around for four or five years for a home for the core of my collection, wanting to keep it together, because I had collected down through a period when major institutions weren't out collecting it for their permanent collections.  And I didn't wanna see it lost to the art world.  So I wanted to keep that together.  I'd had many museums say, hey, we'd like to have these, we'd like your (unclear) or we'd like your Charles Wright, or we like your Hale Woodruffs, or your Jacob Lawrences, or your Benny Andrews, or whatever.  And I said no, I don't wanna siphon things off that way.  I wanna keep the core of it together.  So I'd looked around, went to a couple of the HBCUs, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  And one college president said listen, if you give it all to us, I'm not sure we can digest it proper the way you want it.  I had certain constraints on it.  And the other president of one of the major schools said whatever you do and whoever you give it to, we will collaborate with them in using it and maximizing its use.  And so I moved further.  When a friend of mine who now, she's curator of the Paul Jones Collection at the University of Delaware, where she teaches art, and art history, and, and black American studies (unclear)--(unclear).  I think I'm going back to Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia] and get you a (unclear) degree, Ph.D. in art history, which she did.  And looking, after having done all the coursework for a committee while she's writing her dissertation, she'd always come up with two people.  They needed three.  And as a result of that, said to the school, can I go outside and get somebody?  They said as long as they meet our qualifications, fine.  I didn't go, but at that time, the University of Delaware had distinguished itself through three white male art historians as probably one of the best American art history programs in the country.  So she wrote to one of them up there named William [Innes] Homer.  I called him really and left a message, and said I'd like for you to serve on my committee.  I'm an American art history major, and I this is what I wanna write on.  He said he got back in touch with us.  Just send me some of your--(unclear)--(unclear).  Let me see what you been about.  She did though lone--learn the things she had done was work with this little person of African American art, Paul R. Jones Collection.  It was so that--anyway, he finally said he'd work with her.  She told the school he said he'd work with us if we pay him.  She said fine.  He, he meets that qualification, but we got no money to pay him.  So that--(unclear)--(unclear)--but it brought his name before the school's art history program.  And so each year with the monies they get from the Lehman Foundation for their Lehman Lecture Series, they brought William Homer down to speak.  I went over when I heard he was gonna lecture and sit in the audience.  I went down and introduced myself.  He said I know about you, and said listen, I've got to speak a class tomorrow morning at ten, another at eleven, and they want me to go to lunch with them.  He said but, if you're here at exactly twelve when I come out of the eleven o'clock class, I'll be all packed, and I'll just go with you over by your house, see your collection.  And you can drop me off then at the airport.  I said fine, I'll do it.  I was there, picked him up.  We by and had lunch and went on over to my house.  Ten minutes into my house, he's looking around, he said may I use your phone?  And I said fine, help yourself.  He called up to school apparently, talking to whoever of his colleagues was chairing what they had in every other year was a national symposium on some aspect of American art history.  That year for the first time they were having it on African American art history.  They had said to the then director of the gallery on campus, get us a good exhibition to correspond with this subject.
Story_ID: 136647
Speaker 1: She came back to them and said, let's--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --forget it.  There's too little time to get any good African American art for a good exhibition.  So when [William Innes] Homer came down there and not knowing about them and their every other year national symposium, he's looking for art.  So he looks around and I could overhear him say, looks like I've found what we're looking for.  Apparently the guy on the other end said see if you can nail it down.  He hung up the phone, turned to me and said would you consider lending to us?  I pause and I said I would consider lending.  Make a long story short, he went up, came back with a graduate student, and stripped my walls.  They went back and students and staff put together a nice scholarly catalog, and the show was on.  They invited me up for the symposium.  I sat there and listen to some of the scholarly papers, and during a break, went by the art history offices.  There was a guy who was chairing, Wayne Craven, typing away on a book galley.  I said Raymond, what are you up to?  He said I've gotta get this in to my publisher before it's late.  He said but after listening to all these scholarly papers on African American art history, I can't afford to send it in without weaving something in on African American art history.  So little bells went off in my head saying these guys had established that school and its reputation and its programs and all the books they'd written, probably completely devoid of anything on African American art history.  As a result of that, I then got an invitation a few months later from the board of trustees to serve on a visiting committee for the arts [at the University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware].
Story_ID: 136648
Speaker 1: That was when they invited me--
Speaker 2: Yes, right, yep.
Speaker 1: --to serve on that visiting committee [for the arts, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware].
Speaker 2: And what year was that?
Speaker 1: For the arts.
Speaker 2: And what year was that?
Speaker 1: I'd gone up for a loan for that first show in that symposium I went to in '93 [1993], '92 [1992] or three [1993].  And--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --later that fall was the year that I got invited by the board of trustees who had established a visiting committee umbrella in the arts to serve on that visiting committee.  Well, that umbrella, the art history, the art department, the, the art gallery, the Museum Studies Program, and the (unclear) program.  And I go up, and we'd had our meeting.  And when we'd have breaks, I'd call them together, and I said look, let's look introspectively at ourselves up here.  What is the makeup?  What the complexion of the faculty and staff here at the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware] in the 1990s?  Is it reflective of the population of the state?  Is it reflective of the population makeup of the country?  Is it similar to other schools?  Then I'd say let's look at the student body.  Is it reflective of the same kind of population makeup?  And they were vulnerable on both sides.  And I keep hammering away at that.  Finally they said to me, what are you gonna do with your collection?  I said for years I've been looking for a good home for it.  In fact, I haven't been trying to sell it.  I'm gonna gift some of it, feeling for that, we might make a statement.  And at the same time, at the right place, it would be there for scholars, students, and the art loving public to use.  They said well, we could be interested.  What conditions are you attaching to it?  I said well, you know I've given a piece here and a piece there to art institutions and museums that I've served on boards.  And I find so often that goes into storage and to vaults, and it's very seldom brought out, except maybe during black history month or something or to lend it, some institution borrowing it.  I said I no longer wanna see this all stored away nicely, but I wanna see some place dedicated where always some of that collection (unclear) that I give will be on exhibition for that art loving public, for students, and for scholars.  And so they came back to me and said we think we can do that.  What else did you want?  I said I'd like to see a full-time curator so that we can do a proper program around the art that I gift across the campus, and I said preferably one of color initially.  And that is how in a national search we came up with a young lady that I happened to have in my hip pocket--[HM] Amalia Amaki, who knew the collection, was an artist and was sensitive to art, and was an excellent scholar, having gotten a doctorate in art history.
Speaker 2: Now what--how do you spell her name?
Speaker 1: Amal, Amalia, A-M-A-L-I-A, Amaki, A-M-A-K-I. Amalia, A-M-A-L-I-A, Amaki, A-M-A-K-I.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 136649
Speaker 1: And she [HM Amalia Amaki], in addition to my gifting and my efforts up there years before I actually gave to them, has been very responsible for the amazing success that gift has had in bringing good deal of detention--attention--to the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware] and its program, and in bringing about more attention on diversity at the university that has been needed.  And I give her a great deal of credit as a one-woman team who singlehandedly almost had worked seven days a week, twelve, fifteen hours a day to see that it was possible.  She edited a book on the collection, and it come out and has been a best-seller.  The publisher, Rutgers Press, along with a museum there at the University of Delaware, are out of books; now they've sold out.  We're thinking about another printing.  But I'll tell you it's been a fantastic run or the money.  It was interesting last year when I was invited by the president and board of trustees to address incoming freshmen at the freshman convocation, four thousand of them there.  And the president and then the chairman of the board of trustees both get up and speak about the contribution I had made to the uni--university, not just the art, but in person.  And it was the chairman of the board who said for the record: here is the one man who singlehandedly has changed the direction of education here at the University of Delaware.  They are now using that by the persons who do recruitment for students, especially for minority students, at one of the biggest draws that parents and students that come in and spend a night or a weekend to look at the school go to or receptions they hold, they held there in that facility that the school spent nearly five million dollars to renovate to house the Paul Jones Collection.  And now one of the more important things is that they're looking at the Paul Jones initiative across campus, where every discipline was used, that art, that collection, and the life of Paul Jones, to build around as they promote the university and their programs.  So it's been that--there's one picture on campus under light twenty-four hours a day, under glass, on that campus.  It's not the founder; it's not the president of the institution; not the chairman of the board of trustees; it's a picture of Paul R. Jones, sits there on Main Street, in front of Old College, the oldest building on the whole school there.  And it's right at a traffic light where you have to stop.  I was at a reception at the president's home last year when the editor of the town paper came up to me and said you're Paul Jones.  I said you're right, but how did you know?  He said listen, you're probably the most recognizable face in Newark, Delaware, here at the university.  I said how so?  He said listen, we all go down Main Street and have to stop at that traffic light.  He said now I've been fighting with the city council to change the length of its hold, because I counted the seconds its, its, it goes sixty seconds plus--(unclear)--plus before it changes.  He said all we can do is turn and look out the window at your face on the campus.  So I said well, I'll run for mayor at that rate, it's so well-known.  But it shows you the kind of impact my going up there had.  What was more important was that I loaned them art for many exhibitions and for many years before I gifted them with anything.  I wanted to get a good feel of them, their intent, their seriousness, and wanted them to get a feel of me.  They would invite me up to everything.  The provost was having his annual thing for chairs of all of the departments.  I was invited, so I'd go up.  If the president was have--having a dinner for distinguished professors, I was there.  If they were having an affair for endowed chair, I'd go.  If it was a football, basketball game I was invited to, I'd be there.  But I went to everything they had, for them to get to know me, to get a feel of who I am, what I'm like, and to find out it wasn't so bad after all, but also to get to know them.  Some friendships began to develop, some support for what I was about began to gel.  And so as I went triumphantly into the University of Delaware, as a Delaware, it was interesting for me to see that art collection on my shoulders riding in also.  Both of us, the collection and myself, were accepted.
Story_ID: 136650
Speaker 1: You know, one of the other things that I was telling you that, that ties into when they were asking me about the number of conditions I had.  And I told you about wanting a place for the art to always be on exhibition.  I wanted a full-time curator.  I said you know, we've--one of my first loves would have been to see one of the HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] able to afford to take a collection and do what I wanted to see done with it.  And so I'd love to see the university collaborate with any of the HBCUs that are interested in collaborating with it, where you can exchange (unclear), exchange exhibitions, exchange students.  And they say hey, we can--came back and said, "We can do that; anything else?"  I said, you know, I've always wanted to see us begin to move toward black art not dangling on a dotted line out in left field, but woven into American art.  And you've got a reputation for having a good American art history program, and I'd love to see you weave the teaching of African American art history into American art history.  So a year or two later, they came up with a couple of courses that were team taught around the Paul Jones Collection in their art history program.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know--
Speaker 1: So that's taking place.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 136651
Speaker 1: Now one of the pioneers in terms of teaching black art history is [HM] David Driskell.  We interviewed him.  I think the first person I ever heard lecture about black art.  And in terms of--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --the history art, art history, David Driskell, when he was at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], and I think he's now at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] I believe, but we were talking off camera and I was telling you about my experiences at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], just going up there as, as an interested African American student, and finding like a sculptor--a sculpture of Daniel Payne in a--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--but Wilberforce--
Speaker 1: --storeroom when--
Speaker 2: --Wilberforce goes back so far as one of the old schools, and you know, if you had anybody doing art and doing sculpture, you would find some of it there--an amazing feat.  I don't know what the damage and what has been done to heal it, done when Wilberforce split.  And you know it split.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --the state and--
Speaker 1: --that's right, right in 1948 [sic, 1947], right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was split--
Speaker 2: Into two schools.
Speaker 1: Right.  But there, there's the Henry O. Tanner sculptures there in, in the archive of the library there.  Nobody ever sees them.
Speaker 2: And when you say that, where--it's, the, the, the library serve both, both--
Speaker 1: No, Wilberforce's library on the, on the, in the new school--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --across Highway 42.  And I'm, I'm just wondering, there, there, there was also the collection of Charles Young on campus, an African art that he brought back from Liberia.
Speaker 2: Right.  I just wondered on how many campus are there, you know, how many campuses how--have great pieces of art, you know, that--
Speaker 1: You know you have--
Speaker 2: --that, that they don't--
Speaker 1: --a number of--
Speaker 2: --that aren't really--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) black colleges and universities--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that were depositories of that art.  One of the prime examples is to look at Atlanta University [later Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], which, after it brought Hale Woodruff down here to establish an art department there and at Spelman [College, Atlanta, University], was influenced by Hale, who said to the powers to be, there's so little outlet of artists of color to exhibit or to compete, that we ought to have an annual nationally juried show for artists from all over the country.  And surprisingly, some of the best artists from all over the country would submit work.  In those days, they didn't, they didn't submit to slides or photos or other things.  They had to crate and ship that art.  And I went over there, and when I started collecting, that was one of the first places I went.  I went over and met the lady who was curating that, Norah McNiven, and amazingly said to her, Norah, I'm interested in buying art.  I'm gon' collect.  And she was so happy, so said look, I'll bring you over here as soon as we have juried art for the exhibitions, and you can then look at the show before anybody else gets in here and buy anything, and you could look at the work that wasn't juried in.  And I would sometimes buy from both groups, feeling that jurying was subjective.  And I'd find once in a while, the stuff they didn't take in are some pieces that appeal to me, and I'd buy.  But I did that every year, and developed a good relationship with her.  And Atlanta University was then paying 25, 50, 75 up to 200 dollars as the years progressed, and a certificate and a ribbon for first, second, and third prize in each category: painting, watercolor, photography, sculpture, drawings.  And these were the pieces that they acquired.  And they got a world-class collection of African American art that stayed there in the basement of the library for years under less than ideal circumstances.
Story_ID: 136652
Speaker 1: It was only when the 1995 [sic, 1996 Summer] Olympics came to Atlanta [Georgia] that there was money brought out through the Olympics to allow them to take an upper room, up near where Hale Woodruff had done some murals in the roof of the building, and made them a worldly, a nice world-class gallery.  And so, that gave us additional space to show.  But that is repeated.  Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] had a good collection of art.  A lot of scholars used to be in there.  You had the Aaron Douglases of the world there.  You had somebody like [HM David] Driskell, who you said was there for a while.  But what was so interesting was, things gradually got to a place where money was hard to come by; they would struggle to see whether they were gonna survive as a school, and art didn't take priority.  And there were pieces on the wall I heard where leaks in the building would allow water to drip down from that or from steam pipes onto some of the art, some of the murals on the walls that Aaron Douglas had produced.  Finally, somebody went in there and said let's get some, something done and see if we can restore some of this, reclaim it, some of that's been done.  Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] has some art from down through the years.  Amazingly, some of what they had was George Washington Carver paintings.  He painted, among other things, and they were hanging in the Carver Museum [Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site, Tuskegee, Alabama], falling into disrepair because the university wasn't spending money on it, and again, the steam pipes were spewing water on 'em.  Some little lady went in there by herself to try to see if she could reclaim some of 'em, restore some of 'em.  Finally I was there when Tuskegee's board decided to deed the Carver Museum, the old Oaks, which was Booker T. Washington's home, and an old plantation on the end of the campus that a white planter had deeded to them on his death, to the U.S. Park Service [sic, National Park Service].  They came in and said they were gonna spend money to bring those places up to where they should be, keep a staff there all the time to do--conduct tours.  And I will never forget one day in an office--I was working at Tuskegee then as the director of public information--the doors swung open, and P. H. Polk came by to see me.  He was happy.  He said you know, I just came from the Carver Museum, talking with the park service people.  They said listen, we understand you shot George Washington Carver more than anyone else, said go through all your negatives, and get every one you've got on Carver, and give us a photograph of that.  He said this is the biggest commission I've had in a long time.  And so as he was leaving and pulling the door to, I caught the knob before it closed, said whoa.  I said if you're going to do a set for the federal government, do two sets.  I'll take the other.  And that was when I began to collect P. H. Polk photographs.
Speaker 2: Now this is what, what, what year is this?  Is this in the '60s [1960s] or--
Speaker 1: No, '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Seventies [1970s], okay.
Speaker 1: --latter part of the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Story_ID: 136653
Speaker 1: There's got to be a lot of hidden art treasures out here, especially on those black campuses and--
Speaker 2: But there are--
Speaker 1: --black institutions and--
Speaker 2: You know, you've got those kinds of things that--
Speaker 1: --churches, and--
Speaker 2: --one of the schools that's been trying to do something with what they had inherited was, is Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], who has put money into further buying, who's renovated a building that's a museum on the campus, who's hired staff to be there, who are now are taking a publication that someone was doing independently into the, you know, the school there now, and they publish it, their quarterly.  And it's a pretty good scholarly publication.  So, you, you've got little things beginning to happen.  I made a suggestion at a talk I gave here recently at the, at MOCA GA., the Museum of Modern--of Contemporary Art [Museum of Contemporary Art of Georgia, Atlanta, Georgia], Georgia, on Peachtree Street [Atlanta, Georgia].  And I'd loaned to them, along with Atlanta Life [Insurance Company] and Atlanta University [later Clark Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia], from their collections on all of the old art--(unclear)--days.  And I said what powerful impact we'd have if you could go to these various black colleges and universities and get the best of that art, put it under some conservation program, and see that it's brought up to snuff, and then do a good book or catalog on it, and travel that (unclear) amazing exhibition as a blockbuster around the country.  It could raise funds for these schools.  It can educate those who aren't educated, to a contribution made by people.  And it's just planting those kinds of ideas that I hope one day will bring us to that point.
Story_ID: 136654
Speaker 1: Now what advice do you have for artists?  Now, artists are getting a little bit more sophisticated than they used to be.  For instance, there is a story I just wanted to throw out--
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: --'cause--for you to respond to.  [HM] Paul Goodnight in Boston [Massachusetts] was, was naive about his work at one point, but he's to the point now where, when he sketches, the sketches fall on the floor and stuff.  They fall--he, he walks on 'em and everything, but he sells the, each sketch for a couple of hundred dollars--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, before he even does a painting.  So, when he works on a painting, he sketches over and over again.  He does maybe, you know, scores of sketches, and there're people that come in and buy 'em off the floor, you know, and frame 'em.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: It's a--you know, so he's--
Speaker 2: As you say, the, the, they are becoming more sophisticated, or another way of looking at it, the art world is evolving; it's changing.  Artist, forget about color for a moment, have come from painting, drawing, or sculpting, photography, or whatever it does, and taking pride in that, getting a price for it, or putting it in an institution, or putting it in a gallery that represents them and selling it, to saying hey, I can take this and do fifty prints or a hundred prints off of it.  Whether they're buying when a Goodnight falls on the floor, or he steps on it, or it's down there, it's a sketch of his, but it's got his signature.  And they're buying his signature.  It's like saying hey, I'd taken anything [Pablo] Picasso could run his fingers into and put on canvas as long as he signed it.  But there's a difference, if you truly wanna look at the world of art, or fine art, and on collecting signatures, and/or the lesser of the art by some of the better artists.  And some do better work at some time than they did at other times.  And you've gotta be sophisticated as we continue to grow to that.  What has been healthy, as you mentioned, is by artists of color is that, they've begun to look at the art world and see what others have been doing out there.  And they say hey, we can go and study print making and you know, instead of people having to pay me 3,000, 5,000,  10,000 for this painting it took me so long to produce, if I've got a hundred prints at 300, multiply that and I've done all right when I've sold that.  And 300 is in the reach of so many more people to purchase it, signed, and numbered, and limited as a print, and has my signature on it.
Story_ID: 136655
Speaker 1: So, is--what would you advise artists to do, black artists to do these days in terms of making sure their work is sold?  Is that, is that what--that, that, that's certainly one of the things, right, to, to produce--
Speaker 2: Well, you know--
Speaker 1: --prints--
Speaker 2: --I, I don't find universally that every artist just creates work just to sell.  I've seen artists who've been so caught up with all that they produce that they've kept it close to the vest.  I went into Lois Jones home in Washington, D.C.  She taught for years at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  Lois had a very nice home in a very lovely section of residential area of Washington.
Speaker 1: This is Lois Mailou Jones?
Speaker 2: That's correct.  Her place from basement, to entry level, to upstairs attic, was wall to wall hung salon style art by Lois Jones, okay.  I don't know what the estate is doing with it, and if they've settled that.  I understand they finally have reached some accord on it, so we'll see what happens.  But artists generally want recognition.  They want to sell.  If would be nice if they didn't have to say I gotta go teach at high school to (unclear) a living and a check, or a college, or to work at a gallery or some art related field, or sometimes not even art related field, and then get the energy to come in and paint, and draw, and sculpt.  But very few artists reach that point.  Jacob Lawrence, powerhouse, and his wife, [Gwendolyn] Gwen Knight, both deceased now, moved from a place they loved, New York City, to go to Seattle, Washington, completely across country from--one ocean to the other, because he had been offered a decent job and a decent salary at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].  And it meant a study income, living differently, living better, not having to wait to see whether somebody bought the last the paintings I did, the last prints I created.  And so if he had to do that, imagine what other artists have to do.  So, when you say they're getting more sophisticated, they're finding, yes, we can do what they call giclees now; we can do fine art prints, which are limited in editions, and a pulled on stones.  And finally by doing this, we reach a larger body of people at prices within more range of a lot of people, and so we make more money that way, and a better living, and we get out work out.  Charles Bibb[s], out of California, made himself a millionaire off of prints.  Bibb's been able to accumulate a list of people around the country who got little places where they sell art, where they sell prints, where you say hey, I'm gonna do this edition, nine hundred or a thousand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I want to write all of 'em and say here's a picture of the latest print I got, at such a such a price.  One will want one, one will want three, one will want five.   And before you know it, all nine hundred or a thousand of them have been subscribed to.  He doesn't have to get out there and sell 'em one at a time himself, and he moves on to the next project.
Speaker 1: Tell me now--
Speaker 2: Business of art we're talking about and the politics of art.
Story_ID: 136656
Speaker 1: Do you make a distinction between what they, they're calling naive art.  And you--we were talking about a subjectivity in terms of a jury looking at, at a, at a--
Speaker 2: Great.
Speaker 1: --batch of art.  There is art--I know there, there was recently an exhibit at the, I think at the Studio Museum of Harlem [sic, Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] of what they called people's art.  I mean some of the artists, some of the residents of New York City, the people of Harlem that just, they do the calendars and the, and the, the paintings of big-eyed kids, and paintings on black velvet, and all kinds of things like that.  You know, but who's to say--you know, and, and then there are the collections that are in the House of Blues and other, the blues places, where they collect--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --all this art from the--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --South, and they bring it up, and the stuff that nobody considers that valuable down there.  But when you get it up and put it in the House of Blues, it's worth, you know, a lot of money.  Now, who--do you make a distinction yourself between what's naive, and what is not, and what is, what is fine--you know, or some things not fine art because they are simply not, becau--you know, are they based on a standard, or what, what are we--
Speaker 2: I find that the common definition of naive art versus this fine art is that it's done by a person's--(unclear)--untrained artists, folk artists.  And so these persons who have some innate talent offering to work with found objects, pen thrown around on the side of the road, paper bags--(unclear)--(unclear)--archival, cardboard, which has got acid in it.  (Unclear)--ways of looking at this thing.  I think each, in their own way, contribute and have talent.  And I, I look at a story of--(unclear)--it's getting (unclear) to a guy named Thornton Dial, in a little place like Bessemer, Alabama, used to be on the side of the road, and what he'd find he'd paint on and sell for little of nothing.  Fellow named Bill Arnett, finds out about him, goes over and begins to buy up his stuff, and then says, I'll be back next week, next two weeks, see what you've got.  And here, I'm gonna leave you some better paper to draw on and some paints to paint with.  Now is he still that naive artist, or is he still the same artist he was?  Who knows?  That's the same one that '60 Minutes' a few years ago did an expose on and said hey, I thought you said you had bought Thornton Dial a fine home over there on the lake in Bessemer, Alabama.  You said that's where he's living (unclear)--it's true.  He said well, we went to the courthouse, and here's the records in the courthouse that says it's in your name.  He said oh, I put it in my name so that they couldn't take it away from him, and Thornton is living there, and living better than he'd ever lived before.  But the property is in Bill Arnett's name.  Now, what are we to say?  There are people who used to say hey, it was Nellie Mae Rowe, sitting here in Smyrna, Georgia, right here on the side of the road, selling for ten, fifteen dollars apiece, her little work; wealthy woman up here who's named Julie Alexander--who died recently--found her and said hey, I wanna bring you up in a gallery I'm opening up, and sell your work up there.  And so she'd go and pick up work from Nellie Mae, and pretty soon she became the controlling Nellie Mae's of the world, got a big show out for her, got her into the museums, gave some to some of 'em, and made her a star, put a price tag on her work that's higher than some trained artists get now for their work.  How much it benefited Nellie Mae?  Who knows.  Would Nellie Mae have ever benefited, had it not been for Julie Alexander?  Who knows.  Would Thornton Dial have made it if Bill Arnett hadn't come along?  Did Bill take advantage of him, or did he help him?  It's all in the eyes of the beholder.  Now back to what you're talking about, you know, you've got to decide what you wanna collect.  Some people were collecting a little of this and a little of that, so they're eclectic, so I'll buy a little art by folk artists, or untrained artists, or naive artists, whatever you wanna call.  And I'll buy some by other people appeal to me or there affordable art.  Lots of people initially got it on the naive or the folk art because it was affordable art.  If you can find a Nellie Mae Rowes of the world sitting on the side of the road selling stuff for ten, fifteen, or twenty-five dollars, versus 2500 [dollars] for somebody else sitting in a gallery where the gallery owner's gon' get 50 percent of what it brings, and your pocket dictates that you buy over here off the road instead of out of the gallery, what are you gonna do?
Story_ID: 136657
Speaker 1: So there's many reasons, but I mentioned earlier key things we forget.  We always talk about art, look at the aesthetics of art, and as we talk about it, and appreciating it, and enjoying it and its cultural attributes, I say we gotta look, as a group, hard at the business of art and the politics of art.  How is it that a fellow named [Jean-Michel] Basquiat goes to auction at Sotheby's or Christie's, and brings over a million dollars a whop on anything it sells, when he has--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--
Speaker 1: --spent the better part of his life under cardboard on the streets and sidewalks of New York [city] doing graffiti.  And he's selling for more than [Henry O.] Tanner, Charles White, Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden-[Edward Mitchell] Bannister, [Robert] Duncanson, (unclear).  But who owns most of his work?  Who (unclear) at (unclear) or Wright?  They touted to collectors here and in Europe, predominantly with collectors.  They own 95--8 percent of his work, and so they make a market.  Who then does a write-up on him?  Who does the review in the papers and in the New York Times and the Washington Posts of the world?  Hmm?  Who are those reviewers?  How many of 'em were colored?  How many of 'em were black?  How many are African American?
Speaker 2: I think zero.
Speaker 1: Where do we go then when we begin to look at appraising art, hmm?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: To the same--
Speaker 1: --you appraised.
Speaker 2: --to those same people.
Speaker 1: And who are these museums getting to appraise, white, black, or indifferent?  Who's gonna appraise for these wealthy people who are buying these pieces of art?  And--(unclear)--of being fed by that hand, they're not gonna bite the hands that feeds them.  They get the kinds of appraisal they probably would want, right, so that they keep on appraising for them.
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: Do you understand?
Speaker 2: I understand exactly--
Speaker 1: The market so we need--
Speaker 2: --what you're saying.
Speaker 1: --more appraisers.
Speaker 2: And I--
Speaker 1: We need more people who're reviewing art.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We need more art critics.  We need more art history writing about it.
Story_ID: 136658
Speaker 1: But we can't forget the--why does the museum down here buy--and I said to the High [Museum of Art, Atlanta, Georgia] once, why are you spending five hundred thousand dollars on the lesser piece by several white artists over here, and you buy more over here, then plus for somebody else's, and that's not his best work?  And I said you never will be at Metropolitan Museum [of Art] like in New York [City] or the Smithsonian.  I said look, you know, with the money you're spending, that money would buy you probably some of the best African American art out there now.  And you can become known for having the best African American art collection in the country, in the world, and still have your other shows, your other exhibits, and other art that people are gifting to you, bequeathing you--couldn't see it--running a little late, behind times now, but just, just getting to see what I'm talking about, but afraid to touch it.  I said once to the director when I went on the board of the High, walked into his office one day and sat straight across from him like we are sitting.  I said without you becoming a flaming liberal, is there anything moderately you can do to see an occasional exhibit by somebody who's black, or weave some of 'em into some of your group shows?  He said Jones, who put this roof over my head, who put this here for the art world, who pays my salary, who keeps the air conditioning on, he said when that changes, when you, you begin to give some money, you can begin to dictate who gets some of the shows.  Again, we're talking the politics of art, the business of art.  What happens when a guy has been enamored--(unclear), or (unclear) for that matter, with an artist, and they buy up a lot of his work?  They become patriots.  You know, they sponsor him.  So he's sitting on fifty or a hundred pieces of this guy's work, he said well, I'm on the board down here.  And I'm a patron at the museum, so I'll give them a couple of pieces of it, right?  And then I'll go over here to the Carlos Museum at Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia] and I'll give them a couple.  And then there's one up in New York, I'll give him--pretty soon he can come back and say look, this artist is museum quality.  He said how's that?  He said hey, he's got a couple of pieces in the High Museum; he's got a couple of pieces over there at the Carlos; he's got a couple of pieces up in New York at the contemporary museum--(unclear)--Mona-MoMa [Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York], yeah--politics of art, business of art, never, ever doubt.  And the sooner we can get in that, better be.  You talked about, saying there were a lot of good artists would never get recognized.  I contend we turn that around.  And I think the sophisticated collector or collectors now of color can make an artist, given that he's talented, mature, knows how to paint.  There's nothing with each one of you buying one, each one of you puttin' em in your collection, each one of you donating it to whatever museum you're on the board of.  And before you know it, you're out there talking about him, talking about (unclear) him up, being written about.
Speaker 2: What we're saying--
Speaker 1: You make him what you want him to be.  What do you think is happening on these others?  We gotta go way back to the Vatican.  What were they doing with the, the [Leonardo] da Vincis of the world and all 'em, but paying them, and sponsoring them, and subsidizing them (laughter) to paint, right?  What do we do a little bit of when we had the WPA [Works Progress Administration]?  In a lesser way it was the same thing.  They would get a check to subsist off of, and they were creating work.
Story_ID: 136659
Speaker 1: Now, I was just gonna say that what we're saying and what, what it boils down to is that the, the art establishment can make an artist.  They can make someone who's not an artist an artist, or, or make an artist an artist, or--
Speaker 2: That's exactly--
Speaker 1: --or either one they wanna do--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: Such--that and--
Speaker 1: Because they have the power to--
Speaker 2: --circumstance, that's true.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have the power to do it.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: [Jean-Michel] Basquiat was--I remember [HM] Jeff Donaldson would--took umbrage, you know, Jeff Donaldson used to be at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], in charge of--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --the art department.
Speaker 2: --museum.
Speaker 1: He took umbrage to the fact that Basquiat was such a big hit in New York, [City, New York] sponsored by Andy Warhol and all of them.  He's a guy who, they dress him in a tuxedo, and he'd come into a reception barefooted, in dreadlocks and you know.  It was like a cult of personality around him, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: [phone ringing]
Story_ID: 136660
Speaker 1: We were talking about naive art, and now we were--and I was suggesting that some of the gallery owners I've met and talked to and, and artists that have been trained and gone to the universities and stuff take umbrage at the idea of this naive art, and kind of resent the artist on some level.  Now what you were giving us, me the explanation of why that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was trying to drive hard the fact that, historically, a lot of those who have paid the price of getting the credentials they've heard you needed to excel in their profession of art, have gone and got a bachelor of fine arts, and many of them have gone on to get a master's of fine arts, which is a terminal degree in art, only to come back after being trained in painting, or sculpting, or drawing, or watercolors, or whatever, to find that collectors out there are suddenly turning toward the naive, untrained, folk art, buying up their works, in preference to the trained artists of color.  Is it deliberate?  Is it unintentional?  Comes out the same way; they've turned their back on the others after they've paid the price and they, they thought had to be paid to qualify, and yet not be accepted into the groups that these gallery owners have taken in as their schools of artists, and not being given the exhibitions in museums and galleries around the country.  Pretty soon he gets disillusioned.  And so you begin to see the response to the naive artists that you see by many of them.
Story_ID: 136661
Speaker 1: Now what has been your interaction with the National Conference of Artists?  Do you interact with the, with them as a group, as an organization?
Speaker 2: Off and on some, keep a dotted line relationship with them, received from them in New York [City, New York] at the Metropolitan Museum [of Art, New York, New York] last year an outstanding award for a lifetime contribution to the arts.  And yet, I have felt it has been so much of a fraternity, a sorority for these people who year after year come together with each other to compare notes that they've needed to move it to a level where they used that organization to bring technique and know-how style to what they were doing in order to promote their works among each other in the context they collectively had.  It's part of why I've seen it dwindle in its numbers and its membership, and as the older founding heads have drifted off from us and from that leadership, has been impacted.  And so now I understand at the meeting there's a chance for them to try to begin to turn things around and revitalize the board, but if they aren't careful, they may have locked themselves into some of the same old ways of doing things.  They've got to have some new ways of doing some new things and some new ways of doing some of the old things.  There's a great need for organization among them.  But, if it should be a professional organization, that every time they come together or to bring the kinds of the people together who can teach them something about art conservation, techniques if they're painters, merchandising if they're out to sell their work and get it out for the public, how to pick and choose and relate to a gallery, the kinds of things that's gonna enable him to be successful.  And so that's my take on it.  I would hope that there's some hope for them, if new leadership, new energy is put into it, and we can begin to move it in some new directions.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: Same thing happens with any group--(unclear)--you--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because the National Association of Museum, Minority Museum of African American Museum Association [sic, Association of African American Museums] just about died on the vine almost and now beginning to come back a little.  But they had such a great opportunity.  But they didn't do anything but take a show and run it from one of their museums to another; they would get circulation.  But there are struggles, one for funding to main for themselves, funds to always buy art from their permanent collection so they would have a collection of their own, buildings that would allow them to have it in the right climate, right conditions, security, and staffing that didn't turn over.  It was awesome because they were poorly paid, if at all, so that we began, did all of that before they're accredited.  It's a sad day, but I can tell you there hasn't been one black museum that has been accredited up until this year.  Now there are three.
Speaker 1: What are those three?
Speaker 2: Well, the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York City, New York], the Birmingham civil rights museum [Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, Birmingham, Alabama], and the Memphis civil rights museum [National Civil Rights Museum, Memphis, Tennessee].  And that's where we are at this point.
Speaker 1: I know you're right.
Speaker 2: Right.  I'm hoping that consciousness will bring it to a point where something's going to be done.
Story_ID: 136662
Speaker 1: You know, one footnote to all that we're about discussing is that I think we're reaching a point where others--when I say others, other than African Americans--are beginning to be attracted to African American art, and are giving it the opportunity for expression and exhibition and shows, giving it recognition in prize-winning circumstances, and giving it recognition by purchasing it for permanent connections, either as a collector or as an institution that collects.  I think the opposite of that is happening, and that is that we're gonna see among minority, especially among black, make a move to collect more, but to broaden the base of collecting just African American artists, but to begin to collect art by artists across the board.  Some of that is taking place already.  I'm sitting here with an African American collection, donated African American art to the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware] for the good of African American artists in the African American community in the art world around the country.  And yet in my home, there's work by [Willem] De Kooning hanging, there's work by [Robert] Mapplethorpe hanging, and there are photographs down there by major photographers who are not African American that I've got.  And I'm thinking we may see that.  So we've got a whole new world unfolding as we go.  More people aware, and collecting, and buying, and supporting African American art, more African Americans aware of art and beginning to buy African American art, but other art also, Latin American.  It starts out with them having gone to the Caribbean, so they get Caribbean art, justifying it as being part of the diaspora.  We go to Africa, that's an expression of diaspora, but then you get Latin American art; you get Asian or Chinese art, when you know--the first thing you know, (unclear) European art, and there you go.  But the question becomes, is that healthy?  Is that good?  And the verdict is out on it.  But what would have been the circumstance, had a Paul Jones decided I'm gonna go out here and collect as best I can, with the resources I've mustered, the best art, and what the best people in the arts claim is the best art, which would be in many instances non-African American.  What would I be now sitting on?  A wealth of art or less wealth than I've got in the art that I've collected, but it will appreciate it ten times, ten times, ten times, till a hundred times?  Or would it never have appreciated, or hardly appreciated?  Those are the questions that we had to face.  Why do we collect?  We collect because we wanna be proud; there's race consciousness; we wanna be supportive; we want a heritage; we wanna protect it; we wanna instill it in our children.  Or is it we wanna invest, see appreciation, and develop something that pays off later for us, allows us to live a good life, to retire comfortably?  Or can it be both?  It doesn't have to be either or.  Those are the kinds of questions that face us, as you talk about revitalized NCA, a National Council of Artist or African American Museum Association [sic, Association of African American Museums], or as we weave ourselves into the larger Museum Associations--the American Museum Association--(unclear) of Artists.  And (unclear) assume our rightful places, more and more of us getting on boards of museums as trustees, going to these conferences.  Those are the kinds of things that aren't too far down the road.  They're facing us now, and we've gotta come to grips with them and develop strategy, policy, if indeed it's going to be a good and healthy for art period and for the African American artist, African American collector, African American boy and girl, children, and culture.  And when I say African American culture, I underline American.  We're talking American culture.  It's just that it needs its deserved right place in American way of life.
Story_ID: 136663
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.
Speaker 2: Shoot.
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community in general today?
Speaker 2: My hope is that the African American community looks introspectively at itself.  And while taking some pride and satisfaction of accomplishment against odds, make less excuse of lack of accomplishment by the broad numbers, and put more focus on programming, training, exposure that would allow for a broader base to be able to step up competitively and earn their place, contribute also, and to enjoy a good life.  Those are the things that I wish, so that we move toward, in a country that--like ours, that faces the odds it does around the world today, where that image we might have one time enjoyed, has been questioned, is being questioned, it being challenged, that it becomes more important than ever that whites and blacks lay aside whatever differences have kept them from coming together as they should, and begin to gel so that we have a stronger nation, and allow everybody who has talent, to contribute.  What happens if a handful of white American males, all we've had in the sciences and the maths, with a sprinkling of others?  We were locked out, the majority, when you take females, and blacks, and Latins, and then others.  Asians have been leaned on so much in this country.  We've gone all the way (unclear) and getting Indians who've come in here, and now they've gone back home because we're outsourcing stuff over there.  We're at a critical point in the country where the African American needs to step forward, but the rest of the nation needs to step forward and lock step and together make for a new day in this country, where we can have the kind of leadership we need.  We need to start early with our children, otherwise it's gonna be tough.  We're facing some challenges that are going to really be serious challenges, and we don't have the leadership and training for it.  We've seen ships in the world.  We'd talk now if you listen to a CNBC about a giant called China raising its head.  (Unclear)--India, the population it's got, and what happens there.  We're looking at an Arab world where oil that we get has suddenly began to double in price.  Who knows when it'll triple?  Who knows when it'll be cut off?  Those are the kind of things that make us have to look at--put all the talent that we can get together, so that they can begin to see that we can get into research laboratories, get into the colleges and universities where its climate is such that we can create.  It is a folly if we're gonna continue to deny to the George Washington Carvers of the world an opportunity to contribute.
Story_ID: 136664
Speaker 1: Okay, when you look back at everything that you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: I've been happy with things I've done.  There are some things I look back on and because of circumstances, situations, might have been tempted toward to do a bit differently.  I think, while I have sought to never let race play into me not being able to do what I wanted to, or the contributors I've wanted to, that it had had to crept in, in ways that I've allowed it to limit what I think I might have done that might have made what I've contributed look small by comparison.
Story_ID: 136665
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you look back at everything you've done up to this point, again, what would you consider to be today your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think I have tried to live a life coming out of a small, Southern, segregated, mining camp community, and showing that you can be somebody.  I have wanted to be remembered for having accepted challenge after, after challenge, after challenge.  And while, as they used to say, you had to be twice as good, I've managed to be able to measure up to being as good as anyone else that I've worked with.  And sometimes I used to shake my head and used to be reminded that I wondered how others got here (laughter)--(unclear)--don't see them with what I think they ought to have to have got here, other than the fact that our skin's a little different.  But I wanna be able to be remembered more for having tried to lay aside what might have been bitterness and resentment because of circumstances, and have stepped forward and to work across the board in circumstances that made me able to help persons who were less fortunate than myself, to contribute to people you may feel they were somebody, that long afterwards they never forget that, and they'd move on to do things, and more than that, to be able through the legacy of what I've done professionally and, and the philanthropy that I've exuded in giving art and money, to have left behind for all to see that a person of my circumstances could rise to that point, and of my color, could also contribute not having to be a Mellon or a Rockefeller, to have collected art, to have set up a family fund, to be thrifty and to save and then to share that with good causes that I felt were good for the largest number of people.  And I'm hoping I'll be remembered long after I'm gone by those who can visit a University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware] or wherever Paul Jones has left some of what he's collected, his papers, other things, so that they can remember that was made possible by a man who did it on a shoestring, and that they too can do it.  And I hope that serves as an encouragement and incentive for lots of others.
Story_ID: 136666
Speaker 1: Not, not to be crass, but you know, I didn't ask this question.  And I, and it just dawned on me that I might, I probably should.  How--can you put a, a dollar amount on your collection?  I mean what, what, what, what would you think--or I know you just made a big donation, but what, what is, what, what do you think is the dollar amount of the work that you've collected?
Speaker 2: It's a touch, sub--subjective thing, and I've had things--I've had appraisals; I've had my own worth and what I've invested, I've had to change to get appreciation.  I'd have to say that it is a continuing escalating thing that would have given doesn't stop at the value of what it was when I gave, that next year, next five year, next ten years, next twenty years it'll be worth so much more.  I was interested the revitalization of the magazine Savoy, which in the first issue, came out with an article on the Paul Jones Collection and its gift to the University of Delaware, and having been a twenty million dollar collection.  I've had Arts and Antiques [Art & Antiques] describe it as one of the hundred top collections in the country.  I've had pieces that I've sold from the collection, that I've been able to sell at 20, 30, 40 times what I paid for it; it's been appreciation.  And so I've looked at what it's done for me in terms of contributing and leaving something that will grow.  And it's the same thing you did with the Braun Collection.  And a man bought some art when he could buy it and afford it and put it on his walls of the home he left it in.  And now today it's considered one of the most priceless collections of first impressionist art.  It has appreciated to that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's why, how I described what I've done.  I've been thrifty.  I've saved.  I've made money, lost money, gambled investments, made money in investments, and tried to use that wisely.  And as a result of that, I've taken what I've gotten from stock markets, properties invested in, and tried to maximize that in my giving so that it had some impact.  And that's, to me, part of help, what helps you leave some kind of legacy.
Story_ID: 136667
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell us about your family.  Now, you've, you've got a son, I know, and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Are there any more children?  Now tell us about them.
Speaker 2: Only, only the one child [Paul R. Jones, Jr.].  He's a grown man.  He's living in California.  Mother died and left her estate to him.  And he told me he'd always wanted to live on the beach, on the ocean, and so he moved out of an apartment building that he had inherited from his mother, and moved out to a place on the ocean, and has been living out there at Hermosa Beach [California] a few years.  Before that, he had been very active as a person in the Internet.  He--programming and other things for Hughes Aircraft [Company] and others.  But in addition, I had a very lovely mother [Ella Reed Jones], father [William Jones], both of who made me feel very secure as I grew up, very warm, very loving.  And I felt I could do what I wanted to do, can achieve what I wanted, go where I wanted; four older sisters, and they always wanted a brother, so they helped see that I get all the things I could imagine I wanted and some I didn't, and also love and affection, which was important to me as I grew up.  And I hope that is some of what I've spread that came from that kind of a closer knit, warm, caring family.
Speaker 1: Now is there anything that we have not asked you that we, that we, that's left out that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I think you pretty well covered most of it, and a career of professional work in a variety of governments.  It's been one in politics that I've had some interest in.  And it's also been one of indulging in those things I've loved to do, like collect art, that I've spent a lot of time in doing.  And it's been a lot of helping others get into doing some of that that I've been able to do.  One of the most interesting things that I ran into, there's people who used to flow through my house to see my collection, to see the art.  But after taking a person through the house one day, looking at the art and seeing them to the door, they said, when did you find time to do all of this art?  I said it hasn't been easy (laughter).
Story_ID: 136668
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to the--
Speaker 2: Your, your question.
Speaker 1: --is similar to legacy, but it's--and you've, you, I think you've almost answered it.  People answer the two questions almost the same sometimes, but it's a little different.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered, sir?
Speaker 2: As honest, and as a friend, and a man who's been as comfortable down on Auburn Avenue here in the pool room in Atlanta [Georgia], as I am at a steak dinner at the White House, and where I felt at home in both places and loved the people around me in both circumstances; wanna be remembered as a person who wants to be remembered for caring, and loving, and giving, and hopefully contributing.
Speaker 1: All right, sir, thank you very much for spending--
Speaker 2: My pleasure.
Speaker 1: --the time.
Speaker 2: --this has been a tremendous--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --experience for me with you.
Speaker 1: Me too.
Story_ID: 136669
Speaker 1: The photograph is of myself, Paul R. Jones, and my son, Paul R. Jones, Jr.  He loves to be called P. R., and certainly doesn't particularly don't wanna be called Junior.  But he is the love of my life and, and has moved to California years ago--(unclear)--back and forth between her and with me.  And he more recently, in the last couple of years, moved out to the Baldwin Hills section of Los Angeles [California] to Hermosa Beach [California], where he'd always wanted to go.  And he's lived on the beach for the last couple of years.  And I think from, according to the last call I got from him, he's ready to start looking for a home out in the Valley for himself now.  So he wants me to come out and check out what he's been looking at, give him the sanction, and move on from there.  But we've had lots of good times together, and older we both got the closest I think we've come, and that's been good for me.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a photograph of my first wife, LoRetta Lee Jones and our son, Paul R. Jones, Jr., and loved them both.  They're beautiful people, and memories of good times together.
Speaker 2: About what year?
Speaker 1: Taken back--well, my son, who's now forty-eight, look like he's about six or seven, five or six, so we take it from there.
Speaker 2: This is a photograph of my oldest sister, Sally, collecting named Safronia [ph.] Phillips.  And she had left home and was living and working in Cincinnati, Ohio, and that's where that picture was taken.  Interesting (unclear)--you might note to the old photographers took pride in being able to hand paint a number of their photographs, and this is one of those that I've kept and treasured.
Speaker 1: Photograph of Paul, Sr. and LoRetta.  This a happy time for both of us.  We had just gotten married, and we'd gone into a booth, and for a quarter, gotten our roll of film.  And this was blown up from that.  That's LoRetta with an L-O [capital] R-E-T-T-A, Lee Jones.
Speaker 2: Both my mother [Ella Reed Jones] and father [William Jones] had been married once before marrying, and I was the only child born to them.  This was my father's son by his first wife, Joe.  Joe was much older, and had moved, and who was married and had raising a family in New York [City].  And I went up to live with him after they had visited him and found they liked the schools up there better than they did the segregated schools in the South that I was attending.  So for about three years, I was in New York, (unclear) was school here and back home in the South during the summer, so I had a foot in the North and a foot in the South.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  And when was this photo taken?
Speaker 2: That photo was taken in recent years.  My brother was proud of his, leaving his home and moving into assisted living.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is my, the next to the youngest of my sister.  We called her Pip.  She's Luella, L-U-E-L-L-A, Phillips.  And Pip went on after college to become supervisor of education for the county, and--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: --and then later moved to Chicago [Illinois], unfortunately was killed there years ago when a gas truck hit a public bus, and thirty-some people were killed.
Speaker 1: When did that happen?
Speaker 2: Back in 1949.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of the really, the original Blues Brothers, Paul and Paul.  That's Paul, Sr. and Paul, Jr.  We used to get together every year where they'd visit me, and we'd go down for our annual photograph.  And that year he said let's slap these glasses on, and we did, and the rest is history.
Speaker 2: You're looking at Paul, Jr., PR again, as he puts on his famous winning smile.  And he's readying himself to get ready to go out and conquer the world.
Speaker 1: Last year I had the pleasure of attending the Trumpet Awards in Atlanta [Georgia], where people from all over the country came in and--(unclear)--and honored those who were the recipients of the year's honors.  And it was my pleasure to sit at a table next to the Williams sisters [Venus Williams and Serena Williams], who I found very charming, as charming as they are, good at playing tennis.  And so, at their insistence, I stood up and posed for them with this picture here so that they would have something to remember me by.
Speaker 2: Serena Williams and--
Speaker 1: That Serena on the left and her sister [Venus Williams] on the right.
Speaker 2: You're looking at my brother, who I lived with, with he and his family in New York--here's Joe.  Joe and I had a good relationship, stayed in touch with each other, visited with each other, was supportive of each other.  And for so many years, I found him very supportive of things that I did, and tried in my own way to be supportive of things he did.  He left the post office and retired and then went into business for himself as a magazine distributor, did a great deal of distributing of--works all over Long Island [New York, New York] and developed quite a business for himself.
Speaker 1: This is probably the lady who has had more impact on my life than anyone else, my mother, Ella Reed Phillips Jones.  My mother was not only beautiful, but was kind, and sweet, and gentle Sunday school teacher, a church lover, and good cook, one of the best gardeners, flowers and vegetables, in our community, and each year would win the prize that they gave in the community for best flower garden and best vegetable garden.
Speaker 2: At the museum this is called, with me, Paul Jones, Sr., at the High Museum [of Art, Atlanta, Georgia], standing there as we were about to go in to meet with Jacob Lawrence and to view in a ceremony for patrons the show of his that was traveling around the country, was about to open at the High Museum.
Speaker 1: And what year is this?
Speaker 2: That was in the latter part of the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: You're looking at my oldest sister, Sally, Safronia, and again, one of those that I chose to keep for myself because it was a hand painted colored, and obviously is a good piece to keep of what was at one time very important aspect of photography for those who had studios.
Speaker 2: You're looking at an interesting subject here, in that it is an autographed photograph from George Wallace to me, Paul Jones, in the capitol of the State of Alabama in Montgomery [Alabama].  And this was after George Wallace had been shot.  I am literally stooping down behind his desk so that I don't tower above him as I stand and he sits, because he had been injured and could not stand on his own.  Later developed a friendship and was invited by George to the Southern Governors' Conference [later, Southern Governors' Association] as the only person of color when he was chairman of the Southern Governors' Conference.
Speaker 1: That photo there was by Clarissa Sligh, well known, nationally known, in fact, photographer who'd gotten a grant to go around the country and do some shooting.  And she chose to shoot me.  In this particular one, she wanted to shoot my hand holding the photograph of my son on the left and of my son and myself on the right.  That made several publications as she finished up her project, and it had note around the country.  And she was kind enough to gift me with a, one of them for having posed for her for that photograph and others.
Speaker 2: You're looking at the two Pauls again, Paul, Sr. and Paul, Jr., and of course, he's standing behind me with hands on my shoulder, and I'm smiling and he is too.  I think we were both happy.  We were happy being with each other and happy again to have come together annually for our photographs as we both grew.
Speaker 1: This photograph was taken at the same time as the previous one.  As you can see, we had, we're joined by a third person, [HM] Amalia Amaki, who has been a longtime friend of the family.  In fact, we've about sworn each other into each other's family so that we're like family.  She was here with Paul, Jr. and Paul, Sr. and is adding a little bit of beauty and spice to the photograph.
Speaker 2: This photograph was taken in Trenton, New Jersey, at the home of, home studio of a friend who collects art and who fancies himself as a photographer, and said he wanted to shoot me as he saw me.  And of course he did, and I liked the photograph.  And he sent me that, and I've treasured it down through the years.  And as you can see, he does love art.  You can see from the piece behind me on the wall.
Speaker 1: You've got me here shortly after I had come back from working and living in Washington, D.C., and had moved to Peachtree Street here in Atlanta.  It was in my apartment there.  And you can see some of the art that I've collected on the wall.  What you're looking at in the lady right at my head is my second wife.  And that was a piece she'd had drawn by artist friend and gifted me with.  And the piece above that of the nude was a piece I'd gotten from a dealer in Bangkok, Thailand, when I lived there and used to visit them and buy art from them.
Speaker 2: This is a photograph of really a drawing of Paul R. Jones, Jr., my son, P.R.  And it was done in 1997 by Amos Ashanti Johnson, who had gone out and spent a year living with P.R. and came back wanting to bring me something, and so did this of P.R. out there and came back and surprised me with it.  And I've cherished it ever since.  Incidentally, I've collected Amos Ashanti Johnson's work down through the years, almost sponsored him for several years, and probably have more of his art than any other single person or institution in the country.  I considered him along with two other people one of the best draftsman I've ever collected, he, Charles White, and [Herman] Kofi Bailey.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA CONVERSATION)
Speaker 2: This is a drawing of my father done by Amos Ashanti Johnson in 1989.  He knew that I wanted something that would remind me of him.  And I had a photograph of him that my brother and I had to take and have redone because of it in such crumpled condition.  From that renewed photograph, it was Ashanti Johnson produced this superb drawing of my father.  He did two of them when he did this so that my son would have one as a gift to him, and this one was for me.  And as you can see, he did himself proud, and my dad good, and made me a happy man.
Speaker 1: Is this charcoal?
Speaker 2: It is.
