Story_ID: 197087
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask you about your family history. I'm gonna ask about your mother's side and your father's [Paul King, Sr.] side of your family.  We'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Frances Ruth Lindsey King.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was born--
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us, the--
Speaker 2: Lindsey?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: L-I-N-D-S-E-Y.  That's her maiden name--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --King.
Speaker 1: All right, and she was born when?
Speaker 2: She was born April 4, 1918.
Speaker 1: All right, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Chicago [Illinois], to the best of my recollection.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace that?
Speaker 2: Well, I can trace my mother's grandmother, who was, her name was Frances also.  She was born in 1868 in Cairo, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that takes me--that's all I know about her.  But then I have a grandmother [Edith Lindsey] and grandfather [Harry Lindsey] on my mother's side that I spent a good deal of time with as a child.  And of course, my mother had a large number of, about six, six brothers and sisters, I mean a total of six, five brothers and one sister, so I knew them.  And out of that came a large number of cousins, you know, on that side of the family, so I know, I did know them quite well.
Speaker 1: Now, did, did your--was--so your mother's mother, your grandmother, is she the one that moved up to Chicago, or was it your great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: I never met my great-grandmother on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my grandmother--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on my, on my mother's side, my mother's mother was born, to my knowledge, in Springfield [Illinois] and did come to Chicago, at what time I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Are there any stories from that side of the family about, you know, life in Springfield or Chicago or--
Speaker 2: Well, I think the, you know, that side of the family, they were, they were quite rural, I think, in their pursuits.  They, at a very early age they bought property in Cassopolis, Michigan, and began to go up there and routinely just go up there to visit.  But in some cases some members of the family actually went up there to live.  And my--they--my grandfather was a great cook.  He was a chef with the, on the railroads at one time.  And he was a very, very busy guy in the kitchen and really took a lot of pride in it, in his cooking.  I did not spend as much time with that side of the family as I did with my father's side of the family, so there's probably a little more, a few more anecdotes on the other side than on this one.
Story_ID: 197088
Speaker 1: Well, give us your father's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Okay, my father's name is Paul Joseph King, Sr.  He was born July 6, 1915.  And he is a twin of my aunt, who was obviously born on the same day.  Her name was Marie King Jackson.  She's since been deceased.  But my father was, you know, started Chicago's [Chicago, Illinois] first black-owned pro--wholesale produce business [P.K. Produce, Chicago, Illinois] and was a great, you know, was a great influence all my life, maybe the chief influence on my life.  But dad was a, dad was a--he was born in New Orleans [Louisiana] and came up here to Chicago with his mother [Olivia Priestley] and my grandmoth--my grandfather [Joseph King].  My father's father had died at the time that they came up here to Chicago.  But at any rate, they came up to Chicago, and they lived in an apartment.  Eventually my grandmother got remarried and to Charles Brown, who became my grandfather, the only grandfather I really spent time with.  And he--they, they bought a, they bought a house on 62nd [Street] and Indiana [Avenue], and it became the house where everybody lived.  So my father--when my mother [Frances Lindsey King] and father got married and I was born, I was born in this house on 62nd, and my twin--my father's twin sister, my aunt, she and her family lived in that house.  The relatives that came from New Orleans had a room in that house until they got settled, and then they branched out and got married and got houses of their own.  And when my father got able, he--we got an apartment on 6147 Indiana.  So it was only a half a block down from my grandmother's.  So we had always had a large number of interactions, you know, with that side of the family, 'cause it was just like one big house coming a half a block away.  We spent a lot of time--
Speaker 1: Now what did the house look like?  Was it a greystone or was--
Speaker 2: No, no, it was, it was really a two-story building with a basement apartment in it.  So--
Speaker 1: Like a two-flat?
Speaker 2: It was, it was a--
Speaker 1: A brick two-flat?
Speaker 2: --it was a two-flat, but it had room--I mean, it had room for a lot of people.  You know, my grandmother and grandfather lived on the first floor with my, with my two uncles and aunt.  And, and my, my father and mother, we lived up on the third floor--I mean on the second floor.  And somehow or another all of these people, you know, got into the same, got into the same house, same building.  It was a, like I said, it was a two-flat building with a basement apartment.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, any stories from that side of the family about life in Chicago in the early days?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, it was, it's much more interesting when you look back on it than when you're in the middle of it, because as a child you didn't understand really what was going on.  But the whole notion of having a great big family, a large number of people around you who loved you, who provided example for you, who gave you guidance, you know, was an enormous, an enormous thing, and the whole idea of people coming from New Orleans and settling there.  At that time you just thought that they were coming to, to visit, to stay.  You didn't associate any process with it.  But in looking back, what obviously they were doing was they would come from New Orleans, stay there until they could get settled, get a job; when they got the job they would be able to move, get the place of their own, bring their family from New Orleans, and they--and that was a group of cousins, or a group of uncles, or whoever it was that settled and became anchored into, in Chicago life.  And you know, when you realized that that was happening, you--how much people took care of one another--and there was no need for any babysitters.  There was no need for anybody to--there was no latchkey kids.  I mean everything--you know, you had this huge family type situation.  And on, on Sunday a whole lot of people would eat together.  And those who didn't eat together, there was always some food to take home, for those who didn't come to dinner.  So it was a, I guess it was a unique kind of thing that is clearly not in play today.
Story_ID: 197089
Speaker 1: Did your family have any stories about the riot of 1919 [Chicago Race Riot of 1919]?  Were they here [Chicago, Illinois] when that happened?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, I never really heard too many stories about that as much as I witnessed the fact that my grandfather [Charles Brown] was a very, very disciplined, determined man.  I mean, he worked at Acme Steel [Co., Chicago, Illinois], and he was like a painter.  And he, I think he must have gone and done that every day, you know, that I can remember, till he retired.  And then when he retired, he always did side jobs, you know, little fix this or fix that, carpentry, or a little plumbing, or whatever.  But he was--I mean the whole idea of seeing somebody work so methodically and a very religious person; you know, he went to church every Sunday.  But I think seeing that, seeing my father [Paul King, Sr.], who got up at three o'clock in the morning to go down to South Water Market [later, Chicago International Produce Market, Chicago, Illinois] to handle the produce, these kinds of examples were indelible to me, in terms of that, the necessity, the necessity to work, and the dignity of working, the value of working, and also made me appreciate the fact that people needed jobs to order to have that dignity was a--I mean those were the lessons that I got out of this.  Now, I certainly had uncles that were my father's brothers who were closer to my age who played baseball with me, taught me how to do a lot of the things that fathers would ordinarily do or supposed to do, 'cause my father was always busy working or sleeping.  And these uncles, these uncles really I mean took me under their wing and, and taught me, you know, not just baseball and the like but also taught me ways of negotiating the streets and behaving.
Story_ID: 197090
Speaker 1: Now what was it like in your neighborhood [in Chicago, Illinois]?  What were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, it was very tranquil.  It was dominated, it was dominated by order.  You saw people that were schoolteachers.  You saw people that were, worked in the post office.  You saw people that, some people that were lawyers, not a whole lot, but I remember a couple of them.  And so there was a mix of professions in the neighborhood.  I find that, you know, I drive, I drive through the old neighborhood very often; in fact, it may be once or week or something like that.  And it's amazing to me how life, you know, has changed.  But at that time, you know, I walked to--I went to St. Anselm's School [Chicago, Illinois], which is right off 61st [Street] and Indiana [Avenue], so I walked to school.  I never had any incidents.  A guy tried to, guy tried to--I don't know--he didn't try to take anything from me, but he did something.  And he was bigger than me, but I figured I had to throw a punch at him at least to see what would happen, which I did.  And that's the only incident I remember, and this was in--I don't know--while I was in grammar school.  So there were, I mean there was a great deal of--you didn't think about doing too much wrong because as they say, many times you heard that you had a lot of people in the neighborhood who were looking out after you, looking out to see if you were doing anything wrong.  So it was a by and large, especially in retrospect, it was a very, very great time, you know, to be growing up.  I often, I often (clearing throat) refer to my, to me, to those of our ilk as being the uniquely favored historic generation because we had, I mean, we had probably as much carefree time and stress free growing up that you could wanna have.  I mean you were certainly going to school and you were studying.  Going to school, good grades were very important to my family, to my household; it was expected.  It wasn't even a question about not getting good grades.  So, that kept you a little bit busy.  Then there was basketball and you know, making the basketball team, which was a very important thing to try to do.
Speaker 1: Now you played basketball at St. Anselm's, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And they, they have a big gym there at 61st--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --and Michigan [Avenue], yeah.
Speaker 2: They built the gym the--when I was in seventh grade they built the gym, so I had one year in which I could play in the gym as a member of the team.  But then they had leagues in the gym after I got out of grammar school, of which I returned and you know, and played ball with--we--I don't--Herbie Brown [Herb Brown], I don't know--Herbie Brown, who became a coach for Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School, later, Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], he and I used to play on the same team, in the Saturday afternoon leagues.  Paxton Lumpkin and Shellie McMillon and all those guys, they had, they were older than me, but they also had, you know, played in the league up there.  So it was a great time to play in that gym because it was new.  Hardwood floors, the smell of that varnish and everything, it was a great thing.  And then, you know, at night, they shut all that down, and at night they'd have dances in there.  So, you know, you could actually go and--you have to go change clothes, but you could spend your whole Saturday in the gym.  So it was a nice thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's interesting there.  You got St. Anselm's; you got St. Edmund's [Episcopal Church, Chicago, Illinois] across the street--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --two big--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --churches--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You guys have Betsy Ross [Elementary] School [Chicago, Illinois] down the street--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the other way.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then you got Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] going--you're close to Washington Park.  Did you spend a lot of time in the park?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother [Frances Lindsey King] took me to the park, you know, more than I went to the park by myself as a child.  We didn't have, we didn't have that much activity going on in the park.  I know that I didn't play tennis at that time.  I wasn't a swimmer, but a lot of my friends would go into Washington Park to swim.  We didn't play that much baseball.  And if we did, we played baseball in vacant lots.  You know, we didn't go to the park to play organized baseball at the time.  But I started going to the park much more as an adult than I did as a youngster.
Story_ID: 197091
Speaker 1: Tell us about your mother [Frances Lindsey King].  I didn't ask you about her personality and what she did.  What was your mother like?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was a very--my mother, she finished high school, but she was a very avid reader.  And she enjoyed opera.  I don't know how she got the fascination for opera, but she did.  And she took me down to see Maria Callas even downtown [Chicago, Illinois] when I was a, when I was a kid.  But she was, she was a person that did not like to drink but was not a religious zealot.  She converted into the Catholic religion to marry my father [Paul King, Sr.].  But all in all, she was a very insightful woman.  And I was a little small kid, you know, when I grew up--when I was growing up, and she did a lot to reinforce my own self-esteem and confidence, almost overkill somebody--some people would say (laughter).  But at any rate, she was very, very thoughtful.  I think the greatest, the thing I remember most about my mother is the fact that when I was thinking about getting married, she would, she would weigh in and said whoever you're thinking about marrying, make sure that she is a strong woman because you're the kind of person that will leave somebody sittin' in a corner and go out and do your own thing.  And if somebody's totally dependent on you, they gon' be in for a, you know, a rude awakening.  I mean I'm paraphrasing, but in essence, she had me pegged, you know, at a very early age.  And that advice, I think, is still something that I'm very grateful and appreciative that she gave me.
Story_ID: 197092
Speaker 1: --And your father [Paul King, Sr.], now, he started the first wholesale fruit business [P.K. Produce, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --a black--that, that a black man--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, he, his--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, he is an amazing guy.  And I use the present tense 'cause both of my parents are still alive.  But he, he started as going down to South Water Market [later, Chicago International Produce Market, Chicago, Illinois] and you know, which is on 14th [Place] and Morgan [Street]--
Speaker 1: That's the entry point for all the wholesale fruits and--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's the entry.
Speaker 1: --and vegetables.
Speaker 2: That's right, all of the trains and trucks would come to South Water Market to bring in fruit and vegetables from the farmers from around the country.  And he would, he would go down there at the early stages and sell fruit and vegetables to people out in the street--not in the street but in buildings.  Soon he was able to get a small truck.  And he went to National Tea [Co.], which was the big chain food store at that time in the black community, and told them that, look, he would give them mustard greens, turnip greens, collards, cabbage sprouts, turnip bunches, and okra.  I'll give 'em to you.  If you sell 'em, you'll owe me something.  If you don't sell 'em, then you can give 'em back.  He, so he effectively, with that technique, he introduced the foods that black people liked to eat into the chain stores.  I mean so, now you go to any, you go to any produce market section in a chain store, you'll see mustard greens, thirty-nine cent a pound, turnip greens, collard greens so much a bunch, cabbage sprouts, turnip bunches, okra, pole beans, crowder peas.  All of those things, items had no place in chain stores before my father went in there and made that bold move of saying take 'em, and if you, if you sell 'em, you owe me; if you don't sell 'em, you give 'em back, no obligation.  And as a result of that, not only did a process take place where these foods got introduced into chain stores, but also he was able to advance his--expand and advance his business.  And you know, the amazing, you know, the amazing thing about that is, you just think about it, he was able to run that business, which was five days a week--and when he went to the [U.S.] Army, he was able to have a person that was working with him--run the business while he was in the Army.  And the guy was so honest he would bring the money and the books home to my mother [Frances Lindsey King] every, every week.  And my father had a good friend that was an accountant, and he look--he would look at what was going on each week.  And the business ran nonstop, even while he was in the Army, which was a great, great example of how you could develop that kind of loyalty with, with somebody who was working for you or with you.  But I think the biggest example that that provided is that my mother didn't work.  We were able to go to--my sister [Claudia King] and I both were able to go to, you know, to Catholic school, that was grammar school.  I was able to go to De La Salle High School [sic. De La Salle Institute, Chicago, Illinois], which required tuition.  And he told me that I could go to anywhere I wanted to go for college, you know.  I said can I even go to [University of ] Oxford, [Oxford] England?  He said anywhere you wanna go.  I mean, and he did this, and was able to say those kinds of things, and provide that kind of access and opportunity on his own business.  I mean, you know, I mean that's major as far as I'm concerned.  And so, I think that he was--he liked to bowl, so that was his hobby, bowling, liked to play poker, liked to drink Old Forester, you know.  So he was a balanced kind of dude, very, very concerned about treating people right, had a very great deal of responsibility for his family, not just his wife and kids but also his brothers, and sisters, and his mother [Olivia Priestley], and other extended family members.  So, I mean I think the, the biggest lesson or influence I got from him was, in fact, how you can, you know, through the sheer force of will, run a business and have that business, parlay that business into being able to take care of your family and advance you toward your dreams and objectives.
Story_ID: 197093
Speaker 1: What kind of a little boy were you when you were growing up?  What did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I would guess I was kind of a, I guess shy in a way at an early stage 'cause I was kind of a small kid.  I wasn't really--I wasn't a ninety-pound weakling, but I was short and small.  And I wanted to definitely--I enjoyed and definitely liked to read almost--and still have that affliction.  But I wanted to play, I wanted to do well in school, which I did.  I wanted to play basketball, which I--was something that I could think--it was a little bit more cerebral than football.  I loved baseball.  At one time when I was a kid, I knew, you know, all of the Major League [Baseball, MLB] rosters for each time.  You had eight teams in each league, National [League] and American [League].  I know every starting lineup for every team, you know, like that, at one point.  So I was a great, avid baseball fan.  My father took me to see Jackie Robinson in '47 [1947] play in Wrigley Field [Chicago, Illinois].  And every time he hit a foul ball, all the black people would jump up 'cause they thought it was a homerun.  That was--you know, I was very--you know, very, very vivid memory--took me to see, to the East-West games [East-West All-Star Game] at Comiskey Park [Chicago, Illinois], saw Jackie Robinson play before he hit the majors.  So, I have a lot--
Speaker 1: That's the Negro League [Negro Leagues Baseball]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --All-Star game.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  So I had an opportunity, as, as a young child, to, I guess to read, to be around, to play ball, to get to thinking about girls, you know, all of the regular stuff, without any real horrific drama, you know, no divorces, no deaths, no catastrophic illnesses, you know, pretty nice way to come up.
Story_ID: 197094
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were just, you just shared a couple of things with me about the neighborhood [Washington Park, Chicago, Illinois], if you wanna--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we were--you were talking about growing up and you know, childhood activities.  And a couple of the things that I remember is people that became very important to me later that I didn't know then, I had the opportunity to meet Jesse Binga, who, he used to have breakfast, meals at the school [St. Anselm's School, Chicago, Illinois].  The nuns that were running the school used to provide him with meals.  He wasn't desolate, but I think that he came by there simply to, you know, exchange--to have a sense of community with some people that were, knew his background and knew his past.  And--
Speaker 1: Now he was the head of Binga [State] Bank [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yeah, Jesse Binga was the head of Binga Bank, and of course he tried to make--he tried to send the Binga--expand the Binga Bank, you know, into downtown even.  And he also talked to downtown banking interests about using his bank as a frame of reference to expand banking services into the, into the black communities further south, you know, which is an amazing thing, again, talking about this notion of histor--being a uniquely favored historic generation.  Here I was, a kid having an opportunity to meet, up close and personal, and just hear somebody like Jesse Binga talk about what his ideas and his vision was and then to see him not succeed but be able to predict what was gonna happen.  And now look at all of the banking activity that's taking place.  I mean you've got banks up and down Stony Island [Avenue].  You've got Northern Trust Bank, which we built on 76th [Street] and State [Street].  So what he was after, besides Seaway [Bank and Trust Company, Chicago, Illinois] and Independence [Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] preceding all of this, what Jesse Binga was after was something that very, was very, very important.  And he got shot down because it was just something, black folk didn't have any business thinking like that, let alone trying to be part of the business machinery that was gonna profit from that kind of thing.  And at that time also I met Richard Wright, who was, you know, navigating through the neighborhood.  I think he lived somewhere in the neighborhood at that time or was visiting.  But, but you didn't know the full import of who these people were when you were a kid.  It's only when you, you know, become older and begin to recall who you met, and then how they carried themselves, and how they thought, and what some of their dreams were.  You know, that was always something that stayed, you know, that stays with you.  And even as an adult, you tend to go back to those childhood examples for giving you a frame of reference, you know, to pursue your own visions.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a conversation with Richard Wright at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know, it wasn't a conversation like this.  It was a kid talking to a grown man.  You know, so you might say hello, hello, Mr. Wright, or hello, Mr. Binga.  How are you?  You know, and they would give you some sage comment or two.  But you got more out of sitting down and being within earshot and listening to them talk to other adults where their conversation was more of a, on an even keel rather than talk down to someone.  But you know, the--I think the thing that impresses me about the exposure that I had to Wright was just that he always seemed to be plodding along, you know, and you never would think that he was gonna be successful person in the sense of making a lot of money or being somebody that's really in the newspaper or what have you.  But it turns out that they were, you know, and that was very important.
Story_ID: 197095
Speaker 1: Where you lived was close to 63rd Street [Chicago, Illinois].  And in those days, was 63rd Street kind of like the border between the white and the black community, or had it gone--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --further south?
Speaker 2: Yeah 63rd Street had, 63rd Street was important because it had the shows, the movies on 63rd Street.  So, to the west going toward Halsted [Street], which was a major shopping--63rd and Halsted was the next best thing to going downtown for shopping, and it had a big movie theater there, the Southtown [Theatre, Chicago, Illinois].  And then going to the east, you know, toward [South] Cottage Grove [Avenue], you had the Tivoli [Theatre, Chicago, Illinois], the [Majestic] Midway [Theatre, formerly, Mayfair Theatre, Chicago, Illinois], the Ark [ph.], the Maryland [Theater, Chicago, Illinois].  You had maybe a half a dozen shows going between Stony Island [Avenue]--I mean between South Cottage Grove and, and, and Stony Island.  So those, those shows, movies, shows were very important on 63rd Street.  Now, as far as race was concerned, you--my grandmother [Olivia Priestley] moved from 60--from 62nd [Street] and Indiana [Avenue] to 66th [Street] and Drexel [Avenue], which was both south of 63rd Street and east of Cottage Grove.  And that was, that met with some racial hostility, but it wasn't big.  It was, but it was significant.  So this would have, this would have been maybe somewhere in the--I don't know--'52 [1952], I guess, maybe around there, or maybe it might have been '51 [1951].  But in that time it was, there was some racial--63rd Street and east was the racial thing, because there were a lot of black people living south of 63rd Street, like 64th and Eberhart [Avenue], Champlain [Avenue], Rhodes [Avenue], you know, all of those places.  That little narrow corridor west of Cottage Grove black people still lived.  When we moved, my parents [Paul King, Sr. and Frances Lindsey King] and my family moved to 73rd [Street] and Vernon [Avenue], which was in 19--that was in 1952.  There was racial animosity there.  Nobody came and did anything to you, but I mean I remember at that time trying to go and play basketball in that [Meyering] Park at 72nd [Street] and [S. Martin Luther] King Drive.  And the white boys, you know, threw rocks and stuff at me trying to go in there to play ball.  Well, that, that event--that only lasted for about one year.  Then enough black people moved out there, and I guess enough white people moved away, so that was the only one, that was the only real incident that I, that we had.  But 63rd Street, as a border, was not necessarily the line as much as being east of Cottage Grove and south of 63rd Street.

Speaker 1: Well, tell me about school.  Now you went to, you always attended Catholic school?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to St. Anselm's grade school [St. Anselm's School, Chicago, Illinois], which was a very good, solid experience.  I mean it--you got a grounding in behavior that I think was very important.  It was great preparation for high school [De La Salle Institute, Chicago, Illinois].  They put a value, they put a value in educate--in reading, and writing, and thinking.  You had an opportunity to express yourself.  The nuns that were teaching there were the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, who got their start from a religious order that was founded by a woman by the name of Katharine Drexel in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And their primary objective was to deal with education of African Americans and Native Americans, American Indians.  I didn't know all of this at the time but began to understand it.  And what they--most of these nuns were Irish, born Irish and had come over here to the United States to teach as nuns.  And just a small anecdote, but my fifth grade teacher called me last year to come over there and speak to the kids at St. Elizabeth [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  She was getting ready to go to retire.  She was ninety-something years old.  But just to show you how--I hadn't talked to her in, since I had been in grammar school, but she knew who I was and knew of me.  But anyway, the Catholic education by that particular religious order I think was very insightful in that you were able to--they were able to give you the education that you could use going forward.  I don't think there were any guys that I went to grammar school with, and some of them are still my friends; we still associate very well together and a lot together.  I don't think any of them were, really turned out to be bums.  I think all of them, by and large, went on to get jobs and went on to do something.  And I think the preparation that we got in grammar school was very unique.  You know, I have often times take issue with the fact that black people let other people teach their kids, and that's probably some of the real basis for the maladies that we face today.  But I think the preparation, that academic preparation that I got, was very significant.  And you see, I make the distinction between being taught and being academically prepared.  So the academic preparation, buttressed of course by this strong sense of family that also had their input on how I viewed the world, you know, made a lot of difference.  By the academic preparation was such that it had me ready to go to high school.
Speaker 1: What, what was your favorite subject matter in grade school?  What did you like?
Speaker 2: Reading, reading.  But, but again, the whole of the, of the grammar school experience was that you made friends, you know, boys and girls who remained your friends, through life.  I mean it's just amazing the number of relationships and friendships that you have.  And it's because obviously you've got something in common.  You've got a sense of behavior, you've got a sense of achievement, and there's a, then there's a basis for you having something to talk about and to share frustrations and ambitions.  And these--so this grammar school experience is different for me, from--to me at least because it serves as a foundation for me: a) to be prepared to go to high school; b) for me to have lifelong friendships; and c) to be able to understand some of the nuances about getting along with people in authority because the nuns and the priests at the school were authority figures, and you had to navigate that, and you had to negotiate that, how you did it, you know, and if you were able to, you know, deal with these people and get them to see your point of view or persuade them to your way of thinking.  That was probably an embryonic bit of politics that was forming in my own arsenal, because there was very little contact I had with white people, you know, other than, at that, at that junction in my life, other than, you know, the nuns and priests, in the school.  So I mean, I think that it was a very--to me, it was a very solid, solid experience.
Story_ID: 197097
Speaker 1: Well, what about high school?  Now, there's a story about how you got into high school you were telling us before we started--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, well the high schools that were essentially open to you at--a black boy graduating from St. Anselm's [School, Chicago, Illinois] in the early '50s [1950s], you could--St. Elizabeth [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], if you wanted to go to the Catholic school, St. Elizabeth, Corpus Christi [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  Those were the two, those were the two choices if you wanted to go--if you wanted, again, if you wanted to go to a Catholic school and not to a public school.  And I said well, I wanted to do something different, and so I said I wanna go to De La Salle [Institute, Chicago, Illinois], and--
Speaker 1: Now tell us about De La Salle.  Why is that significant in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, a lot of the--because you know, when you were playing bask--organized basketball in eighth grade, you had a chance to play against the white schools.  St. Sabina [Academy, Chicago, Illinois] had a tournament that we all used to play in.  And so you played with--against the schools from Visitation [Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois], St. Raphael [School, Chicago, Illinois], and the other Catholic schools, and these were all-white schools.  And I knew a lot of these guys were going to De La Salle, and I, and I always wanted to have a little one-upmanship.  I said well, I think that I'll have a better chance to do more if I go to De La Salle.  I didn't know--I met [Mayor] Richard [M.] Daley, the current mayor, I met him there.  But I didn't know that De La Salle had the tradition that it had before I went there.  I thought I was gonna go and get a better education.
Speaker 1: And that tradition you're talking about is the mayor and--
Speaker 2: The political--yeah, the political--
Speaker 1: Politicians from Bridgeport [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --go to--
Speaker 2: I didn't know that at that, at that time.  I really saw myself going to school where I would be able to get a better education and--you know, I--somewhere deep down inside me I always wanted to have a stronger arsenal of weapons when I went out into the world.  I don't know why'd I got that 'cause I never need it, but somewhere--maybe about watching my father [Paul King, Sr.], I daresay.  But at any rate, I wanted to go to De La Salle because I thought I'd have a more better--be better prepared and have more weapons, you know, and--
Speaker 1: So, what happened when you applied?
Speaker 2: Well, I filled in the application, and it came back not accepted.  So I went to this Irish priest at St. Anselm's and I said look at this, why--I'm the top boy in the school in St. Anselm's.  Why couldn't I get accepted?  He looked at it and he says well, let me look into it.  And the next day I got a letter that said I was accepted.  So that was my first lesson in pragmatic politics.  I know that that priest made a call to somebody he knew and intervened to get them to change the decision.
Speaker 1: Now when is this, about 1952?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so right then and there I'm gettin' my education in, both in practical politics and the way thing are done.  Again, mind you, I had to have had a smattering of political sensibilities to take that letter to the priest.  Why didn't I take it to the nun, or why didn't take it to my mother [Frances Lindsey King] and father?  You know, so somewhere it was, I had--speaking to that, learning how to navigate it and negotiate authority and get the--persuade them to see how you--to your way of thinking, I was able to go and take this to, to the priest, who evidently had the muscle to get this thing changed, although I didn't intend for him to chan- I didn't know he could change it.  But I at least wanted him to know about it.  And at any rate, I did get into De La Salle--
Story_ID: 197098
Speaker 1: What was it like [at De La Salle Institute, Chicago, Illinois]?  Were there any other black students there?
Speaker 2: Twelve blacks out of twelve hundred students at that school.
Speaker 1: One percent exactly.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and when I went in there, there were no black seniors; they were juniors and sophomores, and of course, I was in the freshman class.  De La Salle was a, again, a great place to go to school, because location wise, it was just six blocks from St. Elizabeth [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  So I could socialize with the people at 41st [Street] and Michigan [Avenue].  It was three blocks from Comiskey Park [Chicago, Illinois].  We got out of school at 2:10.  I could go over there and see the end of the [Chicago White] Sox games.  Games start at 1:30, so I could sneak in there and see a couple of Sox games.  But I played basketball at De La Salle.  I did not make the varsity.  I played on the frosh/soph [freshmen/sophomore] teams.  There were no black people on the varsity when I was there.  I know that I should have made it, but I didn't.  That was purely racist, racial activity by the, by the coach.  I was as good as some of the white boys that made it.  But again, I got a great education.  I got--I was prepared when I got out of De La Salle.  I was in the high I.Q. room.  When I got out of De La Salle I had made good friendships.  Some of these guys that I went to school with I still go out with, you know, once a week, and we do business.  We have interaction going.  We--I was able to get--I was able to play frosh/soph basketball, which honed my basketball skills, even though I didn't make the varsity.  There was organized basketball that we could play.  You could win a letter, you know, by doing that.  So, I accomplished that, and I was academically prepared for college [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Who, who were some of the, the teachers there that you remember that had, had an impact on you?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a little guy named Van Hatz, H-A-T-Z.  He was a mathematics instructor.  He was a very, I guess, cerebral kind of teacher, but he made mathematics very easy to grasp.  I had a Latin teacher by the name of Frank Raspus [ph.], who was also a teacher that ended up teaching my son at St. Ignatius [College Prep, Chicago, Illinois], which spans twenty-some years.  So I don't--there is nobody that jumps out at you, that jumps out at you in high school, I mean in high school to me as much as the opportunity and the people that I, you know, the people that--the classmates that I had.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean those were important.
Speaker 1: Okay, who, who were some of the classmates that you--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, the, you know, the black, the black classmates that I had, one guy was named Vince Clemens [ph.], who became a writer.  There were some Irish guys, a fellow by the name of Tom Ward, remained very close friends.  There are some lawyers, and guys that are elected officials and appointed officials, and people inside of--a lot of these guys became policemen, firemen, and worked inside of government and inside labor unions.  And so these relationships came into play in adult life more than they did when I was in school.
Speaker 1: Okay, when you were a senior, did you know what you wanted to do career wise or the rest--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --of your life?
Speaker 2: No, I just--no, I didn't.  I just knew that I'd done well in physical sciences; I'd done well in English, so I said--I didn't know what I wanted to do, so I said I would just take a shot and major in chemistry.  And you know, that's what I did.
Story_ID: 197099
Speaker 1: When did you decide to go to school, or how did you decide to go to school?
Speaker 2: You know, I mentioned earlier in the interview that my father [Paul King, Sr.] had given me the option of going where I wanted to go.
Speaker 1: And this is like 1956?
Speaker 2: This would be '56 [1956], '57 [1957]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I chose to go to the University of Chicago [U of C, Chicago, Illinois] for a few reasons: one, it was closer.  I could stay at home, and that's where my friends were; that's where the girls I was talking to; that's where the dances were; that was the prime time in my life, so did I wanna be going somewhere, you know, foreign.  I mean I had access to driving the car.  I could stay out, you know, past eleven o'clock at night.  I mean, so, I was gonna go to somewhere where I could stay in Chicago [Illinois].  But where could you go that you could stay in Chicago?  And again, think about this.  This is the same mindset now that I had when I went to De La Salle [Institute, Chicago, Illinois].  Okay, I'm not gonna go to [Woodrow] Wilson [Junior College, later Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] or Chicago Teachers College [later Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], you know.  I'm not gonna go to Navy Pier, University of Illinois at Navy Pier [later University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  I wanna go somewhere different, not necessarily elitist but different, that's gonna give me a better stick at being able to navigate and negotiate life--(clearing throat)--you know, in the future.  So I said this University of Chicago is a big, big school.  It's got all kind of history behind it and stuff--
Speaker 1: Did you ever--
Speaker 2: --like that.
Speaker 1: --did you ever spend much time on the campus when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you were relatively close to it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, just maybe having driven through or around when you're going down to Midway [Plaisance, Chicago, Illinois], you know what I mean, but not walking, not driving or walking in and out of there.  But at any rate, the University of Chicago, they had a fairly rigorous entrance examination.  And I placed out of English and placed out of mathematics, meaning that I started right off, you know, I didn't take freshman English or freshman math.  That's how well De La Salle, St. Elizabeth [sic. St Anselm's School, Chicago, Illinois], De La Salle had prepared me.  So I mean I took, I took math courses, and I took English courses, but they weren't entry level; they were the next step.  So, the whole University of Chicago selection, I think, really yielded big results fast, because number one, I was able to go to a school that I felt was prestigious and I felt was gonna get me something that, give me the ups.  I was able to play basketball and make the varsity at the University of Chicago, even got a basketball scholarship, and this is just when the team was resuming its activity 'cause the team had been in a very, you know, laid back role for a number of years.  And I was introduced to the fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] at that time.  So, then things start just, you know, just opening up, you know, at my freshman year at De La Salle--I mean at the U of C.  Yeah, it was a big experience.
Story_ID: 197100
Speaker 1: What was the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] like for you?
Speaker 2: The coming into--you gotta put yourself back into calendar year 1956, '57 [1957].  And the biggest thing that was happening then was you were able to play basketball, and you were playing for a college team, that meant that you got on buses and you went places to play, Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, when you went places to play basketball.  The school, the classwork was rigorous, the first time I ever really been seriously challenged or tested, and so that was major.
Speaker 1: What was your major?
Speaker 2: Chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay, chemistry?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but then, you know, you had this great opportunity of being engaged in a fraternity.  At that time I pledged Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity at the behest of Bill Lester [HistoryMaker William Lester, Jr.] who was an upperclassman when I went to the--black guy who is still a good friend of mine.  And he grew up in the neighborhood around 69th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  And I lived at 73rd [Street] and Vernon [Avenue], so we knew each other, you know, as teenagers.
Speaker 1: Now was--
Speaker 2: We--
Speaker 1: --was there a citywide chapter, or was there a chapter--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A later chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha was a citywide chapter.  It reached out and touched students at Roosevelt University of Illinois [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois], at Circle Campus [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], Chicago's Teachers College [later Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], University of Chicago--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --so at all the metropolitan area schools--
Speaker 1: That had--
Speaker 2: --undergraduates were brought, initiated into Theta chapter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was a very, I mean that was a huge experience in my life.  It was thirteen guys that pledged the fraternity.  Each year those of us that are remaining here in Chicago [Illinois], we have a dinner at Army & Lou's Restaurant [Chicago, Illinois] where we bring Alphas and our friends to celebrate our initiation.  So we just had a, I guess we had the forty--what, we had the forty-fifth anniversary of our initiation last year at this particular dinner.  These guys that I pledged with became my friends for life.  One guy is my CPA [certified public accountant]; another guy is my son's--one is my son's godfather, and we just have maintained--you know, one of the guys works here at UBM [Inc., Chicago, Illinois] as a project executive.  So we, we have maintained this close relationship over all these years.  So you had that dimension.  Another dimension of the fraternity, however, was the, was the, the, the mentoring and the access we had to older, successful black men, unbelievable--Lewis [A.H.] Caldwell, Oscar C. Brown, Sr., Dick [I. Richard] Mahone, Sidney Jones, a black judge, Sidney Jones, Sr. [sic, Sidney A. Jones, Jr.], black judge.  I mean the number of black, successful black men that were in that Alpha house.  And they taught you how to become a man.  They taught you what was expected.  They'd sit down, and you'd play poker with them.  They would sit down and praise you when you were doing something good; kick you in the butt verbally when you were doing something that was not good.  And it was probably one of the most amazing things in my life, because you're able to sit down at the foot of greatness and hear them talk and talk about politics.  I mean Gene Sawyer [HistoryMaker Eugene Sawyer] was an Alpha.  You know, you, you just have all of these, all of these--[HistoryMaker] John [H.] Stroger [Jr.]--I mean, but these guys are, they're not closer to my age, but they, they ta--they--John Stroger is maybe ten, twelve years older than me, but [HistoryMaker] Clark Burrus, all of these people who made Chicago history were at that Alpha house, and we were able to sit down there and, and talk to 'em and listen to 'em, and be educated by them.  As to all of this--all of this is going on in that first year of college.  And you know, my activities in the fraternity, I became president of the chapter; I became a national officer in the fraternity, and I got the fraternity scholarship, I mean, so and that just is another whole, that's another whole chapter of activity that you might wanna get into at some point.  But the--this is all happening at the first year.  So you've got the, you've got the fraternity; you've got the basketball; you've got the challenge of the school, and of course you have got--I don't think there's a better time in anybody--in any man's life than freshmen year in college, 'cause you've got the independence of, of being quote, grown, unquote, but at the same time, you go back home and the food and everything else is in the house (laughter), your mother [Frances Lindsey King] and father [Paul King, Sr.] got going for you.  So it was a great time.
Story_ID: 197101
Speaker 1: Are you the first person in your family to attend college?  Were you the first?
Speaker 2: I'm the first person in my family to attend college here in Chicago [Illinois].  I--my father [Paul King, Sr.] has uncles and cousins who in New Orleans [Louisiana], who were schoolteachers and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Were they--what schools were they associated with in New Orleans?
Speaker 2: I believe--
Speaker 1: Xavier or--
Speaker 2: Xavier, I believe Xavier [University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Is Dillard [University, New Orleans, Louisiana] in New Orleans as well?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I think Xavier and Dillard, I think, are the two that they were associated with.  But at any rate, the--I think that's sheer, just sheer accident of birth because my cousin, a female who is my father's twin's [Marie King Jackson] daughter, she's just a year behind me.  And she went to college as well, as did most people after me.
Speaker 1: Did your sister [Claudia King] go?  You got a--
Speaker 2: She, yeah, she went, she went to college after she spent some years after she graduated from high school.  But she did go back and do some college work.  I don't know how far she got--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but she did some.
Speaker 1: But you have the one sister, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So it's two of you.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 197102
Speaker 1: So, chemistry now, at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], around the time that you were in school, I mean the University of Chicago was thought of as one of the great science centers in the country with having the atom bomb having been developed over there, you know.  What was it like?  Who were some of the teachers that you met over there?
Speaker 2: Well, there was Harold Urey, who was a very big organic chemistry man.  There was a fellow named Nathan Sugarman, who was very involved with physical chemistry.  The--you know, I was never the, the real gung-ho chemist.  I got over there, and I wanted to go into that because I felt that it would provide me with a strong basis for always being able to get a job if you were able to be a chemist, which it turned out I could, which it turned out it did provide me with.  But I never did take the advanced chemistry courses where you really got up close and personal, you know, with a professor.  I mean I think the--I think physical chemistry and chemical thermodynamics were the courses that I took.  But I didn't take any of those, you know, any real major special projects or anything like that because my interest was waning more away from chemistry, and I started, you know, paying a lot more attention to my social sciences and to political sciences and that kind of thing.  So the, the University of Chicago experience, academically, it not was a big thing.  I mean I went and did the academics and, and passed the grades and stuff like that, more as a necessity to do the other things than a genuine verve for the classwork itself.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: It didn't, it didn't really have the kind of magic that the other things had.
Speaker 1: Did you connect with any of the teachers there really in any of the subjects?
Speaker 2: Humanities there were--a guy was teaching, a guy was teaching English--was teaching music interpretation, and I was able to understand better that opera that I told you about that my mother [Frances Lindsey King] had taken me to.  So I was able to learn that, you know, while I was in humanities, and the reading and the discussion.
Story_ID: 197103
Speaker 1: I don't recall any teachers there at the Uni--basketball coach, yes.  His name was [Joseph] Joe Stampf, and he was a great guy because, you know, now mind you, I didn't make the varsity at the University of--De La Salle [Institute, Chicago, Illinois], but I did make the varsity at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  So naturally the guy that gave me my chance to play certainly was somebody that I connected to.
Speaker 2: Now you must have played guard I guess, right?
Speaker 1: Absolutely, I--(laughter), yeah, you know, and the nice thing about, the ni--I don't know if you--there's a fellow that is still a friend of mine named Mitchell Watkins.  He's about 6'2".  And another guy, Clarence Woods, he's a doctor now.  They, they're both maybe about same height, six-two.  They automatically played center because they were six, they were six feet; they were higher, bigger than six feet.  Well, you know, the world was much smaller then, you know, I mean, so these guys, a 6'2" guy would be a small guard in today's world, you know, let alone automatically be given a center position.  But that's, you know, that's the way the world was, and it was, it was a good--you know, a guy of 5'7" or 5'8" max, you know, he's gotta be, no chance at all except to be a guard.  And it was a great opportunity.
Speaker 2: And now you all played the smaller colleges.
Speaker 1: Right, we played the small--
Speaker 2: 'Cause University of Chicago has a huge academic reputation--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but they sort of downplayed sports--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's correct, that's correct.
Speaker 2: --to--
Speaker 1: And we played Chicago Teachers College [later Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], as an example.  And that's where you got a chance to play against all your buddies, guys in your frat [fraternity], you know, and all the black guys who you knew back in the day.  You know, you all met playing one another at college basketball level.  That was a very nice experience, in that regard, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, so you, you graduated with a chemistry degree, or did you--
Speaker 1: No, what I did is I completed my, my ac--my academic work, but I did not take the degree at the University of Chicago.  There were some other things that got in the way, and I didn't take the degree there, but I did complete the academic prerequisites for the degree.  And--
Speaker 2: Well, what happened?  What happened?
Speaker 1: Well, it's, it was, it was one where I kind of got distracted in--I wanted to go, I wanted, I got very much interested in business at the time, and I didn't see where, you know, going and taking this German course over again--'cause that's what I needed to do--was really, was really worth it at the time.  And so I just didn't pursue the degree.  But as again, I had enough academic credits, and I knew enough that I could go out and get a job as a chemist if I wanted to.  I had already tested the marketplace and found that out.  And then if you fast forward a little bit toward 1961, I got married in 1961, and then that takes me into another whole era of activity--
Story_ID: 197104
Speaker 1: On the national scene, the Civil Rights Movement had started to kick up with the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision of '54 [1954] [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], then Montgomery Bus Boycott in '56 [1956] [sic, 1955-1956].  What did you think about all that when you were in school?  Did your parents [Paul King, Sr. and Frances Lindsey King] talk about that, or did people around you discuss that?
Speaker 2: They talked a lot about it, more at school than at home.  And my sister [Claudia King] actually left school and went down there to Montgomery [Alabama] to work with [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  So she was actually involved in that whole effort with him.  That was part of the whole awakening--there was a strong sense of black awakening that's beginning to take place then.  And again, that's where I talk about being in this uniquely favored historic generation.  Because here we had television kicking in, showing us stuff that we had not experienced directly.  I mean I was not one of those, I was not one of those kids like many of my friends who went down to Mississippi every summer.  I didn't have relatives in Mississippi that I know of, but I--and I never did go to New Orleans [Louisiana] to visit family 'cause all the family in New Orleans was practically here.  So I didn't go and experience the kind of stuff that I was seeing happening to black people on television.  I didn't--I knew, I knew about the racism that existed, but I--it got explained, it got put into perspective for me by, by looking at this separate but equal.  I mean I didn't know.  I mean, yes, [St.] Anselm's [School, Chicago, Illinois] was all black.  I didn't know the why of that, but I knew that it happened.  De La Salle [Institute, Chicago, Illinois] was practically all white.  Again, I knew that the phenomenon was there, but I didn't know how it had happened.  So the whole idea of racism, you know, and black oppression and the bad thing that happened to black people, I didn't really know that and really experience that up close and personal.  I remember in going to, going to a [Alpha Phi Alpha] Fraternity convention in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in '57 [1957].  Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.], I was a hotshot president from Chicago [Illinois].  Adam Clayton Powell was Alpha.  He told me, he said, "Don't show me your, degrees; don't show me your Brooks Brothers' suit; don't show me about all these things you're thinking about.  Tell me how many pickets have you carried in the heat of the day."  I'll never forget that.  I mean, and so he--just like taking a sledgehammer.  Adam Clayton Powell, Thurgood Marshall, those guys--they, they began to put all of this into some type of perspective that if you were a privileged black man that could be educated and be a member of the fraternity, you had an obligation to do things for black people.  I mean that just came like night followed the day that you were supposed to do that.  So in order to be able to do the things that you should, you had to become informed and educated, a whole different educational direction.  Because, mind you, if here you are watching this stuff, and now here you have these people you respect telling you, look, you have to get out there and be doing something to create change to help black people because this is what the fraternities are all about.  This is what your advantages of education is all about.  This is what being a black man--you define yourself as being able to do something for black people as being the essence of manhood.  So, if--in other words, then ought to--right then and there, my whole being is getting challenged to be more than just, not just what my fa--I saw in my father, but be more than just educationally more advantaged than him because he gave me that education, but to be actively engaged in creating change that's going stop some of the madness and some of the oppression that I was being witness to on the television but also being reinforced by what the members of my fraternity had to say.  I mean, when you get a guy like Adam Clayton Powell or William [Henri] Hale, who was, who was president of a university [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma], Walter Washington, Myles [Anderson] Paige, all of the, a big--a federal judge, all of these people, sitting down, put their arms around me.  Martin Luther King, put their arms around you and telling you about what you needed to do, what the challenge was--fantastic set of experiences.
Story_ID: 197105
Speaker 1: What was crucial there, was when you found out that in order to really make any type of contribution, you had to be educated more effectively.  And that's when the whole idea of moving into the--moving from the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s], you got--if you didn't experience slavery, but you had to understand what it meant.  If you didn't experience separate but equal in its most overt, you had to learn more about it, and then you had to engage in conversations about it, which kind of moves--I mean which kind of, here is where the embryo starts, which kind of propelled me into the relationships I had with Jake Carruthers [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.], and [HistoryMaker] Harold Pates, and Anderson Thompson, and all of those people.  I mean, but that's, you know, that's taking it up into the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s].  But at any rate, that's where--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the need, the necessity was sparked there.  See, in other words, I'm saying you couldn't, you couldn't be following the mandates of what the people in the fraternity and your mentors were telling you unless you became more educated.  And if you just knew what you had been told--I didn't--I mean, you know, here's a great point and counterpoint: all of the reading that I did, you know, all the way up and through the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], I never read a book on black history until I started taking a course at Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois] in the origins of black thought and Basil Davidson, African history and all of that.  I mean, so I mean what's wrong with that story, you know, all of those, all the way--St. Anselm's [School, Chicago, Illinois], nine years, with kindergarten, De La Salle [Institute, Chicago, Illinois], four years, University of Chicago.  And nobody--you know, and so I had a lot of catching up to do, not that I felt propelled to catch up, but I felt strongly motivated to do it.
Speaker 2: Now did you know, when you were coming up, did you know about [HistoryMaker] Margaret Burroughs and--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --her attempt to establish a museum [later DuSable Museum of African American History, Chicago, Illinois] or?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: The House of Knowledge, a bookstore with Hammurabi [Robb] and other people?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I didn't know about that.  I didn't know about that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I knew about that more, more, more in the era of my college years, so you know, '60 [1960], '59 [1959], '60 [1960].  That's, that's a, that's a crucial--I'm not quite sure when all of this stuff started coming together.  Because if you can imagine the fif--the late '50s [1950s].  I'm getting all of these impulses from these strong, influential, successful black men in a fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] about what kind of responsibility--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it really sounds like, and I hadn't heard this before, not to this degree that Alphas really had, the national leadership really had a commitment to do--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --do social change.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, without a doubt.  I mean, and it was ferocious.  When I say ferocious I don't mean necessarily physically ferocious--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but mentally it was, it was quite challenging and emotionally charged up because everyone put a premium on oratory and persuasiveness.  And you're talking about some, some people that could talk.  I mean, you listen to Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.], or Thurgood Marshall, or some of those guys sit down and talk to you when they were coming up, the passion, you're talking about passion, forget about it, man.  They had, I mean passion, you know, off the charts.  And when you--when they got--and [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], you know, when they got through with you were branded for life in terms of trying to do the kind of things that they talked about.
Story_ID: 197106
Speaker 1: Let's go to '61 [1961].  Now you got married in 1961?
Speaker 2: Right, September, 1961, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did you meet your wife [HistoryMaker Loann Honesty King] at the university [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Met her--she was in, she was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority [AKA].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Was she going to school here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: She went to school here in Chicago, and we met--
Speaker 1: Where did she go--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: She went to, she went to Englewood High School [later Englewood Technical Prep Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and then to Chicago Teachers College [later Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she graduated, became a teacher for CPS [Chicago Public Schools] at the time, but we met.  The Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] and the AKAs had a joint convention in Cincinnati [Ohio].  I think this might have been in 1960.  And that's when we met, even though we had seen each other, you know, at dances and stuff like--we'd never formed a, had even a conversation.  We just knew who each other were.  But anyway, so we met each other, and I think a year later we were engaged, and got married shortly thereafter.  And then a year after that, first son [Paul King, III] came along, and that takes me into--you know--the family life.  But again, I'm, what am I doing at that juncture?  Number one, I'm running a business.  I started a contracting business when I got married--before I got married.  I'm being married and family is starting to come.  And then I decided to--I think one time I was catching so much hell making payroll that I was running my business, doing my contracting business during the day, and I was a chemist for DeSoto Chemical [Coatings, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].  They were on 13th [Street] and Kostner [Avenue].  And I was developing--as a matter of fact, I did develop the first one-coat exterior latex house paint.  That's what I--that's the project I worked on for DeSoto, and DeSoto was owned by Sears, Roebuck [and Co.].  So I was over there, and I did this for about a year and a half or two.  So that proved that I could be the chemist that I set out to be, but I hated it. I felt like I was going to prison.  Every day I'd go down the Dan Ryan [Expressway] and head over to this laboratory, and I was never so happy to go out and be able to have lunch because I felt like I wasn't free.  So after about '63 [1963] or '64 [1964], I just jumped out of that and went full-time into my contracting business.
Story_ID: 197107
Speaker 1: Well, you said something interesting during the break, that influences today are a little bit different than they were when you were coming up.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, you know, the point I was making is, again, this phrase that I've been throwing in and out about being a uniquely favored historic generation, if you can just visualize what we've been talking about before of what I had working for me: father [Paul King, Sr.], grandfather [Charles Brown], whose example in evidence showed me not he value but the necessity of working rigorously at discipline.  And then you, and then you talk about the influences in the [Alpha Phi Alpha] Fraternity here locally in Chicago [Illinois] that mentored me as a young, aspiring college student.  And then you'd go further along the road and, and go into what kind of effect having someone who you held in awe, like Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.], and Thurgood Marshall, and [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], they weren't the big television figures and national figures that they are now, but they were very, very important to us in the context of fraternity in terms of what they were doing.  And you had those people all, and all, and it was all contributing to my growth, development, and purpose, my purpose.  And now you look and see--compare that, compare the excess, advantages, and mentors that I had in that, in that period, say 1950 to 1960.  I mean--and then take, take some black boy today or even take him say from 1970 to 1980 or 1980 and beyond.
Speaker 1: They're, starting with, already they're starting with no daddy, not--
Speaker 2: We're on a--
Speaker 1: --not to mention grandfather.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I mean, just as a, just as an aside, my youngest, my youngest son [Timothy King] was president of Hales Franciscan High School [Chicago, Illinois].  This was, this was--he was the first lay and the youngest person to ever be the president of a Catholic school here in Chicago.  I was on the board of director of Hales.  We were at a rally when I was being introduced to the young men, some of the students at Hales.  And I--he introduced me to one kid's name whose name was very similar to his, and I said, "Oh, how are you," shook his hand, then I said, "What's your father's name?"  And my son kicked me, and I just backed away from the conversation.  I said, "What's up with that?"  He said, "Dad, you don't ask these boys about what their fathers' names are, 'cause many of them don't even know who they are."  Now that goes to your point.  Here I am, with all of these advantages, and here is this kid-- I'm talking about 19-- this is 1985 or 19--this is 1990.  This is, I'm talking, the story I just gave is 1990.  Look at the difference.  From somebody who you know who is provide--two generations of who you know providing you example to some--to a case where you don't even know who it is.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, it's, to me, you know, you sit back and you think about this and said clearly, I'm responsible for more than some other people because I've been given more advantages.
Story_ID: 197108
Speaker 1: Now, let's get back to your story and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You started your business in '61 [1961]--when--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--what I did was--(coughs)--I had, as a result of being taught how--I had an uncle--this is my grandmother's [Olivia Priestley] youngest, youngest brother, who, he was a superintendent for a large painting and construction firm.  He, in summers and weekends he let me work with him and taught me how to paint, hang wallpaper, set tile, and, and do some other light carpentry work.  And you know, that was a real nice thing because--(clearing throat)--I was able to, man, I was able to make fifteen, sixteen dollars a day.  That was, you know, lots of money at that time.  And after I had learned how to do that, I was, you know--you gotta stay with me now.  That's when I was a member of the [Alpha Phi Alpha] Fraternity, and Oscar [C.] Brown [Real Estate Corp.] was a big real estate, oh, here in Chicago [Illinois].  So, it was about this time of year, maybe a little earlier, but in the month of December, I was trying to make some Christmas money.  And this is, this would have been in the 1950s, the late '50s [1950s], '58 [1958], '59 [1959].  And I said I wanna, you know, I'd like to--can you give me some painting jobs to do on some of your buildings?  So he had a building, a co-op.  He, he, he had a big apartment building on the corner of 51st [Street] and Woodlawn [Avenue] that he was converting on the north, it was on the northwest corner of 51st and Woodlawn, Hyde Park [Boulevard] and Woodlawn.  He was converting that into condos.  This is one of the first--co-op, into co-ops.  This is one of the first co-op developments in, on the South Side of Chicago.  At any rate, they had these huge stairwells, stair halls, and he gave me the contract to paint those stair halls.  So I got--I, I told my uncle I had this contract.  This is the uncle that had taught me how to do this.  I had this contract, and he would arrange it and let me get some equipment.  And he would help me get some of his men, and we would do this job, and I would pay everybody, you know, out of the proceeds.  So he arranged for me to get the paint on credit and the plaster.  And he lent me the tools, and he got me some grown men to come and work for me.  Now mind you, I'm a college student.  And I made, I after I paid everybody, I made five hundred dollars.  Boy, I was hooked then.  I said--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now this is 1958 or so, right?
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958], '59 [1959], yes.
Speaker 1: Five hundred dollars then was like--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  Well, then I'm talking about--
Speaker 1: Five, six weeks of work--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Less than that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: Two, okay.
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: I mean for the average working man, that represents about five or six weeks of work, right?
Speaker 2: The guys were getting paid twenty-five--I paid those guys twenty-five dollars a day for working on that job.  And he brought a ton of guys out there, you know, to get it done, in two days, on the weekend.  You know, and so we--two weekends it was all finished--
Speaker 1: And you still made five hundred dollars.
Speaker 2: Five--my--after I paid everybody, my share.  Anyway, that got me really smitten.  So in the back of my mind, here I am at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  If you were look at one of my old chemistry books, oh, University of Chicago books, I got notes in there about the fraternity and the speech I'm gonna make.  I got notes in there about the, about the contract I'm gonna do for so and so and how much money I'm gonna make.  So I was really thinking a lot about things other than chemistry.  But this whole business thing really got to me because I saw the kind of money that could be made.  And I did more of that, and I had people that were willing to work for me.  And I did that, you know, pretty much all the way up unto the '70s [1970s], when I started this company [UBM Inc., Chicago, Illinois] here.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you started it in '61 [1961], really formally, to--
Speaker 2: Formally, formally, formally, right before I got married.  So formally, I would say maybe '60 [1960], '59 [1959]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: -- in that area, in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so it grew to the point where when you left the job with the paint company--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, see, I was still--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: --mind you, I was still doing the same--I still had the--even while I was going--working at the paint company.  See, I wanted to work at the paint company.  You know, you get married, you gotta, you gotta start bringing in some regular money.  So I went and start working, you know, at DeSoto Chemical [Coatings, Inc.], but at the same time I still had this painting, this small painting contracting company going.  You remember the model I told you about, about how my father [Paul King, Sr.] delegated the work to the guy when he went to the [U.S.] Army.  So I had seen how you could delegate something to somebody you trusted to take care of it.  And when you came--and then at the end of the day, you came and saw how things were, and then at--on a weekend, you're settled up.  So there was a lot of--you know, I was always trying to do two things at once, pretty much.
Story_ID: 197109
Speaker 1: What happens next?  What's your, what--
Speaker 2: Well, if you--I think two major things are happening.  First of all, I'm going to--I'm getting this strong sense of racial consciousness and racial interest in black people.  And so in the '60s [1960s], I went to Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois].  I wanted to just get involved with black studies and, and black history.  And I studied under St. Clair Drake, Charles [V.] Hamilton, C. L. R. James, you know, and those people.  Now there's where, you talking about some absolutely awesome encounters.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, they are.  These are giants and--
Speaker 2: Yeah because that's where--I mean Charles Hamilton, with the book he wrote with, with Stokely [Carmichael, later Kwame Ture], 'Black Power: [The Politics of Liberation in America],' and St. Clair Drake with 'Black Metropolis: [A Study of Negro Life in a Northern City],' and C. L. R. James with 'The Black Jacobins: [Toussaint L'ouverture and the San Domingo Revolution],' you know, our label to--each of them gave me an avenue of insight into black people.  Hamilton was always an advocate, a student of change.  St. Clair Drake used to be able to have insights into empirical phenomenon going into the black community and connected.  He, I mean he could connect what black people were doing here, and how black people created the Haitian Revolution, and what the connections were.  And C. L. R. James, of course, he was--I'd always, I had always wanted to understand how and why we had so many national black advocates coming from the Caribbean, Stokely from Trinidad, you know, and--
Speaker 1: Marcus Garvey from Jamaica.
Speaker 2: Jamaica, you know, all of that.  And he, you know, ex--he explained to me, you know, the first time that at some point a small island is no longer large enough to absorb great thoughts.  And you have to have a larger theater of operation.  And that sounds simplistic at first to me then, but in retrospect, you know, I think about how much sense that absolutely makes--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because this very quickly moves into 1969, when I was involved in leading the first shutdowns to get blacks into the unions.
Speaker 1: Now, now, before we get too far ahead--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --now, now you were at Roosevelt at what period of time, from?
Speaker 2: Sixty--I would say from about '67 [1967], '66 [1966], '67 [1967], and then I took a degree in political science from there.  I believe that was in '70 [1970] or '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were there for the latter part of the '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at, at Roosevelt?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: By--yeah, so you were there really when the--at the dawn of the black power era, I guess--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yes--
Story_ID: 197110
Speaker 1: Before that time, now, in '63 [1963] when the March on Washington took place was your sister [Claudia King] still involved with [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was, but that was probably my--the years, the years when I was nowhere nearly as socially conscious or active, you know, right--and I was, I had taken more like a hiatus of a sort, not--it wasn't distance, but I was not as much of an activist as I had been in the [Alpha Phi Alpha] Fraternity days or as I would become, you know, after that period.  But at '63 [1963], I was working--in '63 [1963] I was working as a chemist.  You know, I had this one--and running a business and had this one boy [King's son, Paul King, III] that I was busily trying to make sure I had something for him going.  So I think from '63 [1963] till about '64 [1964] and '65 [1965], in that era.  I was not as much involved, but I was in activism, but I was greatly involved in meetings and in education, I mean Andy [Anderson] Thompson and, and [HistoryMaker] Harold Pates.  And I think we started the--not, I didn't start, but my wife [HistoryMaker Loann Honesty King] and Andy, they started the Communiversity [Chicago, Illinois] I think was right around '60 [1960] [sic. 1970].  You remember the year?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that Communiversity, I'm not sure when it started 'cause I wasn't in town, but I know they started in the mid-'60s [1960s] at some point.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so you see, so this--
Speaker 1: And that was, for those who are watching this later that was a community university that dealt with issues of relevance to black people in the black community.
Speaker 2: Exactly, and it was also a degree, it was also a degree providing facility; I mean you could, a person could go there and study; you could do Communiversity, which was anybody.  But then, you know, it fed into Northeastern [Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois], which a person could, in fact, get their degree, 'cause my wife got her master's degree--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: -- from that.  And I think--
Speaker 1: From the Center for Inner City Studies [later the Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, from the Center for Inner City Studies, right.  But, so there was that, that whole level of interact meetings, discussions.  One of the great things about that period of time was that you were able to take any idea you had and talk to these people about it.  I mean, again, you don't think of yourself as being, you know, tremendously advantaged at the time this is happening, but I wanna talk to somebody about see--something, some book C. L. R. James wrote.  I get on the phone, and I call Jake [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.].  Jake, what do you think?  Okay, okay, okay, all right, go back and look at that, go to some footnote, call up Andy or meet him for some breakfast, and talk about it.  I mean the level of learning and discourse, you know, was so tremendous.  I sometimes think about how they, not romanticize, but they talk about the Harlem Renaissance, you know, when you had all of these people writing and--but I think we had something here that was so big, because you almost had to--in order to be current, you had to read.  I mean you just couldn't be current.  You know it, maybe when you were going to college, and going to some dance or something like that, you wanted to have you a Brooks Brothers' suit or a tweed jacket, whatever the current fashion was, right?  At this juncture, in order to be current, you had to not only have read, but understood what you read, and be able to get into dialogue about it with people who might be teaching it, or might even be who had written it.  You know, I mean and so it was, intellectually, it was a, it was a huge time, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And so we're talking Dr. Jacob Caruthers was the Jake you referred to?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Andy, Dr. Anderson Thompson.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: We got--
Speaker 2: Dr. Harold Pates.
Speaker 1: Dr. Harold Pates.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Dr. Bobby [E.] Wright--
Speaker 2: Bobby, Bobby--
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: --Wright.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: Bobby Wright and his wife [Easter Wright], we used to, we used to go to his house for parties.  And first time I used Bobby Wright's book [sic. article, "Mentacide: The Ultimate Threat to the Black Race"]--first time I used an article I wrote in Emerge magazine, I used the word mentacide.  And I said that Clarence Thomas was--Justice, Supreme Court judge [sic. Supreme Court Justice] Clarence Thomas was a victim of mentacide.  And they said, you know, the proofreaders at Emerge said where did you get this word mentacide from?  So I had to go and jerk out Bobby's book, you know, and photocopy it, and sent it to 'em, you know.  What--I mean this is the level of stuff--of dialogue that was going on.  Now mind you, this is just in the neighborhood.  You still got this wealth of knowledge down there at Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois], you know, with the--so I mean it was, it was, it was big intellectually.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: I wasn't, as I said, that much in the activist role, but as far as intellectually, man, it was beautiful; it was beautiful.
Story_ID: 197111
Speaker 1: So was it by association that you kind of got drawn into trying to--I mean that prompted your going to Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois] to--
Speaker 2: No, it was--no, I knew that I needed more formal education in trying to un- if I was gonna be true to the purpose that I had, that I think that had evolved in my mind, I knew that I needed more formal education in this arena.  I knew that I had--I mean I knew that I knew a lot, so I had to structure my--I had to give some structure to my learning, to my pursuits.
Speaker 1: Would it be fair to say then that you saw some of your future activities as a contractor in a political realm more so than--I mean so rather than going, go to school to learn more about contracting, you were going to school to learn more about politics--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --and/or, and how to--
Speaker 2: But I don't think that I could connect those two dots, or that I did--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --connect those two dots at that time.  I think that in order to give more meaning to me and give more, again, give me more weapons in my arsenal, and I've used that term before, I needed to learn more, and I needed to get, I needed to have some structured learning.  So I mean, see, I was learning, like sitting down, talking to Jake Carruthers [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.] or sitting down talking to Anderson Thompson--I was learning, and I was learning if I was reading books, but I wasn't being challenged to be able to make sure that that learning was being structured in such a way that: a) I could write about it; b) I could formally talk about it; and c) that I could convince or persuade people to my point of view on it or debate it.  So what this, what this Roosevelt experience did was provide me with a forum in which I could do that; otherwise, I would be just another--so I mean I--otherwise, I'd just be another learned individual.  So I wanted to get some credentials associated with it, which I did.  But I think that as I studied more, with both [Charles V.] Hamilton and [Bobby E.] Wright--I mean Hamilton and St. Clair Drake, I was able to understand the politics of things much more and then clearly, without a doubt, the politics of business I began to see.  I mean and that's the first article that I'd ever published was 1972.  I wrote about the delirium imperium, the connection of black business and black politics.  And so those ideas then were actually a result of those things that had taken place.  So Drake and Hamilton and all the oth--Bobby Wright and the other experiences that I had, I had in that article.  I mean, that Black Scholar article, this is kind of the way, how the things evolved.  Now this Black Scholar article was a result of--
Speaker 1: This is an article that you write for Black Scholar--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --on--and what was the title of it?
Speaker 2: "[The Role of Black Business:] Delirium or Imperium" [The Black Scholar, Paul King].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 197112
Speaker 1: We had--[HistoryMaker] Nathan Hare came into Chicago [Illinois].  And we were talking, we were visiting, and he said that he wanted to have a symposium out in Sausalito, California, with blacks who were active in different fields coming out and presenting a paper that would be of what they thought about it, and we would each discuss it and critique it.  I said, "Fine, I'll--."  He said, "Well, will you do one as a black businessman?"  I said, "Okay, I will."  So, you know, I mean--now here I am with, with Nathan Hare, Max Roach, the drummer, Johnnetta [B.] Cole, Bob Allen, just--
Speaker 2: Robert [L.] Allen, right?
Speaker 1: Robert Allen, yeah, and just some other--who was, who was the pres--who was the president, the female president of Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia]?  That wasn't Johnnetta Cole.  That--what's her name?  Do you know the one who got the big gift from Bill Cosby?
Speaker 2: Oh, I know and I can't think of her [sic. Johnnetta Cole was the first female African American president of Spelman College, and she received a twenty million dollar donation from the Cosby family].
Speaker 1: Anyway, she--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --she was there.  So, you know, and, and we each had to present these pape--Max Roach gave it on music.  Johnnetta Cole gave it on education.  Robert Allen gave it on, I think, politics.  And we each critiqued it, and then they--we were published in the Black Scholar.  Now, the learning that had taken place with Anderson Thompson, Jake Carruthers [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.], [HistoryMaker] Harold Pates, the structured learning that took place with St. Clair Drake and Charles [V.] Hamilton and the writing style that I developed, came into focus in those two articles that were published in the Black Scholar magazine in 1972.  And you know, that's thirty plus years ago.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they're really from the perspective of a black businessman who was actually--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --successful and--
Speaker 1: But at that--
Speaker 2: --working.
Speaker 1: -- at that point, I wasn't successful.  Business was bad.  I was an aspiring businessman, but that was very much affected by what was possible in terms--and what was needed.  I advanced theories of what was needed, you know, and then if you look at that, many of those things that I advanced in that Black Scholar article I tried to do, or have attempted to do, or have done as a black business owner.  Now, again, in this window, which I would say by far the most amazing time of my life was between 1967, '68 [1968] and '72 [1972], '73 [1973].
Story_ID: 197113
Speaker 1: (unclear) in July 23, 1969, concurrent to all this other stuff going on, I was involved as one of the leaders in shutting down the construction site, sixty million dollars' worth of construction here in Chicago [Illinois].  Now, you--
Speaker 2: Now what, what was, what, what were they working on at that time?
Speaker 1: Well we--it started, it started on Douglas Boulevard, about at Homan [Avenue].  There were two or three rehab projects going on.  Now this was a very amazing and probably one of the--a watershed moment in my life.  We had [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] C. T. Vivian, who had worked with [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.], was based here in Chicago.  And he organized a group of twelve.  We called it the Group of 12.  So it was Jeff Fort from the Stones [Black P. Stone Nation, formerly Blackstone Rangers], David Barksdale from the D's [Black Disciples], Bobby Gore from the Lords [Conservative Vice Lords].
Speaker 2: These are gang, gang leaders, right, at that time?
Speaker 1: Well, at that time, we called them organizational leaders.
Speaker 2: Okay, Jeff Fort from the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, from the Stones.
Speaker 2: --what they call the--
Speaker 1: The--
Speaker 2: --Blackstone Rangers.
Speaker 1: Right.  Bobby Gore from the Vice Lords--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and David Barksdale from the Disciples.  Now, and then we had other people like Bob Lucas [Robert Lucas]--
Speaker 2: He's with the Kenwood--
Speaker 1: Ken--well, at that--
Speaker 2: --Oakland--
Speaker 1: --time, [Reverend] Curtis Burrell was representing the Kenwood-Oakland Community Organization [Chicago, Illinois]; you had Sally Johnson with Allies for a Better Community [ABC, Chicago, Illinois]; you had Bob Taylor; you had David Reed with the Valley [Community] Organization [Chicago, Illinois]; you had me representing West Side Builders Association [later, The United Builders Association of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  And they didn't want [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L. Jackson], so [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Calvin Morris was representing--
Speaker 2: Operation--
Speaker 1: --Operation Breadbasket.  So at any rate, it was twelve of us.  And we went out there on July 23rd and shut down, physically shut down this construction site.  And it caught everybody by surprise.  And we--
Speaker 2: Now why did you shut the site down?
Speaker 1: Well, because at that time, over two points: one, jobs for black people, and two, contracts for black contractors.
Story_ID: 197114
Speaker 1: So, we're talking about the--we're talking about the reasons for shutting down the construction sites on July 23, 1969. There were--at that time, there were less than 2 percent of all of the construction unions had any black people in them.  And [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] C. T. Vivian and Meredith Gilbert--Meredith Gilbert was representing LPPAC, Lawndale People['s] Planning and Action Committee from the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].  They came up with the idea that the research that this project was being funded by HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] funds.
Speaker 2: Public money.
Speaker 1: And that the unions, by virtue of their involvement with this, were obligated to not only not discriminate but also to take some affirmative action.
Speaker 2: And to prioritize the hiring of black people.
Speaker 1: To--a step further.  And they weren't doing this, so we shut--we, physically went out there and got in between the delivery trucks and everybody and the workers and said you can't work here unless you give us some jobs.
Speaker 2: Now just, before we go a little--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --further, let's go back a little bit--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to '68 [1968]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --after the death of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --there were riots--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --on, on the West Side.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: A lot of property destroyed and damaged--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --where poor people lived.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Was this an attempt to reconstruct some of that, or was it--
Speaker 1: Well, some people--
Speaker 2: --separate from that.
Speaker 1: --some people say that it was, and it may have been.  Because you know, this was not the--the riots happened largely on Madison [Street] in the commercial retail areas.  This was, even though it was on a major thoroughfare, it was not a commer- it was a residential district.  So, the HUD funds for rehabbing may have been a political response, but I'm not absolutely positive that it was a direct response, because the first direct thing that is done is when we built that movie theater just recently on Roosevelt [Road] and Homan [Avenue].
Speaker 2: And that was a black effort.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean that's, you know, that's really where you're putting some commercial stuff back into a war-torn area.  But at any rate, we used the position that they could not dis- use federal funds to discriminate against blacks by keeping them out of the union.  So you had here the confluence of a couple of very important things.  The white contractors association who got involved in this was the--is the Association of General Contractors [sic. Associated General Contractors of America], the Builders Association.  These are the same people who are fighting the city's minority business program right now.  So in other words, just if you can stay with this.  In 1969, they were against us, and here we are thirty-four years later, and they have, they are still, you know, anti-black people.  This is the Association of General Contractors.
Story_ID: 197115
Speaker 1: Just to make another point, maybe to make another point here that, a contract in a city like Chicago [Illinois] is extremely important to working class people. Right, and the--just kind of talk about the his-- 'cause I know you know the history of this--what a contract means to Italians, Irish, or any other ethnic group in the a city that starts off poor.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, well, you see, a contractor is really a step up from being a tradesman.  Most of your contractors have a history of having been a tradesman, so that if you have a masonry contractor, that contractor generally had his or her start in being a bricklayer.  If you have a painting contractor, that person had his start undoubtedly in painting as a tradesperson.  So, the first thing is, you get your practical experience in the field as being a tradesman.  Once you become able to negotiate and assemble labor and materials to sell that to someone, you become a contractor.
Speaker 1: Were there a lot of black tradesmen?
Speaker 2: No, what I'm explaining to you is that you had less than 2 percent of all the tradespersons in Chicago trade--construction unions--were black.  So you can--you can hardly get to the stage of expanded black contractor base until you expand the amount of black learning that takes place as a tradesperson.  So what we were doing at the same time was demanding more jobs, but I was representing the, the West Side Builders Association [later, The United Builders Association of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] that was a loosely knit organization of about forty contractors, all of whom were small.  And I was there saying yeah, and the reason we want these jobs is so we can have more contractors.  But what I was also doing, I think unbeknownst to the opposition, was getting into the dialogue the issue of including black contractors on the demands so that when you had a case like, people were just talking about jobs, I would say, well, black people were fully employed during slavery, so we don't want just jobs.  We want contracting opportunities so we can hire our people, and which was genuine, but it was an argument that was thrown in there, and nobody seemed to object to it.  So that's when, you know, the whole idea of black contractors became important.  Now it's very significant for you to pick up on, at the same time, we were pressing the issue of blacks getting into the unions and getting more jobs.  We were also pressing--and I was taking this argument for black contractors.  I became one of the founding members in Sept--August of 1969 of the National Association of Minority Contractors [NAMC].  That was an organization founded in California, and it was aimed at trying to create greater laws that would guarantee and maximize black contractors, while everybody else was still talking about affirmative action and black jobs.
Story_ID: 197116
Speaker 1: Now, here is where all of the things come to work, come together.  During 1970, I wrote an article called "The Black Elected Official and the Black Contractor" [sic. "Black Political Leaders and the Black Construction Issue"].  And I sent that article to every member of the Congressional Black Caucus, every member, every black alderman, and every black elected official in the State of Illinois.  [HistoryMaker] Parren [J.] Mitchell [III], the Democrat from Maryland, called me up and said, will I come to Washington [D.C.], because he wanted to talk to me about how we could work together to create some laws that were going to benefit black contractors, and to that end, black businesses--black workers.  So I went, I went to Washington and became a member of the Congressional Black Caucus brainstorming group.  Parren called it the Black Business Braintrust.  And we were able to, we were tasked to sit down and evaluate legislation and also evaluate ways and means by which we could get the legislative process to work to help black businesses.  So you had black businesses--so you had people like [HistoryMaker] Earl [G.] Graves [Sr.], [HistoryMaker] Ed[ward] Lewis from Essence, myself, we were all, you know, members of this black brain trust.  And what we were able to do is use Parren Mitchell's office as a basis for putting amendments into law--onto laws.  We created in the Small Business Administration [SBA], we created an office of minority small business, which began to address specifically concerns of black contractors and black businesses.  So, what you had here going on--this was really a clearly important juncture--you had both black contractors' activities going on vis-a-vis the National Association of Minority Contractors [NAMC] and the work that we were doing with Parren Mitchell.  And at the same time we had the black worker issue going forward and championing affirmative action.  And we ended up shutting down over sixty million dollars' worth of work here in Chicago [Illinois], and it was one of the greatest organizing things that I've ever seen in my life.  [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] C. T. Vivian, it truly amazed me how unselfish he was in the activities that he carried out.  Because what he was able to do is get all of these egos of all of these leaders of organizations to sit down and work together without having any hidden agendas for the common good.  And they cre- that movement created change that the beneficiaries of today don't even know about.  And if there's one thing that I would hope this interview would be able to do is tell the story of how right now we've got 30 percent of the workforce as minorities and women.  Each one of those owe their opportunity to those brave, unselfish people that went out there and shut that site down on July 23rd, 1969.  And I doubt that any of them really know the history of that.  And what else is important, is to understand how on the one hand the construction unions, they got religion and found out how important it was for them to embrace bringing in black and other ethnic groups into their unions.  The white contractors, on the other hand, have been continually relentless and adversarial toward us in term, terms of what we've tried to do.  So this was a very key point in the whole history of the construction industry, in this country.  And if you, if you think about it, all of the major [U.S.] Supreme Court cases have dealt around two central areas: educational and contracting.  So if you look at Adarand [Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 1995] coming out of the South, that was construction.  If you look at Croson [City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 1989] that came out of Virginia, that was construction.  You look at Bakke [Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 1978] and DeFunis [DeFunis v. Odegaard, 1974], that's education.  You look at Michigan that just got--that was educational [Grutter v. Bollinger, 2003].  But the students, the students that led the educational effort at [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], I brought to the National Association of Minority Contractors' Conference to sat down and give them some historical data that they could use in their case.
Story_ID: 197117
Speaker 1: What we started here in Chicago [Illinois] in '69 [1969] was, in fact, something that was so successful that it has gone all the way to a [U.S.] Supreme Court that was our friend in '69 [1969] who is now our enemy today.  And it's an amazing juxtaposition when you think about what has happened with something that some dedicated people in Chicago did, dedicated black people did, under the leadership of [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] C. T. Vivian.
Speaker 2: And once again, on that, on that committee was yourself, [HistoryMaker Reverend] Calvin Morris.  C. T. Vivian called it together.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Who else was it?
Speaker 1: Sally Johnson, [Reverend] Curtis Burrell, David Reed, Meredith Gilbert, Bob Taylor, Bobby Gore, Jeff Fort, David Barksdale, Bob Lucas [Robert Lucas].  That should, that should get you about twelve.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And there was a--the twelve were called?
Speaker 1: The 12.
Speaker 2: The 12, okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: No apostles, nothing like that (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 197118
Speaker 1: You all started the ball rolling of change in terms of these contracts?
Speaker 2: It not only started, but you see, it has evolved.  Two of the very disappointing things that, that I can say in reflecting on this is the first, you know, with the opportunities for blacks that were created, we should have more blacks working in construction now.  And we don't, because the educational situation has, has not fostered teaching our children the value of what the world of construction has to offer them.  So we don't have anywhere near the number of blacks in Chicago [Illinois] involved in construction.  I mean, for example, UBM [Inc., Chicago, Illinois], the company that I head, is the largest black owned construction firm.  We don't have any of the three big black firms that were in business when we started this stuff in '69 [1969]; they're no longer in business, able to do jobs of any substance.  I mean we had [Charles F.] Moore [Construction Co., Chicago, Illinois], we had [Robert] Martin [Construction Co., Inc., Chicago, Illinois], we had Bush [Construction Co., Chicago, Illinois], big companies.  Ideally, they would have been able to succeed, and go forward, and take advantage of this, not the case.  So one of the things that I am working very diligently to do here at this company is to make it a multigenerational business.  But again, as far as the number of jobs that we see, we see more Hispanics taking advantage of the opportunities for jobs in construction.  What can we do to get more blacks involved?  I think we have to do a minimum of two things: first, we have to let these young people in the Chicago public schools know about what the opportunities in the world of construction can provide.  You know, you can make a one thousand dollars  a week, take-home pay, off of being a construction laborer?  I mean how many of these kids really know that?  And what do they have to do to become that?  And the second thing that we have to do is reinstitute Pell Grants so that these hundreds of thousands of black men incarcerated can learn some trades while they're in confinement, so when they come out they can be productive.  Now, the other thing you should understand is that there are about a hundred and fifty thousand jobs in construction that go unmet every year.  So here you have a group of people that are in a position to be trained in an industry that needs 'em, and all that has to be done is the two of 'em be put together.  Well, they can't be put together effectively if there is no training and skill development, which is what I'm advocating.  And at the same, at the same time, if we look at the average age of a union employee is about forty-eight years old.  That means that they're graying.  And the young people are not coming up, so that this is a perfect opportunity for the new people, for new people to get the skills, learn the discipline, and learn how to navigate the world of work so that they could become--earning in this industry.  And you know, it's so simple that you wonder why somebody hasn't done it yet, but it's a fact.  I was sitting at a major construction meeting with some large white firms.  And they were talking about important workers from a foreign country, workers, not engineers, workers.  And I just got up and said look, if you talk any more about this, I'm walking out of the room.  Because how can you talk about important workers when you got incarcerated people that could be trained right now and be able to fill these gaps, when you could be going into these black high schools and training people to be able to come in and do this work.  And they speak the language; you wouldn't have to translate for them.  You know, but, I mean this is, I think this is the task in front of us now, is to be able to take these opportunities and train some people who are educable, 'cause this is not rocket scientry [ph.].  This is something that people can do, and train them so that they can take advantage of this.
Story_ID: 197119
Speaker 1: Now, what about your business that you--I mean what do you do in terms for--
Speaker 2: UBM [Inc., Chicago, Illinois]--UBM [Inc.] is a multidiscipline construction firm.  We do general contracting, construction management, and we do, we self-perform concrete.  So if you saw the concrete on Soldier Field [Chicago, Illinois], we did that.  We did that one in a joint venture with another firm, but we do that kind of work.  If you saw the, the Jewel Food Store on 95th [Street] and Stony Island [Avenue], we built that.  You see the Northern Trust Bank on 78th [Street] and State [Street], we were the general contractor for that.  If you see Jeremiah Wright's [HistoryMaker Reverend Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr.] church on West 95th Street, we built that. So we do, we do general contracting; we do concrete.  If you see the police--I mean the fire station at 67th [Street], just a little bit west of Stony Island, we just got through building that.  So you have, so that-- we are about, we're a twenty-eight-year-old company.  I started this company with another gentleman by the name of Sham Dabadghao.  We started this company.  We added a third person who has been with us throughout that time, Sandra Jiles.  And then we have expanded the company now to, there's approximately a hundred employees, give or take.  And we, we are involved in most major projects here in the City of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  I guess what's been the most difficult task in terms of doing what you, doing contracting work here in the city?
Speaker 2: I think the, I think one of the most difficult challenges that faces us is to be able to identify and bring in sufficient number of young black people so that they could eventually become leaders in the company.  You know, unfortunately, you know, I think black people have, maybe the only people that have left their, the training of the young, the education of their young people to others.  And in so doing, we've got a large number of young people who, who I'm here to ensure that they could get an opportunity to become future leaders.  But the education, the self-esteem, the confidence, the discipline, and the order that they need to have in their approach is, is, is not there in sufficient quantities to be able to cast them into the leadership roles that I would like to see them to achieve.  So I think this is a real tough, tough thing.  I mean, clearly any business is gonna have difficulty with things like being able to na- get bank loans or being able to get surety bonds.  And these have been difficult, but I know that those are things that you can, you can overcome them, I mean with enough work.  There's a lot of racism, there's a lot of hostility, but still you can overcome those.  It's very difficult to, to want--to, to find a black senior manager that can get out there and maybe run a big job.  They're not there, so what we have to do is train them, bring them along.  That's a--that process takes a number of years, so it's not happening as fast as I would like to see it happen.  And I think that's the biggest challenge that I see right now.
Story_ID: 197120
Speaker 1: Ironically, it seems as though the [Chicago] Board of Education is changing the focus of some schools that were I guess focused on trades at one time, that the--Dunbar [Vocational High School, formerly, Dunbar Trade School, Chicago, Illinois] used to be a trade school is what I've heard, and then it became a vocational school, which meant that the graduates were no longer--they didn't automatically go into the union.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that was a setback.  And the--now Dunbar's an academy.  It's not even considered a vocational school.  CVS [Chicago Vocational Career Academy, formerly, Chicago Vocational School, Chicago, Illinois] is still existent, and so does--Simeon [Career Academy, formerly, Westcott Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois] is now an academy I think and not focused on vocations.  Do you have issues with the board of education in terms of those things?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the whole problem comes down to whoever is making curriculum choices and whoever is providing guidance counseling has not got a current grip on what the opportunities for construction are.  I mean it almost goes back to the old W.E.B. Du Bois, Booker T. Washington argument, you know.  Is everybody still talking about the Talented Tenth and Booker T. is talking about, you know, getting some jobs?  I don't believe that it's necessarily that simple, but I believe that in today's economy, guidance counselors ought to be looking at, you know, where are sustained avenues of employment, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, architects.  You know, professions related to the industry are one case.  You know, you know, a couple of years ago we only had one black person to graduate with a civil engineering degree from IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois].  I mean, what's wrong with that story?  We need to be encouraging our youngsters to learn--the civil engineers are the ones just gonna be repairing these dilapidated bridges, are the ones that are gonna be setting up, lining up the Dan Ryans [Dan Ryan Expressway], and the street construction.  It's the civil engineers that's--it's environmental engineers that's gone be continually looking at water, that's gon' be associated with water purification as well as water reclamation.  So these are professions that have ongoing continued line of work.  Now, as far as the trades are concerned, if I just told you that one thousand dollars a week take home is for a construction laborer, why can someone come from Mexico who doesn't speak the language can do these jobs, and some black boy or girl right here in the neighborhood can't do it?  Something is wrong with the educational process.  It doesn't guide these youngsters into these job opportunities.

Speaker 2: We're in the offices of UBM, Incorporated, [Chicago, Illinois] which is the construction firm of which I am the president, chairman, and CEO.  It is the largest African American owned construction firm in the State of Illinois.  And it's located here at 223 West Jackson Boulevard in Chicago, Illinois.
Story_ID: 197122
Speaker 1: I think we started to talk about the work shutdown on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], and how that was orchestrated and--
Speaker 2: Oh, I think that that was the most marvelous display of black unity, leadership, ability to change, and the capacity to subvert one's ego to a larger purpose, and have a national effect that is still in place.  It is--that, those work showdowns, the only parallel that I've been able to see to those work shutdowns in my lifetime and in my reading has been the struggle for voting rights.  Other than that, there has been nothing.  You have to--as we speak, we are--this is the thirty-fifth, this year is the thirty-fifth anniversary of when we shut those construction sites down.  This was an organization of organizations.  We had Bobby Gore from the [Conservative] Vice Lords; we had David Barksdale for the D's [Black Disciples]; we had Jeff Fort from the [Black] P. Stone Rangers [sic. Black P. Stone Nation, formerly, Blackstone Rangers]; we had Sally Johnson from the Allies for a Better Community [ABC]; had Bob Lucas [Robert Lucas]; [Reverend] Curtis Burrell; we had, we had people from [Operation] Breadbasket, [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Calvin Morris, and all of us were being led by [HistoryMaker] Reverend [Dr.] C. T. Vivian.  And C. T. had this uncanny capacity to take all of these egos and have them submit to the purpose of: we want to get jobs in the construction industry.  Meredith Gilbert from LPPAC [Lawndale People's Planning and Action Conference] on the West Side, so we had the whole city covered.  Now, our basis for this was that there were some HUD, [U.S. Department of] Housing and Urban Development, projects being done on West Douglas Boulevard.  There were no black subcontractors and very few, maybe one or two black workers.  At that time, less than 2 percent of the construction workers in the Chicago area were black.  And we used--Meredith Gilbert and C. T. came up with this.  You know, they said, in order to use HUD funds, you have to--you cannot discriminate, and you have to use people from the community in which these HUD funds are being spent.  So we researched Executive Order 11246, which said you not only had to cease discrimination, but you had to have affirmative action to, in fact, correct the effects of discrimination.  And this was a crucial--I mean, man, I'll tell you, I'm sitting there in the midst--it was only twelve of us.  They didn't let [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson in.  They only let Calvin Morris.  I'm sitting in the midst of these, of these guys.  I mean, you know, everybody is peaceful, respectful, and we--the day we went out there to shut down the sites, we had over a thousand people, you know, and you know, you had these--we, we used to call 'em our LSD, Lords, Stones, and Disciples.  You know, at that time LSD was a popular hallucinogenic, but we said our LSD are the troops.  And they went out there and stood in peaceful attention and we told the white contactors and the white workers, you can't come on this site.  You can't work unless we work.  That particular event was so strong that it led to what is called, what was called then The Chicago Plan, which was a plan to integrate the unions, and also a plan that would require black--but they changed it to minority--black subcontractors on federal funded projects.
Story_ID: 197123
Speaker 1: How was this plan [The Chicago Plan] initiated?  Can you--I mean who took the initiative to build the--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Well, the way it worked was that, after we shut the jobs down--we shut down sixty million dollars' worth of work.  I mean that had never been done before in Chicago [Illinois].  I mean and, and the, the only violent people were white unionists later on at another juncture, but there was no violence.  [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson came by on one site and, and managed to get in jail, get arrested and go to jail.  He grabbed up one little disciple and said, come on.  The guy said no, I can't afford to go to jail (laughter), 'cause I already got a beef on me.  But at any rate, the way that it worked, when we shut down all of this work, it got, you know, it clearly got the attention of the media.  And then what we had was a meeting in the mayor's office, then Mayor [Richard J.] Daley.  And on one side of the table were--this is very interesting--we had the white unions and the white contractors.  Now usually they're at opposition with each other, but with us, they were on the same side.  And then on the other side was the coalition, our group [Coalition for United Community Actions Negotiating Team].  And Ralph Metcalfe, who was one of my frat [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] brothers that he was--I think he was [president] pro tempore of the [Chicago] City Council at the time, so I used to call him pro.  So at any rate, so we had the mayor, and Ralph Metcalfe as pro tempore and these guys.  And so we began to set our demands.  We said that we wanted ten thousand jobs immediately, and we wanted opportunities for black contractors.  It was very important because at that point, I could have let the discussion of black contractors get immersed in this whole Chicago Plan thing.  But I said, black contractors is a separate thing, so that'll be discussed separately from integrating the unions, 'cause I said we were fully employed during slavery, so we don't need just jobs.  We need black contractor opportunities.  So that was a crucial point.  Now, taking it--these discussions, these meetings came up with a series of basically negotiations brokered by the mayor and us.  And what it ultimately said was that there would be a--there would be goals and timetables to integrate the unions with African Americans.  And that was the only group at the time being mentioned.  You know, the group expanded into a larger number of ethnic groups over time, but at that time, the unions would have goals, a specific number that they would reach within a particular timeframe in order to integrate the unions.  I mean you have to understand that what I'm talking about is that at this time, blacks were confined to what we call the wet and trial trades.  You had some blacks in the painters' union; you had some blacks that were in the concrete laborers' union.  But you didn't have any black elevator operators; you didn't have any--you had very few black electricians; you had very few black HVAC, heat, ventilation and air conditioning workers.  So, the whole idea of these particular sub-negotiations were not just to get jobs but to get jobs across the twenty-plus trades that are in--that were in the unions.  And this, this particular plan got funded in part by Model Cities [Program] and some other things.  I don't know if you remember Fred Hubbard was made the first head of that, and then he had some problems.  But the plan still remained a victory because we put on the table and got legitimacy for the fact that federal work, federally funded work had to have goals and timetables associated with the workforce, and it had to be given some attention to be determined toward the use of black subcontractors.

Speaker 1: Now if you wanna fast forward from there, we then took--I became pretty much a leader, leading advocate, traveling around the country when--shut down work in Denver [Colorado] at Stapleton [International] Airport, Seattle [Washington], King County [Washington].  I helped Nate Smith in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  And so we began a national movement based on the Chicago model [The Chicago Plan].  And what that has done, I mean just numerically, is that we now have over 25 percent minorities in the trade, in the building trades.  However, far too many of them are, are, are non-African Americans.  It pains me to see and to know who started it and who now are the beneficiaries, because the pool of applicants are Hispanics, Asians, white females, in addition to blacks.  And the tragedy of this is that we've got some young brothers in the street that could be making a thousand dollars a week as a laborer, and instead of making that thousand dollars a week legitimately and paying taxes, they living from hand and mouth, being lookouts or something like that when it's--instead of becoming a foreman, they're looking at three cots, you know, three hots and a cot in county jail, and this is tragic.
Story_ID: 197125
Speaker 1: This kind of hearkens back to the beginning of this discussion because you had members of the street organizations on the front line.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And maybe I don't--this might be good--can you tell us, 'cause a lot of people don't understand how these organizations are formed and what they're about and so forth, and their ups and downs in the City of Chicago [Illinois] as well as elsewhere, but can you talk a little bit about, what is--give me the history of blacks' involvement in gangs in the city and--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --and what is really a gang--
Speaker 2: Well, I can only speak from my own associations and experiences.  In the case of their commitment to what we were doing, they were on time, disciplined, honorable, and kept their word.  So if we were to be there at seven o'clock in the morning, they were there at seven o'clock.  If they was to stand at parade rest or attention in the heat of the day, they did that.  They would--if Jeff Fort or one of his lieutenants said this was gonna happen, no one stepped out of line, it happened.  So you had that particular set of behaviors going on.  Now, what they did to generate money, to enforce control in their areas, I don't think that's unique one bit to African Americans; Irish did it; Italians did it.  It's--so, the problem that I see, and I see some of the sons of these guys that I--that marched with us are now coming out of jail and saying, and talking to me about trying to get jobs.  And I have tried to assist in doing that.  But in today's time, I think where we lost the capacity to do some of the things that we--the discipline may have been, you know, with the fact of the introduction of crack.  At one time, they didn't allow any crack; Jeff Fort didn't allow any crack distributed in and around his area.  But I think that when you look at, when you look at gangs--I'm not a social scientist so I can't go into the real detail of it, but I will tell you this: America, black America, particularly, is gonna have to look at the 500,000 young black people who have never been socialized except through gangs and in prison as they come out of prison and come back to our communities.  So this dialogue that we were able to have thirty-five years ago should be, and is of necessity, gonna take place.  The thing is either gonna take place on their terms, on radicalized young black people coming out of prison, on their terms, or terms by others who have enough insight and enough energy to try to address it.  But I can only say that what we did could not have been done.  They were the troops; they were the soldiers.  It couldn't have been done.  [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] C. T. Vivian was a thinker.  He was a pacifist.  He was Martin--one of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr.'s disciples.  In that context, he did not allow nor condone anything violent, and no violence took place.  So I think that there's a great deal of work that has to be done about in and having a dialogue with some of these young brothers who have now been in these organizations and maybe exposed to violence and other things, been incarcerated.  And they are still, you know, our people, and they are still worthy of a respectful response to the things they want, their aspirations that are legitimate.
Story_ID: 197126
Speaker 1: I know Jeff Fort was--I guess achieved some notoriety for political, having political aspirations for the [Black P.] Stones [Black P. Stone Nation, formerly, Blackstone Rangers], in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s].  And then--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --later on Larry Hoover, even in the '90s [1990s], you know, organized the--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --the, the--
Speaker 2: But David--
Speaker 1: --[Gangster] Disciples, yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah, but David Barksdale preceded Larry Hoover.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the latest I guess big push by the Disciples to organize themselves politically was in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] when they had the, what do they call it, the--
Speaker 2: Vote?
Speaker 1: --no--yeah, yeah, 20th century vote [sic. 21st Century Vote], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, but that was kind of--it was smashed by the police basically--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm not really equipped to go into the details of how that translated or transferred into political action.  I do know, and I go back to this, that it could, that organ--that level of organization could be an agent for change, was an agent for change.  And the beneficiaries, all of those people that you see, all of those blacks, Hispanics, Asians, females that you see working on construction sites owe them at least in some sense.  They owe all of us that were involved in that twelve, in the organization of twelve--some sense because we created the environment that they, in fact, now find livelihood.  And an unfortunate fact is that their progeny are not amongst those beneficiaries as they should be.
Story_ID: 197127
Speaker 1: Now what year was that that you all took over the--
Speaker 2: It was, the day was July 23, 1969.
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, as we speak in 2004, it's a thirty-five-year, you know, anniversary year.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you say there're opportunities now that people could take that are in that situation that actually choose to, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean that's the irony of it.  How can you have people that don't speak English coming from Mexico and other parts of South America or have a president [President George Walker Bush] talking about bringing in guest workers to do jobs that--(coughs)--excuse me--that we don't do, we don't--the Americans either can't do or don't wanna do.  I mean one of the things that I have recommended is that we teach construction trades to the young brothers that are incarcerated.  I may have mentioned it in our earlier conversation.  I actually hired one guy right out of, he came right out of prison.  And Peter Jennings' '[ABC] World News Tonight' did, much like you, an interview with the guy being interviewed here, and we hired him.  And he had, but he had benefited from a Pell Grant while he was incarcerated, where he learned some drafting, and he learned something about construction.  Now just think, if you had painting, plastering, carpeting, carpentry being taught while people are in a controlled environment, they come out with a skill.  And they speak the English; they speak the language.  I mean, so and it is so obvious, a remedy.  Why isn't it being done?  Well, I believe that the prison industry wants to recycle itself, keep itself in business, and the business is to keep people, you know, on a revolving door, back in.  But at the same time, you know, the irony, if you ever go to a major construction summit--we're gonna have one here in June of this year, just where all the big white firms and a few firms like ours will attend.  The number one problem that they talk about is the shortage of labor.  The average age of a union worker is forty-five years old.  That means the twenty-somethings are not coming that way, but yet if we prepared--I mean there's got to be some intervention.  Here's the need.  Here are the people that want--that need the jobs.  And while they're in a controlled environment, if they were trained and exposed to it, look what they could do.  Besides those who don't ever get incarcerated, just what level of training is taking place inside the schools?  That's another subject.  But at any rate, it's a very unfortunate situation that we have these opportunities, and they're not being, they're not being taken by those who, who really have earned a right to some of those.
Speaker 1: That's a message that has to get out.
Speaker 2: Yes, it does.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 197128
Speaker 1: Tell me about the contractors, how they were organized, and how--
Speaker 2: Well, what we did in that same year, '69 [1969], and like I said, that was an epiphany for me because I felt we could do anything.  I mean you're talking about somebody feeling empowered, I mean feeling, I mean, man, I said if we can bust these unions, then the next thing we're gonna do is attack education, then--I had all kind of great, you know, (laughter) ideas.  But any rate, what we did do was go to--a group was starting an organization called the National Association of Minority Contractors [NAMC] in 19--in that same year [1969] in California.  So I attended that, and I became the Chicago [Illinois] director for that national organization.  And what that did was allowed me then--'cause we met three times a year, and we still do.  We began to organize contractors all over the country.  And then I wrote an article called "The Black Elected Official and the Black Construction Issue" [sic. "Black Political Leaders and the Black Construction Issue"].  I wrote that article in and around 1970.  And I sent it to all of the black members of the Congressional Black Caucus and all of the black elected officials in and around Chicago.  And [HistoryMaker] Parren [J.] Mitchell [III], Democrat of Maryland, called me and said, I read your article, and I'd like for you to come to Washington [D.C.] and sit down and meet with me.  So I came--I went to Washington, and he formed a black business brain trust [Minority Business Enterprise Braintrust], which was a group of black businesses, black representatives who had different business interests and would counsel him and give him ideas and, and essentially work to improve legislation that was gonna help their particular interests.  So at that time you had [HistoryMaker] Earl [G.] Graves [Sr.] with Essence; you had Ed, I mean Black Enterprise; you had [HistoryMaker Edward] Ed Lewis from Essence; you had, Bob Johnson [HistoryMaker Robert Johnson] came a little later, but you had a large number of--Berkeley Burrell.  You had a large number of black leaders in the media, in other places, in Parren's brain trust.  And finally, the brain trust became compartmentalized, and I became the head of the construction component of the black brain trust for Parren Mitchell.  And in that context, we were able to influence legislation, and that was a very important thing.  We--there, in 1976 there was a public works act [Public Works Employment Appropriations Act of 1976] that everybody wanted because unemployment was off the charts, and so we just tacked on that 10 percent of each one of these dollars must be spent with minority subcontractors.
Story_ID: 197129
Speaker 1: We were talking about the--how the contractors got together.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so the contractor dimension largely took hold on a national level vis-a-vis the National Association of Minority Contractors [NAMC].  And that was an organization started in Oakland, California, by Ray Dones, D-O-N-E-S, and he is still alive.  And we will be meeting I guess for the thirty-fifth consecutive year in a couple of weeks in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And, in that context, the national association was also interested in organizing in different cities, the logic being that, if we were empowered, we would be the better trainers and the better employers of black workers.  And so that was the mission pretty much of the National--NAMC, National Association of Minority Contractors.  On a political level, we were getting, we were able to get [HistoryMaker] Parren [J.] Mitchell [III] to do things within this U.S. Small Business Administration [SBA] that were just terrific.  I mean we had guys from Chicago [Illinois] like Art Minzier [ph.] and Connie Mack Higgins, who were officials in the Small Business Administration.  And we had a program which is called the 8(a) [Business Development] Program, which is a set-aside program that allows for federal contracts to be negotiated and not competitively bid.  And we began to use that and improve that, and they said, no, it's not just enough to have that.  We're gonna have to have loans.  So we were able to institute a direct loan program.  Then they said, contractors can't wait for their money, so we arranged for an advance payment program.  I mean you get a contract, give you an--you sign it.  You have some money put in the bank against it.  We created models and mechanisms within the Small Business Administration that allowed for every problem that we had encountered or could imagine to be addressed in some way or another.  Again, there were a large--UBM [Inc., Chicago, Illinois] was a large benefit--UBM was one of those 8(a) contractors for a limited period of time.  And then the program became, you know, in this anti-affirmative action era that, you know, basically, basically started, you know, with [President George Herbert Walker] Bush--I mean with [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan in the '80s [1980s].  The program got in some way, in some ways got watered down.  But still, because it was part of a law, it is in effect today, and firms can still benefit from some of those things that we started during that period of time.  The contractor program nationally then was one more of federal contracting and national organizing.  So we had a contractors' group in St. Louis [Missouri]; we had one in Philadelphia; we had one in Atlanta [Georgia]; we had one in Memphis [Tennessee], all around the country.
Story_ID: 197130
Speaker 1: When [Mayor] Harold Washington became mayor [of Chicago, Illinois], we--that would be, what, '83 [1983], right?
Speaker 2: Eighty-three [1983], right.
Speaker 1: Eighty-three [1983].  He and I had, the two of us had worked together previously.  When he was a state rep [representative], along with Lewis [A.H.] Caldwell, we worked together on trying to improve surety bond legislation here in Illinois.  And then I worked with him when he was in the [U.S.] Congress as part of the Congressional Black Caucus, with which [HistoryMaker] Parren [J.] Mitchell [III] was still active.  I worked with Harold Washington then.  But at any rate, so we had known each other, and worked with each other, and had good solid regard for one another.  So when he became mayor, naturally I was ecstatic, just like frankly every other black person in America was ecstatic, that he had achieved mayoralty.  However, he was a little slow about coming up with something that was gonna benefit black contractors here in Chicago [Illinois].  And you know, I had his home phone number, and Delores Woods, who was his secretary at the time, I could always either go in and see him or call him up.  But I went in, and I said, you know, Harold, look, people out there are getting ready to march, and this is not gonna work.  You have got to do something quickly about something that's gonna benefit black contractors.  And shortly thereafter, he issued the ordinance that required that 25 percent of the city contracts go to minorities--
Story_ID: 197131
Speaker 1: At that juncture, which is '83 [1983], we had the first ordinance that said that all construction contracts in the City of Chicago [Illinois] would be--have to have 25 percent minority participation.  After Harold's [Mayor Harold Washington] untimely death, [HistoryMaker] Mayor Eugene Sawyer continued that program.  And after Mayor Sawyer's defeat, the current Mayor [Richard M.] Daley made that program a law, a city ordinance; it became not just an executive order, which is what Harold Washington did; it became an ordinance.  And it stood as one of the most powerful opportunities in ordinances for black and other minority contractors in the history of America.  I mean we had cities like Denver [Colorado], and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and Atlanta [Georgia] getting their programs knocked out.  Chicago's program continued until this year, even though the white contractors, led by the Association of General Contractors [sic. Associated General Contractors of America], filed suits.  They didn't do it here in Chicago until this year.  In other words, it didn't reach a judge.  They may have filed a suit, but it didn't reach a judge until this year, Decem- in December of 2003, Judge [John] Moran indicated--and this is a very, very interesting ruling.  He said that it was proven that blacks had been discriminated against in the construction industry primarily because we had been excluded from Washburne University [sic.], which was a city of- Washburne High School [sic. Washburne Trade School, Chicago, Illinois], which was a city funded school, part of the Chicago Public Schools [CPS] system, which had an arrangement with the unions to train apprentices.  And blacks were denied opportunities to go there and get the attendant jobs.  So the judge ruled that racism existed, that the program had merit, but that the program he said, his words--you know, I'm using his words--is it should be addressed with a laser beam and not a baseball bat, meaning (laughter)--and what that essentially says is that racism was the basis for the program.  There's no doubt about it, but the race can't be the remedy (laughter), you know, in the solution.  And he gave the city until June 30th of this year, 2004, which is not far from now, from this day to come up with a revised plan which will do a number of things.  First of all, an individual whose net worth is greater than $700,000 will not be eligible to be part of the minority business program.  There has to be a limit on how long someone stays in the program.  There has to be a dollar volume that the average, three-year average dollar volume of say $17 million that the company cannot exceed in order to be in the program.  It also says that whereas it can be--there's no question about blacks being discriminated against.  There is not any real evidence of Asians being discriminated against.  So, the pool of who benefits from this minority business program is gonna shrink.  It's, what this represents--(clearing throat)--is a thirty-five-year assault and battle by those same white contractors that we fought in 1969, now having said that, you know, we are finally--we let you in, but we're never gonna stop till we end this program.  And they've got a [U.S.] Supreme Court that has set a precedent that said you can't take race into consideration even when race is a part of the problem.
Story_ID: 197132
Speaker 1: It's an unfortunate thing because there's this fatigue of activism that we have right now that should not be taking place.  I mean [HistoryMaker] Hermene Hartman and N'DIGO published an enemy's list.  That's all of the white contractors in this organization who filed a suit.  Black aldermen could stop them from getting work permits in their wards unless they met with--if you don't wanna call it affirmative action, you could call it economic opportunity for local residents.  There are a score of things that could be done.  I mean schools, Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois], University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], DePaul [University, Chicago, Illinois], all of these schools that are in the City of Chicago [Illinois].  Look at this thing that just--Columbia College [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], Roosevelt, and DePaul just put together over here on State Street.  I don't think there was a requirement to have any black contractors involved in that thing, so we have to attack the private sector.  If the public sector is going to be prohibited by law from providing opportunities to black and other minority contractors, then we have to begin to look at the private sector.  And the private sector has been getting a pass, you know, like a big dog on, on this subject.  So I believe that, what did Rudyard Kipling say, you know, if you could keep your head about you when everybody else is losing theirs, you'll be a man.  I say if you can keep your head and everybody is losing theirs, chances are you don't understand the situation (laughter), you know.  And to me, the situation is horrendous, but no one seems to be, you know, excited, angry, ready to go and do battle with it.  Now, I mean, now let me give you an example so that you can get a framework.  They got an organization called BAMN; it's called By Any Means Necessary.  They're students up in Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  They led the fight for that Michigan Supreme Court case [Grutter v. Bollinger, 2003].  These students are awesome.  I brought a couple of their latest to a National Association of Minority Contractors' [NAMC] conference.  They are articulate, they are passionate, they are driven, and they are relentless.  They are just like we were, you know, back in the day.  Where is this level of black furor?  Not to go out and burn, and loot, and pillage, but to go out and make demands, and hold people accountable for, you know, for results.  It's not happening.  We got some aldermen in Chicago, I mean like Alderman Ed Smith and Alderman Bill [William] Beavers who don't let anything go on in their ward without some black contractors being involved.  So it's not to say no one is doing anything.  But that's coming out of their own personal philosophy, and mind you, look at their ages.  You know, they're of my generation.  Where is this new level of black activism going to begin to not only shape--take shape but assume some identity, 'cause two things need to happen.  First of all we need to know who they--we need to begin an intergenerational conversation so that they can learn what we have done that's been successful.  And secondly, they can benefit, and we can benefit, from their perspective because they have got new tools.  We didn't have any Internet to work with at that time.  We didn't have any cell phones to work with, that so, so there--excuse me--there's a lot that this--this intergenerational conversation I think is one of the things that needs to take place in order for us to become, begin to resume this activism, 'cause the misery index for black, for people is off the hook, it's way higher than it's ever been before.  And it seems like passivity, has, you know, overcome protest, and I think that's an unfortunate thing.
Story_ID: 197133
Speaker 1: Where would agitation, I guess, come from?  I mean do you see yourself or see the National Organization of Minority Contractors [NAMC] providing agitation, you know, in communities--
Speaker 2: Well, you, well, you see--
Speaker 1: --to get this--
Speaker 2: --I mean it's like I say, you have this fatigue of activism.  Some people are too old and tired.  That's not, I don't consider myself in that category.  I have a business to run.  I have hundreds of people whose livelihood depend on my paying attention to what goes on.  They, their children, who are now going to college, need me to be able to ensure that their parents have places to go.  So there's a certain level of time that you don't have.  Where I see the agitation coming--I mean it's clear that we've got some young black brothers that are going around, you know, picketing sites, I mean in all neighborhoods.  But is it a structured environment, a structured effort like the one we had.  Because usually what is happening is that when they get, you know, when protests, they go and, they go and protest at a site, and then maybe some job--something happens.  But then, you know, right over two blocks away or two streets away nothing is going on out there.  So there has to be--I mean I think there's--
Speaker 1: So it's not a sustained effort--
Speaker 2: And I think there has--
Speaker 1: --across the board.
Speaker 2: --to be, I think there has to be a dialogue taking place between the younger people and those of us that have been doing more things.  I mean, as you know, it--we do a good job of it, those of us that write and read.  We are able to articulate our ideas and hold them for posterity or for younger people to review.  I mean I have articles published on, that are published on the Internet and people from all over the world will communicate with me and ask me about this or that.  So that, from an intellectual point of view--well, not intellectual, informational point of view, you know, it's happening that ideas and experiences from one era to another are taking place.  But this thing that we did in Chicago [Illinois] is so unique, because it fundamentally changed the landscape of who was going to do building in America.  It changed the landscape, and that same approach could be taken toward education, as an example.  I mean we are the only people that allow other people to teach our children.  Something's wrong with that.  And we should be looking at how and who are teaching our children, and what they're teaching them, and what they ought to be teaching them, I mean just as an example.  Now, there's a lot of black thought about the subject, but there is not that level of action that is taking place.  I mean these are the things that--all is not gloom and doom.  I mean my youngest son [Timothy King] was president of Hales Franciscan High School [Chicago, Illinois] an all-boys single-sex school, and he--a hundred percent college, you know, admission for the graduates.  So I mean, it's not like everything is bad, but it's not as much as it should be--
Story_ID: 197134
Speaker 1: What would you like to see take place that you think would actually change the situation of all these unemployed black youth that are out here in the street organizations and so forth?  I mean is there a scenario--in the beginning you talked about the schools, and teaching, you know, construction trades in schools, trying to get the kids steered towards that, and the prisons too.  But it seems as though, I mean as we discuss this, you said it's not--we need to make some big splash or something somewhere to draw attention to opportunities and you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well, you know, one of the real fortunate things that has happened to me is that I have been, as the chairman of UBM [Inc., Chicago, Illinois], I have been able to put into practice some of the ideas I had toward beliefs that I felt were, were important.  So, I mean, as an example, we could begin at, in the fifth grade teaching young people about the world of construction, just so they would be able to know what it is and have those courses, you know, upgraded each year until they were able to, they were able to understand that besides being a basketball player or a doctor they can become an engineer or an architect.  The second thing that we can do is expand on the Newhouse Competition.  The late Illinois elected official Dick Newhouse [Richard Newhouse, Jr.] sponsored a program where architects--architecture is taught in the public schools, and a competition takes place every year.  And I'm one of the jurors on this.  And you look at what they've done, and they get awards and get possibly into college to intern with larger firms.  And they learn in that regard.  So then you have, having these students who have been in high school exposed to architecture and engineering choosing and being counseled toward taking courses of that type in college, estimating, project management, construction management.  These are all college--civil engineering--these are all disciplines that are needed to be successful.  That's, so that's going the traditional route.  So that means that someone has to introduce, legitimize, and push within the structured educational system.  Right now, in many states you have more children, youngsters getting their GED [General Education Development] than they do going all the way through school at one time.  That's especially prevalent in New York State, but it's happening all around the country, that you have people leaving school for what, for a number of reasons, but getting the GED in order to have an opportunity to either go to a community college or whatever.  We--if that's a phenomenon that's gonna take place, then something connected with construction needs to be introduced to the GED program, even if it's no more than being able to get up and be on time, understanding how to ask questions without feeling stupid, being able to get requests made without feeling dissed.  The whole level of entering the world of work has to be taught.  So that's if you're in the educational track, those are some ideas.   Now let's suppose you're not.  Suppose you are in this other group that has come out, that have been in jail or come out--maybe not in jail, but just out here, not in school, and want a job.  Well, one of the things we did was we set up a program called Project Pride, and Pride is an acronym for personal responsibility individual development or something like that.  And we put some money over at Malcolm X [College, Chicago, Illinois], and we had these young brothers and sisters being taught by Malcolm X teachers on how to take the apprentice apt [aptitude] test, and how to behave, and to enter the world of work, and that program has been expanded upon.  So, I mean that's, those are some of the things.  Because just because somebody wants a job, does not mean they are prepared to be productive.  And just because they aren't prepared to be productive, doesn't mean we should write 'em off.
Story_ID: 197135
Speaker 1: Operation Pride [sic. Project Pride], now that's a program that has come and gone, I take it now.  It's not still in existence?
Speaker 2: No, it's still in existence.  Other people have, other organizations have begun to embrace it.  But what it does is it gets people ready for application into the apprenticeship unions.  I mean they're not something that--you know, that's something that was in--we were building a project for Reverend Charles [M.] Ford in St. Paul Church of God in Christ [Chicago, Illinois] on 48th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue].  And you know, his son, Kevin [A.] Ford, came up and said you know, what can we do, when we sat down and said--you know, 'cause all these people saw this building going up, and they said they wanted jobs.  What could we do?  So we were able to come up with this idea, Project Pride, and it works.  I mean, so these models--when I'm talking about a model, that if expanded upon or replicated, you know, could be very useful and result in ameliorating some of the unemployment and some of the difficulties we have.  We have to get our people prepared to enter the workforce, be depended upon, be timely, be respectful, you know, and be good stewards of their responsibilities.  We have to prepare people for that.  If, if people have never been given direction in those areas, then when will it--when will they ever achieve this?  I mean that's one of the values--are we, are we on?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of the values of going to school is that you acquire a set of behaviors that, you know, a particular action yields a particular result.  You get up an hour and a half earlier than you need to be at class, and you'll be in class on time, and then you could hear the lecture.  You know what I mean?  Or you can--I mean there's just things that--if somebody, if somebody doesn't have that experience, then--and they become thirty-five or forty years old without ever having it, then we have to have that level of intervention to help fast forward the training.  I mean it's just that simple.  There are things I don't--I mean there--as a businessman, for example, there are things I didn't know five years ago when I said I wanted to make this business [UBM Inc., Chicago, Illinois], you know, a multigenerational business.  I didn't know anything about knowledge sharing, or HR, human resources related matters, how the necessity to management people and develop them, I didn't have a clue about those things, have a clue about strategic planning, not a clue.  But because I was driven to want to achieve this thing, I know something about it now.
Story_ID: 197136
Speaker 1: And I use that analysis to say that, you know, there--you are always, always supposed to be in a learning mode.  And there is no chronology associated with when you can learn something.  I mean and, and to me, it's got to be, you know, you gotta connect the dots for people.  No one wants to be in bad shape, no one.  And so if you can show them the way, and there--and they can develop some trust in the way that you're talking about, then you have something working.  I mean just look at the number of black churches and the proliferation of black churches you have in our community.  There's somebody, there is somebody, a pastor that has given somebody some sense of hope that this is a way to cope.  Similarly, I mean, and I'm not trying to--I'm using this as an analogy of course.  Similarly, there is a way to, to show people that if you do these things, you can achieve a career in construction.  But there has to be the same level of interest and commitment, you know, toward that.  I can give you numerous examples of things that have worked, but they need to be, in my judgment, they need to be replicated and embraced in a full structured way, you know.  And if that took a--you know, if you, if you go back to the, to the days when Jake Carruthers [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.], and [HistoryMaker] Carol [L.] Adams, and Andy Anderson Thompson, and [HistoryMaker] Harold Pates, and I, we would sit down, we would read for weeks at--and discuss particular issues.  And you'd have to read and think to be prepared to engage in the conversation.  But out of those conversations became a capacity to assess the environment you were living in.  And once you assessed it, you could then make your moves and make your decisions.  I mean 'cause my decision was not one to be an intellectual educator.  You know, mine was to become a businessman.  Well, I am.  But the process that I engaged in and was fortunate enough to be a part of is something that has propelled me into continual learning, and I think that's something that is sorely missed.
Story_ID: 197137
Speaker 1: Now, in that respect, you have been a prolific author and contributor to magazines and not only on a con--on the subject of construction, and minority contracts, affirmative action, you've written about black culture on some level and what things we need to do, you know, to change that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, for the better.  Can you talk about maybe some of your writings?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the first writing experience that really took off, I mean I published articles back in the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s] on construction, different construction magazines, you know, wanna hear what a black person had to say about the unions or about the challenges of blacks in the industry, stuff like that.  But I think the one that was the most eye opening and intriguing was [HistoryMaker] Nathan Hare sponsored a retreat up in the mountains in Sausalito, California.  And Johnnetta [B.] Cole, I think she's president or was president of Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], but, but Johnnetta Cole, Nathan, Bob [Robert] Chrisman, Robert [L.] Allen, Max Roach, myself, each of us--and then there were about four or five others.  But each of us were asked to write a paper, and the paper would be critiqued by the others who were in attendance.  And all of the papers would be published, you know, in The Black Scholar.  And so, you know, one of the very interesting things--this is a bit of a deviation, but one of the real interesting things is to have chronicled what happened to the people who were at that particular retreat.  I mean, you know, I was so proud to see Johnnetta achieve what she did.  Max Roach, you know, wrote on music and stuff like that.  I wrote a particular article called '[The Role of Black Business:] Delirium or Imperium' [Black Scholar, Paul King]  And it was premised on a book I guess that--by Sutton [E.] Griggs that 'Imperium in Imperio' and--
Speaker 1: And that was written back at the turn of the [20th] century almost--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And what I did was, what I did with that was try to identify that, you know, we were a nation, black people were a nation within a nation, imperium in imperio and in so doing, articulate some issues that we need to address.  And also use it as a forum to talk about how important construction was.  And that was in 1972, '73 [1973].  And I got a nice--you know, I was very proud to have written that.  You know, as a person who writes, I have a couple of real close friends who will review what I've written and you know, dot the Is and cross the Ts.  And they tell me that I write too much like I talk, and sometimes, you need to take an axe to some of it, and so, you know, that kind of thing.  But that was a very important experience because of the environment.  If you notice, I talk a lot about the environments that things take place.  It's unbelievable to drive up into the mountains, just to be invited by Nathan Hare, you know, to be invited, you go up those mountains, and you're there, for two days.  And you listen to all of this phenomenal black thought taking place.  I mean, and you hear Max Roach talking about music and it's an inspirational type of event.  So, at any rate, you know, that, the labor imperium with Black Scholar was something. Since that time, I have written or published something every year--
Story_ID: 197138
Speaker 1: So this year, being 2004, I have published in the [Chicago] Tribune, "[Going Backward?] Deconstructing the Construction Business."  That was published, and that was a challenge to the City [of Chicago, Illinois] because of the judge's decision on the [Judge John] Moran case--Judge Moran's decision about the city's MBE [Minority Owned Business] program.  At the same time I wrote "Fast Forward or Going Backwards," [sic. "Fast Forward or Rewind: The Impact of the Moran Decision on Chicago's M/WBE Program"] which was published in N'DIGO, which was a larger piece on that same subject of Judge Moran's decision and what the black aldermen ought to do.  So that was this year's action.  Over the years, I have challenged--in Emerge magazine I was published, and I was responding to [HistoryMaker] Randall Kennedy's article on race and whether people should be race conscious.  And I wrote an article that was, in fact, you know, calling him someone who must hate himself for raising such a question.
Speaker 2: He just wrote a book entitled, the "N" word, right ['Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word']?  I know he was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know, so I've had the opportunity and the urge to write, to express my ideas.  And I have had the opportunity to write--I forget what this brother's name is that went to California.  He's from Chicago [Illinois], and he, he has become somewhat of a little bit of a critic of affirmative action and race considerations.  But at any rate, [HistoryMaker] Haki Madhubuti had published a particular magazine.  And I published in there, so I have had the good fortune of being able to publish in Motion magazine, which is the head of that publication and maybe even get my ideas out there.  And it's, I think it's been useful.  It's certainly been a catharsis for me, because you get this, you just get angry, and you wanna articulate some, you know, some things--
Story_ID: 197139
Speaker 1: Now recently, well, last year [2003] you published a retrospective on affirmative action twenty-five years I think after--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --affirmative action that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was, what were some of your conclusions about affirmative action?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I mean I think the biggest thing about affirmative action is that it was, it has been a victim of wordsmithing.  You know, people have called it quotas; people have called it set-asides; and you have had people to almost--even had some black people almost ashamed to say they benefited from affirmative action.  So it's, so, but affirmative action is no more than forgiveness.  If I punch you in your nose and don't say I'm sorry or don't do anything to correct that, something's wrong with that.  I mean something's wrong with me.  And if we've been denied exposure to, because of our race, because--into medicine, into medical school, into law schools, into construction unions, why should we--what basis is there for people to say that that is illegal?  Well, the court, this court, much to his eternal disgrace and my eternal disgust, [Supreme Court Justice] Clarence Thomas, who cast the deciding vote [in Gratz v. Bollinger, 2003], who himself as a Negro was a beneficiary of affirmative action, and he says that the consideration of race is not acceptable in admissions, when in fact the entire basis for affirmative action was correcting past discriminations.  Now when there are sufficient blacks reflective of our population in the state universities, when there are sufficient blacks reflected of our population in the workforce, when they have sufficient blacks in the corporate, in the Fortune 500 CEO positions reflective of our talent pool, then I can say okay, affirmative action may have reached a particular point where in its current form is not needed.  But at this point, we're nowhere near that, we're nowhere near that.  So, you know, it's one of these things that, again, I salute the young people at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] for their persistence because they did go, you know, a big step in, in fighting for this.  But what we're looking at, you know, is people are even masking the term.  You don't hear people talking about affirmative--it's almost become a bad word.  You know, people are now talking about diversity, people of color, you know, everything but what the real deal is.  Black people are catching hell and calling it a good time (laughter).  You--and somebody, you know, needs to continue to say that.  Now, you know, hopefully, maybe a new president might change the makeup of the court, and that five to four could slip back to where it'll help us.  But you imagine that the [U.S.] Supreme Court used to be where we would go to get relief.  Now it's where you don't wanna go with any of your grievances 'cause you know you'll get grief.  And to me, as we look at affirmative action, there is more need for it now than ever.  We need more focused attention of our young people.  The young brothers and sisters who don't have parents, who don't have both parents in the house or who are living with their grandmother, grandparents, we need some affirmative action toward them.  We need affirmative action relative to the number of young students who are giving their jobs, opportunities away to Eastern Europeans that can't speak English.  I mean, this is a--in my judgment, this is a very, very tenuous era that we're in, and if people don't articulate it in writing and don't discuss it and some action doesn't emerge from that, then, you know, then I'm afraid some of Chancellor Williams' conclusions, may in fact take shape.  And you know, some of those conclusions were not all that present to black people.
Story_ID: 197140
Speaker 1: One of the questions we always ask is what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community?  Now this whole discussion has been basically about that, but I want you to maybe answer that question in terms of something we discussed off camera, and that was the need for a school of government in the black community.  You talked about--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: See, I believe that the biggest disconnect that we have in the black community is between the generations.  There is no dialogue or conversation going on between black people who have achieved and aspiring black people, young, young aspiring black people.  And I have urged [HistoryMaker] Emil Jones, [HistoryMaker] John [H.] Stroger [Jr.], [HistoryMaker] Clark Burrus, [HistoryMaker] Earl Neal, [HistoryMaker] Mayor Eugene Sawyer, and other elected and appointed officials who have this wealth of knowledge to consider a school of public policy where we could begin to teach our younger people about the art of governments, the art of political compromise without losing your principles, the art of reviewing a budget and understanding the impact of what a budget means with employing thirty thousand people like John Stroger is doing--(coughing)--excuse me.  And I believe that, you know, we need that type of forum, that type of school of public policy.  It could introduce people like myself in business who could lecture on what it is to run a business or how do you achieve a certain level of business acumen and a certain amount of business success without losing your concern, you know, for black people.
Story_ID: 197141
Speaker 1: As I mentioned earlier, you know, I think that I'm part of a uniquely favored historic generation that has had overwhelming, overwhelming benefits because I've straddled two eras, the era of the giants, Thurgood Marshall and [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], and Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.], and the now, where we have the Internet and the speed that communication takes place.  The--just think of what we could do if we could begin some kind of dialogue with people who have achieved as much as the president of Cook County Board, or a former mayor, or the president of the Illinois State Senate [Illinois General Assembly].  What does the senate do?  What does it mean to be an Illinois state senator?  What goes on in the senate?  Is, the issues of welfare in the governor's office or in the senate?  Does a senate have the right to veto something that the governor wants to do instead of putting the money for day care for mothers that'll have to go off of welfare?  I mean these are, these are questions and issues that people need to know.  You know, I went and lectured to the Medill School of Journalism [Media, Integrated Marketing Communications, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] earlier this year about this [Judge John] Moran case.  Here are these eager, anxious, aggressive, largely white young people who are gonna be writers.  They're gonna go to work writing somewhere, and they're trying to learn about urban issues.  So, I mean so my hope is to be able to, by example, create and maintain a business that is able to do some things that reflect what a black company can do so that other people can replicate it, and to be around long enough to train and teach another generation of leaders within this company [UBM Inc., Chicago, Illinois] to do that, to be able to write, and to be able to communicate as often as I can, you know, to people that the opportunities in America are endless.  People are coming from all over the world to here for these opportunities.  Yet, those of us that have been, using Bobby [E.] Wright's word, afflicted with mentacide, through slave, the slavery experience, failed, you know, to get it.  So if I had, you know, if I had one wish it would be the eradication of mentacide (laughter).
Story_ID: 197142
Speaker 1: The last statement you made on the last--well, where you quoted Dr. Bobby [E.] Wright, you know.  Can you tell us a little bit about Bobby Wright, you know, for those who--he's not here anymore, and I thought it'd be good to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, well, Bobby was, was not only a personal friend but one of those insightful people that came up and around with Andy [Anderson] Thompson and [HistoryMaker] Harold Pates and the rest of us.  And he was the first person that I heard talk about the mental afflictions of slavery and what kinds of things, or what type of behavior, and what type of damage was inflicted upon black people as a result of the slave experience, and you know, and is--I quoted him a couple of times in things that I've written when I've referred to his term, mentacide.  You know, we know about suicide; we know about fratricide.  Mentacide was what he coined as his term.  I don't believe it was a term.  I mean I think he invented that term, mentacide, and in so doing, he gave form to a phenomenon that I had long thought about, which was why do people, some people act like they do?  Why are some people not motivated?  Well, because they've been told they couldn't achieve.  That's mentacide.  Why are not more people aspiring to become successful businesspeople?  Because they've been told they can't, because they don't amount to anything, or because they ain't S-H-I-T, I mean, and that level of menta- I mean, when Bobby, when, when Bobby would stretch out, now even though he talked (demonstrates fast talking), you know, he talked real fast, you keep up with him.  And we used to go house at his--the parties at his house 'cause some other friends--he lived on 69th [Street, Chicago, Illinois], just southeast.  And on one floor was some friends of ours, and he lived on the other floor.  And yeah, he used to live on the other floor, and so we would see each other both in, what I would call the intellectual capacity and then socially.  That'll be like on the weekend, you know, when you'd be at a party, but you'd be at somebody's party.  You'd be sitting down talking, but you could talk the same stuff.  And, Bobby would get wound up, and you couldn't, you know, you couldn't shut it down.  You just said okay, you know.  But he was a great guy.  And to his credit, to have, you know, set up that mental health center over on the West Side [Bobby E. Wright Comprehensive Behavioral Health Center, Chicago, Illinois], you know, and I mean I think that there's a guy that, you know, put his heart into his work.  And you know, I consider to be just heroic, a heroic black man, and black thinker.
Story_ID: 197143
Speaker 1: Back in 1972 when you wrote the article for Black Scholar, the first one, "[The Role of Black Business:] Delirium or Imperium [?]" [Black Scholar, Paul King].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You had twenty questions that you posed--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I guess to the black community.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What's, what's your retrospective on those twenty questions now?  Have they been answered?
Speaker 2: No, you know, they haven't been answered.  As a matter of fact, you know, that's the--I'm--I suppose that this is the first time since we've been talking that I've been ambivalent, because I am both proud of the fact that I was able to articulate the questions but saddened over the fact that the answers have not been put forth, and in fact, the circumstances that surrounded the questions have become more critical, and the circumstances have become more negative.  I asked a question, what can we do about the relationships between black men and black women?  That was one of the questions in there.  And look at what we got.  We got such trash as people--men talking about down, getting the down-low.  You know, and in parts of rural Alabama, Mississippi, one out of five, one out of five men is HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] infected.  And they don't wanna go and talk.  They don't want people to know about it, so they won't even go and take the medicine that could keep 'em alive.  So, you know, the--I raised a question about what can black intellectuals do to stimulate more change in problems facing the black community.  I don't believe that--one of the intellectuals I have the most admiration for is [HistoryMaker] Derrick [A.] Bell [Jr.], who, you know, continues to write and continues to put his ideas forward, who fought for a black woman getting tenure.  You know, what is there--if there is a contingent of young, black, thinking warriors coming from the Cornel West and the Derrick Bells, and the rest of the intellectual, black intellectuals that are coming out to lead some type of fundamental change to the condition of black people, I haven't seen that.  I mean, even if it was something as, you know, how do you eat an elephant?  Well, one bite at a time.  You know, well, this thing that faces black America is an elephant, so you can't go and grab it all, but you can eat one bite at a time.  One of the things we need to be looking at is health issues, particularly health issues effecting young black kids.  You know, they tell me that one out of every four kids in Harlem [New York, New York], black kids in Harlem, has asthma.  I mean I had an allergist who went and actually stopped practicing to be able to do more research to address that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 197144
Speaker 1: The point I'm making is, how can we bridge the intellectualism with the activism that will fundamentally address change?  Here we have, we're right now in the midst of a primary, of an election year.  Have you heard any questions, any issues about black people and problems that they face?  People are afraid to even talk about being friendly to black people, because if they say that they are concerned about black people, they'll alienate the white people.  And the margins are so thin that there is no issue that even comes up.  [Al] Gore lost that election last year beca- last time not just because it got stolen from him.  It was one of the dumbest run campaigns I've ever seen.  He didn't use [President William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton.  He should have used Clinton.  But more important than that, what were the issues that affect black life that even have resonance in the national dialogue in an election year?  I mean they aren't--I mean isn't it the challenge of black intellectuals to fashion that?  I mean to me I think it is.  And you know, you can read Bob Herbert in the New York Times and even hear this or that, but I don't see anybody but George [F.] Will and these other Republicans, you know, talking all the time about what the issues are.  I mean I care, I care more about what's happening on the South [Side] and West Side of Chicago [Illinois] than I do about Iraq.  And these, so these questions that I have in "Imperium in Imperio" [sic. "The Role of Black Business: Imperium or Delirium?"' Black Scholar, Paul King].  They haven't been answered.  I mean you've got some--now there's--all is not negative.  You've got some black elected officials who have taken a strong role in advancing black economic development, which is one of the points that I raise.  So there are some things like that, but those things are the more fundamental of those twenty that I raised, especially the thing between men and women I think, you know, unfortunately the answers seem to be much more complex than they were thirty years ago when I wrote that.
Story_ID: 197145
Speaker 1: I would be remiss if I didn't ask you a question about the book 'Imperium in Imperio' [Sutton E. Griggs].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You--when did you first come across that Sutton [E.] Griggs book, and who was he, do you know, or?
Speaker 2: I came across that book probably in the late 1960--around '68 [1968], '69 [1969].  And [Prince] Asiel Ben Israel, at that time he was Warren Brown.  But Asiel Ben Israel was head of the Nation of--Hebrew Israelite Nation [African Hebrew Israelite Nation of Jerusalem].  He and I were talking at one time about the necessity for having that type of thing possibly take place, that perhaps we need it, a organi--a government within the government.  And I think somewhere between Anderson Thompson and Jake Carruthers [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.] I got steered toward Sutton Griggs' book.  And it, I guess it, it motivated me in a couple of ways because, as I recall the book, you know, Griggs tried to set this model up of an imperium and imperio, but he got--but somebody sold out.  And it, you know, it didn't work.  I mean that's--and in a way, that, I didn't say that there, but if there's one thing that remains constant in the Sutton Griggs experience and the article in which I based those twenty questions is that many of the answers to what we have, what we need to have happen have not happened because people have sold out.  There's a book now, very smallish book, but a guy named Bob Lencioni [sic. Patrick Lencioni].  It's called 'The Five Temptations of a CEO.'  And the first temptation that the CEO must overcome is the desire to have his or her ego or interest reduced or secondary to the interest of the organization he's trying--he or she's trying to lead.  And if we look at most of the black things that we--black efforts that could have taken place, we failed because--not because people were evil or mean-spirited, but because they put their own survival or their own interest ahead of the larger purpose or the larger focus.  And that sometimes I think is really the answer to why we have so few, you know, black leaders in America today that are able to speak out.
Story_ID: 197146
Speaker 1: What would you see at this point as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, I believe that the--outside of my family, which we certainly talk about, but I think that I set up a business [UBM Inc., Chicago, Illinois] that was able to do things no other black person has ever been--no other black company has done.  I hope that it remain--I mean my hope is that it will be multigenerational.  But I have been consistent over my life in advocating for blacks in the construction industry, with no interest on my part to gain from that entry, or no interest on my part for them to succeed.  I mean no interest in terms of their success will not benefit me.  So, and I have consistently--
Speaker 1: Not materially, you're saying.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I have consistently written, spoken, and demonstrated my belief that blacks should be more deeply involved and benefit from one of the largest, you know, industries in the United States.  At one time, ten cents out of every dollar spent in the United States was construction.  This is serious business.  I mean Iraq War is one thing, but a hundred billion dollars to rebuild it?  I mean, come on, that's classical money.  And so, the whole idea of continuing to be able to articulate it, and hopefully there'll be a book that'll be, you know--or two, one about the journey and then one about this business.  And that will be I think the essence of the legacy.  But to have been able to be able to publish whenever you had something to say.  I mean, you know, that's a great advantage.  I mean so, I guess I don't really--I guess my legacy is having, as I said before, is having been a member of this uniquely favored historic generation and grabbed a piece of it and ran with it.
Story_ID: 197147
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything that you would do differently if you had it to do again?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure there would be some things that I would do differently, but would have to think about it a whole lot more.  I would have much liked to invest more time into my father's [Paul King, Sr.] business [P.K. Produce, Chicago, Illinois] so that it could have been--I could have kept it going before--but it's still running now, but somebody else owns it.  I would have probably learned a couple of more languages.  You know, I mean, but by and large, the things that I would have been, that I would do differently are not fundamental differences.  I mean the choices--you know, we make choices.  You know, pilgrims that we are, we make choices as we go along.  And I think that, sure, I'd be a little less impatient, you know, with people that don't get it or don't see it like I see it.  I'd be--you know, I'd probably give people a little more--you know, I'd probably be a little more civil with people who didn't get it.  I mean I think that's something that you learn.  I don't think that I could have chosen to be that way any, you know, much different.  I think that I had to, you know, get it when I could.  But I would certainly have spent more quality time with my kids [Paul King, III and Timothy King].  But then the question would have been how could I have done that and done these other things.  And I think my children understand that, and if they don't, they will one day--you know, but the natural things like that, but nothing major that I would do differently.  I certainly would if we had the kind of technology that we have now, try to get on tape, even if it was audio tape, the various heroes and people that have influenced my life, just so that I would have been able to have them maybe to hand over to you.
