Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions that only require a short answer that management compels me to ask of everyone we interview (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let it rip.
Speaker 1: They're sort of a warm up.
Speaker 2: Got you.
Speaker 1: First one is: do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, whatever's available.
Speaker 1: So it's a see food diet.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yeah, hot pink.
Speaker 1: All right.  Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Anyplace you can scuba dive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is: do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I'm on it.
Story_ID: 420667
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay, fire away.
Speaker 1: I'll ask about your mother's side and your father's [Russell Reid] side (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Got it.
Speaker 1: But we'll ask about your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was Hazel Pallemon [Hazel Pallemon Reagan], P-A-L-L-E-M-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, Jesus, she was born in San Antonio, Texas, and I'd really have to reach hard to get her date of birth, but I will try.  Blank, I'll give it back to you if I get it.  I don't have it.  I mean I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, and that's because my birth mother didn't rear me.  My stepmother [Mattie Ross Reid] did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Okay, but I can answer many other questions about my mother, my birth mother.
Speaker 1: So she, was she much old--was she in her twenties when she had you, or--
Speaker 2: Oh God, she was a nursing student at Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] when she met my father and they married.  And, oh I guess you could figure this out.  She was probably born about nineteen--that's cute of you--probably born about 1907 might be right.  I could look that up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Oh, I know a ton of stuff.  She was born into this family of high achievers in San Antonio, Texas.  Her father [Nelson Pallemon] was a minister.  At a very early age she was part of a study of near genius youngsters and ended up testing on the then IQ test, as you know, a genius or near genius.
Speaker 1: You know who conducted that study?
Speaker 2: I know that it was done at Stanford University [Stanford, California] in California.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know that she was extremely beautiful and brilliant and outspoken, and did a number of things.  I mean she didn't complete her nursing degree, but married my father, who was graduating from Meharry.  Came to Virginia to live with him.  They were divorced well before I was four.  She went back to nursing school, became a WAC [Women's Army Corps], if you understand that, in World War II [WWII].  Took her G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] and went to Meharry for medical school.  I came to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] in 1955 in August, she graduated from Meharry in May of 1955.  And practiced medicine on the West Coast until she died about, oh I want to say maybe twenty years ago.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is your mother--
Speaker 2: That's my birth mother.  But then I have a mother of my heart, my stepmother who reared me.
Speaker 1: All right.  So is there--okay.  What about, are there any stories about her ancestors in San Antonio, what they were doing?
Speaker 2: Well as I said, he, her father was a preacher.  Her mother, we call Grandma Daisy [Daisy Appling Pallemon], was a housewife but had been I would believe a licensed practical nurse, which is why I think my mother wanted to go into nursing.  There were two brothers [Louis Morse, Sr. and William Morse, Jr.] and my mother, and they were all extremely brilliant.  And interestingly enough, all ended up going to medical school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's pretty much about it.
Speaker 1: So I was a little confused.  Did she start her nursing studies at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At Meharry, yeah.  That's where she met my father.
Speaker 1: Then she was interrupted by--she got married and--
Speaker 2: She got married and went to Newport News [Virginia].
Speaker 1: And then came back.
Speaker 2: And then endured that relationship for--easily no more than four years.  No, actually no more--yeah four years would be right.  And then went west, yeah.
Story_ID: 420668
Speaker 1: --Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Russell Edward Reid [Russell Reid].  You'll ask me when he was born.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I want to say 1914, but I can check it, February 17th, I know the day.
Speaker 1: So is he--he was younger than your mother [Hazel Pallemon Reagan]?
Speaker 2: No, so my date would have been wrong.  He would have been, he must have been four years older than she, so I must be wrong on my mother's birth date.  But I will look at that up (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Otherwise, we'll take a pass.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, well, and where was he born?
Speaker 2: Portsmouth, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what do you know about the ancestors on his side?
Speaker 2: Oh a ton because this is the aunt who really did the family tree well before it was in vogue.  Seven brothers, all named Reid, who variously were doctor, dentist, lawyer, preacher, accountant and maybe a second doctor.  Their father was a, you know the--every family out of this place I lived in Tidewater, Virginia contends there were no slaves in the family.  Trust me, I do not believe this.  But their father was a freed man of color.  And he was married to a woman who was a quarter, get this, there really is a tribe called Pamunkey, Indian [Native American], in Virginia.
Speaker 1: Pamunkey?
Speaker 2: P-A-M-U-N-K-E-Y.  There's a river by that name in Virginia, and probably half black and then a quarter, you know whatever was passing for white those days.  We suspect Scots-Irish because of the name and the--there are lots of Fergusons on the male side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those brothers, and there were about five of my father's father's brothers, all participated in the Civil War.  One of them ended up as secretary to General Armstrong [Samuel Chapman Armstrong], who started Hampton Normal school [Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] in Virginia.
Speaker 1: That the same Armstrong that Armstrong (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) High school, um-hm, and all up and down the South.  Which turned out to be names for now African American schools.  But he was the first president, which of course wasn't the title then, of what was then Hampton Normal school.  And that's really how I got to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], all of my family were at Hampton and um-hm, I don't want to go there.  Too much supervision, yeah.  What would their claim to fame have been?  They were a very close knit family.  Focused on, well the things that we all used to be focused on generations ago.  Accomplishment, education and certainly decorum, this kind of decorum, yeah.  Everything had to be perfect and beyond reproach.  But a very close knit family.  Between--I mentioned my stepmother, whose name was Mattie [Mattie Ross Reid], well she still is, she's ninety-five on Tuesday.  There was a--every other week when we lived in Newport News [Virginia], the living children of my grandparents and their kids, went to my grandmother's house for dinner.  Every other Sunday.  And it--I suspect now looking back it was not something that they--the spouses preferred, but there wasn't a child in that family who didn't, A, want to and understand that there would be dinner at grandma's house (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 420669
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is Grandma Reid?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She went to Hampton [Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  Got a degree in home economics and met my grandfather, who went to Shaw Uni- well it was then called the Leonard School of Medicine [Raleigh, North Carolina], which is now Shaw [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina], of course without the medical school.  And the things that I know about my grandfather are these: that he and all of the other people, I think my father--grandfather was in the second class at Leonard, had to study French because there were no persons of color in the United States who were qualified, certified to teach medicine.  No white folk would do it, and their professors came from France.  So they all had to learn French in order to take their coursework.
Speaker 1: Well, that made medical school tougher than it ordinarily would be.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  But I suspect as a family if they aspired and if their parents, my grandparents, my great-grandparents aspired to those things, then they also ensured that at least the people who went to the medical side of, you know, the professions that were available then, all had at least a grounding in French.  My grandmother was quite a different person.  She quoted Shakespeare [William Shakespeare].  I can remember at age five, "To thine own self be true."  And then: "It follows as night follows day, I can't stoop to be false to any man," ['Hamlet,' William Shakespeare].  That same grandmother worked to have the City of Portsmouth [Virginia] build a designated library for the Negroes in the town as there was none.  And the other thing about her as it was the family legend that--her maiden name was Brown [ph.]--that she did not realize that she was black until she was nine, when her father who was a seagoing captain died and they flipped her out of the big house, and put her in the quarters for the house folk.  But he left enough money to educate her and she went to Hampton.  So those are our legends.
Speaker 1: Those dramas of the 19th century.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and you know they exist in every family, every family.
Speaker 1: So her father, as long as he was alive, he could protect her on some level (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then the minute he was gone they flipped her out of there in a nanosecond, yeah.  Very pale, very straight hair, blue eyes.  And I--it's interesting when we talk about this grandmother.  I think she felt, in ways that were very painful to her, discrimination.  Because she had experienced a different reality as a child.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I have another thing to say about them as well.  While my grandmother, very tiny little woman, was this firebrand.  After doing great things in the city for, you know, the colored people, my grandfather was very much invested, and I think it's the difference between the male and the female of the time.  Not ever stepping out of line so as to protect his family, which meant he had to protect his life.  It would be my grandmother who would ask for, even demand a thing that she felt was the due for our people.  Whereas my grandfather was right straight down the line.  And I, you know, have a recollection because there were lots of stories told around that dining room table that you had to visit every other week.  Then as my first cousins got older, never my sister [Edna Reid McCollum] and I, they would say, "Granddaddy was an Uncle Tom."  And my response to that by the time I got to be a teenager is, "No, your grandfather is a survivor.  If he didn't ensure that he survived so as to build this foundation for his kids, we wouldn't be here today.  It was what it took."
Speaker 1: Stakes were certainly higher for him too.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Than they were for grandmother.
Speaker 2: For the women.  And I understand that now as a parent.  I have a son [Carl Rollins III].  And I get to--even today which is you know, something that as a parent of a male you never forget.  It's never over.  It's not just the DWB [driving while black].  It's almost the lines are not as--not drawn with as great a definition.  But young black men, I see that now as the president of Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  There's a path they have to march or be destroyed or destroy themselves.  And so I in large measure believe that it is important to tell truths to our kids.  Be they, you know, 957 of them at Fisk or our own, yeah.  And it is, it's different for women.  It's not fair, but it's different.
Story_ID: 420670
Speaker 1: Tell us about your stepmother.  She was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ah, easily done.
Speaker 1: Now what was--can you give us her full name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, her name is Mattie--she'll die about this--Lou, L-O-U, talk about really being from the South, Reid [Mattie Ross Reid].
Speaker 1: Mattie, what's the--
Speaker 2: Lou, L-O-U, that's really southern.
Speaker 1: Mattie Lou--
Speaker 2: Reid.  She was Ross before she married my father [Russell Reid] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ross, okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, I know that.  So why can't I get to my mother's and my birth mother's [Hazel Pallemon Reagan]?  Her date of birth is 1912, March 13th.  And we can do the math, my father was seven years older than my stepmother.
Speaker 1: She was born in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: No.  She was born in the country in Virginia.  Someplace very near Richmond [Virginia].  I could probably remember the town but I won't right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you know about her early life?
Speaker 2: I know a ton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know everything.  Her mother grew up on a large farm, west of Richmond, Virginia.  Her mother was a mulatto and worked on the farm of the white folks up the road.  She did not know her father.  When she was fourteen, she was impregnated by one of three men on that farm, either the father or two sons.  My stepmother was born.  A year after that, her brother [William Ross] was born.  And when she was seventeen, she left that place and went to Tidewater, Virginia.  She left on a mule with a cardboard suitcase with one intention in mind.  That that would never happen to her again, and that she would bring her kids out of there.  Two years later she did.  And over a period of about fifteen years, she brought every niece and every nephew out of that place.  She educated her son, he became a physician, and my mother, I call her my mother, who became a school teacher.  And interestingly enough, for her first teaching job, went back to that same county west of Virginia and taught for I think it was two years.  And then she went to the big city, in Newport News [Virginia], where she had come.  She went to Saint Paul [Saint Paul's College, Lawrenceville, Virginia], which is now a college near Lynchburg [Virginia].  It was then a boarding school for Negro kids.
Speaker 1: Was that the Episcopal--
Speaker 2: Yes.  And interestingly enough, my father went there, but not at the same time.  She and her brother went to Saint Paul and then from there she went to Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] and got her teaching degree.  And when she came back to the big city of Newport News, she met my father.  This attractive man with the, you know, the right set of degrees, and married him and took us on, yeah.  I was four, my sister [Edna Reid McCollum] was five.  And we had during that interim period, lived with Grandma Reid, which was a whole another piece.  Learned all about decorum and comportment, and the other grandmother, Ross, Grandma Lula [Lula Clark], was about her--they were both about service and giving back.  But her relationships with people in need were very proximate.  Grandma Lula had her entire back and side porch turned into a kind of store of used clothing and shoes.  Clean, folded and by size, male/female, adult/child.  And anyone in need could come and get what they needed.  And I've already told you she brought all of those nieces and nephews out.  I do not ever recall a weekend when she wasn't cooking for someone who was ill.  And my recollections of Christmas at her house was that she was busy making fruitcakes, ten upon ten, on the dining room table for neighbors and people in need.  And then she did Smithfield hams, now that was a good thing.
Story_ID: 420671
Speaker 1: What else do I remember about them?  My mother [O'Leary's stepmother, Mattie Ross Reid] won't like this.  But that grandmother's husband was a numbers, not runner, but the bookie person.  Because when we were growing up, we lived out and we used to come into Newport News [Virginia] to go to school.  And when we would come home for lunch, the table was piled high with money, and I thought we must be the richest people in the world.  I had to really, you know, get a bit older to understand.  And she and that husband, not my stepmother's father, had this exotic, exciting collection of friends.  We went to Hot Springs [Arkansas] in the winter for the baths and they played poker and there was someone called Mr. Sharpoon [ph.].  And at age six or seven I have this recollection of a huge diamond stickpin and they all wore, you know, these big hats and it was a lot more fun than Portsmouth, Virginia.  A lot more fun, yeah.  This grandmother was without pretention, although she had the desire for some, both these grandmothers were the same.  Education, education, education.  One because she had had it, and other because she hadn't had it.  And so the standard with respect to comportment was different in those houses.  But the expectation with respect to academic achievement were exactly the same, exactly.  There will be no Bs brought into this house.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's my story.
Speaker 2: I can't resist asking this question, but--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: How did your stepmother get along with your Grandmother Reid?
Speaker 1: Not at all.  Not at all.  This is interesting.  She, I don't understand this.  She did not permit Grandma Lula [Lula Clark] to come to their wedding.  I cannot imagine a circumstance under which anyone could forbid my mother from attending my wedding.  But they permitted it to happen.  She wasn't good enough.  She was a bastard.  But in point of fact, we don't know whether that grandmother was or not.  Grandma Reid, do we?  And I suspect now that maybe all of these pretentions--I mean we were brought up in the Episcopal church after, you know, if we could have gotten any closer to Anglican, you know, I don't know how.  But this pretention after a thing that really wasn't--it didn't, none of it was real. And I, you know, I could see the differences in those two households.
Story_ID: 420672
Speaker 1: When you think about I guess, when we look at, we reflect on the influences around you growing up, your--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --father [Russell Reid], your mother, your grandmothers and your stepmother [Mattie Ross Reid], who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It's interesting.  My birth mother, whose name is also Hazel [Hazel Pallemon Reagan], when she--she's now dead, but we sounded alike.  As a teenager if I would go to visit and pick up her phone for her, and they would say Hazel, and I would say yes, and then that person would began to chat to my mother.  I think we had the same edginess.  I doubt I was as brilliant but I want to say maybe close to.  But she didn't influence me because she--I don't remember her, my sister [Edna Reid McCollum] remembers her as a child.  I have no recollection of her as a--you know, before she left my father, and she did leave my father and also left us, which is an interesting thing to process as a child.
Speaker 1: That wasn't what you would expect (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It wasn't the done thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't what you would expect for those days.
Speaker 2: And as a youngster, you know, as I processed it the weight was on her.  As I got older and I processed it, the weight was on my father.  You know, what terrible thing could have happened to her that she would leave there?  You know, it's rumored that I was left on the front porch in a playpen and my sister was taken next door to the person who was our babysitter.  Who knows?  You know, there are these wonderful legends in every family that take wings and puff up.  But so in point of fact she was not an influence on my life.  I have recollections of her coming to town, and I now understood that when she came back, she came to try and get us.  And I see this beautiful woman decked in furs and smelling of perfume and very sophisticated.  And my stepmother is a beautiful woman.  But she was, you know, she was the woman with an apron who baked a cake and you know, got us ready for Halloween and as between the two of them, well first of all I didn't have a decision to make.  That decision was made by, you know, my father.  But no way I wanted to--I was fascinated by this person who came in and out of our lives, but I didn't want to, I didn't want to go with her.  I knew where I belonged.  I knew where home was.  So now I'm going to leap to my stepmother.  Like the mother-in-law, very concerned about what people thought, what people felt.  Being thought of as perfect.  And my stepmother worked very hard to be perfect.  I of course, realize--my sister worked very hard to be perfect, so I worked extremely hard to be imperfect, which was a lot more fun I think.  The grandmothers, I loved Lula [Lula Clark].  There wasn't anything you--you couldn't shock her.  There was no dark secret from age seven that you couldn't share with her.  She didn't have to forgive you because she never judged you.  And she taught you lessons, not so much through her words, but through her behavior.  But it was easy to be with her, easy.  And I've already told you it was the most fun place ever to be with these wonderful characters.  And I wasn't reading the books then, but there were no books I could have read as a child that would have been as exciting as these people who surrounded them.
Story_ID: 420673
Speaker 1: --I was going to tell you one more Grandma Lula [Lula Clark] story.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: First of all, she was amazingly entrepreneurial.  She had restaurants, and in the summer, of course the beaches, you know Tidewater [Virginia], the Chesapeake Bay, the James River, the oceans out there.  There was a black beach and a white beach.  And she had concessions at the beach; she had a restaurant at the beach.  And again, it was a fun place to go.  So on a rare occasion my stepmother would let us go to the beach.  And on one of these days, one of the women who was running one of the games for her, got sick or didn't show up.  And Grandma Lula said, "I don't know what I'm going to do.  Elsie [ph.] is not here."  And I go, "I can do that."  So to do that was to take a white mouse and a cup with a cover on it and spin this table that I then recognized, probably looked like every gambling table in the world, they were blue, they were black, there were numbers on it.  But the deal was, you shook this mouse on the table and he ran around of course until he or she found the hole to be in.  So the woman Elsie had a spiel.  And it was, "Are you ready for Freddy?  Are you loose for Lucy?  Let's roll the ball."  So you know I had seen that maybe two or three times, that was very intriguing.  I can do that, I can do that.  About the time I did it for the first time, my stepmother, Mattie Dear [Mattie Ross Reid] we called her, I call her still, my sister [Edna Reid McCollum] too, came up.  She grabbed me by the scruff of my neck.  "If you don't come out of here."  And I can still see her with her hands on her hips, giving it to her mother.  "What do you mean letting this child--?"  And Grandma Lula said, "I didn't see any harm in it."  I had a ball.  And we talk about that now, my sister and I.  My sister, you know the really good one, I couldn't wait to do that.
Speaker 2: Now is your sister the oldest, or are you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She's older by fourteen months, yeah.
Speaker 2: She's the oldest, okay.
Story_ID: 420674
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I do.  I have two and they both involve living with my grandparents in Portsmouth [Virginia], the Reids.  No I have three.  The first one was being down the street at my father's [Russell Reid] brother's house.  I mean they lived four doors--I mean it was, I told you a very close family.  And the cook in their house was named Tensy [ph.].  And it was a kitchen that you could go into.  And my first recollection is sitting on the stool in the kitchen with Tensy and she's letting me beat the batter for the cake.  That would never happen at my grandmother's house, not allowed in the kitchen.  My second recollection is playing hairdresser.  Little braids, little thing with the big bow, and I was the hairdresser first and my sister [Edna Reid McCollum] was customer.  (Makes sound) took it off.  And I remember being put on the back porch with the door locked for that afternoon.  And I must have been three.  I kicked that door all afternoon, all afternoon.  And my last one involves an older cousin again who lived down the street.  And we were playing on her front lawn and I wiped my hand along a gate and I must have had a hundred splinters.  My grandfather was a doctor.  And I had the recollection of sitting in his office and very carefully and very lovingly he took out every splinter.  Sat me on his knee when he was done, told me what a big girl I was, gave me a quarter (laughter).  Those are my three memories.
Story_ID: 420675
Speaker 1: What were some of the--this has been really rich so far.  But what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of growing up?  Oh, wonderful.  First thing, [paternal] grandfather's office.  Iodine, leather chair for the doctor, leather table.  Benedyne, the sounds of the instruments, and this was really back in the day as we now say because the office was an attachment to the house.  You could actually go through the den and come into the side door of the office.  So it was a great time to be in my grandfather's office.  And in many ways it was not as controlled, or did not appear to me, as the house.  It was a wonderful place to go.  Smelled exotic.  I took that smell of things chemical directly to gasoline, paint.  These are almost the same smells as the doctor's office.  These chemical aromas, petroleum benzene like odors.  I grew up on the water.  I have recollection of the sea, of waves.  I do not like lakes and still water.  Salt in the air.  I have and will always have a sense of home that is tied to almost simultaneous smell of brackish water, river and bay.  And when I get that combination, I'm home anyplace in the world.  Open skies, water, always water.  Water is my child, water is in my life today, yeah.  What are my other memories?  Snowsuits, you wouldn't remember, you're too young.  I mean in the wintertime you got put in these things that zipped here, came up to here if you were a little kid, with suspenders.  And the, the mittens clipped to your, your coat to be decked out for the winter.  And the freedom of summertime.  And also the fear of summertime, with polio.  At our house we took a bath three times a day in the summertime.  Weren't allowed to get overheated.  Because no one knew then the what and the how of polio.  And so the summer was a very frightening time.  You could feel it in the house.  That these kids, these little girls would be safe through the summer.  And then I take that recollection directly to March of Dimes [National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis; March of Dimes Foundation], iron lung, and the movie theaters.  You know they'd show the public service thing with the little kids in the iron lung or people clomping around in braces and then they'd turn the lights on and collect the money.  This was a very serious thing in my growing up time.

Speaker 1: The other thing I remember is I remember the war, World War II [WWII].  Because some of the German prisoners of war were interred right there in Tidewater [Virginia].  And the activity on some Sundays was to go and look at the prisoners of war.  At the same time that we're going through air raid warnings and practice when we had the black curtains and the air raid warden would come around and tell you when your lights were showing.  And my sense was that invasion was imminent, and that's an overlay of the movie.  I have a recollection of a real propaganda film with the Japanese impaling little Caucasian babies on their bayonets and I can remember my sister [Edna Reid McCollum] and I planning where to hide.  I remember that to this day.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Where--
Speaker 1: Was that enough?
Speaker 2: No, where could you see Japanese prisoners of war?  I mean in what circumstance were--I mean the German prisoners of war (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They were interred very near Newport News [Virginia], before Newport News in Fort Eustis [Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia].  And it was a Sunday outing for families--there was a chain link fence, here were we, and there were they.  And these submarines were picked up off the coast of Virginia.  And these people were interred there, oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 2: So the war was a lot closer.
Speaker 1: It was very close.  I told you so much so that again, we planned where to hide.  My other war story involves my sister who was in the first grade at the time.  I was still at home.  And her teacher's giving them all a lecture about rationing and there will be no--this is terrible--there will be no butter, no coffee, no sugar.  And my sister raised her hand and said, "Oh no, Ms. Adams [ph.].  We have plenty of that at my house.  My father [Russell Reid] has it all in a big closet.  Do you want me to bring you some sugar?"
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's known as hoarding, right, in those days, I guess (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well here's what I'm aware of.  The patients, my father's patients came in two forms.  One they could--they worked in the shipyard, so this is very big boom town.  The [U.S.] military was there and the shipyard was there.  So the patients with money paid in silver dollars.  This is another time I thought we were really rich, just piles and piles of silver dollars.  And the people who didn't have money, would often pay in coffee and sugar and cakes and chickens and squabs and whatever.  So yeah we had a ton of that.  We did and my sister said that the nice teacher came and told my mother [O'Leary's stepmother, Mattie Ross Reid], "You know maybe you better have a talk with (unclear)."
Story_ID: 420677
Speaker 1: You had mentioned church.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was church a big deal in the family, or was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I tell my mother today that we were sent to church.  She declares it was, is not true.  Yes and no.  Sunday school was very important.  By the time I was--by the time my father [Russell Reid] was married to Mattie Dear [O'Leary's stepmother, Mattie Ross Reid], she was in the Presbyterian church.  We went with her to the Presbyterian church.  I'm a Presbyterian today.  And the church in mind was very social for the kids, you know, there would be summer bible school, there'd be talent shows.  Things to--ways to spend supervised time at church.  I don't have a recollection of, you know, bible reading and that kind of stuff in my house.  But we went or were sent.  And today church is extremely important to me.  But not in the--how do I want to say this?  I go to church--I mean I'm still on the rolls of the Carver Memorial Presbyterian Church in Newport News, Virginia.  And it's my home church.  And I, you know, and some friends stopped by.  I was home for my mother's birthday, stopped by on Monday night and we were talking about the numbers of, you know, ministers, pastors, preachers in that church since we've all grown up, and we can name them all to this day.  And so if I go home and I'm not involved with my mother and can get to church, I will go.  And I go to chapel here at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  I've always liked the music and the message becomes more important to me as someone who has to model behavior that we expect our students to exhibit, yeah.
Story_ID: 420678
Speaker 1: See, what about radio--I guess later on, television (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, 'Young Dr. Malone.'  'Just Plain Bill,' barber of Hartville.  'Stella Dallas,' she saw her beloved daughter Laurel [Laurel Dallas] marry into wealth and society and realizing their differences in taste and worlds, went out Laurel's life.  Yeah it was entertainment, it was fantasy, it was education.  There was something called 'Let's Pretend' on Saturday that had the fairy tales, "Cream of Wheat is good to eat and we have it every day.  Sing the song, it will make us strong."  Now that was a very important part of our growing up.  'Amos 'n' Andy,' which was frowned upon in our house.  So of course we loved it.
Speaker 1: Did you know that they were white?
Speaker 2: No, not then.  I did later.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  TV came very late and came to my house slowly.  I suspect because my father [Russell Reid] was extremely frugal and my mother [O'Leary's stepmother, Mattie Ross Reid] didn't quite want us exposed to things that she hadn't quite vetted well enough yet.  Yeah, no it was the radio.  And I continue to think today, I love public radio.  I also like public TV because it teaches you and takes you places.  But you're allowed to use your imagination.  There's something called the inner sanctum on the radio, the squeaking door.  And you could either decide to be frightened to death or to listen.  I very early understood sound effects.  And my sister [Edna Reid McCollum] and I would try to figure out what it was.  You know, cloppity clop for the horses.  What do you think that is?  But the ability to hear and then use your mind to create the picture I think is a far more exciting thing than--I feel the same way about reading.  Much more leaves me free to interpret than to have to see it on the tube (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 420679
Speaker 1: So did you read a lot when you were growing up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, I'm a big reader, big, big reader.  Loved poetry, loved history, I still do.  I have trash reading for coming back from a business trip, you know you read the business stuff going out.  And if you're not too tired, then I still am--I just consume history because it's like opening the door and peeking in on the people next door who after all aren't very different from you and me.  Yeah, I'm a big reader.
Speaker 1: What kind of history do you enjoy the most?
Speaker 2: Depends.  I--let's see what am I reading at this very moment.  I am in the--I'm always in the middle of books.  I'm in the middle of--darn it, I've forgotten the book, 'Reverend Stowe, the Great Abolitionist' [sic.].
Speaker 1: Henry Ward.
Speaker 2: Henry Ward Stowe [sic. Henry Ward Beecher].  I'll bet you didn't know he was a big adulterer.
Speaker 1: There was a story, I heard a story of a scandal, some big scandal.
Speaker 2: That was it.  And the juxtaposition.  Let me tell you how I came to this.  I was reading another book on sort of a look at the Civil War and abolition in a more domestic setting.  Sort of how the women reacted to this, why were there some women who were abolitionists, some not, and what was the difference.  And I was also reading a book called 'Property' [Valerie Martin] which was the story of a slave's very intimate relationship with her mistress, who happened to be her half-sister.  And I read The New York Times Book Review section every Sunday to figure out what I want to read.  And I decided against this backdrop of this outstanding abolitionist who had a hand in helping the Jubilee Singers [Fisk Jubilee Singers] get to Europe.
Speaker 1: Henry Ward Beecher.
Speaker 2: Right.  And so I thought, well let's see the other side of this story.  And so I--well this is how my appetite runs.  So I'm about a quarter of the way through that book.  I am also reading 'The Audacity of Hope' ['The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream,' Barack Obama].  I am also reading a lousy book, Grisham's 'An Innocent Man' [sic. 'The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town,' John Grisham], which is nonfiction.  Do you know the background of this story?  Well it's about someone who's accused of murder and years later it's discovered that he did not.  But the plot is out of reality and Grisham's mind is far more creative than any of our realities.  And so I'm like I really can't stand this book.  Why is it--you know why isn't it moving along at a great pace?  Let's see, what else am I reading right now?  I blank at the moment.  But at the bottom of my bed on my bench, this is embarrassing, I probably have six books that I'm in the middle of.  And I will pick them up.  Although I just returned from--I was on the road for twelve days.  And I knocked out a book, oh this is so trashy.  It's called 'With a Courtesan' [sic. 'In the Company of the Courtesan,' Sarah Dunant] and it gives you a background of Venice [Italy] in the middle 17th century [sic. 16th century].  So you've got a titan, you've got Rome [Italy] being sacked in its last sacking, and Venice becoming the center of commerce and the view of Venice almost like Amsterdam [the Netherlands], that has become a melting pot where different kinds of people are accepted because they all bring enrichment to the city state.  And it's an interesting book in that regard as well.  So that was my--I knocked that out before I ever got home.  And I'm going to bring it in and give it to somebody here I know who will enjoy it.  Yeah that was my--that's been my trash book of the month, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So having a [paternal] grandmother that quotes Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] and lots of books around.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 420680
Speaker 1: --What else did you like to do when you were growing up?  I've read that you were into the arts and could sing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I could sing and read poetry and badly play the French horn and play the violin so badly that my mother [O'Leary's stepmother, Mattie Ross Reid] said to us, "Well if you're not going to practice those violins, take them up to the attic."  And we said, "Okay."  And she, being a very principled woman had told us to do that, so she never told us to bring them down.  Yeah, we were--we went to dance class, you know we went to drama class.  We did all the things you're supposed to do.  Swimming in the water, on the water, crabbing, boating and during that time, you know we were--we went where our parents went, to their conventions, their conferences.  Interesting thing too, because everybody knew everybody.  Also went to Camp Atwater in East Brookfield, Massachusetts [sic. North Brookfield, Massachusetts].  Run by the Urban League, and I used to think that we were sent to camp because they loved us.  As I became a parent, I came to understand that we were sent to camp because they needed relief (laughter).  But I liked that too, so we were--it was another example of being let free, set free.  God, I loved camp.  I have songs from camp I could sing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Camp Atwater was where--
Speaker 2: In East Brookfield, Massachusetts, and a group of us went from Tidewater [Virginia].  This was really long ago because there was no Bay Bridge [Chesapeake Bay Bridge] across the Chesapeake [Chesapeake Bay] to get up north a quick way.  And we'd take the Cape Charles Ferry [Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry] to get the train, and we'd go from New York [New York], we'd come to Penn Station [Pennsylvania Station, New York, New York].  My mother's very sophisticated New York friend Evelyn [ph.] who taught me to put my hair up first and last and put on makeup, would meet us and take us to Grand Central station [Grand Central Terminal, New York, New York].  We got on a train and go to Springfield, Massachusetts, and be picked up in a station wagon and taken to Camp Atwater.  And by the time we got there, we knew we were free, we were free (laughter).  Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was an Urban League camp, right?
Speaker 2: Exactly, yeah, yeah, and I have Atwater friends to this day, Camp Atwater friends, yeah.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other people in camp that--
Speaker 2: I knew you were going to ask me that.  Well I'll tell a great friend of mine, Alma Brown, [HistoryMaker] Alma Arrington Brown, Ron Brown's widow.  I have known Alma since camp.  Alma also went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  She was two years behind me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She was the cutest camper at Atwater, yeah she was a cute kid.  The Delany sisters [Sarah Louise Delany and Annie Elizabeth Delany] out of New York, Wanda Caffey [ph.].  I just ran into Wanda Caffey [ph.] in New York this week and she ran up to me, gave me a big hug.  I probably haven't seen her in five years.  But those are, you know--it's like Fisk.  The people I went to Fisk with, hey I might not see them for ten years, but if I had a need or an ache, my heart were aching, just pick up the phone and call.  And that is the advantage of the so-called gilded ghetto.  We all know each other.  We know the first wives, the second wives, the third wives, all of the children, and for our kids, they had they built in set of relationships.  First you go to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] and then you go to camp, you come home.  Now there's not that much convention of meeting going anymore.  You know there's no longer the National Medical Association, or the National--there's still people who belong to the national law association [National Bar Association], but not as--I mean when I was growing up, there were no other options.  And in Virginia the--
Speaker 1: Oh, the black professional organizations (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah the dentists, the doctors and the pharmacists would meet together in Virginia.  So we all know each other.  And there was a high expectation that you would marry out of that group too.  And get busy.
Story_ID: 420681
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about school now.  What school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Well let's see, I started school in Aberdeen Gardens [Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Was this in Newport News [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: No that was actually in Hampton [Virginia].  I'm sure it belonged to a county then.  Aberdeen Gardens is now on the register of historic sites because it was built by Negroes, for Negroes to live in, and this was the housing provided to people who lived in the shipyard.  My father [Russell Reid] was there as a physician, that's how he got in.  My uncle was there as a pharmacist, that's how he--because they were to be people who could tend or at least have an office that these people would come to.  It was, it was interesting because in some ways I got this message that we were better.  No one ever said it.  But I loved Aberdeen because it was closed.  We all knew each other.  You could play up and down the street.  You just had to be home before dark and you had to come, you know for the summertime, you had to show up for lunch.  But pretty much again, freedom.  We were let free.  In back of our house which also had victory garden, we had a chicken coop, we had a pigeon coop.  I was twenty-one before I learned that squabs were expensive.  But in back of that victory garden which everyone had, was (cough), I'm sorry, the experimental farm for what was then Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  And we used to go inside and steal the red tablecloths and bullfight the bulls.  And we also used to--
Speaker 1: Bullfight the bulls?
Speaker 2: Like the movies, yeah.
Speaker 1: Real bulls.
Speaker 2: Real bulls, and we--I mean no one--you know, I have been beaten within an inch of my life.  And there was beyond the farm, a creek with a vine on it.  And we would play Tarzan.  But we knew we had to do it early enough to be dry by the time we showed up at home.
Speaker 1: Or you would miss--
Speaker 2: I would get my butt beat.  Oh yeah, oh yeah.  And the same kind of freedom came with beach life in the summertime when we went to Cappahosic [Cappahosic Beach, Virginia], or when we went to Rehoboth [Rehoboth Beach, Delaware] or anyplace they let you go.  And you just knew to show up.  And if anything bad happened, you couldn't do this at school.  Things bad happen at school, you get spanked at school, spanked at home.  But when you were free if bad things happened, you just shouldn't show a bruise, shouldn't be leaning any way and never speak of it.  That's what I learned.  I learned how to keep my own counsel, yeah.  The growing up was fun, yeah.  It was controlled to utter lack of control.  And also understanding the expectations in each of those environments.  I don't think that's unique either, that kids get to be rowdy when they're free, yeah.
Story_ID: 420682
Speaker 1: --Was this kindergarten in Aberdeen [Aberdeen Gardens, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: No, there was no such thing as kindergarten then.  No, I started in first grade.  And we stayed there until I think, I remember being in the second grade in Aberdeen Gardens it was called, imagine that.  And then we went to school in the city because it was determined that the schools here weren't, whatever that was, good enough.  And then we went to Booker--no, John Marshall School [John Marshall Elementary School, Newport News, Virginia].  And I was at John Marshall I think for the third and fourth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, John Marshall School?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So did I miss one?  There's Aberdeen--
Speaker 2: Aberdeen, John Marshall.  I was there for two years.  The kids used to beat me up every day after school.
Speaker 1: Why?  Why would they beat you up every day?  Okay, too light for them.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  And I used to run to Grandma Lula's [Lula Clark] house every day.  I hit the corner screaming, "Open the door, open the door."  Then one day she came out there and said, "I'm not letting you in."  "You got to let me in."  "You see that branch over there?  You pick up that branch and you hit these people."  And I did.  And she said, "And that's the way you survive."  And the next day we were in another school.  My mother [O'Leary's stepmother, Mattie Ross Reid] moved us.  We then went to--nobody bothered Edna [O'Leary's sister, Edna Reid McCollum], but Edna was so--I was pretty mouthy and whatever.  But we got moved that very next day, and we went to, this is when we went to Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington School; Booker T. Washington Middle School, Newport News, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay now where was Booker T?
Speaker 2: Booker T was in the East End [Newport News, Virginia].  But they were all, you know, black neighborhood.
Speaker 1: All in Newport News [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, all in Newport News, but you know there was the North [North End, Newport News, Virginia] and the East End, whatever.  And nobody chased me home from school anymore.
Speaker 1: So color was that big a deal in school.
Speaker 2: Always, always, and see it's really interesting when you--how you get your messages.  The message I received was I am different and my Grandmother Reid and my stepmother were telling me, "Oh yeah honey, but this is much better."  And folks were chasing me home every day.  I'm going, "I don't think this is better."  And I--remember I told you the subliminal message you are really better.  Booker T, a lot more--the population was a lot more diverse.  There were many more light kids there.  So nobody picked on you for that reason.  And this interesting because my sense of the unfairness of the thing was probably formed in the third grade.  And I didn't really believe oh, but you're better.  The reason I didn't was there were all these messages about black women being used by white men and how else do you get to be pale?  I'm like I don't think this is such a big deal, or else why would Lula leave that place?  It didn't--it just didn't make any sense to me.  I didn't get the, oh, but you're better part.
Speaker 1: Someone said a long time ago to be an expert on race in America is to be crazy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There are so many contradictory--
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Trust me, I get it.  I mean I have a recollection; my sister was about a year and a half ahead of me in producing kids.  And her kids were blonde with blue eyes.  And the first time we showed up together, I had my little brown baby and she had her little white babies, and my grandmother reaches out and she goes, "Oh these are my grandchildren."  And I go, "What?"  But it is--the self-hatred is systemic in some of our homes.  And I think they take different tales and different myths, but they're there.  And the legacy is important to acknowledge and then to overcome.  We cannot hate ourselves.  We just can't.
Story_ID: 420683
Speaker 1: So did you spend the rest of your elementary school days at Booker T [Booker T. Washington School; Booker T. Washington Middle School, Newport News, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and then we went to high school; there was no middle school then.
Speaker 1: Okay now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And we went to Huntington High School [Collis P. Huntington High School] in Newport News, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Named for Commander Huntington [Collis Potter Huntington], who had the railroad and the original shipping ports in Tidewater [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Now Commander Huntington I take it was a white person.
Speaker 2: Oh, for sure.  You don't think we'd go around naming a school--except for Booker T, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well in school, in the Tidewater area, did you have a favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: I had a ton of favorite teachers.  Mr. Green [ph.], I think, who might have been eighth grade.  Ms. Palmer who was married to one of the Palmers, Mercedes [Mercedes Hardwick Palmer].  It's interesting, she was my teacher, she was one of my favorite teachers, and as a young adult she became one of my best friends.  She was my mother's [O'Leary's stepmother, Mattie Ross Reid] good friend.  And she and her husband, his name is Gus, really Augustus [Augustus L. Palmer, Sr.], they were about my mother's age, they're in their mid-nineties and they still live at home.  And they still apparently (unclear).  Yeah, those would be some favorites.  Then after the ninth grade, ten, eleven, twelve, yeah.  We went to school in New Jersey because the schools were segregated.  You know again, got to get a better school, got to get a better school.
Speaker 1: So was Huntington an all-black school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, it was named for a shipper.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all the, you know--Armstrong [Samuel Chapman Armstrong].
Speaker 1: So that was--was Huntington a white philanthropist who donated to the--
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  I just think all the things in that town and all those towns up and down the eastern seaboard carry those same names, it's alarming.  And I suspect that you know our history is our history and the, the, the barons were people of industry and commerce.  And if they owned things, especially in the late 18th to the mid-20th century, they had to do with commerce and things moving.  So the streets, the schools, they all have the same names, yeah, yeah.  But no, totally segregated.
Story_ID: 420684
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then I went to the school of fine and performing arts [Arts High School, Newark, New Jersey] in New Jersey.
Speaker 2: Okay so this is a, as a sophomore?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: The school of fine and performing arts (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And performing arts.
Speaker 2: This is in Newark [New Jersey]?
Speaker 1: It's in Newark, yeah.  Mr. D'Amico [ph.] was my band teacher.
Speaker 2: Now how did you--I mean were you--so you had aspirations to become an artist, performing artist?
Speaker 1: No, I think it was once again my parents [O'Leary's stepmother, Mattie Ross Reid and Russell Reid] making a decision about what the best place for us to be.  We probably should have gone to West Side High School [Newark, New Jersey].  The interesting thing is this was a very small school.  We both had, you know, it was alleged had some modicum of talent.  There was a test to get in and we got in.  My sister [Edna Reid McCollum] was there too.  I loved it.  I mean all the things I'd done all my life, you know, all of a sudden not only are you reading poetry, but you can be in a contest.  Not only are you doing a play, but you can be in an opera and operetta.  I really did play the French horn in the orchestra.  I was so bad.  I was so bad.  We were doing Madama, the first act of 'Madama Butterfly' [Giacomo Puccini].  I think it must have been my, my junior year.  And I don't know why, but I was sitting second chair, first French horn.  And the guy who played first chair, Ralph Zytland [ph.] was late.  And the beginning of that aria starts with a very high F that's sustained.  And of course on the French horn you just have those few little keys.  You got to find those notes with your mouth, and I was in there, there is no way I'm playing this.  And I'm trying to warm up my mouthpiece, you know, I'm sitting on it, I'm--and I'm looking up the aisle and almost as the lights go down, Ralph Zytland comes floating in with his black coat, probably his father's coat.  Far too large for him, sort of flapping in the breeze.  And Mr. D'Amico looked at me and said, "Saved."  And I said, "No sir, you're saved, you're saved."  It was a small school.  Lots of very talented--Connie Francis was in my class.  Do you know Connie Francis?
Speaker 2: Right, 'Where the Boys Are.'
Speaker 1: "Where the boys are, someone waits for me."  Her name was Connie Franconero, and she played the accordion and was on the 'Arthur Godfrey Hour' ['The Arthur Godfrey Hour'].  It's interesting, the kids from Arts High School have a, you know, have an email tree and they find each other and talk to each other all the time.  I rarely, sometimes I read it because I'm amused to think back.  But that was a dramatic difference for us.  We lived with an aunt, my father's baby sister.  We were catapulted into an integrated, somewhat integrated society.  My uncle by marriage was a Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduate, my Aunt Edna [ph.] had gone to Atlanta University School of Social Work [Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia] and oh, there's a lot of neat stuff about that.  Arts High School was also the high school for disabled students.  And what I learned at Arts High School also learned that at summer music camp in Virginia, because there were disabled kids who went there.  Acceptance of and a recognition that there was personality and folks were interesting no matter what their apparent affliction.  I learned a real acceptance of everyone through those two experiences.  The first person I ever knew was severely limited by cerebral palsy, I met at Arts High School.  Which enabled me to interview on a higher, probably one of the most brilliant lawyers I've ever worked with, who had cerebral palsy and you really had to work to hear him.  He was so palsy he had to drink his coffee through a straw, everything through a straw.  But those were sort of life's lessons that were given to me very serendipitously.  And they carry on into some of my later career.  When I was doing work at the [U.S.] Department of Energy with people who were exposed to radiation, you know, I had relationships with people who had features gone, half a face gone.  It was not a big deal to me.  And it, it was, it was an act of reaffirming what I had learned so long ago as such a young person, to find the heart and the soul of people who were so damaged that most of us would not talk to them, or wouldn't think they were worth talking to, you know.  Because people are different or scarred or whatever.  You know, that's a piece of humanity I learned in that experience.  Yeah, I loved Arts High.
Story_ID: 420685
Speaker 1: Did you have aspirations to become an artist or some--did you think that you might (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I thought, I mean you hear me singing, right?  You know, I've been singing at every turn.  I thought no, I mean I knew--my line is when I talk to young people is that it wasn't acceptable, so I went to law school [Rutgers Law School, Newark, New Jersey], which is another form of performance.
Speaker 1: So were you ever in a play?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, all the time, yeah.  But not a Broadway play.  I mean you weren't thinking that.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: Arts High School [Newark, New Jersey] play.
Speaker 2: Yeah, at Arts High School, at the Huntington High School [Collis P. Huntington High School, Newport News, Virginia], in grammar school.  I was in a drama club from the time I was probably ten.  As were all the kids I knew in the little creek.  Mrs. Scott [ph.] was our drama teacher, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you have--so you--how were your grades in school?
Speaker 2: I did very well in everything except math, yeah, yeah, very well.  I flunked Algebra 3.  I had to go to summer school, it was terrible.  I mean I told you, not even Bs in our house, yeah.  But guess who knows her math now?  And do you know why?  Because I think it's so important to teach everyone that math isn't that hard.  Not only is it fun, you know, which is part of the myth, but it is the passage for entry into critical thinking.  If you can't balance things and come up with an answer, can't do your numbers, your equations, how can you compare anything in life?  So what a terrible thing to have somebody give you a pass.  Oh, she didn't feel like learning this now.  And we're faced with the same challenge here at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  There are kids who come to us who have been taught it's okay not to do math.  Not to do it well.  But, you know.  Yeah, but other than that, I was a great student, yeah.

Speaker 1: How did you choose a college?  Now most of your family you say went to Hampton [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], right, they were Hampton people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, easy.  And the other half, you know, at the beginning of integration they all went to, you know, majority schools, as did my sister [Edna Reid McCollum].  She went to Cedar Crest College in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  And I had three aunts who went, you know, to majority schools long ago.  (Cough) I told you how close in age I was to my sister.  So when I was a senior in high school [Arts High School, Newark, New Jersey], I would go up to see Cedar Crest College in Allentown, Pennsylvania to see my sister.  There were three Negro women there, three.  And my sense of them at Cedar Crest was that no one was mean to them, but no one knew what to do with them.  And they were sort of foreign elements within the great sea.  And then one weekend there was a social, yeah listen to this.  The guys from Lehigh [Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania] came over to Cedar Crest College.  And what I saw as these hordes of men came through, and my recollection is they may have been five Negro students from the engineering college.  I will tell you that the chaperones were body blocking these black guys from talking to the white women, and the black women if it looked like, or Negro women.  They were going to talk to the black, the white guys.  And I thought to myself, and said so, why would I want to be in a place where A, apparently nobody really likes me, and B, someone is afraid that there will be this romantic flicker?  So from that experience I go well, I guess I'm going to a Negro college.  And I had a cousin here, recall though, my father [Russell Reid] and my birth mother [Hazel Pallemon Reagan] had gone to Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], so I said, "Hm, I think I'm going to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]."  And in the family, you know, among all of those first cousins, the routine was each kid ready for college would be given enough money to apply to ten schools.  I took my ten school money, I applied to Fisk, and I went shopping with the rest of it.  And then I thought, what would I have done if I hadn't been admitted?  I guess I would have had to go to Hampton.  I think they would have taken me there, but I was admitted to Fisk.  And I was happy here, and yeah I loved Fisk, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was it, was a change from high school.  So you went from a segregated school in Newport News [Virginia] to an integrated--
Speaker 2: Yeah, to an integrated school.
Speaker 1: And then to, now to Fisk--
Speaker 2: Take me to where they're gonna love me.
Speaker 1: So you graduated from high school in '55 [1955]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, '55 [1955], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you came here the fall of--
Speaker 2: I came in August really.  And my father brought me here, which was very interesting.  My introduction to life at Fisk involved opening a dresser drawer in my dorm room in Jubilee Hall and having a huge thing fly out of the drawer (makes sound).  It was a flying cockroach.  My father stood there laughing and said, "Welcome to the real world."
Story_ID: 420687
Speaker 1: That is the only negative impression I have of my dormitory life at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  I don't remember anything else that was a negative.  I liked being here.  That freedom piece again.  But free in an environment where there were lots of folks making certain that you were toeing the line.  Of course I was on social probation this--before the end of my first week at Fisk for driving a car.  It was my father's [Russell Reid] car.
Speaker 2: Did he leave the car for you?
Speaker 1: No, they were over Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] visiting someplace and he said, "Why don't you take the car and take these things over to your dormitory?"  So you know, I'm from the South.  I was driving since I was fifteen.  So I jumped in the car, drove it up the oval, and wham.  So I go, wow, they got a set of rules here, yeah.  No there was no leaving of cars then.  Fisk women were not allowed to--there was never a question of owning a car.  Not allowed to drive in a car.  Fisk women, a Fisk women is not allowed--
Speaker 2: They weren't allowed to get in a car with someone, you said.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  Fisk woman is not allowed--there was something called the Fisk Woman.  The Fisk Woman is not to frequent the apartment of unmarried men.  I, the little wag said, oh great, I guess that leaves us open to visit the apartment of married men.  Is that what you had in mind?  You get the story.  It was plenty of (makes sound), yeah, yeah.  It was interesting.
Speaker 2: All right, so these--did these rules apply to the entire, for the entire--
Speaker 1: No, here is the impetus for academic achievement.  If you make the dean's list as a freshman, you advance to the sophomore rules and on and on it goes.  So you want to be on the dean's list.  You want to be on the dean's list so I'm thinking somebody will have to correct me.  But I'm thinking we were due in the dorm at seven o'clock.  And there was you had to sign in, and you might be able to sign out again.  But there were only three places you could go off campus.  One was--I was talking to somebody the other day who remembered the name of the Ritz Theater [Nashville, Tennessee].  But it only changed movies every three days.  So there were people signing out to the Ritz Theater every night.  And of course I mean, you now know something about my character.  I would say, this makes no sense at all.  These people are not at the Ritz Theater.  Well you have to sign out.  I would sign out Alpha house [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], and they would say you're not allowed in the Alpha house.  If something happens to me, don't you really want to know where I am?  I want you to know where I'm going.  I will be in the Alpha house.  They're having a big party there, I'll be there.  There was a lot of--like it was grandma all over again.  You know this--I used to say there was a pretention after Miss Ann [ph.], and we really weren't, do you know?  At any rate, I didn't get in too much trouble at Fisk.
Speaker 2: I always suspected that myself.  You know, some--yeah, a pretention after southern.
Speaker 1: And a southern belle.
Speaker 2: Southern gentility.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, give me a break.
Story_ID: 420688
Speaker 1: I don't want to really knock the pretention too much.  Because it really was what parents wanted to happen, especially for their daughters, and I believe their sons.  I find it interesting today if, I mean if you really want to know what's going on, on this campus, you go to admission because the kids have come through with their admission counselors, and they like them.  So that's home base.  So if I really want to know what's going on on our campus, I walk the campus.  But if I don't have time, I go down to admission.  And one day I walked in and they were going through the old yearbooks and everybody had on stockings and the guys had on suits and ties.  They probably had one suit, do you know?  And these kids now who got their--even though they're not allowed to do that anymore since I got here with their bodies, you know and the plumber's butt.  Said well why can't we be like this?  Now is that not curious?  And my answer is but of course you can be.  It is up to you.  And I try to think back.  I know we weren't allowed, you know, there were times when you could wear pants.  There were no jeans to be worn.  But at dinnertime on Saturday, you were dressed up and on Sunday you had on heels, you went to chapel and you had a seat in chapel and you weren't missing chapel.  So there was a lot around building the kind of discipline that is really necessary in life.  And failure to follow the norm brought with it some sanctions.  You were on social probation, my god you're stuck in your dorm.  Now you become the world's greatest bridge player and you write a four point average if you have any good, common sense.  There was a sense of ownership that we are, you know we still have, but I don't believe it is as profound because it wasn't any gadding about the city.  So your professors, if you were among the bright kids, would invite you over for supper, a discussion group, and when dignitaries came to campus, there existed and does exist today, the opportunity not only to hear them in lecture or seminar, but interact with them, to ask life's greatest questions.  And that was the fun part of Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Story_ID: 420689
Speaker 1: One of my favorite professors who's just retired, he was an emeritus professor and taught a course a semester, Dr. L.M. Collins [Leslie M. "Doc" Collins].  There is not a Fiskite living today who hasn't been taught by Dr. Collins.  And we had a play which we staged here at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] for the month of February called 'Ordinary People' [ph.].  It was really a series of multimedia vignettes that captured the lives of the, some of the soldiers in the Civil Rights Movement.  And in that play there's a vignette, this would be 1959, '60 [1960], '61 [1961], and the kids are talking about Dr. L.M. Collins.  So there's this sense of continuity.  Dr. Collins had to retire, I mean he really needed to; I mean I'm sure he's my mother's [O'Leary's stepmother, Mattie Ross Reid] age.  And I went over to kind of get him ready for this, broke my heart.  And he said to me, "I'm not ready to go." I said, "How come, you're not well.  I don't think we have any choice," you know, I'd like to see you healthier and he said, "I cannot imagine giving up the opportunity to touch another life."  And I thought, ouch.  There are still here a handful of professors who show up, or I say who have a, you know it's a closet opening, they all come back.  They came when I came, they came back.  My psychology professor, my speech professor reminding me of who they were and what a difference they made in my life.  And it was faculty, some of the administrators.  But the connect with the faculty, deep and abiding.  And I felt it this week because of the students who are graduating, you know they honor me to say, could you write me a reference, and I have a rule that I will do ten.  But you need to know me, I need to know you.  So we have to have had proximate relationship.  So they're coming back this week.  I got a full ride at Marquette [Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], I'm going to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  But that you are as engaged in the lives of these young people and to see them take the next step, that's a powerful piece.  And I had that when I was here at Fisk.  T.S. Currier [Theodore S. Currier], I was a history major, who was also the major professor of [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin.  And Ted, believe me we didn't call him that to him, but you were allowed to call him T.S. during class.  Ashes all down his little vest, went to Harvard, and he gave John Hope Franklin the five hundred dollars to go to Harvard to start his master's [degree] in history that led to his Ph.D.  And if this man could have for fifty years touched lives so that I have the connection with John Hope Franklin whom I adore.  My line is that every intelligent woman over thirteen has a crush on John Hope Franklin, and you can count me in the legion.  He's brilliant and southern, loves women, and is a bit of a flirt at ninety-one.  But that we would all have that connection.  And here now you see the next generation of the great professors touching these kids, that I would share this young woman Lauren Parker's admission to Harvard with now the head of the history department [at Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Story_ID: 420690
Speaker 1: So you were reflecting on your student days at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] and comparing them to what's going on now at Fisk.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and I was--my insight is that there is still this deep involvement of faculty and administration and the lives and comportment of the kids.  And I think it's a heavier burden today because they come with -- I'm just talking of my own sense of rebellion.  But they come not understanding the boundaries.  So they need, they need attention but it can't be heavy attention.  And it's interesting, you don't see it, but we have a set of values at Fisk.  We celebrate diversity, excellence, teamwork, accountability, integrity, leadership and service.  And the reason we thought we should come up with the DETAILS, someone else pulled the acronym together, but we worked at settling on what our values would be, faculty, staff student.  So it's right there behind you, the DETAILS.  So you'll see signs hanging outside that say, "Our success is in the DETAILS."  Which is also an attention to being careful to ensure that you follow the steps with the course that you lay out for yourself and your plan.  But it is also to ensure that we model behavior, we don't just talk about the behavior.  But that we model it.  And so for these youngsters who now deal with their professors and the administration.  There is the same involvement in their lives and the celebration of their victories, or you know, I don't want you to think it's all, as the kids would say, it's all good because sometimes it's a rough and rocky road.  My first year here the head of the student government association got kicked out because she was on social probation for having a fight over something having to do with a Greek letter or whatever.  And here is the bright kid with not enough discipline, I mean I don't even understand it, you know, two women going at it.  And she was tremendously embarrassed.  And I said to her, you have but one thing to do here.  You will be on--she was on social probation for the entire year.  I said you have but one thing to do here.  You need to earn a 4.0 [grade point average] each semester and get yourself to law school.  And you can come to me and talk about it.  And then I told her, now they all know, I said but it's not so hard to stay in the dorm all semester, I've done it.  And what you have to do is understand that this passage can be ugly or you can make something out of it.  And so to continue, there are great teachers who are engaged in and involved in their students, who take the time.  I talked early on about going down to admission because you know the students will be there.  The so-called administrators who are involved, engaged and they will come to wherever they find simpatico and interest to seek help or seek advice.  Or sometimes all because they were in trouble.  And that's the glory of the small liberal arts black school [HBCU].  We're not tolerate--we don't tolerate our kids.  We don't tolerate each other.  We talk about the Fisk family, it exists and you know, you might talk about each other on this campus, but you don't leave here not doing anything other than lifting the kids who are here.  And it's a great experience.  There are nine hundred and I think fifty-six students here.  By the time we get to next year, I will know all of their names.  I mean, I mark the class I came in with, I came in a week before the class of 2008.  So I'm a sophomore, I'm a sophomore this year, I'll be a junior--no I'm a junior this year.  I'll be a senior next year, that's my class.
Story_ID: 420691
Speaker 1: How many students were here [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] when you started?
Speaker 2: You know I cannot remember.  I'm thinking there probably were five hundred.  The dining room was in the basement of Jubilee Hall, now we have a dining facility.  Jubilee Hall, Scribner Hall, Old Livingstone Hall was the men's dormitory, it was Bennett Hall.  I knew everybody on this campus, we knew everybody at Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  We did not know the people at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--yeah so Nashville [Tennessee] was interesting cause you've got Meharry, Fisk, and Tennessee State and Fisk are like--they're down Jefferson Street from each other.  Well you said that you were very--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is very interesting.  I think some of the young women shopped for their, as my mother [O'Leary's stepmother, Mattie Ross Reid] would want to me call, beaus, down there at TSU.  It was then just Tennessee State but I mean this was Fisk, man, you know.  Private school, touched by Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois], Horace Mann Bond.  Oh no way.  Yeah, American Baptist, okay.  The preachers are coming out of there and that's a good thing.  It was definitely implied and real--I don't think I ever set foot on Tennessee State's campus the entire time I was here.
Speaker 1: Not for any reason.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  It was all happening right here.  It's in that sense changed--I mean I go up there now because Melvin Johnson is my colleague.  Because they share and his family, the Johnson family, the Charles S. Johnson family, the first Negro president of Fisk, who was my president interestingly enough.  When I got here I found a wire on the wall in what was then the president's house, which is now the Race Relations Institute [Fisk University Race Relations Institute].  It said, "Charles S. Johnson, professor at Fisk University.  Rumor here--."  It was from the editor of the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News].  "Rumor here in New York is that you are to be the first Negro president of Fisk University.  Stop.  Let me know by return wire if this is true.  Stop.  We intend to write the story.  Stop."  It was hanging on the wall in like a fifty-cent frame.  I immediately scooped it up and took it over to our special collections.  But imagine in the history of Fisk those many years to have finally, you know, have the trustees understand and see it was time for a black president.
Story_ID: 420692
Speaker 1: What was Charles Spurgeon Johnson [Charles S. Johnson] like?  I mean--
Speaker 2: He was the most distant--their house, a beautiful Queen Anne mansion by my standards, juxtaposed on the right hand side walking toward Jubilee Hall was there and we never saw him.  And the difference in terms of the availability of the leader has turned dramatically.  I mean, I wouldn't want to be here if I couldn't be engaged with the students.  But no, he was a distant person.  Though at opening convocation this year, you know I had unearthed the Fisk Woman, and my provost said, "Well is there a Fisk Man?"  I go, "Good Lord, no one cared what the men did."  You know, lock up the virgins.  At any rate we struggled to try and find some writing for the entering freshmen who had now been through orientation, their opening convocation, it's also Scholar's Day so the people have honors, names are called, big deal.  Set the pattern, what do you want to be?  You want to be one of these kids?  We found, no, back house in special collections found a talk that Charles Spurgeon Johnson did at an opening convocation.  And it begins, "I was distractedly walking from my house to wherever and someone called my name, 'Dr. Johnson, Dr. Johnson.'  I turned around, it was a young man.  I was very distracted and did not really want to speak with him.  He said to me, 'Dr. Johnson, I have a question for you.  I keep hearing this term Fisk family, the Fisk way.  What does that mean?'"  And then he goes on to express the idea.  You are family because you have been chosen to be here.  You chose us, we chose you.  We care more about you than Greek letter organizations.  We care about your deportment, we care about your behavior.  A very contained, controlled kind of person who had little congress with his students, but gave this eloquent opening convocation speech about what it meant to be a member of the Fisk family.  And he was spot on and nothing has changed today.  You may belong to a Greek letter organization, but your sorority and fraternity mates do not come before the Fisk family.  We expect comportment.  We expect your best academic effort, but very formal.  You would hear from him on formal occasions.  Highly revered, respected.  I mean the Race Relations Institute [Fisk University Race Relations Institute] was coming off of the high of Brown v. the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  Much of the work done to undergird the sociological examination of the harm done by segregation was done right here at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] and at Atlanta U [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  So we all understood before we got here and certainly once we got here, that Charles S. Johnson with his Race Relations Institute had set the course for a Nashville [Tennessee] that appears in many ways to be much more liberal and less harsh and certainly other cities in the South and certainly the outlying sections of Lebanon [Tennessee] and Pulaski [Tennessee] where the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] was born.  So he was, he was the first, he validated all of us as Negroes, and he had a rich enough sense of the need to collaborate to make this campus a haven for people of various races and experience to come to Fisk, to work on, to discuss these issues.  And to finally make things happen.  Which is what I say again to the kids.  I don't want your research that's not going to change something.  I don't want you smart and not using it for the betterment of somebody larger than your own family.  That's the Fisk history.  But given to us in a very different way than today.
Story_ID: 420693
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What sort of people came in from the outside to speak to the students when you were here?
Speaker 2: Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Was that during the height of the Montgomery Bus Boycott?
Speaker 2: It was both before and after.  Last time he was here, it's so interesting, I was with [HistoryMaker] John Lewis.  He's a Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] graduate as well.  God, I love John Lewis.
Speaker 1: Was he on campus when you were on campus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I don't remember him.  I tell you who I do remember.  I remember [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry.  I remember Diane Nash.  I don't remember John Lewis.
Speaker 1: What was, what was--well keep going.  I don't want to stop you.
Speaker 2: No, go on.
Speaker 1: But with those two, so many people are surprised that Marion Barry was part of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  I guess the media--you know I think people don't know where he came from.  What was he like at the--
Speaker 2: He was a grad student first of all, and he was a chemistry major, and he didn't go to Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  You know what I mean?  We're--the women are a little older so we're not really playing with the little boys at Fisk.  There were single men over at the medical school, and much older.  I probably shouldn't have said that, I didn't say this.  But that's the truth.  I knew Marion through his major professor, Sam Massie [HistoryMaker Samuel Massie] who taught me chemistry.  Now understand I left in '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: Samuel Massie was here teaching chemistry in those days?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  The man who was part of the Manhattan Project.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and who was the chair of the chemistry department, and that was--and he taught chemistry.
Speaker 1: Head of the National Science Foundation.
Speaker 2: Yeah, with his wife Gloria Massie [Gloria Thompkins Massie], they were at Fisk.  And so Robert Hayden who became the poet laureate of the United States of America, taught me poetry.  Aaron Douglas was my art teacher.
Speaker 1: Robert Hayden, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Middle Passage' [Robert Hayden] phase, yes.
Speaker 2: So back to these, these people in the movement.  They were beginning to talk and organize.  The work got rolling in '60 [1960] in earnest.  And as I look back on it, I say to myself, I can remember sitting around the dormitory.  I mean you really want to go downtown and sit on a lunch counter and have a bunch of white people spit on your coat, spit in your face, burn your hair?  And the answer among my little crowd was I really don't think so.  And then there was some people were going for training to check it out.  And I have a clear recollection of the people who were committed when I left and know them today, and of that number, it is Marion Barry.  And I'm thinking what I know about Marion Barry I now know is anecdote.  I mean he makes a big impression on me to say while people are being expelled from their colleges and universities, Sam Massie went downtown to get his kids when they got out of jail and told them not to worry about the assignments that they missed.  No one talked about expelling students at Fisk who had participated.  That speaks well for Fisk, very well for Fisk.
Speaker 1: Was Charles Spurgeon Johnson [Charles S. Johnson] then--he was the president then?
Speaker 2: He was dead by then, he died in '56 [1956], yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was dead by then, okay.
Speaker 2: Steve Wright [Stephen J. Wright] who subsequently went to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] was the president, Stephen Wright was president.
Story_ID: 420694
Speaker 1: Did you know James Lawson?
Speaker 2: Yeah I knew Jim Lawson.
Speaker 1: James Bevel [HistoryMaker Reverend James Bevel], was he in town then?  I don't know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he was--I think, what, he was American Baptist?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He married Diane Nash who was here, yeah.
Speaker 1: And Diane Nash who I think so many people don't know about, who was--
Speaker 2: You know what we're trying to do with Diane?  First of all Diane never graduated from Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  She went directly from the Freedom Rides to SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and my sense is that Fisk didn't do right by her.  So when I got back, I'm asking, "Well where's the honorary degree for Diane Nash?"  And they go, "Well she never graduated."  And I say, "And the problem would be?"  Oh you have to have--well we all know I say bad words.  And I said, "Oh, no, no, this is going to happen."  And I spent a year working the piece.  She's going to get an honorary degree in May.  And when I told her I was going to do it, she didn't believe me, she didn't believe me.  And I saw her last month, Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee] paid for that, Freedom Ride 2007, but we do the kickoff here at Fisk and we went on the bus.  We actually retrace the steps of the first Freedom Ride with all of the icons on four buses, it's mostly kids.  And on the way we exchanged some of the leaders so that the kids got on their bus to hear everyone tell their stories which was, it was--and the interesting thing is I was on the cusp of this but I wasn't in it.  So I got to tell Diane then, "Hey you know, you're going to be busy on the 7th of May?"  And she goes, "I don't know, why?"  I said, "We're gonna give you an honorary degree."  She said, "You are?"  I said, "No, Fisk is."  I said, "Don't you remember when I saw you last year?"  She said, "Yeah but, you know, people tell you things."  I said, "No I was serious about this."  But here's what I want for Diane.  She, there's a book in her.  There's a book in Diane Nash.  I would like her to come to Fisk to do her research here, to teach some seminars and work with some research assistants and get that book done.  And we're emailing each other about that now.  Her mother [Dorothy Bolton Nash] is very ill and she's in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Right, we have tried to arrange to interview her in Chicago and I've been unsuccessful.  She said she's writing a book, that was years ago.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's still writing it.  But she needs research support, which is what everybody else has, and she needs to be paid so that she can write the book.  And oh by the way, wouldn't it be a great idea if we worked on finding her a publisher.  She is overlooked, under celebrated and what I saw of Diane that weekend with our kids, is that my grandmother, my mother [O'Leary's stepmother, Mattie Ross Reid] would have been proud of her.  She's a lady, never raised her voice (unclear) curse words like I do.  She is the perfect role model of the selfless individual.  You probably haven't seen it--but this is the glory of being at Fisk, you know, you can dip your hand in and find something.  But there is this PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] piece on 'Eyes on the Prize,' and it shows Diane in downtown Nashville [Tennessee] with Mayor West [Ben West].  And she takes him through this teratology.  Do you believe that man is moral?  Do you believe that men are free?  What she told our students when they did the panel in our chapel, she had just in her psychology class, philosophy class, I'm sorry, discussed the teratology.  She used what she had just learned to bring Mayor West to say as a moral man, I believe it is not right.  Is that just a powerful--
Speaker 1: The value of education applied.  That's what it is.
Speaker 2: And for her to be bright enough to figure I know this.  I'll use it today.  And there she is this little baby, Mayor West do you believe--wham, wham, wham, wham.  I learned it that week in class.
Story_ID: 420695
Speaker 1: Here's the other thing.  As I've been through this season of revisiting.  I mean I talked about the play 'Ordinary People' [ph.], and then we had all these civil rights giants back on campus, plus the guy who wrote the book on the Freedom Riders.  And this is the current chair of the history department would say and I'm so--not meaning to offend you, I am so sick of white folks interpreting our movement and so I talked to the current chair of the history department, Reavis Mitchell [Reavis L. Mitchell, Jr.] and Linda Wynn, who's also a commissioner for the Tennessee Historic Society [sic. Tennessee Historical Society, Nashville, Tennessee].  And I go, "If we can get Diane [Diane Nash] here and made it possible for her to get this book written," and I mean it goes a step further.  And we began to teach, not as an academic exercise, but as a way to live, nonviolence.  Could we not teach our students that there is a better way?  You know I talked to you about my first SGA [student government association] president they unseated for doing an--I think that's utterly outside my experience.  But if we would teach this on campus.  We would go to the junior high schools and teach to affect, to affect behavior.  Would that not be a bigger gift coming out of a legacy that we're so proud to talk about that lies there.  That's what happened to me over the past month.  And I've, you know, been, been pitching it and we've got a team of people to put it together.  So I see Diane's book, we supported her book, we supported teaching nonviolence.  Not as a mere academic discipline, but as a way of life.  Empowering our young people to solve problems today.  Not telling them what to do.  Giving them the tools to make their own decisions.  And if that weren't enough, let's get all of this ephemera that comes out of the Civil Rights Movement and Nashville [Tennessee] and enrich our special collections.  Now we're talking, now we're talking.  I'm thinking, you know, really big here, really big, yeah.
Speaker 2: So okay when you--so back to--
Speaker 1: You want me to tell you about the past, I want to tell you about the future.
Speaker 2: But this is good.  What you said--I'm glad you said that.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's hot stuff.
Speaker 2: That's wonderful and it links up to a lot of discussions we've had in this series of interviews about the Civil Rights Movement.  With [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni, she talked about being at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], you know.
Speaker 1: She's coming back to teach.  Did she tell--when did you talk to Nikki?
Speaker 2: That was three years ago.
Speaker 1: Oh wow honey, I got Nikki.  I said, "You need to come to Fisk."
Speaker 2: We talked to James Bevel [HistoryMaker Reverend James Bevel], [HistoryMaker] James Forman.  We haven't talked to James Lawson.
Speaker 1: He's here, you know.
Speaker 2: Is he here now?
Speaker 1: He's at Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: He's in California.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what they did?  They had him here for a year, it's a mea culpa.  They kicked him out of Vanderbilt.
Speaker 2: So he's here at Fisk?
Speaker 1: He's up the street where the rich folks are (laughter).  But he's extremely available to everybody.  He's spoken at Fisk twice.  He's being honored this month by the OI--Reverend Sullivan's [Leon Sullivan] group.
Speaker 2: OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And he has made himself available to everyone.  But they are--they're saying forgive us, taking this great man who Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] calls the best preacher you ever heard.  And the greatest teacher of nonviolence, and kicked him out of Vanderbilt.  And that is the contrast as between what happened at Fisk.  We nurtured our kids and sent them on.

Speaker 1: So when you were here, you were--things are getting ready to jump off, but (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Things were getting ready to pop, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did--was [HistoryMaker] David Levering Lewis here when you were here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a senior as I came in as a freshman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This past year at commencement, we also have a reunion weekend.  This fifty year class I knew.  They were my role models.  And I--you know you do a little talk cause there's a scholarship thing.  And I told them how happy I was 'cause I know you, that you were my role models.  Adrienne Lash [Adrienne Lash Jones] I wanted to be like.  She was brilliant, a lady, beautiful.  There was another, Quay Whitley [ph.], who's now Quay Whitlock, another brilliant, elegant--if I could have melded the two of you, it would be what I would want to be.  And then I just went through the class.  But yeah, I remember them all.  But they were the kids to be looked up to, yeah, and I said, "No one in this room knows who I had my first Fisk crush on," and then I called the person's name.  And the laughter just went, you know, rippled across the audience and they were patting him on the back.  Of course he's now on a cane and can barely move.  But yeah that was a good thing.  So yes I remember that entire class, all of them, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now what was your major?
Speaker 2: I majored in history and economics.  T.S. Currier [Theodore S. Currier], the teacher of [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin, was my guy.  And I knew Jim Lawson [James Lawson].  Vivian Henderson [Vivian Wilson Henderson] taught economics.  He went on to--I can't remember if he was president of Clark Atlanta [sic. Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  Yeah, he was a great teacher.  A great teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, who else?
Speaker 2: I think I ran them for you.  Told you about Robert Hayden.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Aaron Douglas, the Jubilee Singers [Fisk Jubilee Singers] were hot.
Speaker 1: That was John Work [John Wesley Work III] was here then?
Speaker 2: No, I'm trying to think.
Speaker 1: That must have been Kennedy [HistoryMaker Matthew Kennedy] then.
Speaker 2: Yeah it was Matthew, Matthew showed up while I was here.  I knew his wife Anne Gamble [Anne Gamble Kennedy] and the daughter, what is her name.  Nina [Nina Kennedy], yeah who's done a movie on Matt.  We gave him an honorary degree last year.  I'm just doing it all.  They wouldn't give him an honorary degree.  I'm like, what is wrong with y'all?  And when it happened the students, they cheered, they were so happy.  What is wrong with you?  If we can't celebrate and lift up our own.
Speaker 1: So you seem to be in the right spot at the right time.
Speaker 2: Well you know, and come with an--not an attitude, but an opinion about how we should be treating each other.  And I don't, you know I don't know what, whatever it was all about.  Whatever it was.  This is a great man.  And here's another one.  Any time you have something at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], Matthew is here.  And of course we accord him, or Paul Kwami does.  Whenever he shows up, he directs the singing of the alma mater.  And he always does it like, and I go, "Oh, Matthew, you know you have that baton."  And he's beloved by the students.  He was the second person to take the Jubilee Singers to Europe.  He's part of our history.
