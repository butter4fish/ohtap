Speaker 1: About four.  That would be 1932.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And That's you?
Speaker 1: Do you want me to say something now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're recording.
Speaker 1: Okay.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Yes.
Speaker 1: That picture is of Earl Langdon Neal as a young man about four years old--four years of age which would be approximately 1932.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Do you know where it was taken?
Speaker 1: That was taken in the City of Chicago [Illinois] at a--a professional photographer and I wonder in my own mind whether he was an African American and I don't know that.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Great.
Speaker 1: Should I put this right here, Scott, okay?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a picture of [HM] Isobel [Neal], my son, Langdon, and myself on our boat, cruising in Florida.  That's my real escape and my real love still, is boating and that's our boat and we were cruising together.  And that would have been about maybe seven years ago so that would have been about 1995, in Florida, where we keep the boat--where we kept the boat at that time.
Speaker 1: Now, this is done for archival purposes, I didn't explain everything to you.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But if you would just spell for the archivist your wife's name-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and Langdon's name.
Speaker 2: Langdon, my son, is L-A-N-G-D-O-N, Langdon, "D", as in David, which David is his middle name, Neal, N-E-A-L and my wife [HM] Isobel [Neal], spelled I-S-O-B-E-L, "H" as in Hoskins, her maiden name, H-O-S-K-I-N-S, Neal and I'm there--there's Earl Langdon Neal.
Speaker 1: That is a photo taken in 1981 when my son graduated from the University of Illinois Medical--Law School and on the left is my son, Langdon Neal, and on the right was the then President of the Board of Trustees, whose name is (laughter)--hold on just a moment.  He's a lawyer from Southern Illinois--it's not Bill Forsyth.  Bill Howard, H-O-W-A-R-D, William Howard.  His father was also a lawyer in southern Illinois in a city in southern Illinois--is President of the Board of Trustees and is congratulating Langdon on receiving his JD degree.
Speaker 2: And that again is Earl Neal on the left and my son, Langdon Neal, on the right as he is graduating from Harvard - St. George [School] in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] from grammar school.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Year?
Speaker 2: That would have been in 19--let's see--when would grammar school be?
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Let's see, he's forty-five, so he would have finished grammar school about eleven-
Speaker 1: Oh, he finished in eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Yes, so it would be about--well he would have been--he would have been about--he was between twelve and thirteen, so we'll say thirteen, plus he was born in '57' [1957] so it would be '69' [1969].  The picture would have been taken about 1969.
Speaker 1: That is a picture of our son, Langdon Neal, again.  He is about one year of age, if that, and the picture was taken in Chicago, Illinois and that's about it.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: That is a special occasion which would have been about--I would say about ten years ago when I was Chairman of a fundraiser for the Catholic Archdiocese, although [HM] Isobel [Neal] and I are not Catholic and in the middle was Cardinal--who's the one who preceded George?
Speaker 1: Bernardin [Joseph Cardinal Bernadin].
Speaker 2: Yeah Cardinal Bernardin.  And that picture would be about ten years ago, I'd say about 1992.  I am on the left and let's see if I can identify some of the others.
Speaker 1: You want to look at the monitor, it's right next to-
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  We'll go from left to right.
Speaker 2: Left to right.
Speaker 1: On the left would be Earl Neal, next to him--next to me, I believe is Shirley Ryan, it looks like Pat Ryan, next -- of Aon, next is Cardinal Bernardin, the next two on the right I do not recall--yes I do.  The first one on the right I don't recall but next is Mrs. O'Connor, then of Commonwealth Edison and the next is O'Connor, who was then the Chairman-
Speaker 2: Is that Bill O'Connor?
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't Bill, it wasn't Pat, it's [James] O'Connor who was a chairman.  Remember he was in everything.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the next is my wife, [HM] Isobel Neal.
Speaker 2: The next picture was a fundraiser when President [William J. Clinton, Bill] Clinton was running for his second term.  I'll have to let you figure--pull out that year, would be his campaigning for his second term and on the left is [HM] Isobel Neal, my wife, in the middle is Hilary Clinton and she was here at a fundraiser and the fundraiser was given at [HM] Elzie Higginbottom's house who was a black developer in Chicago [Illinois] and then I'm on the right.
Speaker 1: Can you spell Higginbottom for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, H-I-G-G-I-N-B-O-T-T-O-M, first name Elzie, E-L-Z-I-E.
Speaker 1: What is this picture?  Do you have clips?  Do you have a-
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Yes.
Speaker 1: --First Federal Savings and Loan Association and it was a civic outreach dinner that we had.  Would have been in the year 1984 and on the left--to the left is my wife, [HM] Isobel [Neal], I-S-O-B-E-L, Neal and I'm on the right and I was then Chairman of First Federal Savings and Loan Association.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  I would say, if you can, still use the taped box with the large photos that way if there's anything good on the bottom, the clips don't protrude into the images.
Speaker 1: Does it fit?
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Usually it does.
Speaker 1: Okay.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Usually if they're curly, there's a problem.
Speaker 1: Okay.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Go ahead sir.
Speaker 1: That picture was taken probably at the--near the end of the first term of [Mayor] Harold Washington [Chicago, Illinois], which would have been about 1987, when he--when Harold Washington was Mayor of the City of Chicago [Illinois] and that was a reception that I participated in and I am shaking hands.  It is Harold Washington, mayor, on the left, I'm on the right and to the right of--to my right is Mrs. Clarke, Rosalee Clarke, who's the wife of Justice Clarke, who served as Supreme Court Chief [John Hessin] Justice for many years.
Speaker 2: And is Rosalee spelled, R-O-S-A-L-E-E?
Speaker 1: I believe.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  And Clarke is with a-
Speaker 1: C-L-A-R-K, I think with an "E".
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 1: How you bring back history.  That is a picture of Kappa Alpha Psi at the University of Illinois at Champaign, Illinois, at our fraternity house at 707 South Third Street.  I do not remember all of the names but I will say that I'm in the middle of the front row, right in the middle, I was in Polemark of Kappa Alpha Psi, which would have been in 1949.  To my immediate left was a person named Bill Tuggle, T-U-G-G-L-E.  Tuggle became a African art collector here.  He was an architect.  The others I can't recall all of their names.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  That's Mr. Tuggle, the man on our left?
Speaker 1: It would have been to my-
Speaker 2: Is that him?
Speaker 1: Yes, right.  That would be to your--yes the right of--the left of me-
VIDEOGRAPHER:  'You' is right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And you said you were with the Polemark?  Is that P-A-L-
Speaker 1: P-O-L-E-M-A-R-K, which is the President of the Beta Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi at that time.
Speaker 2: Oops.
Speaker 1: That is a picture--on my left is Isobel Neal, my wife, in the middle is Roland Burris and on the right--I'm on the right.  I was giving a fundraiser for [HM Senator] Roland Burris.  What year is that?
Speaker 2: That's February of 1991.
Speaker 1: So, February of 1981.
Speaker 2: Ninety-one [1991].
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-one [1991].  I guess [HM] Roland [Burris] was running for governor at that time.
Speaker 2: Not mayor?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  It was not mayor.  I wouldn't have been there (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right.  But he did run for mayor that one-
Speaker 1: Yes he did run for mayor at one time but I'm sure I didn't participate in that.
Speaker 2: I don't think that's necessary.
Speaker 1: Let me just-
Speaker 2: That is a picture, I would say, approximately 1976 when I was elected to the second term of the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois [Champaign-Urbana].  During those days you were elected on a statewide popular vote.  In the middle is John Corbally, who was then President of the University of Illinois, in the middle on the first row, the tallest person there.  And John Corbally, of course, became President of the MacArthur Foundation when he resigned from the University of Illinois [1979].  All of the others are fellow trustees of the University of Illinois and principal officers.
Speaker 1: Now Corbally is spelled, C-O-R-
Speaker 2: C-O-R-B-A-L-L-Y, John Corbally.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Hold on one second please.
Speaker 2: Sorry.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, go ahead.
Story_ID: 71759
Speaker 1: The next is a picture which is a--truly a sense of history.  To the left is Renault, R-E-N-A-U-L-T, Robinson.  I'm in the middle.  [HM] Renault Robinson was then the Executive Director of the Chicago Housing Authority [Illinois].  I was then Chairman of one of the Boards of the Chicago Housing Authority, at the time, and we're conducting a public meeting.  That was a true sense of history since many years ago I defended the City [Chicago, Illinois] in the police discrimination case where [HM] Renault Robinson broke all history in really bringing about a truly integrated police department that never would have happened without him.  I have the utmost respect for [HM] Renault Robinson.
Speaker 2: That is--that picture was taken in 1970 when I was running for the University of Illinois Board of Trustees.  And to my right is Adlai Stevenson III.  And--and you can see we're both having a bit of a discussion.
Speaker 1: Now what was the--what was that on you think that you were discussing-
Speaker 2: We were probably wondering why he didn't get out more and campaign (laughter).  I won that election, incidentally.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of--truly of my mentor who started me in politics.  To the left is Colonel Kenneth E. Campbell, C-A-M-P-B-E-L-L, who was Committeeman of the 20th Ward in the City of Chicago [Illinois].  He was a very powerful alderman and a strong committeeman and Congressman [William] Dawson's right-hand person, although Congressman Dawson said that everyone was his right-hand person.  Next to Colonel Campbell is my wife, [HM] Isobel [Neal], and next to Isobel is a person I don't know.  And to the right is [Representative] Cecil Partee, who was President of the Senate in the State of Illinois and also became attorney general for a period of time--or state's attorney for a period of time.
Speaker 2: Did Kenneth Campbell ever serve in the State Legislature?
Speaker 1: Campbell-
Speaker 2: Campbell-
Speaker 1: --no he did not.
Speaker 2: He did not, okay.
Speaker 1: That is a picture--on my left--on my extreme left, behind [Mayor] Harold Washington, let me think, is a famous--was a radio person, so well-known, I'll think of his name later.  Next is Mayor Harold Washington, where we were celebrating his birthday.  That would have been about 1984, right after he was elected and [HM] Isobel [Neal] and I--Isobel is to my far right and we are opening a gift that we had for [Mayor] Harold Washington.  It was probably his most successful fundraiser.  We gave that in a small restaurant on the Near North Side [Chicago, Illinois].  He had an affair later that day at Navy Pier which probably brought out five thousand to twenty thousand person and they lost money but at this affair we raised the money for him and I always laugh about that.
Speaker 2: I don't know about that--okay.
Speaker 1: On the left, that's Earl Neal on the left, next is Mrs. Hartigan, H-A-R-T-I-G-A-N.  Next to her is my wife, [HM] Isobel [Neal] and to the right is Neil Hartigan, who was then running for Attorney General, who was actually the person who started Langdon [Neal] in his second career in the election process.  He appointed Langdon at a young age in, oh, I would say when he was maybe twenty-five, to the State Board of Elections [Illinois].  He was then Attorney General, was the highest ranking Democrat in the office.
Speaker 2: That is a picture of--yes--okay-
Speaker 1: Oops.
Speaker 2: --with my son Langdon on the left, to the next is the Chief Judge, Judge Comerford, next to him is [HM] Arnette, A-R-N-E-T-T-E, Hubbard and to the right is--I'm on the right.  And that was my son--was being appointed as Chairman of the Chicago Board of Elections [Illinois] which would have been approximately ten years ago or a little less than that.  It would have been approximately 1995.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That's a--the next is a wonderful family shot when I was running in 1970 for the Board of the University of Illinois and no one had ever had a major fundraiser when you ran for the Board of the University of Illinois as a non-paying job.  To my left is--to the left is [HM] Isobel [Neal], next is my son, Langdon.  The year would have been 1970.  I am there next--next is my mother, Evelyn S. Neal and next is my father, who was then a judge, Judge Earl J. Neal.
Speaker 1: That is a photo that I am most proud of.  We gave a--to the left is the Olympic medalist, Ralph Metcalfe, who was also a committeemen in the Third Ward of the City of Chicago [Illinois] and was one of the real sponsors of [Mayor]Harold Washington.  Kneeling is my son, Langdon, and then is my wife, [HM] Isobel [Neal], and I'm on the far right.  I gave an affair in Washington Park for the kids.  Would have been, oh, probably in the--would have been in the '70s' [1970s].  And we had a swimming meet in Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois]and Ralph Metcalfe came out to give the prizes and, of course, we as a family sponsored the affair and brought the kids from Washington Park.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Let's first talk about them.  Do you want both of them?
Speaker 1: We can do both of them.  I see.
Speaker 2: Okay.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  The top.
Speaker 2: The top was when I was chairman of the annual affair for the National Basketball Association.  Irv Kupcinet is on my left and I was--we were presenting to Irv Kupcinet an award and to the bottom, I don't know who was on the left but I'm in the middle and the next is Irv Kupcinet.  And that year would have been about 1985, approximately.
Speaker 1: Oh, wait, did you do?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  I did both.
Speaker 2: Okay, thanks.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  We got descriptions of both.
Speaker 2: Sorry, I missed some.
Speaker 1: The next is a very recent picture when I received the--an award of the Paul Stevens Award, the Supreme Court Justice Award, and about five of us received the award last year.  That would have been 2001 and that I'm congratulating Judge Prentice, P-R-E-N-T-I-C-E, Marshall, who was a federal judge, then retired, that he was also a recipient of the Justice Stevens Award.  The sense of history is that Pren[tice] Marshall was the presiding judge in the case involving the [HM] Renault Robinson or the "African American Patrolmen's Association versus the City of Chicago" [Illinois].  He was the presiding federal judge and I was a lawyer representing the City and we tried that case together, or against one another, or in the same courtroom, for about two years.
Speaker 2: The next is an award that I received from the Urban Health Association.  To my left is Dr. Leon Dingle, who was a consultant who was very helpful to me at the Urban Health Program.  The Urban Health Program was a program I started at the University of Illinois to attract minorities to the University of Illinois College of Medicine and as a result, I don't want to say as a result, but as a--one of the factors in the University of Illinois graduating more minorities in any other university other than Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington D.C.] was this program which was an outreach program to reach minority students.  It was an award I received when I resigned after twenty years of that program in approximately 2000.  Next is the President of the University, I'll think of his name, he's still President, it's, anyway--then I'm there and I don't remember the names of the others.
Speaker 1: Okay, she looks familiar.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they all look familiar but I can't remember their name.
Speaker 1: That's not significant.
Speaker 2: Okay, it's not, okay.  Well, we don't--you know I--let's take this-
Speaker 1: All right, that's a picture of Earl Neal, presiding over some affair.
Speaker 2: Are there any other pictures that-
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Do you know the approximate date?
Speaker 2: The approximate date of that would be recent.  That would be approximately '99' [1999].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any others that you-
Speaker 2: No, those are the only ones that we picked out that we thought were significant.
Speaker 1: Okay, I want you--oh wait, how about your boat.
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know whether you need-
Speaker 1: --that is, yes, the name is interesting.  That is a boat that I purchased in 1990 and I still have it.  It's our family getaway and one where I escape from the pressures of the day.  The boat is docked in the Bahamas.  We spend a lot of time there.  The name of the boat is Yemanja, Y-E-M-A-N-J-A, which is Goddess of the Sea.  It is a Brazilian tradition where the people throw flowers and food to the Goddess of the Sea and the Goddess of the Sea, Yemanja, represents all good things like fertility, love, sex and things of that kind (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's nice.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: We almost forgot this.
Speaker 1: Yes, that is a picture of my mother and father.  To the left is Evelyn S. Neal and my father, Earl J. Neal, who became a judge.  And that picture was taken in New York City when they went to New York to see Paul Robeson in "Othello" and which was a major event at the time to get to New York and have the money.  I don't know what year that would have been but I would estimate that it was in the '50s' [1950s].
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Paul Robeson and my father were very good friends.
Speaker 2: How did they meet?
Speaker 1: They met in New York when--
Story_ID: 71760
Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to get started and we're going to start by slating it all with, you know, we're just going to have a conversation, you and I-
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --and I'd like to start out, my name is Julieanna Richardson, I'm the videographer and Scott Stearns--I mean the interviewer and Scott Stearns is the videographer and I'd like you to start out by stating your name for us and spelling it.
Speaker 2: My name is Earl Langdon Neal, E-A-R-L, L-A-N-G-D-0-N, N-E-A-L.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I'd like to have your date of birth.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was born April the 16th, 1928.
Speaker 1: Okay, and today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is--is March the-
Speaker 1: May 30th.
Speaker 2: May 30th, 2002, May 30th, 2002.
Speaker 1: And I'd like to have our location.
Speaker 2: Location is in Chicago, Illinois.  It is our law firm, located at 203 North LaSalle Street, Suite 2300.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Can I adjust his tie a little bit?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can adjust his tie.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: And I'd like to have your profession.
Speaker 1: I'm an attorney at law, licensed to practice law, both in the State of Michigan and the State of Illinois.  I was licensed to practice in the State of Michigan in 1953, State of Illinois in 1955.
Story_ID: 71761
Speaker 1: Now I ask five questions of everyone, they're little People Magazine-ish-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but just short answers.  I'd like to know what your favorite food is.
Speaker 2: My favorite food is fried chicken.
Speaker 1: It's cute.  Okay, you don't look like a fried chicken-type of man (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: I guess so (laughter).  Okay, favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color is blue.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: It's now in South Carolina, a little island called Kiawah, K-I-A-W-A-H, which is about 25 miles outside of Charleston [South Carolina], where we have a small comfortable cottage, that we've been going to for the last eight years.  It's very quiet, very secure and very much out of the mainstream.
Speaker 1: And favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Favorite-
Speaker 1: Time of year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of year would be Spring.
Speaker 1: Favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite-
Speaker 1: Phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase would be, I don't have one.
Speaker 1: That's fine, me either.  But people reel them off like-(laughing) I think I need to go back and start recording all of those.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)I don't--I don't have one.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 71762
Speaker 1: --Okay.  We're going to start at--I wanted to start by asking you about your mother and if you could state her name and tell us what you know about she and her background.
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's name is Evelyn Smith Neal.  My mother was born in 1906, in the City of Chicago [Illinois] at Provident Hospital.  My mother graduated from a teachers college.  Then I think it was Wright Junior College, later it was a two-year program.  She taught school in the Chicago Public Schools for forty-three years.  During the last ten years, she was the first African American to teach in the Homebound Program, which was a program for handicapped children who were unable to attend school and she taught in the home, of the children, for about fifteen years and she was the only African American to participate in that program at that time.  It was during the time when education in Chicago [Illinois] was a lot different than it is now.  I am the only--I am an only child and she was married to Earl J. Neal, who was a lawyer and also a judge for ten years.
Speaker 1: Did your mother talk--what about her parents?  Were they--where were they from?
Speaker 2: Yes, her parents--the name was Emma, E-M-M-A, Smith.  She was born in Cincinnati, Ohio with some pride that her family was always free.  And her father was Smith and he was born in Alabama.  I want to say Montgomery, Alabama and his first name was Langdon C. Smith.  He was the first African American to sell insurance--going way back was Royal Insurance Company and then the depression hit and he was no longer involved in that.  And he wound up managing the estate of Maytag in Colorado where we spent most of our summers in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Speaker 1: So this was your grandfather-
Speaker 2: My grandfather.
Speaker 1: --on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side, yes.
Speaker 1: Did she talk at all about growing up?
Speaker 2: My mother, most of her time, was spent here in Chicago [Illinois].  They lived in Chicago [Illinois].  She attended the public schools in Chicago [Illinois].  Nothing was particularly significant in her young life except that she was a very good student and became a teacher.  But nothing--nothing particular in her young life did she talk about.
Speaker 1: Did she--what kind of person would you describe her?
Speaker 2: She was a very quiet, caring, kind person, very much interested in the growth and development of the children that she taught because for the last fifteen years, it was a one-on-one relationship.  She taught maybe seven to ten persons during any one semester so that she developed a good relationship with them.  Her friends were all school teachers and they spent time together.  This was either--you're either a school teacher or you worked in the then-called Welfare Department if you were African American during that period of time.  It was also significant that there were no African Americans driving buses, driving the elevators, that all of the schools were segregated and it was a very different time but it was also a time of entrepreneurship and most--many of my mother's friends had restaurants or small businesses and were--and we thought then, independent at the time.  But she married quite young and I think she was probably nineteen or twenty when she married my father, Earl [J.] Neal.
Story_ID: 71763
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell us about your father?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father's life was much different from my mother's in that my father attended Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois] and then went to various colleges because when he was seventeen, his mother and father died so I know very little about my grandparents on my father's side.  But when they died, when he was about seventeen, he attended--he attended the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign], he attended the University of Minnesota where he had relatives who lived there at the time, and he attended the University of Chicago [Illinois] and then graduated from law school from, I think, the now Kent University [Chicago-Kent College of Law], it may have been called something else at the time.  But after his parents died, and he was about twenty-one, he went to New York and spent a couple of years enjoying New York City and among his friends, as we mentioned before, were Paul Robeson and many of the others during the period in the Harlem [New York] days when all were enjoying New York and I guess he enjoyed most of his inheritance, if not all of it, in New York City and then came back to Chicago [Illinois] and had to work as a Red Cap, which was at the train stations where he always talked about all the bags that he had to carry for about ten years as he went through law school and finished his education.
Speaker 1: Did he talk anything about growing up before his parents passed away?
Speaker 2: Very little except that he--he was the recipient of many awards.  He was--he wanted to be a scientist and a chemist, as a matter of fact.  And when he went to college, when he first went to college, he told them that he wanted to be in science and they asked him what he wanted to do, teach school, in the South, because there were no jobs for it.  And I think that was the most frustrating experience that he repeated often during my young life that it discouraged him from doing what he really liked.  And he had won many awards as a young high school student.  He was an outstanding student in chemistry and math and in that area but there was no place for him to go and that's when he turned and went into law school.  He was--his parents must have encouraged him because he was extremely well-read, classics, he was just--he read all the time.  But the same time his philosophy and my favorite quote was, "To be a gentleman is a steel [sic, iron] fist in a velvet glove" and I think that's my favorite quote that I couldn't remember before.  I got that from my father.  He was one who also encouraged me as a young man.  He said that you had to be able to sit with ladies at the bar and also walk with queens.  You had to be a total complete person.  And his other statement that stuck with me for many years was, "That it took three generations to make a gentleman" and those are some things I have recalled and I think now as I look at my son as he comes along and to see what he has grown and developed beyond what I was able to do.  My father, in sum, I would say he was a very frustrated African American.  He did not believe in the social clubs that you see in Chicago, The Snakes, the 40 Club.  He was a member of The Snakes, one of the original members, and he resigned because he said that we couldn't afford to do things like that.  That we should dedicate ourselves to business and to improving our state, to do civic activities, which is way ahead of his time.  And he didn't believe that we should spend our time applauding our meager achievements when we had achieved so little.  And that was his frustration through life.  As a matter of fact, it was--my mother and I had a hard time persuading him to become a judge because he felt that we should have done, as African Americans, so much more and to achieve more in terms of economic achievement and business that we weren't able to do.  So that he was, I would say, although it never showed, a very inner frustration from not being able to participate in the full scope of the opportunities that this country provides.  Although it was well hidden, he always shared that sum with me.  His hero was Paul Robeson and I guess he was my hero, as I grew up from learning from my father because of what he stood for.  He was, of course, a Muhammad Ali of the day (laughter).
Story_ID: 71764
Speaker 1: Now, okay, let's--I'd like to--do you know how your parents met?  Do you know how?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  It's interesting in that my father's best friend was my mother's brother and when my father's parents died, she--his mother, I think, had a business as a hairdresser and my father's father, I think, was--ran on the road or something equivalent to that.  And they left some money for him to go to college and whatever money they left, the small amount, was managed by my mother's parents.  And her brother was my father's best friend who her brother was, as he says, was one of the most brilliant men he knew, he did everything.  He said he was a boxer, he was a "A" student and they went to school at the University of Minnesota where my mother's brother contacted tuberculosis and he died and my father flew--I know, not flew there, went on a plane--a train, and brought his body back and then his sister, his little sister and my father became friends and they married after that.

Speaker 1: The other question I have for you, you have a lot of--it looks like Indian in you but I was wondering--is that-
Speaker 2: Our background, yes, yes, we do have Indian.  My father's--I'd say grandmother, was Indian and he recalled the days of visiting her.  They were in Kansas, Indians in Kansas, and she was on a reservation.  And he remembered visiting her and reminded me but she was Indian and my father inherited that side of the family.  And his mother looked very Indian, she was--really looked more like East Indian that she was a mixture of the two.  So, yes, that's where the Indian blood came from.
Speaker 1: Do you know what tribe, or?
Speaker 2: No I don't.  It was in Kansas and I should remember that but I don't.

Speaker 1: Now, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory was that we lived at 41st and Michigan, 4143 Michigan Avenue [Chicago, Illinois] and I had a number of friends who lived in the apartment building.  In fact, my grandparents owned the building.  It was a six-apartment building and they lost it during the depression.  And the family had a couple of the apartments and we lived there.  And I recall growing up there and going to, as I always joke and say I went to a private school, Forestville [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], which was, of course, the largest public school in the City of Chicago [Illinois] but my mother taught there at the time.  So I went there, to grammar school, and I remember the difficulties of growing up in a--in an African American or black, or as they said then, negro, neighborhood and totally negro community in that there were a lot of angry young boys who would seize upon those who might have little more opportunity so that you had to fight your way through home and generally throughout the school year.  It was very difficult.  The patrol boys, which you may remember at the time, wore the white--it was hard to even get someone to do it because the gangs would beat them up.  But the difference is that the gangs then might beat you up but the gangs were not infested with drugs and with knives and with guns and all of the things that they have now.  So you would think is a relatively calm period but to us it was not.  I remember grammar school, one of my closest friends, is a well-know musician now named Johnny Griffin, who played the saxophone.  And Johnny Griffin, who I've seen lately, we were both editors of the school paper at Forestville [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  And I remember when he played here in Chicago [Illinois] I took him a copy of the school paper when we were both about eleven.  And he got so tickled he couldn't play for about ten minutes.  He had to get off the stage.  But Johnny and I grew up together and I remember, although he swears I should never tell it, that he started playing the accordion but he said don't tell anyone.  And then he played the piano, this was about seventh grade.  And then he went home one summer and learned how to play the saxophone and then went on to the legend that he's become.  But we were probably the closest friends in--throughout grammar school and I now see him once a year when he comes to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: I want you to take you back to your time.  You lived at 4143 South Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] your whole growing up? Is that-
Speaker 2: Forty-one forty-three [4143] South Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] until I went to, about the time I went to high school, we moved south to Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois] at 6843 Champlain Avenue.
Speaker 1: Now-
Speaker 2: But I continued to graduate--it must have been my last year.  I still graduated from Forestville [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and then I went to Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois], although Parker High School was at 69th and Stewart and I lived at 68th and Champlain.  I went to Englewood [High School] which was at 62nd and Stewart because of the lines that they had drawn that I couldn't attend Parker [High School], and which I went there for a couple of days and they told me that I was outside of the district.  And because my mother and father worked for the [Chicago, Illinois] Board of Education, my father then was a truant officer and my mother was a teacher, they thought best not to challenge the system, which I regret to this day.
Story_ID: 71767
Speaker 1: Now, I want you to take yourself back to 4143 South Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] and I want you to just think back at that time and I'd like to know what sights, smells or sounds remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: What--growing up at 4143 South Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  The one thing out of African Americans I think that most of us miss is that we didn't know we were poor.  We didn't know that the housing situation was probably as bad as it is.  Ours was, of course, always by the standard of others very comfortable but, of course, as I look back, it was very meager but we had a strong family relationship and that my uncle lived there and he was one of the first post office persons to drive a truck and deliver mail in the Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] area because he could speak several languages and played the violin and was just--he never could--he could answer any question on a quiz show and the best job he could get was in the post office at the time.  It's things like that that I remember but we had such a close family relationship that I have nothing but happy memories of living in the area.  And, you know, I remember the ice persons up and down the alley.  I remember them selling the food up and down the alley and I remember doing it myself when I moved and got a little older.  And it was just a way of life.  I have no negative feelings about living there at all.  Or no negative feelings about Chicago [Illinois] at all.
Story_ID: 71768
Speaker 1: Now what--what was family life like? Was it-
Speaker 2: It was a very close family.  Although my mother and father worked most of the time, my mother was teaching school, my father was always working a couple of jobs and therefore they were out of the house a lot but we had dinner together, always, almost always, and we spent holidays together.  And then when I recall getting older, we spent summers together with my grandparents in Colorado, which was a total escape from the city of Chicago [Illinois], so it made my life different, which was another part of my life that's different than most African Americans growing up.  And that if I skip to that, my grandfather was managing the estate in Colorado Springs [Colorado], which was right outside of Broadmoor [Colorado], which was one of--at that time, was one of the richest communities in the United States.  And they had a home that was hidden in the hills that as far as you could see, you couldn't see another house and the deer would come in the yard and they lived on the estate.  And I grew up spending my summers there.  I would leave school in the spring and I would stay there and I played with--and my neighbors were the Maytag's of the Maytag washing machine company.  And we rode horses and we rode together.  And it was quite a few years before I got old enough to realize that I was different.  And I realized I was different when we'd go to a movie and I had to sit in the balcony.  And that I think was the beginning of some of my bitter experiences of the real life of being black in the United States and probably the determination to do something about it.
Story_ID: 71769
Speaker 1: Now did you--what was the young Earl Neal like?  Were you quiet?  Were you shy?  Were you rambunctious?  Were you-
Speaker 2: Well I would say--I would say that I would be a quiet, conforming person but I would say I was inhibited, I still think of that today, by my friends and that I was--school was not too difficult for me, say by comparison to others because I had a better background, a better training at home.  But I never wanted to make too good of grades because I thought that I would not be part of the group and therefore I wanted to make grades just high enough that wouldn't upset my parents but not too good where I would lose my friends.  And I think that was another inhibiting factor and that all my friends were not achieving for the goals that I should have been achieving for through high school.  And I really didn't get the challenge till I got to college and then I knew I had to do better.
Story_ID: 71770
Speaker 1: Now when you describe the gangs and, you know, were they beating you up?  When you-
Speaker 2: Oh, we used to have to run home, yes, from Forestville [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  Of course my father was truant officer and he would drive me home some and they knew that and that sort of thing.  And I managed to escape the brunt of it but we knew they were there and we knew we wanted to get home and hurry up and get on that street car to get where we were going.  And there were gangs called, "The Four Corners" and they controlled the area insofar as the young persons are concerned.  And they were still doing some of the things and threatening the businesses and--but that was a young life of Chicago [Illinois] where you didn't have--blacks didn't have any opportunity and you couldn't get on the police force.  I mean, you knew maybe two or three people on the police force.  The only policemen you knew black with pride was "Two Gun Pete", who controlled the 47th Street and, of course, he made his money, I'm certain, I don't know for a fact, but I'm sure the taverns and all, encouraged him to come by their place because there's never a problem when Two Gun Pete showed up.  He was a friend of my father's.  And the fact that policemen we looked up to them because there were so few because, obviously, we weren't qualified to be a policeman because we had flat feet.  And that was the incredible part of the number of police that were turned down and that was part of the lawsuit that we had many years later.  If you had flat feet you couldn't pass the exam to be a policeman.  Of course, a lot of blacks had flat feet, which was one of the excuses--which is an incredible.  And to think that no one could drive a street car or bus--black, is just an incredible deprivation of opportunity and people now wonder where we are.  Well, where could we have been without those opportunities.  So, that was--we grew up.  But as a young person, you weren't really aware of it.  As you look back now and-
Speaker 1: That's what I was going to ask you if you were really aware of-
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --you know of those things.
Speaker 2: No you weren't.  No, you were not aware of them as much as you should be.  Later we became aware in a very vocal sense.
Story_ID: 71771
Speaker 1: Now what was the--describe the neighborhood a little bit more, you know, were you--cause you say the family a lot of, you know, the people you knew a lot of families in the building-
Speaker 2: In the--in our building, we had--we, of course, we rented the building out for a period of time when we owned it and we were very careful.  So the building was safe, secure.  The neighborhood was one of older buildings, apartment buildings.  There were not a lot of homes and generally was a very comfortable neighborhood.  I have no ill feelings as I think back on it.  None at all.  And we played baseball in the lots and football in the lots and had fun.  We had to watch our bikes or they would be stolen but other than that there were no great problem.  So that I believe that blacks grew up in that area without the real illness of drugs that has permeated our society now.  Made it entirely different.  It's almost hard to understand now.  But in general, I don't think blacks were as--there was not such a dependency on welfare.  There was not a lot of welfare then and people were working.  And people were striving with little small businesses and I think we miss that today.
Speaker 1: A lot of people were also migrating into the city.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely, absolutely.  In 47th Street [Chicago, Illinois], and if I go back again, I remember it was the Regal Theatre and on a special occasion, my parents would take me to the Regal, we'd go to the movie and then we'd go to Joe's Chicken Shack and have chicken for the evening.  And across the street was a Metropolitan Theatre, which was at 47th and South Parkway [now King Drive, Chicago, Illinois] in those days.  And then down the street was the Jones Brothers, who were the great policy persons who were left, involuntarily from Chicago [Illinois], who were friends of my father's, had the--would have been the equivalent of a Woolworth Store then on 47th Street that everyone went to.  So there were persons of achieving that we knew.  Managers of the theaters were black, that we knew.  And--and the businesses up and down the street were primarily black-owned businesses.  I could remember the first place I went was the Palm Tavern.  My father took me as a young man and was just so interesting that today we represented the city when we acquired the Palm Tavern and when one of my lawyers went there, they said, "Earl, your picture's on the wall as a lawyer, that Jerry had saved as one of our memorabilia."  I said, "Well, I have a conflict of interest 'cause I certainly don't want to pay for that picture."  But in any event, it was a real pleasure to go there and there was a certain camaraderie and a certain feeling of pride that blacks had in those days and I think we miss that today.
Speaker 1: Okay we're going-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to change tapes.
Speaker 2: Yes, I thought so.
Story_ID: 71772
Speaker 1: Back--I want to--your father, did he--he never thought of medical school, you know?  Did he, I mean, I know you said-
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --he wanted to be a scientist.  I'm just, you know, science, I mean, science and law, they-
Speaker 2: Right, they're different.  No, I think that was--he did not think of medical school.  It was probably a financial restraint at that time and that he was able to go to law school and work and fit it in the schedule whereas medical school would have been more a full-time.  And I think that's why he migrated into law.  Whereas if, in the beginning, he had been encouraged to pursue it, he probably would have been invited to do it and would have undoubtedly gone into medical school.  So a lot of those were frustrations because of the lack of guidance from--from your teachers and your instructors--instructors at the time.  And he was very frustrated because of that.
Story_ID: 71773
Speaker 1: Now, you--what--what about religion in your family?  Did it play a role?
Speaker 2: No, religion played a relatively small part of our family although, as a young man, I attended Christian Science Church, although I'm not a Christian Scientist, totally, but I attended the--the--at 44th about and Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], was the Eighth Church and a lot of African Americans.  It was very crowded.  And it was the strength of the mind and the power of thinking and I still believe that to a great extent, although I go from Christian Science to [HM] Johnnie Colemon, where I go now to Christ Universal Temple and I always say it's a soulful Christian Science church.  And I enjoy that.  But, yes, we did.  And then we attended--we attended church, I believe, was a Reverend Evans at 64th, we had a church.  Most of the churches we attended were--was popular with the black community.  That we would go on holidays and things of that sort.  But, no, I did not have a very strong religious background, although we went to Sunday School on Sunday.
Speaker 1: Your father was more--that your family was more educated than sort of academically.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
Story_ID: 71774
Speaker 1: Now did you--how about politically involved was your--was your family--was there history of involvement with-
Speaker 2: Well, yes, they were involved--my father was involved in politics but really as a lawyer for many of the politicians who were all, of course, his very good friends because there were so few in those days.  So all of the politicians, from [William L.] Dawson to [Kenneth] Campbell to [Ralph] Metcalfe, all of them that you had named during that period, were good friends of my father's.  And he did legal work for them on the civil side.  There were not a lot of civil lawyers at that time.  Most were criminal lawyers because that's all you could do at that time and he didn't practice--very little criminal law so that he knew them all.  And then I grew up with him and I became the protege of Kenneth Campbell.  And as a result, I got to know [William L.] Dawson and all of the others very well, over the years, as a high school student where I was the outstanding graduate from high school, of Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois], and things of that sort.
Story_ID: 71775
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now, you went to elementary school, where?
Speaker 2: I went to Forestville Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: That's right, Forestville, and then that was until eighth grade?
Speaker 2: That was until eighth grade and then I went to Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois].  And then there was a debate as to whether I would go to the University of Minnesota or the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign] and the University of Illinois was less expensive and I went to the University of Illinois.
Speaker 1: I want to go back to Englewood [High School].  Englewood versus Parker [High School].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And at that time, I want to know, you know, what your interests were.  You know, you've already said that, you know, I was trying to just do enough-
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: --you know, to be accepted.
Speaker 2: My interest was in public speaking, primarily, and I was in a number of plays in school and involved in public speaking.  I was on the swimming team at the Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois].  Englewood [High School] was a large school, I would say, about two-thirds black, maybe one-third white or maybe three-fourths and one-fourth.  But you did have white students there.  A lot of the--because Englewood drew from the then Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois], which was the upper scale African Americans at the time, you did have a lot of families that you knew, and a lot of persons you knew going to Englewood High School, so that it was a--a good school, reasonably good.  Parker was a better school.  It was smaller, smaller classes, more white population, of course, which meant a better, more sophisticated family circumstance in competition so that--but Englewood--Englewood [High School] served me well.  Taught me how to get along with everyone.  And I think of all the things in life, I think Englewood, being an enlisted man in the [U.S.] Army, of things that turned and made me, gave me my drive to accomplish and overcome some of these hurdles that we have today, to overcome, was just an all-consuming drive which, if I fast forward, I would say to you that there--during, I would say, at least three-fourths of my professional career, I would go every evening, I would ask myself whether I have done everything that I could possibly do and the answer always was "no".  And I would leave in a blue funk because I had not worked hard enough.  And then I used to plan so that I could start working when the door closed, that I would have something on my mind or something I'd work on as I walked or took the transportation to the office.  And I was all-consumed because I didn't want to be poor and I guess even today, maybe, there's no reason for it.  I still worry about, am I going to be poor?  But I don't know.  I sometimes think of how my wife says, how maybe unrealistic that is, and yet I remember having a lunch with [HM] John [H.] Johnson who said, "So do I" and then I knew that it came from some background or something in my background that I wasn't actually crazy because if [HM] John [H. Johnson] can say that, then maybe I can say it with a lot more realism than he, of course.  But that's the result, I believe, of how we grew up and the frustrations that we have which worked both ways.  It works to drive to make you want to be successful, to figure ways of how--when you tried cases, how you can be more American than the jury.  You think how you could use being black to your advantage and to think of those things and to become, well, reasonably successful in doing it.  But I think it's that drive of deprivation, sometimes, that has made, not myself, but has made many of the blacks who had become leaders and have done all these outstanding things that they wouldn't have achieved other than they had the drive to get up earlier and to work later, which is something that is not talked about enough.
Story_ID: 71776
Speaker 1: Now I want to take you just back a little bit to-
Speaker 2: Uh-huh-
Speaker 1: --Englewood [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and the whole decision about Parker [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  Was that--was there much discussion about that in the family?  I know you said your parents-
Speaker 2: Yes, there was discussion.  I went to Parker [High School, Chicago, Illinois] because I wanted to go there.  I thought it was a better school, whether--I didn't know, but I just thought it was, and I went there and they told me I was in the wrong district.  And we talked some about it but not a lot because Englewood [High School] was not rated as a real poor school.  So they didn't have a lot and probably, I guess, rather than having verified it by something that my parents said, but knowing that they both worked in the [Chicago] Board of Education, they did not want to get involved in what was obvious discrimination-
Speaker 1: Now so your-
Speaker 2: --and gerrymandering.
Speaker 1: --your father was working in the-
Speaker 2: He was a truant officer-
Speaker 1: Okay. --he's working for the [Chicago] Board of Education for some period of time.  Now he became a lawyer in 1930 something, '35' [1935] or '36' [1936], so it was some time just prior to that or maybe while he was a lawyer for a while, or something of that sort, but he did work.  But my mother was in the Board of Education working at Forestville [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  I think Forestville at the time.
Speaker 2: So then you--so, okay, at Englewood [High School, Chicago, Illinois], you said you learned, you know--you really sort of learned survival in a way and you learned how to-
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --get along with people.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: And-
Speaker 1: I learned that in Forestville [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] first and Englewood [High School, Chicago, Illinois]was just a continuation of Forestville.  It was really an upscale from Forestville.
Speaker 2: Did you--and you said you were very good at public speaking.  Were there other things, activities, or things that you were involved in, that influenced you?  Were there teachers that, you know, had-
Speaker 1: No, I had no recollection of any teacher that really gave me the stimulus to do whatever I may have achieved now.  I was more of a sociable person, want to get along.  I was small at the time.  I was a year younger than most and I did not have--I didn't--there's no one who drove me to do what I have done or drove me to achieve and I think everything was a self-motivation.  Of course, my parents had a certain basic standard that I had to achieve and I would work all night or all weekend when I had to pull things up but it was not difficult to do and that was--whereas, as I think back, of course, I drove my son much harder.
Speaker 2: Because it came easy to you?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 71777
Speaker 1: Now when you--I know you said when you were--now you started working with [Alderman] Kenneth Campbell.  Was it in high school or was it in college?
Speaker 2: What was that?  I didn't-
Speaker 1: For [Alderman] Kenneth Campbell, when did you start?  Was that-
Speaker 2: Oh, [Alderman] Kenneth Campbell was an old family friend.
Speaker 1: Right, but you start working-
Speaker 2: But I became--I started working with the Democratic organization when I was in high school.  I gave my first major political speech when I was about fifteen, in a crowded auditorium about--so that I was involved in public speaking and he brought me along, I would say the end of high school and all through college.
Speaker 1: So what was that experience like?  And what did you learn?  I mean, you were a young--
Speaker 2: Oh, that was an important experience.  I learned people--and you said what is your favorite statement.  I think of things that [Kenneth] Campbell told me, one is my favorite, "The people will take you to the mountain top, the people."  So that you always have to have an understanding and know and be kind and understanding and considerate of the little person and that was just drummed into me from my father to [Kenneth] Campbell to everyone and we've always tried to do that.
Speaker 1: And what kind of person was he?  What was his, sort of, you know-
Speaker 2: He was a--in those days, blacks who had achieved anything, of course, spent all of their money on dressing very well and having a very good car.  And there wasn't much else to look forward to.  And so [Alderman] Kenneth Campbell was a very articulate--Colonel [Kenneth] Campbell as he is known, very dapper, very strong, well organized--political organization.  We knew where everyone lived.  We knew when a person moved.  We had precinct captains who he knew exactly what they were doing and where they were, whether they were working or not.  It was the most--it was the greatest--it was the best organized, I would say, political organization in the Dawson-era machine that the precinct captains would have to report every two weeks as to who moved within their precinct and then we kept--I kept a record of it and I would know how many.  And after the first hour of voting, we got so we could almost predict what the vote would be in our Ward.  And then we would know where to encourage people to come out and where not to.  And that we would deliver at the time the money that you would pay for people to work the precinct during the period of time.  We'd know who got what, who kept the money, who spent the money.  Tremendous organization.  It was a part of politics of the [William L.] Dawson machine that is--was just incredible at the time.
Speaker 1: And can you talk about Bill [Representative William L.] Dawson and what type of person he was also?
Speaker 2: Bill [Representative William L.] Dawson as a young man.  I thought that Bill [Representative William L.] Dawson was not the leader that we should have.  I thought as a young man that he had--he had sold out the top jobs to have more street sweepers, if I can use it as a quote, rather than having commissioners who would do more.  I was not too pleased with him as a young man.  I remember voicing my opposition, which was quickly snuffed out.  And now that I've grown older, I don't know about wiser but older, I realize that there hasn't been anyone that powerful that we've had since, or at the time.  And then I can remember now, when I think about the mayor's office, I don't see a Dawson coming in.  When he didn't need an appointment, everyone would see [William L.] Dawson.  And I remember when the late Mayor [Richard J.] Daley ran for office and The [Chicago] Tribune talked about [William L.] Dawson and his machine and how evil he was, he said the people will say what they think about Dawson and he delivered the votes to elect the late Mayor [Richard J.] Daley.
Speaker 1: That--wasn't he really responsible for that?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.  He delivered the greatest number of votes that was ever heard of in his Ward.  They were so good at it.  They were professional and they worked hard at it.  And they helped people.  They never left the office on a night when they saw people in the community.  They didn't see everyone till every person was seen and helped in a job and the rent and all the basics 'cause you didn't have a system that you have now.  And now my son is Chairman of the Chicago Board of Elections.  He thinks of all the methods that they used and techniques to get people to come out to vote and to teach people how to vote because we don't have the precinct captain which everyone says was so evil (laughter).  And that's kind of an anomaly.
Story_ID: 71778
Speaker 1: Now when you--so was that--that involvement with [Kenneth] Campbell, did that--was a thing when you decided you were going to go to U of I [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign], you said that, you know (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Was that--was that why you chose Political Science as a major?
Speaker 2: No, I always--I always thought about law.  I always liked law.  I always was involved in government.  It was just something that was just natural and I didn't have any other interest all my life that I really wanted to be a lawyer, I thought at the time.  So that when I went to the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign], and then when I went to [University of] Michigan Law School, was when I worked for [Kenneth] Campbell for a short period of time when he was Illinois Commerce Commissioner and I got to learn more--more and more about the law.  And then when I got out of law school, and then I went--I was drafted immediately in the [U.S.] Army, and when I came back from the [U.S.] Army, I then got a job at the Chicago Land Clearance Commission, which paid the great sum of three hundred fifteen dollars a month but I learned a specialty and that's what got me started.
Speaker 1: Now I--I just want to go back to U of I [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign], that was your first time away--well you had spent summers in Denver.  Did you go to--you went to Champaign [Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: I went to Champaign [Illinois], that's correct.  There was not a (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: There wasn't a Circle Campus [University of Illinois at Chicago] then?
Speaker 2: No, no there was not.
Speaker 1: So, that was--so what was that experience like 'cause it was your first?
Speaker 2: Well, I lived in the Kappa [Alpha Psi] house, we were all black together and we were--we didn't know that there was any other way of life.  I pledged Kappa [Alpha Psi] and I was duly--I would say disciplined as a pledge in the Kappa [Alpha Psi] fraternity when you were paddled almost every night.  And my recollection, though, of the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign] was not a very pleasant one when I first went.  It was the first time that I met really overt discrimination and that my first day there when I went to campus, I stopped in a restaurant to buy a hamburger and they put my hamburger in a bag and I said I wanted to eat there and they said no.  And that was the first experience.  That was two blocks off campus.  And I lived in the Kappa [Alpha Psi] house because you couldn't live in the dormitory at a state university, at the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign] when I went there to school, which is incredible.  And then twenty years later when I became President of the Board of the University of Illinois, I reminded them of that.  And much to my pleasure the students didn't believe me and they went to the President's office and said how could--what is this person talking about?  And they said, yes, it was true at the time.  But the fact they didn't believe it, I liked, and that's something that I've never forgotten, that you couldn't live in the dorm.  As a matter of fact, blacks weren't good enough to play on the basketball team. And those are sort of the incredible things of discrimination and prejudice.  There's just hard to believe that it could be that deep-seated.  But you had no blacks on the basketball teams, in the Big Ten.  And they finally changed during the period of time which would have been 1945 to 1949, it changed, and we could eat on campus by the time I left because we picketed and did all the things that most people do.

Speaker 1: Now what things were forming you as a young, you know, a person during those college years?  Were there other things sort of forming you as a, you know, as a young man?
Speaker 2: No, I think the--the one thing that bothered me was that the Kappa [Alpha Psi] brothers would make me go to a restaurant to buy hamburgers and bring home when I knew I couldn't eat there and that was--I hated more than anything in life.  I remember that which was a deep instilled sense of discrimination that reminded me of it every time I would go there.  I believe, other than that, we worked--we had a good, strong fraternity, black organization.  We had several good students who--and then we developed in the fraternity house, a competition and grades became important.  And all of those things helped us to develop.  Grades then became important to me the last, maybe two years, of college because we wanted to bring up the whole fraternity by having those of us who could perhaps get better grades.  So that I think the comp--well, I know, the competition of living in the house, the fact that we were all black together, we worked together, was not an unhealthy relationship.  And we had friends.  You didn't have the prejudice in the school itself.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I was wondering, you know, do you think about that, here, young black guys isolated but they--they themselves bring each other up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh yes, you can, you can look at the group.  One is [Dr. Edward] Ted Cruzat, who just died recently, was a very fine surgeon here in Chicago.  [HM] Frederick Ford, who was the first black to be with one of the--Draper and Kramer who became their Vice President of Draper and Kramer for many years was during the same group we were there.  There was a doctor in St. Louis [Missouri] who is, Les Bond, who is a very famous surgeon in St. Louis [Missouri] who also lived in that same Kappa [Alpha Psi] house.  There are a couple of architects and engineers who have done extremely well.  So that even though the university had a sense of discrimination, it was not evident in the classroom and it was certainly was not evident in our relationship so that out of that came good students.  And students went to the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign] because they couldn't get into school in Missouri.  So they would pay their tuition at the University of Illinois because they turned down applicants.  So they would apply for graduate school just so they could go to the University of Illinois and get the State of Missouri to pay their tuition, which is also incredible.
Story_ID: 71780
Speaker 1: Now so, you get out--you graduated in 19-
Speaker 2: I graduated from the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign] in 1949, February of '49' [1949].  I then went in, I guess it probably would have been in September, to the University of Michigan Law School.  I felt very fortunate to have been accepted there and it was one of the--is still one of the, you know, top law schools in the country, as you know well.
Speaker 1: Now when you went to--was there some, you know, thought about where you would apply to law school and how did you know-
Speaker 2: Well, I really--I only applied--it's interesting.  I only applied at the University of Michigan, if I can recall, in that time, and I was accepted.  I got a good letter of recommendation from a professor who was--who I took courses in law, or similar to law, and political science, that he thought I would be a pretty good student and he wrote a--and he had finished Michigan, and he wrote a letter for me and he said at that time you'll probably get in, whatever that meant.  But anyways, I was accepted right away and I only applied to [University of] Michigan.
Speaker 1: So how was that experience there?  You know, you--you have the advantage that your father is a lawyer but it was--he had gone to a different type of law school?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  When I went to [University of] Michigan, I met--my father introduced me to a family named Baker.  Very interesting family.  Oscar Baker, Senior was--became a lawyer in Michigan, in Bay City, Michigan, in 1903.  He had one leg and he had seven or eight children.  And he became the lawyer in Bay City, Michigan.  He died in 1956.  He left a very fine estate as a black lawyer practicing in Michigan.  Of course, all of his clients were white.  And his sons had gone to the University of Michigan.  And one son was there when I applied and my father knew Oscar W. Baker and had written him.  And then I met his sons and they paved the way for me to have a pretty good relationship.  And then we knew--my father knew a lot of people from Detroit [Michigan] who went to Michigan Law School.  So I had a lot of friends when I arrived at the University of Michigan.  And then I met my wife at the University of Michigan (laughter).  So, it was a good--it was a good experience for me at the University of Michigan.
Speaker 1: How many--how many blacks were in your class?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think maybe four at most.  We could live--in my second year, I was able to move into the Lawyers Club which was very helpful, beautiful fireplace in the room, that sort of thing.  It was really an old English-type law school environment and that helped me in that I was with the students who were good students and we worked together.  So that was very helpful to me in the University of Michigan environment.  So I had a very good environment.  A very good situation at the University of Michigan.
Speaker 1: Did you feel--are you--in terms of academically, I know you said, you know, you started to be competitive and that U of I [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] helped sort of form you.  Did you find that that competition or that you were--still had to sort of strive to work hard to compete?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, absolutely.  The University of Michigan was a real challenge for me and I got out, as a matter of fact, my friend [Oscar] Baker, when he graduated a year ahead of me and came back and he had a new car and I thought he was very successful.  And he said to me, "Earl, no client will ask you whether you made an 'A' or 'C' in class, just get out."  And I always remember that and thought about that.  But it was hard work when you get out.  And I did reasonably well but not as well as I probably should have.
Story_ID: 71781
Speaker 1: Now you, you said you passed the Bar in Michigan (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, I took the Bar.  Immediately when I got out, I was being drafted in the Army, so I passed the Bar in Michigan and was admitted January the sixth or seventh and I went into the Army the eighth.  So then I took the Illinois Bar when I came back out of the Army, in 1955.
Speaker 1: You were in the Army, how long?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Two years, okay.  Where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: I was--I was in Georgia for a period of time and I was in--right outside of Paris for a year, in Orleans, which was a great experience (laughter).  It was a very enjoyable year for a young single man at 22 in Paris.
Speaker 1: Now, I believe it.  Okay, we're going to change tapes (laughter).  So you were--so you met [HM] Isobel [Neal] but you didn't get married?  Are you worried about?
Speaker 2: No, I'm fine.  I just wondered the time.
Speaker 1: But you didn't get married?
Speaker 2: No we didn't get married until I got out of the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In 1955.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we met--should we change?
Speaker 1: You're changing--?
Story_ID: 71782
Speaker 1: We were in California and she spent two years there and got her Masters in Archeology which was a real challenge.  People say, "How did you do it."  But we spent more real time together when she was in California probably than we did anytime because I was pretty busy trying cases around the country.
Speaker 2: But, when you--you said--where we were was that you were stationed in Orleans [France]-
Speaker 1: Orleans [France], which is just outside of Paris [France] for the second year of the Army.  The first year I was in Augusta, Georgia, and I said they made up for it and then sent me to Paris.
Speaker 2: How did you get that assignment?
Speaker 1: I had--I had finished law school and I was not accepted as an officer in the JAG [Judge Advocate General] Corps, probably for a lot of reasons, but I like to think that was because the--I think that it might well have been because the JAG [Judge Advocate General] law school was at the University of Virginia and I don't think there were any blacks in the law school, at the University of Virginia, at the time.  So, in any event, I was not made an officer and I was there--some of the white officers didn't like that and they asked me where I wanted to be transferred and I said, "Paris [France]."  And they transferred me to Paris [Paris].  So I was then--I was a Corporal, or whatever have you, an enlisted man, but I decoded messages because I learned to type pretty fast and learned how to decode them pretty quickly so that I only had to work about one or two nights a week when decoding the messages, but I could do it pretty quickly.  So I spent a lot of time in Paris [France].  Orleans [Orleans] was about an hour's trip away.
Speaker 2: That's pretty fabulous.
Speaker 1: So it was a nice--that was also a very good experience.  I learned a lot about life, living in Paris, and it's interesting now I have a client, one of the largest advertising firm in the world, is [JCDecaux] Decaux, stationed in Paris [France] and they're my client and they just won a contract with the [Chicago, Illinois] city to do a two hundred million dollar street furniture and that will be all of the street furnishing.  It happens to be a client of mine although we managed to, I can say now because it won't come out before, to stay out of the newspapers.  So that we are busy--in fact they're here this afternoon.
Speaker 2: They won a twenty-year contract.  I was just reading about that the other day.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Okay, right.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: So, now, the Paris [France]--let's talk--I mean just a little bit about that because a lot of blacks, you know, spent time in Paris.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It was a place that people-
Speaker 1: Felt free.
Speaker 2: --felt free and all that and I'm wondering, were there any people that we would know there?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't know anyone.
Speaker 2: But Josephine Baker was there, right?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, Josephine Baker was there.  I saw her perform whenever I managed to get enough money to do that.  But I didn't meet anyone, I didn't know anyone, I just enjoyed Paris as a twenty-two or three [twenty-three] year old young man would (laughter).
Speaker 2: So, now when you-
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That's cute, he has a grin on his face (laughing)
Speaker 1: It rounded out my background, I'll put it that way (laughs).
Story_ID: 71783
Speaker 1: So, when you come back, you come back to Chicago [Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I came back to Chicago [Illinois], studied very hard for the Bar because I'd been away for two years just knowing nothing.  It was the best experience I had because I really worked hard at it.  And I had some disappointing experience in the [U.S.] Army so I was just driven again to try to be successful.  And I passed the Bar and then I--I was able to get this job through [Alderman] Ken[neth] Campbell with the [Chicago, Illinois] Land Clearance Commission and I worked there and because there was a lawyer who was in charge of land acquisition, was not the hardest worker, he was very happy that I was there and was able--and he let me do a lot of the work.  And, of course, I worked like the devil and I learned the business.
Speaker 1: Now what, for people who don't know, you know, what the [Chicago, Illinois] Land Clearance Commission is.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the [Chicago, Illinois] Land Clearance Commission was a public body that acquired the land for Lake Meadows [Chicago, Illinois public housing] and Prairie Shores [Chicago, Illinois public housing] and all of those early urban renewal projects were done by the Land Clearance Commission up until 1961.  I worked for the Land Clearance Commission from 1955 to 1960, when I left and got a job at the [Chicago, Illinois] City to do the urban renewal for the University of Chicago area, Hyde Park Urban Renewal.  And we did that which was the urban renewal for the University of Chicago, primarily the Hyde Park area.  And then after that, we started with the University of Illinois Circle Campus and I was the number two lawyer in developing the land for that part of it.  And then from there I worked for the [Chicago, Illinois] City as a salaried employee for about four years.  And then I resigned and the late Mayor [Richard J.] Daley recommended me to be appointed as a special assistant, which was then a major break-through in that I was--it was in all of the papers and they laughed, they said I was paid fifty thousand dollars a year on a contract and I think the mayor then made thirty-five thousand [dollars] a year so the--they saw fit that, you know, a black should make this kind of money, that it was in the New York Times what my salary was, which was not very pleasant for me to continue.  However, I had the support of the late Mayor [Richard J.] Daley and that was my start.  And I then left a law firm that I was with Foran and Weiss, Thomas A. Foran, who was U. S. attorney.  He had then gone in the U. S. Attorney's Office so I left the firm and formed my--I never really stopped practicing law myself.  In those times, people didn't work full-time on public job because they paid such a small amount.  But then I began to develop my own firm and my own specialty in land acquisition and it was really because of the start.  And then the late Mayor [Richard J.] Daley gave me opportunities, as I said in the book that I gave you, opportunities to participate in the--really, the more challenging areas of the law that very few have had.  From that I tried the first reapportionment case, I guess, in the history of the United States because before, you know, it was in the political thicket that nobody entered into reapportionment.  And that was in, I think, 1972, I tried that case and we managed to win.  I then tried the [HM] Renault Robinson discrimination case [1976] which was very difficult for me.  My wife, [HM] Isobel [Neal], went through a lot of trauma with her friends who criticized her saying that, "How could Earl represent the City [Chicago, Illinois] in a discrimination case."  And I thought about that a long time and I remember one time I went to the president of the Chicago Bar Association, who happened to be a friend of my father's.  My father didn't give me advice but he told me to check.  And this lawyer said that if I had the philosophy that I couldn't represent my client, vigorously, and totally, that I should resign but that I also ought to turn in my law license because the lawyer, he represents your client.  You don't necessarily vouch for his philosophy.  And with that it gave me the ability to withstand a lot of the criticism 'cause I realized I was a lawyer.  But then in that role, I was able to achieve more to promote what has happened in the [Chicago, Illinois] police department than if I hadn't stayed on the inside.  And I think the real proof in the pudding is that [HM] Renault Robinson and I--I think today the best of friends because he knows that I helped resolve some of the key issues.  And any number of cases in that period of time, the late Mayor [Richard J.] Daley would call me in and say that I would handle it.  It was a marvelous experience.  It's things that people would never understand.  There's a reputation of the late Mayor Daley that he would stay in his office to meet me at night when I finished in court and asked me if there was anything he could do for me to help me.  He encouraged me and really gave me the opportunity to achieve whatever we have achieved over this period of time because I begin--I was able to participate not in the shootings on the South Side in court, but in the cases in the Supreme Court and the Appellate Court and some of those things we've done, a lot of them I think back that I feel very proud of, some I wonder about.
Story_ID: 71784
Speaker 1: Well, I want to--I hate to do this, but I want to because I would like to--for people to understand the significance of some things and I'd like to go back to the [Chicago, Illinois] Land Clearance Commission, just for a second.  And, you know, these, both Lake Meadows [Chicago, Illinois] and Prairie-
Speaker 2: Prairie Shores [Chicago, Illinois]-
Speaker 1: Prairie Shores [Chicago, Illinois], those were very significant projects.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so I'd like for you to just create a context of what was happening and who were the significant people working on that project, you know-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --all sides and it was some-
Speaker 2: With Lake Meadows [Chicago, Illinois public housing], it was very interesting.  We were acquiring the land, which was to be purchased and sold to New York Life Insurance Company for development, which is now, of course, the real stable point of middle income, black America, living in it.  But we had to buy the property which were then slum-invited property.  The concept was--it was probably in 1945, there had been a [U.S.] Supreme Court ruling, Parker, I can't think of the first name, Berman v. Parker [1954], which said that you could acquire the land to clear a slum was a public purpose and was building on that and that was the theory.  But we took cases to the [U.S.] Supreme Court, we were challenged by a black law firm, named Braden and--Barnes and Braden, who owned property in the area, and they challenged us and we tried those cases and we went to the Supreme Court and we managed to be successful.  And then we acquired the land immediately south of that for the Prairie Shores [Chicago, Illinois public housing] development and almost all of that was land acquisition.  In those days they were all juried trials.  They moved rather quickly.  So I tried, I would say ten to twelve jury trials a year, which was, as you know, is an enormous amount.  Even our prove-ups were with the jury in those days because they said you--just compensation had to be determined by a jury and they didn't think you could waive a jury and it's changed since then, of course.  And then from there we moved over to the University of Illinois [at Chicago] which had a great controversy and none of these things were without a lot of controversy and a lot of things that you were accused of being "Uncle Tom", this sort of thing.  But we did then the University of Illinois at Circle Campus [Chicago, Illinois].  By then you didn't have a black versus white, you had the Florence [Italy] scholar, or Italians, claiming they were moved out of a neighborhood and we handled that during that period of time, with a couple of other lawyers, so I was probably number two or something of the sort.  The other things that have occurred during that--yes--
Speaker 1: Just one thing, though.  These were mainly eminent domain?  Were they eminent domain-
Speaker 2: Eminent Domain.
Speaker 1: --cases?
Speaker 2: They were all condemnation, eminent domain, the right of a public body to take property for a public purpose.  And from that developed a lot of other things that we did.
Story_ID: 71785
Speaker 1: Now what were the urban planning?  Who was guiding a lot of this planning?  And was it sort of city focus or commercial?  I just want to get-
Speaker 2: It was city focus.  It was the [Chicago, Illinois] Department of Planning.  I can't remember who was the commissioner at the time.  But it was under the strong leadership of [Mayor] Richard J. Daley, who saw that this should be done.  And it was challenged.  It was a first in the country to say that you could take land and sell it to a private company and that sort of thing.  There had been other precedents but this was on the real cutting edge of urban renewal at the time.  It was new.  The first [U.S.] Supreme Court ruling was, I think, probably late '50s' [1950s] [sic, 1954 Berman v. Parker] so it was--it was rather new and rather challenging and they all were challenging a lot of issues, which they were again now challenging going back where the courts are more conservative about the right to acquire property and it's sort of for me it's deja vu although the lawyers here question it.  That was part of it.  That was probably--that was undoubtedly a real specialty that we broke out in where we represented other villages, other cities, we represent almost every public body in the city that does it.  We represent McCormick Place [Chicago, Illinois], the Illinois Medical Center Commission, the University of Illinois [Chicago] and, of course, the City of Chicago [Illinois].  Our major client is a Public Building Commission where we are building a--some eight new fire stations and seven or eight new police stations and new schools.  We represent the [Chicago, Illinois] Board of Education in land acquisition.  And we represented the Village of Barrington [Illinois] and many of the white villages.  We also represent a lot of owners outside of the city of Chicago [Illinois].  And that's been the real niche of our work and is what we specialize in and we still do, although during the time when I came up, I would say, the thing that pushed me most were some of the high profile political cases that we handled.  The [HM] Renault Robinson Patrolmen's Association case where we represented the [Chicago, Illinois] City where they broke the windows in my house, twice, because I was representing the [Chicago, Illinois] City in the case.  And we had police protection during that time, which was very difficult for me.
Speaker 1: Tell me-
Speaker 2: And more difficult for my wife [HistoryMaker Isobel Neal].
Story_ID: 71786
Speaker 1: So, do you--do you remember your first meeting with Mayor [Richard J.] Daley when you first came to meet him, the late Mayor?
Speaker 2: That's [Mayor] Richard J. Daley.  Yes, I remember the first meeting was when I started working for the [Chicago, Illinois] Land Clearance Commission, which is in 1955, he was just elected then and [Alderman Kenneth] Campbell introduced me to him.  And we just met.  And then I would say that we developed a relationship when I left the [Chicago, Illinois] City and I had worked for--I had worked--it was 1962 and I wrote a letter to the late Mayor [Richard J.] Daley indicating that I couldn't--didn't want to work any longer for the City that I would do my own and that was when we became pretty close friends.  And for some reason he would call me and I guess we were closer than I ever really imagine.  When I think back on it, I realized that he gave me opportunities that very few have ever had since or during that period of time.  And he supported me in all of these causes and his positions were a lot different than those that are portrayed in the paper as the strong political leader solely, uncaring for the people.  Nothing could have been more different from [Mayor Richard J.] Daley.
Speaker 1: So, can you talk about your own views and your experiences with him?
Speaker 2: Yes, I can say that probably the--the real example was during the police case when it was extremely difficult to represent the City [Chicago, Illinois].  [HM] Renault [Robinson] had a very strong case.
Story_ID: 71787
Speaker 1: But let's--can we talk about what led up to [HM] Renault [Robinson]'s case, you know, what were the circumstances?  Okay-
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I'm sorry I assumed that.  Police first--there was a lack of hiring of African Americans in the [Chicago, Illinois] police department and he thought the method of weeding out, or finding them unqualified was not appropriate for several reasons, one, the physical examination, which I alluded to before was prejudice and secondly where the written examinations that they thought were not appropriate to measure.  And they filed--and the federal government came in and questioned the method of hiring because the percentages of African Americans were so out of kilter with the percentage of persons who applied or who were eligible Afro-Americans in the community.  The [U.S.] Justice Department began to make inquiry in those areas and there was a change in the Civil Rights Act [1964] which made it apply to the City of Chicago [Illinois], or municipalities.  And all of that brought about the--the standing shall we say, or the cause of action that was appropriate in the federal court.  And the [U.S.] Justice Department started, and [HM] Renault Robinson joined, and Renault was represented by a very very fine lawyer in the firm of Kirkland and Ellis [Washington D.C.], who donated their time to do that.  And Louie had become very good friends, of course.  But during that period of time, I was hired to represent the City [Chicago, Illinois] which was very very difficult for me.  But, as it worked out, during the period of time that I began to talk and chat with Mayor [Richard J.] Daley, he began to understand that there had to be a change and he actually advised me, encouraged me and supported me, in many of the compromises that I advanced in court, although I have never said that, nor would I say it politically.
Speaker 1: But you--so really, 'cause a lot of people when they look at lawyering, they look, you know, at trial cases-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And there's another part of lawyering that is-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --really compromised and sort of strategic position-
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and things like that.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And so what you're really addressing here is that part of that.
Speaker 2: That part of the role and I would say that my relationship with Mayor [Richard J.] Daley helped to advance the cause of the [HM] Renault Robinsons and their cause because he began to understand, when we would talk about these issues, that we had to find some kind of a compromise and, in fact, indeed we did.  So that in the end result, I feel very good about it but at the time it was awful hard to do it because of the criticism that you got from the black community of being the quote, "Uncle Tom".
Story_ID: 71788
Speaker 1: So how did that--you know, your father, was he still alive at the time?
Speaker 2: My father was alive.  He was a judge at the time.  He was very distraught when they called and threatened me.  They called him and said they were gonna get me and if I continued to represent him because we were doing pretty well, I guess, in court on some occasions and-
Speaker 1: Did he--what did he think of your career up to that point?  Was he--was he--'cause I go back to you saying, you know, my father was somewhat angry and, you know, frustrated.
Speaker 2: Yes, but he--by that time he'd become a judge and what he really liked was being a judge in the neighborhood where he could help the people.  He didn't want to move.  He loved it when he was at Chicago Avenue [Chicago, Illinois] or out at 87th Street because he understood the people and he felt he could help them with, an understanding.  So he was then--he had mellowed and he knew that what I was doing was very difficult but he knew I had to make the decision and he guided me, encouraged me to continue, to not get weak and was a great strength that I had.
Speaker 1: Now how was [HM] Isobel [Neal] handling all of this?
Speaker 2: It was very difficult--with difficulty because all of her good friends were saying how could Earl do this and how does he do this?  And we had built a house with Cecil Partee, the then State Senator [Illinois] on Michigan Avenue [Chicago, Illinois], where we lived together in two condominiums that I had built and one of the first in the state, as a matter of fact.  And when they broke the window, he was on the first floor and I lived on the second floor and the windows were broken twice on the second floor so it was clearly directed at me.  And we had police sitting on the outside of the house for a period of time.  This was very difficult for [HM] Isobel [Neal], first for her protection, but I think primarily whether I was doing the right thing.  But [HM] Isobel [Neal] was always supportive of me and said if I want to do it, that's what I would do.  And she just supported me without saying it.  So--and we were criticized that that's how we made money, that's how we became successful and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: And what about [Illinois Senate President] Cecil Partee?  What was his position (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Cecil was-
Speaker 1: He was-
Speaker 2: He was supportive.  He was then either--he was in the [Illinois] Senate.  I'm not sure whether he was president of the Senate but he was surely the leader, one of the leaders in the Senate.
Speaker 1: He was (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I can't remember when he became president [1971-1973, 1975-1977].
Speaker 1: If he wasn't, he was close to--I think it was in the '60s' [1960s], though-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You're right.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I think he did.
Speaker 2: So he was--he was a very powerful leader at the time-
Speaker 1: He had close ties with [Mayor Richard J.] Daley, too?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes, Cecil was a very fine politician, close ties.  And I would say that my relationship with [Mayor Richard J.] Daley was entirely different than many others because we were on a client--attorney client relationship.
Story_ID: 71789
Speaker 1: Now were you--also remember how you said that your father was not really into the social clubs, he thought things-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but your-[HM]Isobel [Neal] had come out of sort of black society-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and I think you were--you had entered black society, here.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: So that would--that would have been even harder at that point.
Speaker 2: It was very hard for her and it wasn't until later that I stopped going to all the club functions because I--I don't know whether it harkens back to what my father said to me but it's something that I just don't do.
Speaker 1: Now that case lasted how long?
Speaker 2: Oh, it seemed like a lifetime but it probably lasted three or four years.
Speaker 1: It was lucrative for the firm--for you and the firm?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was lucrative for the firm.  I was paid well.  It was--but there were so many aspects of it that went up and down, to the Appellate Court and some parts of it I didn't handle.  I did most of the trial work, although I didn't--most of the cases in the Appellate Court I handled too.  But it kind of now is blended into a whole morass of cases that were difficult at the time.
Speaker 1: Did you ever question you--I know you had the conversation with the person at the Chicago [Illinois]-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Bar Association
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but did you ever question during that, you said four--did you say four or two year period?  Did you ever question, am I doing the right thing?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Is this ultimately hurt my career?
Speaker 2: All the time.
Speaker 1: And-
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't so much as hurting my career, I-
Speaker 1: But reputation, I mean-
Speaker 2: But whether my reputation--whether I was doing the right thing for blacks, or what I wanted to do, and whether I was achieving it, and then I would think if I don't do it, who will?  And I realized that all it would be would be another white firm that would represent them with no sensitivity, whereas if I got the respect, earned the respect, nobody gives you respect, I earned the respect of the then-political leaders, I can maybe then talk about judgment and that's what happened.  And if you question it, ask [HM] Renault [Robinson], who was really the leader in it.  But we tried any number of cases since then that were difficult.  They held forty-three million dollars in model cities' funds for the City [Chicago, Illinois] because they said there was a discrimination and after that we went to Washington, D.C. and tried the case to get it brought back here.  But all of those cases were rather merged together, all basically discrimination cases, but they all worked out in time.
Speaker 1: So, just, oh.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Excuse me.  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 71790
Speaker 1: What, but what was the end result of the [HM] Renault Robinson?  He was the-
Speaker 2: The end result of the [HM] Renault Robinson case was there was an order entered where they had new examinations, that there were certain percentages of blacks, I believe, that were promoted, so many captains and lieutenants and it was--the examinations were thrown out.  We then continued to work to develop new examinations, how you could do it, what would pass muster with the federal government, all of those things were worked out at the time but they all were resolved, either by court order or by agreement, most were by court order even though there may have been agreed.
Speaker 1: Now the other--what was the position you said that you got fifty thousand--you know, that it was a contract position?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was when I quit the City [Chicago, Illinois] as a salaried employee.  I was then hired back by the mayor [Richard J. Daley] as a contract employee and that was what gave me the opportunity to develop what we developed in the City of Chicago [Illinois].  Without that I wouldn't have been able to do it.
Speaker 1: And that was a lot of money then.
Speaker 2: That was a lot of money.  It enabled me to pay my secretary, my rent and a lot of other things, exactly.
Speaker 1: And what other things are forming you at that point?  I mean just in terms of your career 'cause it's still relatively--let's see, you have at that point you've been out of law school, what fifth-
Speaker 2: Well from there, yes, I'd been out '55' [1955] through '70' [1970], I would say were those cases.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But in 1970, then my career began to change and then I had an opportunity to serve on a number of Boards.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yes, and in that first Board that I served on was Chicago Title and Trust Company, the leading title company in Chicago [Illinois].  I was asked to serve on that Board.  From there I got on the Board of Lincoln National Insurance Company in Ft. Wayne [Indiana], one of the leading insurance companies, or money managers as they are now.  From there I went on the Board of Peoples Energy Corporation and stayed on there and then really culminated in going on the Board of First Chicago [Bank] and NBD First Chicago-NBD [Illinois], and I stayed on that Board.  So that I then began to gravitate to corporate society and corporate business I should say, not society, and made a lot of friends and began to get business in the corporate world but that was what gave me the opportunity to move into that because of the things I had done in the legal world.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to change tapes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 71791
Speaker 1: --So we'll try to do something with the name.  I told Langdon [Neal] to, you know, make it so that when--something--when I stop, it isn't just the end, you know, it continues.  So anyways, we'll try to do it.  Okay, let's go.
Speaker 2: So, I guess--so, when you--when you start, you said in 1970 when you start serving on corporate boards, what, you know, because up to that point this has been very political in many ways involvement in government-
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --which is where African Americans-
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --really, you know, had--that was the place-
Speaker 1: An opportunity, correct.
Speaker 2: --you know have an opportunity.  Now, when you start having those experiences, sitting on corporate boards, what did you learn because that's a whole new world?
Speaker 1: Well, that is interesting, Julie[anna Richardson], because that's really when you begin to realize how much we, as African Americans, miss an opportunity.  It's not--it's certainly not the pay that you get on the Boards, although I'll tell you deferring the pay is not bad, now that I'm retired, I'm very glad I deferred all my salary on those corporate boards and I can now live on that.  But it wasn't so much that, it's the sitting around a room that you look around and you say, I'm with ten or fifteen persons, who are running corporations to give you, say one hundred thousand dollrs worth of business, this means nothing.  And if you become friends, you can say I need--I would like you to think about me.  And you get the business.  And you then begin to realize how easy it is to grow and develop in this area.  Well, I began to learn that too late.  I guess I went on the Board maybe mid-'70s' [1970s] and I had to develop friendships and start from scratch.  But as I look back on it, I realize that that was the entry in where you should be because we've always been on the outside of that.  And when you're there you promote, you push, you get employees, you'll want to know who's the department head, you do all of the things that all of us who are on boards, as I trust do, and it makes just an enormous difference in the whole fabric of opportunity for blacks in business.  And that began to open my eyes and began to make me realize that I hadn't done anything compared to the opportunities out here, that I never had the opportunity to really strive and develop.
Story_ID: 71792
Speaker 1: And then I became, of course, by fluke in 1983, I became the Chairman of First Federal Savings and Loan, which was one of the first time that had ever happened in the history, I guess, of our country.
Speaker 2: Why do you say by "fluke"?
Speaker 1: About-
Speaker 2: That, "I became by fluke the Chairman of the Board"?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What happened was there was a challenge by the federal government, I should have said by happenstance, the challenge by the federal government to the management of First Federal Savings and Loan, which was the largest savings and loan in Illinois, one of the largest in the country.  And the Board was changed so the federal government came in and appointed a certain number of persons to the Board and so that the mix was maybe some appointed by the federal government, some of the existing Board members, and I managed to survive all those changes.  And then when they came down to electing a new Chairman, because the Chairman was requested to resign, there was a question of who would get it and we had sort of a fight between those who had been appointed by the federal government and those of us who were on the existing Board.  And when it came to a vote, I also knew something about politics.  And I remember telling, and I was elected Chairman, and I remember telling one of the members who had been appointed by the federal government, who was a little upset, that I managed to be Chairman, and I said to him, I said, you know--we'll say that there were ten members on the Board, I said, "You know, I'm not as smart as you are but I count real good to six."  And I never forgot that because that's what I did, I counted real good to six and I had six votes and he had four.  So that's when I say--however the newspapers, because it was a first, because the support I got from The Defender [The Chicago Defender, Illinois] from--who that was [Robert] Sengstacke [Abbott], who gave me the award which was a--really I'm so proud of it to this day.  In fact of all the awards I've gotten, that's the one I--from The Defender, of the Abbott Award, because I was the first black and statements that I got from Jesse [HM Reverend Jesse Jackson] and all recognizing this achievement that I ran it for a year, although I didn't know a lot about it.  I ran it and understood it and we almost all but survived and then finally we sold to Citicorp, who bought four or five savings and loan.  But as I look back on it, with the savings and loan disaster that occurred within the next two years, during that time I think we had like a twenty million [dollars] problem which was nothing.  And we really survived during a tough period when all of the other savings and loan really, you know, turned up with great difficulties so that it was, in hindsight, it was a pretty good stewardship, as Chairman, although when--when the other--when Citicorp came in, I did not wish to have a relationship with them because I felt it was selling out Chicago and I refused any, I don't say I refuse, I'd say I didn't discuss any potential relationship, although it could have been very lucrative for me, I'm sure, 'cause I thought it was time to move on, which I did.  But that was--that was a great experience.  I found out how easy it was to raise money for the first time.  I was already chairman of an affair and all the people working for the banks, and all, you don't have to do anything but send out a letter.  And those are the things we miss.  And I learned how, you know, that was--and I remember that when I first became Chairman, it was the fiftieth year of First Federal and I think it was one hundred fiftieth year, or something of the City [Chicago, Illinois], and we planted fifty roses out in Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois] and we had a big ceremony.  Of course CEO's from all over the City came.  [Mayor] Harold [Washington] had just been elected and I told Harold, "Why don't you come, you'll meet everybody."  Of course, he didn't show up.  And I was so disappointed because it was his opportunity but four years later he then knew it was an opportunity and we, unfortunately, he didn't survive when he began to realize the thing that I was then told by--'cause I had given some lectures in California, [Tom] Bradley, the mayor of California, I saw him at a lecture that I gave in--I was also a member of the International Academy of Trial Lawyers, I was Dean, so at the time I was traveling about giving lectures around the world, really on--in any event I had one in California and I talked to Mayor [Tom] Bradley and he said [Mayor] Harold [Washington] hasn't returned my call.  And I said, oh, you know.  He said, oh no, he said, "I know he's busy."  He said, "Just tell him that I"--he said, "I know you're his lawyer in a certain occasion."  He said just tell him I said, "Make friends with the business community."  I've never forgotten that.  I remember I told [Mayor] Harold [Washington], which he didn't accept at the time.  And we had--I'll just leave this thought with one thing that we laughed about, I remember that I-when [Mayor] Harold [Washington] was first elected, of course, I'd known him for so long, and we tried to be as helpful as we could and, of course, he was very suspicious of a lot of people but I had just been elected Chairman of First Federal, he knew that I certainly didn't want to be mayor, I wasn't--I didn't want to do anything but be supportive of him so he was close with me.  And I remember he said one day when we worked and we--I'd been--I had breakfasts and lunch, and things for him, he said, "What can I do for you?"  This was right before his--when he went to the office the first time.  And I said, "Oh [Mayor] Harold [Washington], there isn't anything really you can do for me except one thing."  I said, "When you get out of your car, in front of City Hall," I said, "I'll be across the street."  I said just turn over [Mayor] Harold [Washington] and say, "Hi, Earl."  I said I'll take care of the rest (laughter).  And so he always laughed about that.  It was our favorite in-joke together and the first day that he drove to City Hall, he was going down Madison [Street] and I was walking the opposite way, Madison [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], to go to First Federal [Savings and Loan], at Dearborn and Madison [Chicago, Illinois], and he leaned out the window, he said, "Hi, Earl."  And we laughed about that to this day.  But what I was saying to him was his friendship and his support that would make all the difference in the world when African American on their way up and it was kind of a private thing that we shared for a long time.
Story_ID: 71793
Speaker 1: What--when you look at his election and his time in-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --office, what would you consider, you know, the importance of that?
Speaker 2: Well I think the importance was not the many things that you would point to, lawyers getting a bond business, persons holding positions that they never held before, encouraging businesses to hire blacks, was the fact that he was there and that he gave the black community pride that they could do it.  And I think that was more important than all the tangibles--things that you could point to, was the fact he was there and that he was competent, that he was there.  And he just developed--he had a political skill that no one has been able to match, which was just incredible.  He was--he was a politician.  Everybody says everything else.  He wanted to be Mayor Richard M. Daley and everyone thinks of all the good platitudes and all, he wanted to be a powerful politician because he said that was the way he thought he could influence and better help his community and people didn't understand that.
Speaker 1: But they don't think of him also having come out of the machine himself?
Speaker 2: No, that's right.  They don't think of that, right.
Story_ID: 71794
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Now, what were you--you were Chairman of the CHA [Chicago Housing Authority]?  What period was that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: That was the time--I was appointed to the CHA when I resigned from--when I determined that I was not going to run again for the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign], which would have been in '82' [1982], maybe.  I was appointed by [Mayor] Jane Byrne, which was something that I didn't have any choice but to accept.  It was a very difficult time.  I had resigned because I didn't want to be in that kind of a circumstance but I had to take it because of the kind of work that I do and I was--I was Chairman of the Finance Committee.  I don't know whether I was really Chairman of the Board but we ran most of the meetings and all.  I just don't recall that with [HM] Renault [Robinson] and we accomplished a lot.  We certainly worked together.  We were sincere.  It's the most difficult job I've ever had and the most depressing because we would meet in the neighborhoods and you would listen to the people who have so many needs, you know, just get my water to run, my toilet to work, and you would just be sick to hear them that you didn't have the money or didn't have the ability to fix it right away.  So that was the four years that I served on that Board, was extremely difficult, emotionally, I think, more than anything 'cause you weren't able to do the things you wanted to do.  And it was also difficult 'cause the press was on Renault, we're trying to help [HM] Renault [Robinson].  [HM] Renault [Robinson] didn't have all the experience to run it in a way that he should and we were trying to do that and, of course, they would say why don't I do it because of my background and experience but--we served on that and then when [Mayor] Harold [Washington] was elected, I was still on the Board.  I told him I wouldn't quit, I'd stay when he was there and I think I stayed for almost four years.  And I know when he was elected the second term, I was at his house the next day, or the day after, saying, you know, I'm quitting, Harold (laughter).  And he said, well I don't want it--it may look bad, it looked like I probably said, okay, how bad it looks, I did not want to do this anymore and so he took some names and replaced me from the CHA [Chicago Housing Authority], which was--it was an awful hard experience, although, hopefully, we got some things done.
Story_ID: 71795
Speaker 1: You know, when you ran for--University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign]'s been really a big part of your life, I mean, you went there, that's your alma mater, but you also, you know, you were talking about when you ran to be on the Board [of Directors].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, and you said it was, you know, you had a campaign--wait, you said there was a campaign but it's for a non-paid position (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: But what--why was that important?  It's a big deal here.
Speaker 2: Yes, it--you know, I didn't realize that much of the time, of course, the late Mayor [Richard J.] Daley is the one who sponsored me to run for it and when you get--now it's appointed, but at that time to run for a non-salaried position on a statewide basis, you have to really be committed to do what you want, you know, to be of service to your university.  So that at that time it really didn't matter whether the Republicans or the Democrats won because you all were sponsored by the Alumni Association and people who were committed to the university.  But when I became President, in fact I guess I, well I know that--the only person who's been black, who's been President of the University of Illinois and then I became President, I was able to accomplish a lot of things, like starting the Urban Health Program.  For instance, the consolidation of the medical school and Circle Campus [University of Illinois at Chicago] into UIC, I was very much involved in that and I saw that to make the University of Chicago, in Chicago, stronger than Urbana [Champaign], which had a provincial Southern Illinois philosophy 'cause I knew that if you put the medical school and all the money it brings and the undergraduate school together, you would have a financial giant that in all things academic or not, the money counts.  And as a result, UIC developed and grew more than it ever would have grown if we weren't able to put it together.  That I feel very good about, was one of the things we sponsored.  The medical school, we put in Peoria [Illinois], and in Springfield [Illinois] and things we've done.  I was not able to achieve a law school here, which is what I really wanted.  But I think we got a lot of things done during that period of time and that was--that was what I considered one of the greatest achievements and experiences that I've had.  And [HM] Isobel [Neal] was with me through all of that.  Enjoyed all of the meetings and was a very good partner.  And I think we developed all over the country.
Story_ID: 71796
Speaker 1: Now you also--I mean at this point that you're doing that, you're learning a lot about running an organization, which is different than running a, you know, a small firm?
Speaker 2: Yes, that is correct.
Speaker 1: And I want you to just talk about that, a little bit.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was interesting that you picked that up.  The University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign], when I first went there, its budget was, I thought was just tremendous.  It was a million dollars a day and they spent a million dollars a day, three hundred and some million a year and now, of course, it's a couple of billion, I think, or somewhere around that area.  But that was just a tremendous amount of money and, therefore, I began to learn management, not hands-on, but management from accountability and holding people accounted--accountable to do what they want to do.  And, therefore, I also learned how to manage a very strong, smart President of the University [of Illinois] and how to garner enough votes with my political strength--knowledge, to let him know that he couldn't do everything he wanted to do and, therefore, you gain, without saying it, respect, so that the President and I worked very closely together in a cooperative manner rather than in a single focus--President of the University [of Illinois] runs everything and the Board in those days but we changed that a little bit.  And we were able to develop, when he may not have been supportive of the Pavilion at UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago] and couldn't get the votes, we were able to handle that so that in all, I would say that my political experience helped me in managing and running the Board and knowing how to be effective, was very important in the University of Illinois but it also told me that there were a lot of people around smarter than you were who you needed to work for and you had to learn how to bring in the strongest financial person you could get and know enough about it to keep him accountable but at the same time to let him do his job.  So that it was a total new management experience, it was very helpful to me.  That and then being on the Board of all of the corporations.  And I would say the greatest experience I had in learning was being Chairman of the Finance Committee of Lincoln National [Insurance, Fort Wayne, Indiana].  Almost everything came through that committee, that the company did, and it was the strongest non-salaried position on the Board and I served in that capacity for maybe five years and that was real experience in learning how government works.  It was also nice to have a private jet take you around (laughter).  It's not bad.
Story_ID: 71797
Speaker 1: And that differed a lot from your experience with First Federal [Savings and Loan], where you were new-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to that?  That was--First Federal [Savings and Loan] was the early part?
Speaker 2: First Federal [Savings and Loan] was the early part of learning it and First Federal--First Federal [Savings and Loan] I learned that there was a person named Homer Livingston, whose dad had run First Federal [Savings and Loan], who came on the Board and he was an old friend of mine.  And I said, "Homer, I don't know as much about banking as you did because I always knew to be forthright and to get them to help you but if you'll do the banking, I'll do the outside bit and make us stronger in the community, in government, and in washing our relationship."  And he helped me a lot.  And he told me a lot of things about business that is so simple that you don't know now.  How do you turn around a company?  You hire somebody whose specialty is to turn around a company and then you leave town, tell him to do it.  And then you don't have all your personal conflicts as to who you hire but, of course, you keep a relationship with him.  But it's things like that that you never occur to you, you know.  You sit in and say, how do they do that?  They hired McKenzie, they brought in this, and you look at the companies, and you think, how do these guys run it?  And then you look at the Board and look what they're paying to the McKenzie's of the world, who come in and tell you this is what you've got to do.  So that all of it is--is really having the money and having the experience to know who to hire to make you successful and to not be hampered by your own ego.  I think with that you can be successful.
Story_ID: 71798
Speaker 1: Now Earl--you know what has always struck me about you and everyone-
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --I mean, talks about it-
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --is your, you know, what makes you, and I go back actually, you know, to your father 'cause he said, "What you take an iron fist and a velvet glove."
Speaker 2: Yes-
Speaker 1: What was the significance?
Speaker 2: --what is a gentleman?
Speaker 1: Do you need water, Scott [Stearns]?  Okay.
Speaker 2: He said, "A gentleman is a steel fist in a velvet glove" which meant to be very strong but to be smooth and to be able to understand and to be able to be acceptable as a person, as a facade that you always carry with you, to be a gentleman, and that's really what you have to do.  You can--and most people are, and I find this is trouble--troubles me with young lawyers or young professionals come along today, who tell me, "I've told him something, I'm going to make them respect me," instead of you earn respect.  If you're good at what you do, you don't have to tell anybody, they'll find out about it.  But I think you can't back up when it gets tough and that's what the iron fist is.  You have to be very strong 'cause there's going to be difficult times.  There's going to be very difficult times in any business.  There's going to be difficult decisions to make all along, so you have to be strong but you don't turn around.  And it's like in our business, very simply, when I tell someone a figure that I'm going to settle for, I don't change.  Don't come back to me tomorrow and ask for more.  I've told you and I was honest and I will stick with that 'cause then we have to meet and we'll fight, but we'll be pleasant when we fight.  So that I believe that integrity is the real key, hard work, to work harder than the next person, to know your own limitations and to learn from others.  The greatest, I believe, thing that has happened to me to be ever successful in lawsuit, is I listen to everyone 'cause you learn something from everyone, whereas most lawyers will turn 'em off, I don't need you, you know, I'm not going to use you.  I always listen and they'll tell me something that I can use.  I can remember one of the most difficult cases, and I should not name it, but one of the most difficult cases was a reapportionment case and I was sent to Zion, Illinois to give a lecture for the University of Illinois.  And one of the key witnesses was a young lady who was brought in as headlines that they found her and she knew more about it and all that.  That she was there just by chance.  And so we were in the pool together.  She was a wonderful swimmer and my hobby is that I swim every night, I haven't now but I always swam every night, and I told her that it was all right for us to talk if we never talked about the lawsuit because she was to testify that next Monday or Tuesday.  And we just talked, just generally about life but, you know, I got to know her.  And I realized back in the years what that did for me when I cross-examined her the next day because I knew what kind of a person she was because I knew when she says, "It's the haves and the have nots", I knew what she really meant by that and I knew, you know, a little bit about her husband.  So that most of the things in life is that you can learn from everyone and just listen a lot and then do the best you can and don't turn around, to keep going.
Speaker 1: When do you think you became really the epitome of your father's statement?  Because, you know, I'm struck by, you know, when I asked you earlier what type of child you were.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You were not that.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And I'm wondering when do you think, you know, that-
Speaker 2: Well I think it came out of--very good question, Julie[anna Richardson], and I haven't thought about that.  I believe that it came out of the difficulty in the lawsuits--discrimination lawsuits that I had, out of necessity of four circumstances, I had to be strong.  And then I realized that I didn't--my very nature was not to be abrasive and to make friends.  So it was that combination of a trying time when I knew I had to be very strong and my nature in trying to be always a gentleman, and forthright, I think produced whatever my ultimate personality is now except that I know that I don't know very much.  Before I thought I knew a lot of everything.  Now I know I've got an awful lot to learn and I think that's part of growing up, too, when you realize you aren't so smart, that you have a lot to learn.  And I think you get that as the older you get, the more you know about.
Speaker 1: That's a very youthful statement-
Speaker 2: Yes (Laughing).
Speaker 1: --coming a seasoned gentleman, that's a very youthful statement.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 71799
Speaker 1: I want--when you look at the black community and where it stands right now, and where you've come through, what are your, you know, what are your hopes and concerns about that candidate?
Speaker 2: Primarily, I'm concerned that I don't see the drive.  What I see that throughout society, I think, it's not only limited to the black community but I think we can't afford--we cannot afford not to have the drive to be successful or to contribute to society.  And I think now for many blacks who have an opportunity to learn and grow, they also have an opportunity not to work too hard and let things flow.  I don't see as much entrepreneurship in the black community as I saw before because it's easy to work for a big corporation and now it's more lucrative.  And I know it's happening in the white community too but when we don't control our own destiny, our own business, we're not going to grow and develop as a society.  I think, of course, drugs are terrible, as I've said many times.  I think the fact that we haven't really started enough of our own businesses to hire people and control it ourselves, the fact that we don't have enough capital to do things, and the fact that we aren't focusing on that, and so many of us can live comfortably in a less than driving way, is the difficulty I see now in the black community.  We've got to get back on being independent, being strong and being part of the total fabric of America and not dropping out, which we did for a while, and I think that's not good.
Speaker 1: And when you say, when we did for a while, would you consider that the '60s' [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes, I think then we were just angry and it's all right to be angry if you hold it inside.  And I know a lot of lawyers now, a couple who are very successful say to me, I was just angry, I hated the system.  I was angry all the time, I fought it all the time and they--now that they've mellowed, they now realize I can be successful.  I can hire people.  I can buy things.  I can get into business.  I can do it in the right way and that's part of what we've got to learn and grow.  So many young are still angry, with some justification.  I guess we are--stop something. Well, we're going to stop but I just need a few--just--I just need a few more questions and we'll be done.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  You want to change, you've got two minutes (unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought you were, okay, I got-
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought he was telling us to stop, okay.
Speaker 1: I thought you gave me a signal, okay.

Speaker 1: I want to know when Earl Neal went from, and you may say this was not you, but when Earl Neal went from Earl Neal the--the "Uncle Tom" to not being "Uncle Tom", do you know when that--was that during [Mayor] Harold Washington?  Do you--I mean, did you ever feel like you had to prove something back or was that not really important to you?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, it was always very important to me, to make a contribution to the community, and I believe that it was understanding of how you make a contribution to the community that made me change that I realize suddenly that in these lawsuits, although I might be on one side, that I still could make, perhaps, a greater contribution to the black cause, society, than if I were to stay out of it because who else would be in it?  It was a tough learning experience because it was so easy just to drop out and not do.  And I believe that the development through that period of time, that tough period of time, that gave me a comfort level that, yeah, I'm going to stay in this business, I'm going to make money, and I'm going to compete with everybody and I'm going to have every lawyer who stands up there is going to say, "Mr. Neal", without me telling them.  I think it was during that period of time that I grew and developed.  And then, of course, from that you begin to give back and you have opportunities, and you don't have to be so consumed about just making a living.  And then the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign] opportunity came along which was--gave me an opportunity to make a great contribution.
Story_ID: 71801
Speaker 1: --Now when you look at the, you know, law and the black community, and I want to--I'm saying law as a career-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, you know, you look at the time your father came through and, you know, even with people who went to a great law schools-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --they're, you know-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --they have to find other ways to making a living, and here you came through, you know-
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, a whole new generation is coming through and I'm wondering, would you advocate--I mean your son is, you know, involved in your legacy, but would you advocate law as a career now?
Speaker 2: I thought you might say that.  You know, I see--I spend, oh, I did before I was until recently, I would spend at least half a day a week with young persons trying to encourage, young African American, encouraging them.  I rarely would recommend law for a lot of reasons.  One, is that the law business, like the medical business, is not as lucrative as it used to be and that it's become so expensive to practice the kind of law that you must, that you're unable to serve the people who you would like to serve, at least it gave me the pleasure.  It's the little person who comes back and says, "Your father closed my home, would you help me now."  That you'd like to help but you can't afford to because of the high cost.  So that the law, as a profession, is gradually fading.  The law is now a business.  It's how much money do you make and how big is your business instead of what do you do to give back or how do you best perform your profession.  So that I think that since law has become a business, why don't you just go into business where you can make more money in an easier way?  That's part of it.  The second part of it is that there are so many opportunities in the corporate world now that you didn't make a lot of money, when I came along, even whites in the corporate world as they do now with the, you know, benefits, stock options and benefits and salaries and opportunities and retirements at an early age that I think one, there's greater opportunity in the corporate world than there is in law.  Two, that law has to a great extent, lost its professionalism, giving back, giving--providing the greatest service that you can.  So three, that's become a business so you've got to measure the law in terms of a business and what is the best business unless you want to teach, unless you philosophically want to do something in the law, unless maybe you want to go into government, I think law is a good--but I'm talking about a pure practicing attorney, I think you have to have other measures to waive before you would do it.  So I do not recommend it for most unless I see that one, that they have to have an opportunity to compete with the best lawyers coming out of the country, 'cause they're hiring just the best now, coming out of good schools, doing well, or they have some special niche that they can do.  That unless you have this, and are just going to be an ordinary student coming out of an ordinary school, you ought to do something else.  So I think the legal profession, I think, has lost a lot of its professionalism.  I think it's lost a lot of its drive to do what you want to do as a lawyer and I believe that's becoming a business so that you must measure it like any other business.  Where do I fit best?  Where can I make the greatest contribution?  Where can I make the most money?  And those are decisions that I wouldn't have made before as a lawyer.  You're a lawyer because you want to be a professional and give back in the way you can as a lawyer and I think that's fading, and I'm disappointed.

Speaker 1: And with it as a business--with it as a business--I have two questions about that to follow, but with it as a business, how can someone really be successful?  Is it that because you have a niche?  They're going to pull you away?  Oh, no, okay.  It's because they're going to pull you (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's all right, that's okay, sorry.  It's all right.
Speaker 1: But is it because--do you make it because you focus or do you--I mean, how is someone like, let's say someone gets started.  This is-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right here, there's a legacy here-
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --you know, and there-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --there's a client base-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --there's a history here.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But for people starting out and approaching it, how are they--what is the business of law nowadays?  Because-
Speaker 2: The business of law is--the business of law is getting business.  You're going to have to do two things:  One, you're going to be one of the smart and bright lawyers, going to a big law firm, that you become associated with a very successful lawyer with a lot of business and he lets you share in it because you're smart and you're helping him and you know more than he does and he's big enough to share it with you.  That's one way to be successful.  The other way is that you join a small niche firm and you work like the devil and you develop a reputation where you can develop a business.  But the end of the day is, what is your business?  We have lawyers here which is different than any other law firm, have been here forever, and they're having trouble with their transition, that I never want anyone to bring in any business because I had more business than we could handle.  So I would say if you take care of it, you don't need to bring in the business.  And now as you change into the new philosophy, it's going to be difficult for the older lawyers to make that change and I think as a young lawyer coming out, you better know where you're going and what you're going to do and be very dedicated or else you aren't going to have an opportunity in the law.  It's all about business.
Speaker 1: Now, what are you disappointed with about the profession?  You talked about that.  What does-
Speaker 2: I'm disappointed because people are not giving back to the people in need.  We aren't--we aren't--we don't have the professionalism we used to have.  For instance, you don't--you get letters from lawyers, you know, if you don't go into court, you miss something this day, they'll do anything to you that they can.  When I came along, we would always say, oh, he must be sick, there must be something wrong, I'll call him, I'll put the case over, I'll help.  There was a professionalism that we shared and a camaraderie that we shared, all of that's gone now.  And you have to watch what you write.  You have to watch every letter.  You have to watch every phone call.  You got to--I threw away my diary in February of every year because I know if somebody takes my deposition, they want to know what I said to somebody on a certain day and I figured I just don't keep it.  It's a whole different menu that you've got to go through in being a lawyer now.  And the question is, as always, what do you want to be?  And in closing I would say, the main thing in life is, is to sing in the morning, to feel happy about what you're doing, so do what makes you sing in the morning and feel good about life, that's what's important.  The rest of it, comes and goes.
Story_ID: 71803
Speaker 1: And what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Just, "Earl Neal, a nice guy who worked hard", and that's really all.  There's nothing I've done or nothing I've achieved that I really want to be known for, that sort of thing.  I just want to be known as someone who gave his best, to do his best, through a lot of tough times.  I think that's it.
Story_ID: 71804
Speaker 1: And what do you hope of your family legacy lives on?
Speaker 2: I don't really look forward to a legacy.  I really think in terms of my son being successful with a good family, four grandkids, that they'll do well, that they'll be happy, and I see that more important now than through my life when I thought you had to be successful, make money, you know, don't be poor, drive, I see now to be happy and enjoy life, is what it's about, in a good way, and to give back, that's so important now and I see that more importantly now than I did than when I was coming up.  So legacy I would say is for them to have a happy life and a full life and to go to those private schools that I couldn't have afforded to send them to.  But all of that's good for them.
Speaker 1: And, one last question, and that is now, at this point, what does Earl Neal still want to do with his life?
Speaker 2: Well, my wife says I should-[HM] Isobel [Neal] says I should stop working and enjoy life with her, which I do enjoy an awful lot now but I find that I still want to continue in the business and to contribute to whatever I can to make my son as successful as he can be and I want to continue to work and to give back and I like doing projects that are meaningful to the City [Chicago, Illinois] and to society.  I like contributing now, without worrying about how much I make.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're done.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yup, we're done.
