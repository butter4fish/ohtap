Speaker 2: Probably autumn.
Speaker 1: All right. Now, when you go on a vacation, where do you like to go the most?
Speaker 2: Well, being in The 5th Dimension, we traveled so much. Another interviewer asked me that question, of all the places you've been, where would--did you like to go the most? I said, "Home." (Laughter) I love to travel and my wife [Mieko Tone McLemore] loves to travel, so we've been halfway around the world. But now I want to go back and see the places that I didn't really see, besides the auditoriums, you know, and the airports and stuff. So, we're planning a trip right now to go to the Panama Canal, and then Croatia, and the Black Sea; so, places I haven't been, so--

Story_ID: 482707
Speaker 1: Now, we're going to talk about your family and your family tree, okay. Tell me your mother's name.
Speaker 2: June McLemore [June Shaver McLemore].
Speaker 1: And do you know when she was born?
Speaker 2: In 1914, in June--
Speaker 1: Where?
Speaker 2: June 3rd.  Arkansas. Black Rock, Arkansas, wherever that is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I tried to find it on the map, and I haven't been able to find it yet (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay. Now do you know her parents, or did you know her parents?
Speaker 2: Yes. Her mother was a Cherokee Indian [Native American], and her mother, I mean her father was black. And he worked on the railroad way back in slavery days. And they were going through Oklahoma and they just rode right through my poor grandmother's reservation and just took it over, just ran the train right through it. So, she was almost sitting on the side of the road homeless with her brother. And he kept sneaking food over to her, you know, and they got to be friends. So, he invited her to come and live with him in Black Rock. And my grandmother had a brother and she wanted hi- she couldn't leave him, so he invited him too. And it's kind of a sad story, because when they went to Black Rock--her brother was like a Cherokee Indian, you know, with braided hair, a really handsome looking guy, well-built. And all the girls would start pulling his hair and all that, you know, when he was walking down the street. So, they were very prejudiced then, and the white guys didn't like it. And they went and saw him one day when the girls were playing with him, and grabbed him and tied him to a tree and tarred and feathered him and just set him on fire. And my grandmother was coming down the street and saw this. And she used to tell us this story. She said, "I'm not telling you this story to hate anybody. It's just that if God can forgive, then who am I?"
Speaker 1: Okay. Tell me, do you know your grandparents', their names?
Speaker 2: Gertrude Whitecloud [Gertrude Whitecloud Shaver] was my grandmother's name. And my grandfather's name was Charles Shaver [Lucian C. Shaver, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Shaver?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay. As a child, did you visit your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to Black Rock one time I remember. I still can't find it on the map. Even people who live in Black Rock can't find it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you, so do you remember any time spent with them?
Speaker 2: No. Well, you had to take trains then. And I remember going from Black Rock to St. Louis [Missouri], and I saw this white cow, and my aunt always reminded me of it. I said, "Look, there's a nice clean cow." (Laughter) I'd never seen a white one before.
Story_ID: 482708
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about your father.
Speaker 2: What I can tell you about him? Um--
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Herman McLemore, we called him J.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I have two sisters [Merilyn McLemore Saunders and Joan McLemore Truelove] and one brother [Donald McLemore]. And I was born in a garage in St. Louis [Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, before we get to when you were born, is there anything that you can tell me about your dad?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember that he was part-musician. See, he left when I was five years old, so I didn't really get to know him that that well. I'll tell you more about him later on. But--
Speaker 1: Okay. What about his parents? Did you know your grandparents on his side?
Speaker 2: No, I never met them.
Story_ID: 482709
Speaker 1: How much education did your mother have?
Speaker 2: I think she finished the fifth or sixth grade. My grandmother [Gertrude Whitecloud Shaver] never finished the third grade, but she couldn't read or write, but she always had this wisdom, the Indian [Native American] wisdom that she passed on to me. People say, "Well, she's living her life through you." I'll tell you a lot of things that she taught me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Well, tell me some of the things about your grandmother. What did she teach you, or what were some of the things that you remember about her?
Speaker 2: Everything (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: Out of all my brothers and sisters, I mean, she used to just pick on me. You know, "Well, I want to tell you this, and how to do this and do that." I said, "Grandma, I just, I just want to go and play ball, you know. Why don't you tell some of my other brothers and sisters?" She said, "Look, when you grow up, you're going to be the wisest one in your family, and you're going to end up taking care of your whole family. So sit down, and I'm going to tell you this now." I said, "This lady got to be crazy," you know. And you know what I'm doing today? I'm taking care of them. And how she could see that, I don't know.
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that she told you?
Speaker 2: Well, she was very instrumental in, I want to say everything that I did. Because I don't care what the situation was, she taught me how to handle it. And she taught me one thing about, there's no such thing as a problem. I said, "Are you kidding?" I said, "You mean a man with an incurable cancer don't have no problem?" She said, "No, he's got an incurable cancer. Now, is he going to worry about it and get ulcers on top of it, or is he going to say, 'How many days I got to live?' and party on out of here," (laughter) you know. So she said, "There's only situations, and you can deal with situations."
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Now, tell me about your brothers and sisters. Tell me their names and where you fit in.
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest. And I have a sister named Merilyn [Merilyn McLemore Saunders] and she died of cancer a few years ago. And I have a surviving brother named Don McLemore [Donald McLemore], and a surviving sister, Joan McLemore [Joan McLemore Truelove]. Truelove now, her married name. And my mother is still alive, June McLemore [June Shaver McLemore], and she's ninety-three years old this year.
Story_ID: 482710
Speaker 1: What was your earliest childhood memory? What is your childhood--earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Being born in a dresser drawer and sleeping with--well, my father [Herman McLemore] ran off and left us one--just left a note one day and said, "I can't hang no more with four kids sleeping in a garage and in a dresser drawer," you know. And I slept on the bottom with my feet hanging out, because I was the oldest and the biggest. And my sister [Merilyn McLemore Saunders] was in the next drawer, and my other brother [Donald McLemore] was in the next one. They had little tabs on the drawers so we wouldn't fall out, and it had blankets and pillows in it. And my mother [June Shaver McLemore] slept on an army cot with my youngest daughter--I mean daughter--my youngest sister [Joan McLemore Truelove]. And that's probably what I remember the most. And finally when I was going to school, they bought me my first real pair of shoes. And I came home one day, and my mother said, "Where is your shoes?" I said, "Well, a little kid down the street didn't have no shoes, so I gave them to him." (Laughter) That didn't go over too good.
Speaker 1: Your, your mother, did she work outside the home?
Speaker 2: She was a maid, working--she was working at the house, in the garage where we were staying. She was the, the maid for those people; that's why we stayed in that garage. But that's what she always did.
Speaker 1: And this was in St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: St. Louis, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 482711
Speaker 1: Tell me about the neighborhood in which you grew up. Who lived in the community?
Speaker 2: Us (laughter). That's all I knew, being that young. And then we moved all around St. Louis [Missouri]. And finally my mother [June Shaver McLemore] had my father [Herman McLemore] put in the [U.S. military] service. She had him found, and they put him in the service. So, they sent money from the service, so that's how we survived. But then we got a little two-room house that had an outdoor toilet, a number two tub hanging on the back porch. Man, I mean it was awful. Near the Mississippi River, and when the Mississippi River used to over- flood, all that crap would come up. Man, but the kids loved it because we didn't have to go to school. We'd run outside and jump in it, talking about surf's up (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was the area in which you lived at that time?
Speaker 2: South St. Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay. And tell me about that neighborhood.
Speaker 2: It was rough. We lived between Monsanto Chemical [Monsanto Chemical Company; Monsanto Company] and the packinghouse. And so, you know how the smell was there, you know. But we survived. And, and the packinghouse, my mother knew a guy that worked there, and he liked my mother. So he said, "At five o'clock at closing, just come by the window." And he'd just throw out all the chitlins and pig feet and pig tails that they didn't want. So, I was out there trying to catch it and take it home. And hey, we survived off of that, you know. My wife [Mieko Tone McLemore] calls it body parts.
Story_ID: 482712
Speaker 1: Tell me about school, elementary school.
Speaker 2: Well, we lived way in the south side of St. Louis [Missouri]. And we were trying to go to a better school, so my mother [June Shaver McLemore] gave my aunt's address where I would stay, so that I could go out on the west side to go to school. So I started school out there, and it was a pretty good education. Then I had to--when I moved up a grade, I had to move back to the ghetto school, okay. So when I went to the school they sent me to, gave me the room to go into, and I went in the wrong room. They said, "Go in 304, and I went in 403." Well, in 403 they were taking the tests for all the kids that--they were trying to move them up, because they were overage and all. Some would call them class dummies, so to speak, you know, and they'd give them a test to see who could move up. So I went in and I said, "God, the first day I got a test?" So, I took the test. And they said, "Well, you made the highest grade in here, you know. Okay, so we're going to move you up to the next grade." They thought I was in there about--you know, for real. So I got a double, just for no reason at all. It wasn't because I was smart (laughter), happened to be in the right place at the right time.
Speaker 1: Well, what type of student were you?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Mischievous. I wasn't--I'm still not too smart, but I mean, enough to get by, you know. So all I wanted to do was play ball and all, like the rest of the kids. But I think algebra was probably my hardest subject, and nobody in my family knew anything about algebra. I don't know how I got a passing grade in that to this day. And I was in the school band, and I played drums with--[HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory was in the band. And Ron Townson [Ronald Townson], who was, ended up being a member of The 5th Dimension, he was in the choir. They were ahead of me, but they were--they graduated before me, but they were in school at the same time.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me the name of this elementary school.
Speaker 2: The elementary school?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Lincoln and Cote Brilliante [Cote Brilliante Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Lincoln?
Speaker 2: Lincoln High, no, Lincoln Grade School [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Cote Brilliante.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Cote Brilliante?
Speaker 2: Cote Bri- C-O-T-E Brilliante. And I went to Sumner High School [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri].
Story_ID: 482713
Speaker 1: Now, back to the community in which you lived. The people that lived in the community, what type of jobs did they have?
Speaker 2: In St. Louis [Missouri] then they were either waiters, or worked on the railroad, or post office, or maids or butlers, you know.
Speaker 1: Were there other single-family homes?
Speaker 2: Where I lived it was like a fourplex with the outdoor toilet. Everybody had a number two tub on the back porch (laughter). And that toilet was so bad, boy, look here, I refused to go to the toilet. So, I was so constipated until I got to school on Monday (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. But my, but my question about single-family homes, were most of the families in your immediate area, did they just have one parent in the home, or were there two?
Speaker 2: I'd say 50 percent of them didn't have fathers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One person in the whole neighborhood, about a half-mile square area had a telephone. So, we used to wear her out.
Story_ID: 482714
Speaker 1: What about radio and television programs?
Speaker 2: Well, they had black and white TV then. And up on the main street we knew one guy, this white guy, had a TV place. And he knew we didn't have TVs, so he'd set up speakers and put the TV in the window at night, and we all brought our chairs up so we could watch--he left the TV on so we could watch it. (Laughter) So that's how we watched TV. And then they said color, they're going to have color TV. I said, "How are you going to have color TV? There ain't no way." (Laughter) So then they got the big old screen with the rainbow in it, and we put it in front of the screen to make, make homemade colors (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Color. What were some of the programs that you watched?
Speaker 2: 'The Shadow Knows' [sic. 'The Shadow'] and--oh, those were radio shows.
Speaker 1: Radio.
Speaker 2: I don't even remember what was on.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about radio. What radio programs did you listen to?
Speaker 2: 'The Lone Ranger' and 'The Green Hornet' (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you, did you have a radio at home?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a radio.
Speaker 1: Okay. What about music? We're in probably 1946, '48 [1948], '49 [1949]. What music were you listening to?
Speaker 2: Then I wasn't even interested in music. I just wanted to play ball and be a gangster probably, (laughter) to survive in the neighborhood [in St. Louis, Missouri].
Story_ID: 482715
Speaker 1: Why did you need to be a gangster to survive in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: What do you mean by gangster? Let's start off with that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, every neighborhood had a gang. You couldn't go in another neighborhood wearing the wrong colors. And it's still the same today almost, you know. So, you had to have your boys in order to go someplace. So, you just learned how to survive, that's all.
Speaker 1: What about jobs? Did you have any jobs that you did as a young child?
Speaker 2: You say child--
Speaker 1: Well, ten or twelve years old.
Speaker 2: Even today I ain't got no job (laughter). But yeah, I always wanted to work, just try and make my own little money. But my mother's brother was a mechanic, and he used to give me little odd jobs, you know, coming in, whatever. And newspapers--when I was seven years old, eight years old, I was trying to sell newspapers, that big old Sunday paper. And I couldn't carry but two papers, they were taller than I was. So if I made five cents, I was happy as--
Speaker 1: Okay. Were there organized sports? You said you liked to play ball.
Speaker 2: Organized?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: My base- my first baseball glove was a paper sack with some rags in it (laughter). And if we ever got ahold of a ball, that poor ball would last for three years. We'd tape it up and tie more strings on it.
Speaker 1: So you played basically in the street (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the sandlot and in the streets, you know.
Speaker 1: In the streets, okay.
Speaker 2: Corkball, that was with the tennis ball and the broomstick; we played that a lot.
Speaker 1: What was it called?
Speaker 2: Corkball, K--C-O-R-K.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the big game in the streets; that's where I really learned how to pitch. And then my mother [June Shaver McLemore], we used to--well, she was half Cherokee Indian [Native American], and she just loved to run. And so we could hardly outrun her, but you know, I'd try anyway. If I did something bad, so since I could outrun her, she'd take off her shoe and throw it at me, and the shoe would turn the corner and hit me upside the head. And I'd come and say, "How'd you throw that shoe?" (Laughter) So, that's how I learned to throw the curveball; she showed me how to hold the shoe.
Story_ID: 482716
Speaker 1: Now, in school, can you remember any of the teachers in your elementary school?
Speaker 2: The music teacher was very good, he was very helpful. I've forgot his name. But one teacher, the only class I ever failed in, was this teacher who was a little on the other side. And he asked me, "Well, if you want a job, come over and wash my windows." And one of the kids told me, "You don't want to go over there and wash no windows." So I said, "I don't think so." He said, "Why?" I said, "I just don't want to." And he failed me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay. Were there any teachers who were inspirational or encouraging?
Speaker 2: Well, they were all very good teachers. The music teacher was probably the most encouraging.
Speaker 1: Were your teachers black or white?
Speaker 2: All black. I went to an all-black school.
Speaker 1: Okay. Were they male or female?
Speaker 2: Both. The music teacher was male, and the guy that failed me was male. The rest of them were female.
Story_ID: 482717
Speaker 1: Did you go from elementary school to high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: No middle school?
Speaker 2: No middle school.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, tell me again the name of the high school that you went to (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sumner [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri], S-U-M-N-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay. And tell me about your high school years.
Speaker 2: I was just av- an average student, you know. I was mischievous like most other kids, but I was really involved in, in sports, and the drum and bugle corps, and drums in high school. So, I enjoyed going to school, and I never played hooky. So guys said, "What's wrong with you, man, come on and play hooky once." So I said, "Okay, I'll play hooky one day." And I played hooky one day, and it was freezing outside. So we went to a little restaurant across the street from the school and waited for school to let out. I said, "Well, what kind of hooky is this?" (Laughter) I said, "I'd rather stay in the school building and be warm, you know." So, I never played hooky again.
Story_ID: 482718
Speaker 1: What type of relationship did you have with your mother [June Shaver McLemore]? How was she, was she a, a strict disciplinarian?
Speaker 2: Well, she worked all the time. And so, and my [maternal] grandmother [Gertrude Whitecloud Shaver] moved in to stay with us and take care of us. And she was, well, she couldn't catch us, but (laughter), but we minded her very much. And her son, my uncle, was the disciplinarian, you know. Whenever something would go wrong, man she'd call him. And I'd say, "Uh-oh." His name was Ray [ph.]. So one time my grandmother--I'd done something wrong man, and so she got the strap and was trying to whip me. And I ran up under the bed like I would always do when she tried to whip me. And she tried--she'd go all around, and couldn't hit me. And all of a sudden my uncle came over with one of his friends. He said, "Well, what?" She said, "Lamonte's [HistoryMaker Lamonte McLemore] been messing up; he's up under the bed." He said, "What?" He told his friend to go grab the bed on the other side. So, they raised the bed up. And she was slapping and, "Where is he?" I was hanging over the bed like this (gesture) (laughter). They laughed so hard they had to let me go.
Story_ID: 482719
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about religion in your family.
Speaker 2: My [maternal] grandmother [Gertrude Whitecloud Shaver] made us all go to church. She was a Methodist, so I was born- rai- baptized a Methodist. But I went to a Baptist church with some friends. And I took Catholic instruction so I could get in their dances on Wednesday, because there was a girl that I liked (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. Anything else that you can remember about church?
Speaker 2: About church? Yep, being baptized. I said, "Grandma, do I really have to?" So they poured this water all over me and whatever, you know, but it, so I was baptized.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a little church. Had a little stove in the middle of the floor for heating the whole place. And nobody wanted to sit close to it because it was too hot. And if you got too far away, you were too cold, you know. It was just one little one-room church on the corner.
Story_ID: 482720
Speaker 1: Well, tell me, what were holidays like?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, all the kids loved holidays to get out of school. But even as poor as we were, we never seemed to want for anything, you know. Because we knew we couldn't get it no way, so we didn't want that much. So if we wanted one thing, they always found a way to try to get it for you, you know so. And there was even pride in the ghetto, you know. I mean, because there wasn't much money around. And sometimes when the kids would get something to eat or when something special came by, they'd come, "(Unclear)," you know. So one day the kids were outside eating a sandwich, and just laughing about it; it was a thing about the food. So we'd get ready to go out, and we were almost in tears. And my gran- my mother [June Shaver McLemore] would say, "Come here." So she took this bacon rind and greased our mouth, "Now go on out there and tell them (unclear)," looked like we had eaten already (laughter). Yeah, the best we had was some jam sandwiches, two pieces of bread jammed together. So, it was interesting.
Speaker 1: What about the different types of foods that were prepared in your house? Was there any difference because your mother was half Cherokee and your [maternal] grandmother [Gertrude Whitecloud Shaver] was Cherokee? Were there different types of food that were served?
Speaker 2: Well, she was married to my grandfather [Lucian C. Shaver, Sr.], so I mean he liked to cook. So she learned how to cook soul food, basically. We cooked whatever could come in the house. And my Uncle Ray [ph.], the one who--my favorite uncle--he's dead now. But he would go hunting all the time and come back with anything. Whatever it was, coon [raccoon], possum, rattlesnake meat--I mean we, we eat everything.
Story_ID: 482721
Speaker 1: So now, you're preparing to, to graduate from high school [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri]. Do you remem- what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Fifty-two [1952]. Nineteen fifty-two [1952].
Speaker 1: Okay. So what were the thoughts on your mind about what you would do after high school?
Speaker 2: Can I really say it? "Oh, shit," (laughter). It was like that. I, you know, what do you really want to do? Well, I go back to a story about my [maternal] grandmother [Gertrude Whitecloud Shaver], you know, and it really had an influence on my life. But I wanted to play ball more than anything, okay. So I went--well, I'll tell you this first. I went out and tried out for the St. Louis Cardinals. That's back when the Dodgers [Brooklyn Dodgers; Los Angeles Dodgers]--and Larry Doby were the first black player and all, you know, so it was trying to open up. Well, they had a call, a tryout, but they didn't say black or white; you know, they said tryout, you know. So, me and three other gu- black guys, went out to try out. And we knew we were going to have to run faster, eat more dirt, hit harder and all, you know, throw, throw harder. And that day all four of us did exceptionally well. Man, the guy said, "You guys are great, man." We said, "Well, all right." So I got home and my mother [June Shaver McLemore] said, "How did you do?" I said, "Oh, we did great, man." She said, "What happened?" I said, "They said they going to call us." She said, "Well, how they going to call you, and you ain't got no phone?" (Laughter) So, "Oh, man." So, there went my Cardinals. But then I wanted to buy this Marty Marion shortstop glove; he was a St. Louis shortstop, a St. Louis Cardinals shortstop. And they had a glove for sale, and I think it was like fifteen dollars, which was probably a hundred and fifty today, you know. So, I was determined to get this glove. And I went out, man I sold papers, I sold everything I could, man. And I finally got this money, and I was the only kid in the neighborhood with this glove. Boy, that night I went to the store--but it was dark after that. So I went and tried to get the kids to come and play ball with me. And it was a monsoon outside, said, "Oh, man, are you crazy?" So I went home, and they wouldn't come out and play. And that's when my grandmother looked at my face and said, "Boy, what's wrong with you?" I said, "I'm so bored." She said, "Let me tell you something about boredom." She said, "If you ever trace the path to boredom, it always leads back to you."
Story_ID: 482722
Speaker 1: So you were telling me about your [maternal] grandmother [Gertrude Whitecloud Shaver], who told you about boredom.
Speaker 2: Yeah. She said, "If you ever trace the path of boredom, it will always lead back to you, meaning that you are a boring person," so (laughter), well, "And remember, you're only bored because you want to be." (Laughter) I said, "Grandmother, why would I want to be bored?" She said, "Think about it. Because as soon as you don't want to be bored, you're not bored no more. Okay?" She said, "It's okay to be bored, but be good and bored. Say, 'Today I'm going to be bored,' so just revel in it, you know." But she said, "You know, if you take three things and, that you want to do in life," and this is what changed my whole life around, said, "pick three things, and if you put a 100 percent into something, you get a 100 percent back. If you put 50 percent into something, you get 50 percent back, 25 percent. So, what's the first thing you want--?" She said, "I know what that is, baseball. Okay, so it's a monsoon outside and you can't play baseball. So, what would you do next?" "Well, photography." "Okay, well, you can always do photography if you can't play ball. Okay, and so you just have another hobby for three things, what would be the third?" I said, "I don't know." She said, "Well, think about it." I forgot all about it man, months passed. Just out of nowhere, she came up, "Boy, what's that third thing?" (Laughter) "Oh, Grandma." And so, "Singing." I lied (laughter). But I'd just come from the neighborhood down on the corner, and all the guys were down there doo-wopping and all. And one of the guys just happened to ask me, "Lamonte [HistoryMaker Lamonte McLemore], come here, we need a bass singer, man." I said, "I don't want to sing." "Oh, come on, man." And all the girls sitting around said, "Just say bop a bop bop." I said, "Okay, bop a bop, bop." And all of a sudden it sounded pretty good, and the girls all cheered. And I said, "Oh, yeah." And that's when I went home, that's why I said singing. She said, "Okay. Well, baseball, photography, and singing is your three things. So, concentrate on those." And baseball, I was signed by the Dodgers [Los Angeles Dodgers] farm system. Photography, I was the first black photographer to ever work for Harper's Bazaar and for Motown. I shot Stevie Wonder's first [sic.] album ['Stevie at the Beach'] cover, Supremes [The Supremes], Temptations [The Temptations]. I mean I shot every- I know everybody in, in the business. And singing, just by accident, The 5th Dimension turned out to be number two to The Beatles.
Speaker 1: So now she's telling you these things, and this is before or after you graduate from high school [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Before.
Speaker 1: Before you graduate from high school.
Story_ID: 482723
Speaker 1: So, what do you decide that you're going to do after high school [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: I was trying to play ball, but it was so hard to get into it, you know. I mean little Jackie Robinson and all of them had just broken the color barrier, but I wanted to play for, maybe start out in the Negro League like they did. You know, I was really young. When I graduated from high school I was fifteen, you know, so I mean I didn't know what to do. So, but by Jackie Robinson going into the Major League [Major League Baseball], once that barrier was broken, that killed the, the Negro baseball league, because all the players were going to the Majors then, you know. So I said, well, you know, the only thing I can think of is going into the [U.S. military] service. But my mother [June Shaver McLemore] wanted me to go to college, so I went to Chicago [Illinois] to, to enroll into a college there. And I knew these gangsters (laughter), because I used to visit my aunt. And so they said, "Hey, man, you want to make some money?" "Well, yeah," I said, "what do you have to do?" They said, "You don't have to do nothing but just run packages." "Run packages?" I said, "Okay." "Yeah, you can make fifty dollars man a week, or something." "Yeah, that sounds great." So they said, "Well, tonight you stand on this corner. And when Freddie [ph.] comes down he's going to hand you a package, and you just go through this gangway and jump over the fence and take it to this basement and drop it off." I said, "Yeah, okay." So I'm standing on the corner, 45th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue] in Chicago (laughter). And man, here comes this guy running down the street, and I hear these sirens. And the guy came, ran, and just threw the package at me, man, bam. So I remembered to run, so I started running. And the police cars jumped out, man, "Halt, or we'll shoot." I'm sure he didn't say halt first. I knew he, (imitates gunfire) and then said halt. But at the alley was a little place where they put the garbage cans. Well, I put the garbage can where I could jump on it and hop over the fence. And fortunately, when I turned that corner, (imitates gunfire) I felt something hit me in the back. "Oh, Lord, I'm shot." So I dropped the package and jumped over the fence and ran to the basement where I was supposed to deliver it. And the guy said, "Well hey, where's the package?" I said, "Man, Freddie gave it to me, but I dropped it." They guy said, "You lying." Said, put a knife up under my throat said, "You better not lie." Said, "You lying." He was kind of crazy, one of the gang members. And the guy said, "Hold on, hold on." I said, "Well, turn on the police station. I'm not--." What made me say turn on the police banner, I do not know. The man upstairs said, turned it on, "Well, Car 92 got one suspect, and another one hit," you know. They said, "He's telling the truth, put the knife away." The guy said, "You know what? I ought to kill you, but this time I'm going to let you go. If you ever say anything to anybody." "Y'all ain't got to worry about nothing." (Laughter) So when I got out of there, man, I, I ran to the recruiting office. Look, I got to get out of here, man. So they made me an offer I couldn't refuse.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: I went into the [U.S.] Navy.
Speaker 1: Navy, okay. Now, you're only fifteen. Did your mother have to sign for you to go in?
Speaker 2: Well, first, I, I was hit by a brick; I wasn't really shot.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The brick, the brick hit my head and blood was (unclear) said, "Oh, Lord." It just scraped me. I mean, I come that close to being not even here today.
Story_ID: 482724
Speaker 1: You said that you went into the [U.S.] Navy. And I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did your mother [June Shaver McLemore] have to sign for you to go into the Navy?
Speaker 2: I called up my mother and said, "Well you know what? I know you want me to go to college, but I want, I want to go in the Navy." She said, "Well, you can go to college." I said, "Well, you know what? If I go in the Navy, the Navy will pay for it; you won't have to rake and scrape." So that kind of made sense to her, you know. So I talked her into it, so she signed me into the Navy, you know, so.
Speaker 1: So what was your, was this your first time away from home?
Speaker 2: In the Navy? Yeah, for any length of time, yeah.
Speaker 1: So tell me about that experience.
Speaker 2: Well, they didn't have--just trains then. So I'm getting on this train getting ready to go to--they asked me about Great Lakes [Naval Station Great Lakes, Lake County, Illinois]. That's where I had just came from with all that trouble. No, I didn't want to go to Great Lakes. All them gangsters (laughter), they all knew me. So, I wanted to go to California anyway, so they sent me to San Diego [California]. But before that, when I went to sign up for the Navy I was going to try to be slick, you know. So I said, I went into the recruiting office and said, "Hey, man, well, what should I sign up for? You know, I want to travel around and just be with the, you know, see the world and all this." I was trying to be chummy. So he said, "Oh, I got the perfect job for you." So, signed me up and said, "You can be a steward, and you don't have to stay on no watches. You just travel with the officers and all, and I'm going to hook you up." I said, "Oh, okay, great." So I went outside and stood in line. And the guy said, "What are you going to be?" I said, "Man, the man said he's hooking me up to be a steward." He said, "Do you know what a steward is? All you is is a flunky for the officers--making up beds and stuff." "What?" I went back and knocked on the door man, and the guy talking about, "Get back in line, you're already assigned." (Laughter) Oh, man, I wanted to kill him (laughter). So now that was a big--oh, the Navy got quite a story, because I was a headache. So (laughter), so I went in the Navy and they said, "Okay, all the stewards over here." They were all black guys and Filipinos, you know. So they said, "We're going to send you all to school." And one guy was saying, "Hey, man, I don't want to be no steward; they tricked me into this stuff. But I heard if you go to school, you'll never get out of it. So don't sign up for school." Me and him. I said, oh, I've got a friend here. So, "We two, we don't, we don't want to be no, don't want to be no steward, and we're not going to school." "Oh, really?" So all of a sudden, not only the white guy, but the black guy was, "Who do you think you are (laughter)?" You know, so, "We're not going to--I don't want to be a steward." He said, "What do you want to be?" "I want to be a photographer." "Yeah, sure." The other guy was, "What do you want to be?" He said, "I want to be a medical corpsman." He said, "Yeah, okay, well, you all stand over there in the corner. And the rest of you all come on." Signed in to go to school and all. So they said, "Well, you want to be a photographer. You know you can't be a photographer if you're in the Navy part. You have to be in the aviation division." I said, "Well, whatever it takes," you know. "Okay." And the other guy said, "You're a medical corpsman. What do you know about a medical corpsman?" So he said, "Well, I was working in a hospital, and all that." Said, "Okay, you go over there, what, this other section, and we'll see if you're qualified." So the aerial people weren't there, so I was just standing with him. So he went into the office, and the head doctor said, "Oh, you want to be in the medical department?" "Okay, what is a stethoscope? What is this, what is that?" The guy answered all of them. He said, "Well, maybe you can be." So they signed him up, "Okay, we'll put you in that department. And you, well, you're going to have to go through a whole other training to get in the air department; you're going to have to do this and do that. So we're going to put you on a ship until that happens." I said, "Oh, okay." So I get on the ship, a small ship, seven officers, six of them rednecks. And it just happened that the captain wasn't; he was from New Jersey or someplace. So they said, "Well, welcome aboard, man. You know, we'll make you a corporal automatically because this is a good crew and everybody. So, you're moving up." Okay, so I'm sitting in the galley; I'm still a steward, with the chief steward. And he said, "Hey, welcome to the--you know, it's not hard. You don't have to do that much work, just cook for the officers." "Yeah, but I want to be a photographer." "Okay." He looked at me strange, too. So just then one of these redneck officers came by and said, "Lamonte [HistoryMaker Lamonte McLemore], I'm Lieutenant So and So, and I got these shoes here, and I want, I need them shined right quick. And I'm going ashore, so I'll be back in fifteen minutes." I said, "Did he say he wanted them shined?" I said, "Sir," and he was gone. So the guy said--I told the guy, my captain, my, the black guy in charge of him, I said, "Do y'all still shine shoes? I thought that stuff was obsolete." He said, "Oh, well, man, they trying to make it obsolete, but on this ship we still have to do it." I said, "No, no, no, man. That's old stuff, I ain't shining no shoes." He said, "Don't start no stuff over this." I said, "Man, listen." He said, "Well, I'll shine them." I said, "No, you ain't going to shine them." He said, "Well, what are you going to do?" I said, "Let him come back." He said, "Oh, Lord, I don't want to be here." So, he left. Here comes this lieutenant, "Are my shoes ready?" I said, "Sir, I tried to catch you." He said, "Catch me for what?" "To catch you to tell you I don't shine no shoes (laughter)." He said, "You don't do no what?" I said, "I don't shine no shoes. I thought that was obsolete." He said, "Well, we do on here. And also, if you don't shine them--I want these shoes shined in fifteen minutes, or you're going on report." I said, "Well, don't wait for fifteen minutes, because I ain't shining no shoes." He said, "What?" So he went and called one of the SPs [shore patrol], man, and he had me restricted, put in the restricted area. And here comes the captain. "Lamonte, what happened?" I said, "Sir, I don't shine no shoes." He said, "Well, you know, we trying to get rid of that B.S., you know, and I understand where you're coming from. But you shine them this time, and I'll wipe it off the slate, you know." I said, "Sorry, sir, I'm not shining them." He said, "I'm going to have to put you on report for this little B.S." I said, "Well, whatever it takes." They had me for insubordination, mutiny aboard ship (laughter). I mean, all these charges because I wouldn't shine shoes, you know. So, they shaved my head, put me on report, took me to the brig for thirty days.
Story_ID: 482725
Speaker 1: The next day the captain came and said, "I can't go with this bullshit," and he signed me out. So I came back to the ship, I said, "I still don't want to be no stewardess." (Laughter) Oh, man, you sure you want me to go on? Because this is--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's interesting, though (laughter).
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: So he said, "What do you want to be?" I said, "I want to be a photographer." He said, "Well, you're going to have to go to school and take a test for that." He said, "The only department we got open here is sonar." I said, "Well, give me that." I didn't even know what sonar was, you know. It was underwater radar, you know. So they had one guy in charge of that. And he said, "Well, I'm going on duty," he was a sergeant. So I got to stay on the ship all this time, and not even go ashore and all. So when I got off the ship, this was on the base, I saw this sign that said, "Join the UDT team," okay. And it was underwater demolition. So, "Oh, okay." He said, "I don't care what division you're in, you can get, we can sign you up and you get off what you're assigned to." So I signed up for that, and that turned out to be the [U.S.] Navy Seals today. That was the worst duty ever (laughter), but I was determined to go through this, you know. So, they took all of our [U.S.] Navy clothes and gave us marine clothes. First, you got to learn how to swim. They said, "We hope you don't know how to swim, because we're going to teach you our way." So they'd wake you up at six o'clock in the morning with just swimming suits on, freezing to death. And then in the afternoon you're burning up, and then in the evening you're freezing again. And people were dropping out like flies. "Out of four hundred people," they said, "only about 15 percent of you all are going to make it anyways." So, I said, well--I'm looking at this little guy beside me, a little white guy. And I said I'm not going to drop out until he drops out anyway. He ended up being first in the class (laughter). So finally after we finished the swimming, they taught us how to swim, okay. So the next thing, to graduate, we had to jump off of this tower, which is like an aircraft carrier, three stories up--no, eleven stor- eight stories up, or whatever. I said--I looked up and they said, "Okay, you're next." So I went up and climbed up this ladder way up to the top, and I looked down and the swimming pool looked like it was about this big. I looked down, and I said, "Well, this is the day I'm going to quit this mess." (Laughter) I looked down there, man, and I said, "No, no, no." So they had one of them Seabees [U.S. Naval Construction Battalions] up there and he said, "Well, that's the Coronado [Hotel del Coronado, Coronado, California] out there, it's really pretty." I said, "Yeah," (makes noise) and he pushed me. Man, we had a life preserver on, and they teach you to hold on to this life preserver. Otherwise, if you hit the water, it'll break your neck. You cross your feet and make a point going into the water. Halfway down, I thought of that, you know. I went all the way down to the bottom and came up. And when I looked up I said, "You know, if I ever see you on the streets, I'm running over your butt." (Laughter) So, so then they took you out in the ocean for you to swim with all your clothes--boondocks and everything on, and come back and wait on everybody. All the water is pouring on you, salt water, in your eggs when you go to breakfast. I said, "Man, I got to get out of this." So, I told them I was getting married, I had heart trouble, I had everything. So, I signed out, they sent me back to the same ship. So I told you, this might be too long a story about the Navy (laughter). But it gets worse.
Story_ID: 482726
Speaker 1: So now, but I find out the ship was going out of commission. Whew, at least I don't have to deal with these people. So they go to San Francisco [California] dock it there before they go to Stockton [California] and go out of commission. So we're on the base [San Francisco Naval Shipyard, San Francisco, California] working. So the guy said, "Well, all you guys go down and fill out where--since the ship's going out of commission, where do you want to go?" Well, I was out working; they'd sent me out in the field. So when I came back the guy said, "Well, did you fill out the paper where you want to go?" I said, "What?" He said, "Yeah, everybody had three choices of where they want to go." So I went down to the personnel office, I said, "Where are my papers? Because I didn't fill them out, I was working." He said, "Well, your commanding officer filled yours out," that same redneck that wanted me to shine shoes. I said, "How can you do that?" "Well, they couldn't find you." I said, "He sent me somewhere, and he knew exactly where I was." He said, "Well, they signed it already, so it's going, it's gone already." I said, "What three places did he sign for me to go?" "The North Pole, Alaska, and Greenland." (Laughter) I said, "What?" So I said, "Boy, okay." So, all of a sudden our orders came in. Half the people got what they wanted. Said, "Lamonte [HistoryMaker Lamonte McLemore], yeah, you got what you wanted, Alaska." I looked over at the guy and said, "Alaska? Oh, man, that's where my brother is. How great, man." He was like (gesture), I acted like--I didn't want to go to no Alaska, but I wouldn't let him know it (laughter). So that's where they sent me, to Alaska [Naval Air Facility Adak, Adak Island, Alaska]. But then at least I got a chance to go up there and try to be an airman, because it was an airbase, you know. So--
Speaker 2: So now, you went from the [U.S.] Navy to the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps]?
Speaker 1: No, we didn't, we were still in the Navy, but they gave us marine clothes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I mean marine clothes.
Speaker 1: --for combat training and all that.
Speaker 2: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And then did you get airman training there, in--
Speaker 1: No, not until I got to Alaska.
Speaker 2: That's what I mean, in Alaska.
Speaker 1: Took the, took the test. I had been doing aviation photography, so I was taking the test. And the final test, they said, "Okay, now you've got to move one of these U-2V planes, hook it up, and back it up--back it up into the hangar." I said, "You want me to move this plane and hook it up?" And they didn't give me no training for it. I said, "You know what? Yeah, okay." I got in the plane (makes noise) and backed it up; I didn't care if I ran into the wall. I said maybe they would put me in jail or send me away. The damn thing went in the hangar perfect. The guy said, "I ain't never seen nobody do that." I said, "Yeah, all right." (Laughter) So, so then I got the airman's qualifications. But then they said, "Well, you know, when you get out we'll send you to school." I said, "You got to be kidding. I have another four years. Y'all, can you read between these lines (gesture) (laughter)?"
Story_ID: 482727
Speaker 1: So at that point, your four years was up?
Speaker 2: Well, almost; it was getting up. And I went back to Car- wait a minute, to San Francisco [California]. Anyways, I forgot the name of the place, it's just outside of San Francisco. And I had another six months, but that was in Special Services, because I was playing ball with the little [U.S.] Navy teams all throughout. But then they had an organized ball team, and, (Unclear) 160 and I remember that, and it's in a suburb of San Fran- of Oakland [California], wherever that base [Naval Air Station Alameda, Alameda, California] is. And that's where I was playing ball, and played an exhibition game against the Dodgers [Los Angeles Dodgers]. And they saw me, and said well, that's when I got a contract to the minor leagues. And--
Speaker 1: Okay. So well, tell me about that.
Speaker 2: All the guys were all happy for me, man. I mean, that day I pitched my heart out, boy. I mean, I was striking out guys. And some of the names with the Dodgers, I don't even remember, you know. But they said, "You got a lot of potential. And you know, since you're getting out of the Navy--." So, the guys took me out celebrating in an old '39 [1939] Royal Chrysler [Chrysler Royal]. And I'm leaning on the door, and they gave me a drink. And one drink, I was drunk. I leaned on the door and fell out (gesture) and broke my arm. I happened to be a pitcher. I mean, for the irony of that to happen--you know, I was laying in the street and people said, "Pull him out of the streets, the cars may run over him." I said, "Let them run over me, I don't care." I mean, that was just the end of my life right there, you know. So when I got through surgery and I got well, they sent me to Double-A league in Long Beach [California]. But my arm wasn't strong enough to pitch anymore, so I switched to first base. But as a pitcher, you never really learn how to hit. You know, they teach you how to bunt, basically. And I really learned how to bunt. So the scouts were coming back saying, "Watch this guy. You know he's going to bunt." I'd bunt the ball and straddle it so they couldn't get it, and they'd run in and I'd bunt it over their heads. I was batting .300 bunting. But it got be a novelty a little bit, but that wasn't good enough. So I just got into photography and gave up baseball, so to speak. I still played ball with, I played softball then with The Jackson 5 team and all the locals. I'm still playing today.
Speaker 1: So, you were actually playing a game against the Dodgers with the, was this with Navy team?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Navy team was playing against them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was just an exhibition game.
Speaker 1: And so the Dodgers are the ones who signed you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, and I hated the Dodgers, being a rival of the Cardinals [St. Louis Cardinals]. But then I had to play for the Dodgers, thinking that one day I'll play against the Cardinals, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, what year was this?
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955], '56 [1956] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because you were getting ready to get out? Getting ready--
Speaker 2: Fifty-six, [1956], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So the accident happened right after you signed with the Dodgers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 482728
Speaker 1: Now going back a little bit, talking about segregation. Growing up, you went to all segregated schools?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And, and tell me what life was like in Missouri, as far as segregation?
Speaker 2: Well, Missouri was kind of mediocre. I mean because we were in the band, we went to the South and we saw how bad that was down there. And so we thought St. Louis [Missouri] was (laughter) heaven in a way, you know, because we didn't have to ride on the back of buses and stuff. But it was still very prejudiced. There wasn't no black and white signs up, but, and then the band, the St. Louis high school band [at Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri], we went to Georgia, right when Parks [Rosa Parks] wouldn't sit on the back bus. And so we going down there saying, "You know, we, I ain't riding on no back of the bus," me and some band members. So, "We're going to go down there and we going to get on the bus, too, you know." So, the bus came. I jumped on the bus and sat down in the front, and the other guys stood outside talking, "Bye." I said, "Hey, wait a minute." (Laughter) The bus took off, and the white people didn't say anything, but the black people in the back were like, "Who do you think you are? Just because you're light-skinned or something?" You know, so I said, "I'm going to kill them cats." So on the next stop when the bus door opened (makes sound), I jumped off, man. And they were just out there laughing. I said, "Boy, I'm going to kill all of y'all (laughter)."
Speaker 1: Was your mother [June Shaver McLemore] involved politically, or in the Civil Rights Movement at all?
Speaker 2: My mother was too busy washing on her hands and knees on these floors, man, to take care of us. So, no, we didn't know nothing about no politics or voting. We didn't even care who the president. I didn't even know who was president, had no idea and didn't care. Our concern was the next meal.
Speaker 1: Okay. What about segregation--well, the [U.S.] military was supposed to be not segregated by this time. But what did you find about that while you were in the service? How were you, how do you think you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, they were trying--like, about the shoe situation.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They were trying to eliminate all of that, you know, but it was still there, just kind of underground. It was, it was still happening, but it wasn't on the surface.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, because all the blacks still hung out together, you know, that meant all the racists hung out together.
Story_ID: 482729
Speaker 1: So now when you leave baseball, tell me what happens next.
Speaker 2: Well, when I was playing ball I was involved in singing, and I was involved in photography and all of that. So even if I was supposed to pitch that day, or play that day, and I had my uniform on, as soon as the game was over, I didn't even take no shower. I just ran home to go to rehearsal, or go shoot pictures and all. So then I finally gave up the baseball, and then photography just kind of took over a little bit.
Speaker 1: Well, when did you start taking pictures? When did photography become a real passion for you?
Speaker 2: When I was a little kid, we were playing cowboys and Indians [Native Americans], and I had a two gun holster. I had a gun in one hand and a camera in the other (laughter). And my mother [June Shaver McLemore] was always running around with a camera, you know, so I guess I picked that up from her a little bit. But I just always liked photography. And then in school, they were talking about a major, and I was thinking about journalism as a major. And they said, "Well, you know, one picture says a thousand words." I said, "Well, why should I sit around writing all day, when I can take one picture and be gone." You know, it just made sense. So, I, I just--then for one Christmas they asked me what I wanted for Christmas. I said, "Well, I want a developing set." They said, "A developing set?" You know, because most kids wanted a BB gun, or this or that. I already had a BB gun, so they bought me this developing set.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: Thirteen or something like, I guess. And so I shot these little pictures with a little Brownie. See all them Brownies (points off camera)? It's probably still up there. (Laughter) I went down in the basement to develop the pictures and everybody was so proud. They said, "Oh, man, we got a little genius, a little scientist." And I'm smiling. I went down in the basement and put this film on a roll and developed it. But you got to cup it, and I didn't know that. And I just wrapped it around there and then put it in there, and it stuck together. They said, "Well, are the pictures ready?" I was so embarrassed. Boy, I said, "Well, it went wrong." So I almost gave up photography, 'cause I was so embarrassed. But I got another roll and tried it and read the directions. And I got it and it came out great, and I was mesmerized. So then, okay, so now I get out of the [U.S.] Navy and I got to try to find a job, okay. And I saw in the paper in Los Angeles [California] where they needed a darkroom technician [at Jack and Jill (ph.)]. This was around Christmastime, because they were over-crowded, I mean overflowing with work. So, I called the guy up. And he said, "Yeah, the position is available." And I told him my credentials, you know. "Oh, yeah, well, you qualified. What's your name?" I said, "McLemore [HistoryMaker Lamonte McLemore]." "Oh, yeah, come on in." So I went down to the studio and knocked on the door. I said, "Well, I came to apply for this darkroom job." They said, "Oh, it's already taken." I said, "Already taken? I just called up down here, and they told me to come down." They said, "What's your name?" I said, "McLemore." They said, "Are you McLemore?" (Laughter) I said, "Yeah, I'm McLemore." And the owner--he turned around and looked at the owner, and the owner said, "Well, hey, we need somebody. If you can do the job, go head on." And so obviously they were prejudiced, but they let me go in. They said, "Well, this darkroom has two rooms, and there are four other technicians in there." He said, "Well, I got one over here that you can have by yourself, you know, because it's kind of crowded over there." All the white guys were over there, and it's all water all over the floor and all that. Man, it was just so messed up and funky in there. So he said, "Okay, so here's these boxes of proofs that we want," you know, they shot kids house to house, you know so they had to make proofs. "So, well, make these proofs and let us see what you can do." So I said you know what, I don't even want this job. So, you were supposed to run a test on it to be sure that it was all right. And I just threw them all in there, just (makes noise). But I have a sixth sense about photography; I just can't let it go wrong, you know. And all the darn pictures came out great. So I just took them out and was washing them. And I'm sitting in there and they turned the light on, and the guy said, "Well, are you taking a break?" I said, "No, I'm through." "What you mean, you through?" I said, "Well, there they are, look at them." He said, "You finished all, the whole box?" He went next door and said, "You see this? This guy just came here the first day. And he done finished the whole box, and you all in there BS-ing." He said, "Something, something's got to change." (Laughter) So.
Story_ID: 482730
Speaker 1: So you were telling me about the darkroom technician, about how you did all the work (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: --and got the pictures done.
Speaker 2: Well, the guy looked at it and said, "Man, these are all perfect," you know. And he went in and told the other guys, "Look at this. This guy done finished the whole box, and y'all got half of your boxes left, and you been here. Something's got to change." (Laughter) So they said, "You know what? We got another enlarger in here, we're going to move you in here to give them inspiration, you know, see what you're doing." So, they took me out of the little funky room and put me in with the other white darkroom technicians. And so we got in, and the lights went out. No, one of the machines went out, so they had to turn all the lights on. So we were all just kind of sitting around. And so when I sit around, I start thinking of lies to tell, and telling jokes. And I had them laughing and all, man. And I turned out to be--they all really liked me then, you know. So I'm, I'm sitting up telling lies while they were doing the work, and it got--it made production speed up. (Laughter) So I told the guy, I said, "Well, you know what? I'd like to be a photographer." "Well, you doing all right in the darkroom. No, you should stick with this, because we shoot in all these white homes, you know." So, I said, "Well, okay." So, I knew where that was coming from. So I'm shooting pictures at home and all. And I told the man, I said, "Well, you know what? If you let me develop my pictures here using the old chemicals that you're going to throw out anyway, I'll stay and clean up, and you can fire the people who cleaning up." He said, "What? That sounds great. We're not going to use the same old equipment, you know, the chemicals, because they almost dead anyway at the end of the day." And I said, "And I'll clean up the darkroom, and you don't have to have nobody come in." "Oh, all right. So, yeah, we'll give you a dollar extra." I was making $40 a week, $34.50 take home pay (laughter). So, it was kind of sad man. So I got a raise, five or ten cents more an hour or whatever. So, I'd hang up all my pictures after I finished developing them and have them hanging up on purpose, so when they came in in the morning they could see them. The guys would come in, "Oh, man, you shot this? Look this, look at that." I could shoot better than any one of their photographers, because they could just shoot kids. They were taught just to do that, you know. And I had pictures of everything--all the pretty girls, all of them, you know, everything. So one day one of the photographers got arrested for drunk driving, and another one got sick. And they had all these appointments, and the guy said, "Well, Lamonte [HistoryMaker Lamonte McLemore], do you, do you think you can handle this? Now, you know it's kind of--." I said, "Hey, I know it. Don't worry." So he said, "Well, we'll go with you." I said, "Okay." So we're going house to house, shooting photography. Okay, the kids, we had to set them up within half an hour. Set them up, shoot them, and get out and go to the next door. The people were selling coupons for two dollars, you know, for an eight by ten [inches]. So the first house I get to, it's pouring down raining. So the boss and his assistant are sitting outside, to be sure I'm all right--you know, if I had any problems with the prejudice and stuff. So I knocked on the door, and the lady said, "What?" I said, "I'm the photographer." "Oh, come on in." So I came in and she was looking at me like (gesture). And I set the little kids up, man, and shot the picture. She said, "Oh, you're a different photographer from last year." I said, "Yeah, that was my brother." Said, "Oh, yeah." (Laughter) So then the little kids come up and said, "What kind of hair is that?" And I let them play with my hair and all, and then I had them laughing. And she said, one lady said, "I don't know why they keep sending photographers out here, because the kids act a fool every year, and you don't never get no picture." So he was sitting in the corner like this. I said, "Oh, okay, so you got a ball? Give me the ball." So I took the ball and just rolled it to the little kid, kicked it back. So I rolled it over there to him again and he kicked it back. So I'd bounce it, and he'd bounce it. So then I bounced it close to the seat was where he was going to sit. So I put the ball in the seat and sat him down. And he started smiling, and the lady said, "I can't believe this." I got the greatest pictures. I turned out to be their number one photographer in the, in the company [Jack and Jill (ph.)].
Story_ID: 482731
Speaker 1: So, now I met a guy named Cliff Hall, and he was another photographer for the L.A. Sentinel [Los Angeles Sentinel]. And he said, "Man, you know what? You good enough to--we can start our own studio." I said, "We don't have no money to start no studio," you know. He said, "Well, I got a plan. If we can start this studio--." I said, "Where?" "I found a building." I said, "I don't have no money for no rent." He said, "Well, I got an MG [MG Car Company Limited]." He said, "I'm going to sell you my MG, okay. And get the credit, you get it on credit and get the money, and we'll take the money and pay the rent. And as we make pictures, we can pay for the car back, the loan back." So somehow he worked this out, and that's how we got the studio. He said, "Now, as far as a job," this guy was a genius. He said, "You working for these people in the lab. Tell them you want to take their account and bring it to us, and they can close their place down." So I went to the lady and said, "Are you sure?" "Yeah, well, you don't have to pay no rent; you just pay for the pictures being done." And they went for it, so we had an account. And that started Halmont Graphics, a photography studio.
Speaker 2: Now what was the name of the company that you worked for, that you were the darkroom technician?
Speaker 1: Jack and Jill [ph.].
Speaker 2: Okay. And how long did you work there before you took over the account (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) About two years, maybe.
Speaker 2: Two years, okay. So you took over the account, and how did you get other accounts?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: All right. You were telling me about Halmont Graphics, the company that you began. This is about 1960 or so?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So tell me how you picked up your next clients, and what happened with the company.
Speaker 1: Well, I was just shooting pictures of kids. Some of the people where, I was shooting for Jack and Jill, they knew I was shooting there, so they would bring their families into the studio, you know. So we started an international studio, more or less. Then one day a guy said, "Well, have you seen this Jet, you know, the pictures in the centerfold?" He said, "Your pictures look just as good if not better than theirs." I said, "Man, well, they got their photographers. I ain't--." He said, "Give me a picture." So I gave him a picture and he sent it in, and they used it. And so from then on, it's been over forty years, and I've still been shooting pictures. I'm still not a Jet photographer, but I, I freelance for them.
Speaker 2: Freelance. So what was the picture that was sent in? Do you remember?
Speaker 1: Yeah, a centerfold. It was just a bathing suit picture of a girl on a beach.
Speaker 2: And they used it. So, how did, how much freelancing have you done for them?
Speaker 1: Forty years (laughter). Forty nights (laughter).
Speaker 2: Tell me some of the photo shoots that you, that you performed.
Speaker 1: Well, man, for them I shot--well, as a photographer, I got signed with Motown and I was a Motown photographer, too. So I had that account also. I shot Stevie Wonder's first [sic.] album cover, Supremes [The Supremes], Temptations [The Temptations], the Four Tops, I knew all of them.
Speaker 2: So Stevie, Stevie Wonder's first album cover, what was the--
Speaker 1: Called 'On the Beach' [sic. 'Stevie at the Beach'].
Speaker 2: 'On the Beach.'
Speaker 1: I bought Stevie his first bottle of wine (laughter). Stevie was only fourteen or fifteen, and he said, "Lamonte [HistoryMaker Lamonte McLemore], can we get some wine?" I said, "Stevie, I can't get you no wine." "Oh, man, I ain't going to tell nobody." So I went and got this bottle of Ripple, or whatever. And I don't know what he knew about it, but we sat out on the beach drinking this wine. So even to this day wherever he's going to be, if I know somebody that's going to see him, I say, "Just go whisper in his ear and say 'Stevie, about that wine.'" "That damn Lamonte telling everybody." (Laughter) So he's still a good friend of mine, too. So, but, through that and Motown, that's almost how The 5th Dimension evolved.
Story_ID: 482732
Speaker 1: So I was covering a beauty pageant and, Miss Black Brow- Beauty America [Miss Black America], and [HistoryMaker] Marilyn McCoo was singing in it, and she won the talent part. And the next year I was covering the same pageant, and [HistoryMaker] Florence LaRue was in the pageant, and she won the talent part. So I asked them both, I said, "Well how would you y'all like to a join a group with two guys from St. Louis [Missouri]?" Ron [Ronald Townson], I went to school with, and Billy [HistoryMaker Billy Davis, Jr.], I knew him from the drum and bugle corps. And they said, "Well, we don't really want to be in no group." I said, "Well, look, I'm working for Motown, and I know all of the auditions. So if we just get together and just harmonize a little, so when they do have auditions I can you have you--you know, I'll know first, and I can hip you guys to it." So, "Okay, well, we'll do that." So we started singing and harmonizing, and it started sounding pretty good. So one day Florence asked me, said, "Well, if this is just a hobby, how come you're buying uniforms?" I said, "Well, we got a little job down at the club, so I bought some red sweaters and black turtlenecks." "Okay." We went down there, and there happened to be agents in the audience. And the rest was history. They couldn't believe that we--just that fast, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, let's go back a little bit. And tell me more about Marilyn McCoo.
Speaker 1: Marilyn McCoo was in college, and Florence was in college also, you know. And they were both modeling for me. And then when I found out--I didn't even know they could really sing. I thought, I knew Marilyn could sing, but I didn't know Florence did, because I had just taken pictures of her. So, that's how that evolved. But Marilyn--we had our first little group that we got together, and Marilyn's mother [Mary Holloway McCoo] wasn't too happy because, "Marilyn, you know you can sing. You don't need no group," you know, "blah, blah, blah." But Marilyn was determined, so we went on the road. We stole Marilyn (laughter) and drove back, drove back to Chicago [Illinois] with this guy, Lonnie Sattin. And we were called the Hi-Fi's, okay. And when we got back to Chicago the guy said, "Well, no, it ain't this month; it's next month." "Next month?" We done come all the way from Chicago. And he got us in this hotel, and we ain't got no job (laughter). So after a couple of days, the guy tried to figure out what to do. He tried to get some more jobs around Chicago, and the man was asking, "Well, hey, where's my rent? We haven't gotten paid in three days." I said, "Well, the man's coming," you know. He said, "No, you all got to get out of here by tomorrow if you don't have the rent." So then we grabbed our little bags and stuff, man, and we were climbing down the fire escape and all. You could see Marilyn McCoo going down the fire escape (laughter). And we had just signed with Ray Charles. So, Ray Charles happened to be in Chicago, okay. So we found out where he was, and we went out the airport. We were still in our little red sweaters and black t-shirts, and running out to--we said, "Hey, Ray, we need a ride back home, because they kicked us out of the hotel. This guy got us a job and the job didn't come through." Ray said, "I told y'all to just wait 'til I come back, and I was going to take you on the road with us next time, you know." So, "All right." And The Raelettes said, "See there, Ray, you cheating rascal. They even got traveling uniforms." (Laughter) They weren't really traveling, because that's why we got out of the hotel with what we had on. So, that was funny.
Story_ID: 482733
Speaker 1: So you say Ray, you had just signed with Ray Charles?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, we had this jazz group, and I knew Ray's manager. Well, I knew Ray a little bit, I'd just met him in passing. And I saw him one day and I said, "Ray, I got this group I want you to hear." He said, "Okay, when you want me to hear him?" I said, "Well, when you're available." He said, "Well, Friday night." So Friday, he came to see us. I said, "Ray's going to come and audition us." They said, "Oh, man, that's great." So Ray came in, "Hey, I hear you kids are really great. So go head on, turn me on." So they always gave him a book to hold, just something in his hand. And so we were getting ready to sing for him, and he got the book upside down. So we all looking, we about to laugh. We said, "He got the book upside down." He took the book and turned it around, and we said, "Ray ain't blind after all (laughter)." So we sang for him, and he said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, this here will work." (Laughter) So he signed us, and we went on the road with no money. We had to pay all the bills, and he'd drop us off at the fleabag and he'd go to the Ritz [Ritz-Carlton]. And man, that's another story. We were on his airplane, we called it the Gooney Bird. Now this is one of the few black entertainers with his own plane, too, you know then. So all right, we all were assigned seats, and everything was great, and man, we're going on the road. The first time, this plane, the plane crashed (laughter). Getting ready to take off from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] in the freezing snow. And we were the last--you know, all the major airlines get a chance to take off first, and then they bring the little private aircraft. And us being the blacks over in the corner, they waited until the last. And all this ice was forming on the plane. And so they didn't have the de-icing equipment that they have today, you know, so he tried to do the best he could. They said, "Okay, we got the clearance," and the plane took off. And oh, man, look here, "Bam." It hit the ground and skidded, and the door flew open. And I saw the pilot look back, and I saw the mountain coming up like this. "Oh, man, no." And he stopped like maybe twenty yards from the mountain, right off the runway, and messed up the landing gear. So then they had to fix the plane. So we stayed in Pittsburgh until they could fix the hydraulic system; that was the only thing really messed up. So Marilyn [HistoryMaker Marilyn McCoo] said, "Well, I don't know; I'm getting off of this. My mother [Mary Holloway McCoo] didn't want me out here no way." I said, "Marilyn, it's all right," you know. So, they revved up the plane to take off. They had two mechanics down there. And Ray was sitting up in one of the co-pilots' seat. They were revving up the engine, and the guy on the ground said, "Is everything all right, Ray? You ready, are you clear to take off?" Ray said, "No, no, no, no, no. Something ain't right." They said, "What do you mean, something ain't right? We checked everything, you know." "Something ain't right." He said, "Let me off this plane." (Laughter) So everybody is like, "What?" And Ray Charles, now he can't, he's blind. They let him off the plane and he went around the front of the plane feeling the--. "What's this?" We said, "Oh, that's the front landing gear pin," that's supposed to be sticking--that's where they heard knocking. And if the plane landed the wrong way, the wheel would bend back and it would cause major problems. He said, "Oh, we sorry, Mr. Ray, yeah, you right; we forgot to lock this pin." So we got on, and from that day on whenever the plane was getting to take off, we'd say, "Hey, Ray, everything all right?" (Laughter) "Yeah, it's all right." But he could hear, he knew the plane so well he could hear that thing banging on the front running, landing gear.
Story_ID: 482734
Speaker 1: So what city were you living in now?
Speaker 2: Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Okay. So, when did you make the transition from Missouri to Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: Well, when I went into the [U.S. military] service--when I got out I stayed in California.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they gave me like five hundred dollars, and I took three hundred dollars and bought a camera. They said, "You don't even have no place to stay, and you're buying a camera. You crazy?" So I went out to City College [Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California], and man, I was just grabbing people. I said, "Come here, I want to take your picture." "We don't want no picture." "Yes, you do, stand up here." (Laughter) So I'd shoot the pictures and bring them back. "Oh, yeah, these are all right." So, I'd sell them pictures, and I just--then in my little studio, when things were going kind of slow, I'd say, "You know what? Every time this phone rings, I'm going to make some money." They said, "How you going to do that?" So when somebody would call, I don't care who it was, I said, "Well, do you need some pictures?" "No, we don't need none." I said, "Well, don't you have any kids?" "Well, my niece got some." "Well, give me that number." I took the niece's number and said, "Well, they recommended you and said you needed pictures." They said, "They did?" (Laughter) And they'd bring the kids in. So every time the phone rang, I made money.
Speaker 1: So your studio was in Los Angeles (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 482735
Speaker 1: Now you talked about Jet magazine and, and Motown. Tell me about Harper's Bazaar?
Speaker 2: Well, when I had my studio, okay, I was shooting these black girls, the models. In fact, we had started our own magazine. No, this is before that. Okay, I sent the models to audition for Bazaar, and they would come back and say, "Well, no, not at this time." I said, "What do you mean, not at this time?" And they would--I knew what was going on; they just weren't using no black models. So, now I just got pissed off one day. I said, you know what? Don't get pissed off, just think about what your [maternal] grandmother [Gertrude Whitecloud Shaver] said (laughter). She'd tell me how to deal with all situations. She said, "Well, if there ain't a media, create one." I said, "You know what? Okay, I'll start my own magazine." Only I'm just the photographer; I don't know no editors, writers, and all that stuff. And I was talking to one of the models, and she said, "Well, I know a guy who wants to be an editor, named John Daniels." So she set up a meeting with him and he said, "I've been looking for a photographer." And I said, "Well, I know artists." And he said, "I know some writers." So, oh, great. So okay, so I call up all the models and man, we started shooting. We got the boutiques, especially the little black boutiques and all, and we got some clothes. And everybody was interested, you know, anything to make a sale. So we shot all these pictures and got the writers and everything, and we laid out this dummy magazine with the pictures, the cover, the writers, and everything. "Oh, man, you know what? This is great." "Yeah, well, now what?" So I said, "Well, we need a publisher." "Well, where we going to get a publisher? We don't have no money." I said, "I'll tell you what. Give me that phonebook." So I took the phonebook and I said, "Well, my name starts with M." So I looked under the publishing department, Medallion Printers [Medallion Printers and Lithographers]. "Okay, call them up." So we call up Medallion Printers. I said, "We have a magazine we want to print." They said, "Oh yeah, well come on out." Nice Jewish young man, you know. He said, "You know, well, we interested; we publish magazines." So we took two of the foxes, two of the prettiest girls there, and the editor and myself, and we go all the way out to East L.A. [East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] to the publisher. "So, well, you interested in publishing a magazine?" I said, "Yes, sir." He said, "Well, all right, how many copies?" I said, "Well, we'd like X amount of copies and all that." He said, "All right." He said, "Well, now about the money. It's going to cost, so how much money do you think?" I said, "Well, sir, we don't have no money." I wish I had a video of his face right to this day. Because his lips were like (gesture). "No money? (Laughter) No money? Well, how are you going to get a book published with no money?" So I said, "Well, sir, we have this magazine, as you can see. What do you think about it?" He said, "I think you got an idea, but you got to have some money." I said, "Well, we're willing to give up 49 percent of it. We'll keep 50 [percent], we want control of it. But we'll give up 49 percent if you publish it, and you'll be part owner." He said, "No, I don't know." Just then his son happened to pass by. And his son saw these two pretty girls in there, and he came in, "Hi, Dad." He said, "He ain't never stopped in here to say nothing to me before." So he went out and talked to his son. And his son said, "Do you realize what you got there? There's nothing out there but Ebony," and happened to be a bright publisher. He said, "Let's give it a shot. Ain't nothing--you know, it ain't going to cost us that much." And they went for it. And that's how we published Elegant magazine. And, and I can show you some of the covers out there.
Story_ID: 482736
Speaker 1: Now that magazine took off like you wouldn't believe. It was the only magazine, fashionable living for men and women. There's still not a magazine like that today, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so then we decided to make it go somewhere every month. Black people weren't used to traveling then, either. "Well, we ain't got no money. Where we going to go?" "So, well, first of all we go to Hollywood [Los Angeles, California]. We live in Los Angeles [California], and people all across the nation think that we went to Hollywood." So we called up the Wax Museum [Hollywood Wax Museum, Los Angeles, California] and all of them, man, and they opened their doors. We shot a great issue there. So the next one, we were going to go to Las Vegas [Nevada]. Las Vegas was right down the road; you drive down there, you know use a backdrop. So, now this is the funny part. So we got all these boutiques and things to give us these clothes. And the models--you know, when you get the girl models, the male models are all coming. They ain't paying nobody. Ain't nobody getting paid, but they're all having fun doing it, you know, getting their pictures in the magazine. So, we got the clothes and put them in this little raggedy van, and everybody is driving. So the van broke down in Barstow [California], or someplace. And some guy backed up in a truck and said, "I saw the van smoking," a white guy with a pickup truck. We said, "Well, we got to get this fixed, we got to get these clothes to Vegas." He said, "Man, look at this motor; it's blown up. There's no hope for this car." "Well, what we going to do with these clothes?" (Laughter) He said, "Well, I'm going to Vegas, but, I can put this big old rack on the back of the truck, but the clothes will blow all off." I said, "Well, you know what," being the editor, put the clothes in the truck and laid on the clothes (laughter). And we drove to Vegas and got--well, we got the rooms free. And the guys were all piled in one room, and the girls were all piled in one room. We shot the thing and it turned out great, it turned out great. But it's a movie about this magazine. And the only reason the magazine folded is because it was making money.
Speaker 2: The only reason why it folded was because it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because it was making money. All of sudden--I tell you, there's a movie. (Laughter) All of a sudden this money is coming in, man, and we're getting, oh, God, look at--"Okay, man, here's a thousand [dollars] for you, here's a thousand for you." And people's subscriptions are going in the waste can; we forgot all about the magazine. We started spending this money and started getting lawsuits. (Laughter) So I mean it got awful. So then the publisher said, "Man, look here, this ain't going to work. So, I'm going to fire the editor." And the editor said, "Well, if you fire me, I'm taking Lamonte [HistoryMaker Lamonte McLemore] and the art director." He said, "Wait a minute (unclear), where you going?" We said, "We staying with the magazine, because you the one acting up," you know. So we stayed with the magazine, and they got another black editor that they sent in. Now he's a photographer, "I want my pictures in, I want this and that." And he couldn't shoot like we could, and he didn't have the feeling for it. And so he tricked the editors, "Well, the book should be in New York [New York], you know, somewhere where something's going on." So he had it transferred to New York. We said, "We're not going to New York." So we said, "You're going to have to buy us out." So we quit, okay. And he came back there and the editor--the publisher--called me up and said, "How come the magazine costs five times more than it did out here?" I said, "Well, you chose to do that." And they just stole it. And now the only thing close to it is--our book was called Elegant, and I can't think of the name of the book. Essence. All of a sudden Essence comes out, and nobody knows the story behind that yet (laughter). But, the logo was almost the same. So, who knows?
Speaker 2: Now, what year did the magazine start?
Speaker 1: It had to be '63 [1963], '4 [1964], somewhere in there.
Speaker 2: And when did you sell it?
Speaker 1: About '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: So it was only in existence for a year?
Speaker 1: Two years.
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: And even Ebony called up--I don't know if I'm supposed to say this (unclear) (laughter), and Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] was very interested in it. He said, "Well, you know, how would you guys, I'd like to buy it out, you know, invest in it." And we found out that three other black magazines had invested in it, and we got them to squash it. And the first year, I think we took a hundred thousand dollars away from Ebony. And we had a great fashion layout. And Ebony had all these ads and a couple of fashion pictures. We changed Ebony all the way around, the whole format. We changed everything to keep, people don't know that. But I'm surprised I didn't get fired, because I was shooting for Jet then. (Laughter) But he tried--and then after that he wanted to hire me and the art director, and we wouldn't do it. I didn't want to work for Johnson Publishing [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] just for that, because I had, I'd have been stuck just doing that. This way, I freelance, I can work for anybody. Then I would have to work just for them.
Story_ID: 482737
Speaker 1: Now, you still didn't tell me how you became the first black photographer hired by Harper's Bazaar (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay. Well, I'm glad you brought that back up. I told you I'm getting Alzheimer's (laughter). Well, when I sent these girls and they came back and they didn't get no jobs, you know, I said, "You know what? Okay." But one guy who was a fashion designer that did some things for Elegant, for our magazine, he said, "Well, man, you know what? You ought to be shooting some things for Harper's." I said, "Are you kidding?" He said, "Look here, I advertise with Harper's, okay. So I want you to shoot some things for my clothes." And he just happened to come--I don't even know how I met him, but he came to the studio and was watching me shoot. He said, "Man, I like the way you shoot clothes. Would you like to shoot a couple of my things?" I said, "Well, yeah." He said, "I got an ad in Harper's." And so, Harper's photographer--he told them, he said, "I got another guy that I want to do the pictures." Okay, well, they didn't care then, because--well, they didn't know I was black, but they just wanted the ad, you know. So, they had this guy bring down the clothes. And the guy came in and said, "Oh, well, this guy's got a lot of confidence in you and all," you know. So I said, "Oh, okay." Well, I started shooting the clothes, and they loved it. So they started using it, and didn't even know I was the photographer.
Speaker 1: Who was the designer?
Speaker 2: I can't remember his name (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can't remember. Okay.
Speaker 2: --not to this day. So, they used it for a few other things. And now The 5th Dimension, so they offered me a contract to come and work for Harper's. And they didn't know I'd been getting pictures in there before. But I was shooting his ad, and they didn't know I was shooting them. So then when they found out they were like hey, you know. They thought it would open the door, to have a black photographer. You know, we might cause a little news sensation because of that. And now The 5th Dimension is taking off, and everybody's quitting their jobs. And they said, "Well, what are you going to do, man? You know, I done quit my pension at the post office." And if I hadn't started The 5th Dimension, then I probably would have went with Harper's. But since I started, man, I had a lot of sleepless nights, man. Because I sure wanted to go, but I turned it down to go with The 5th Dimension.
Story_ID: 482738
Speaker 1: You didn't take the job at Harper's [Harper's Bazaar] because, as you said, it was many sleepless nights getting The 5th Dimension together. But you told me the name was Hi-Fi [Hi-Fi's], and then it changed again. Tell me about the transition, and who the people were that trans- made that transition with you?
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, when we first started the Hi-Fi's, a guy named Rex Middleton saw us, and that's when we changed from The Versatiles to--I'm making it backwards. Well, anyway, we were the Hi-Fi's, okay, and then we went with Ray Charles for a minute. And then when we quit that, we started The Versatiles. And the president of Motown--when they moved it to the West Coast from Detroit [Michigan]--his name was Marc Gordon, and he was the one who got me involved in the photography with Motown. He knew we were singing, and he was involved with a couple of my little groups. So he heard us, and he said, "You know what? I can probably get you all an audition with Motown." So he brought us some songs that [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson had written and all that for us to do, so Motown could hear it, you know. So, we recorded these songs and they sounded--there were about three songs, they sounded really good. And he said, "Well, we want [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy to hear it," but he was back in Detroit. "So what we'll do, we'll chip in money and send you back, since you know Berry, and let him hear them and see what happens personally." So, okay, because Berry's not coming to California anytime soon. So they chipped in money for me to go to Detroit. So I go back to see Berry, and he said, "Hey, great, man." I said, "I got these three songs I want you to hear, and I made an appointment." And he said, "Right now, I'm involved in a project, and I can't really get away. Maybe tomorrow." I said, "Well, you know, okay." So the next day I said, "Berry." "Man, I'm so busy today, I can't." I said, "Well, Berry, I ain't got but one more day. I got, I got--." He said, "Sorry, Lamonte [HistoryMaker Lamonte McLemore], I just ain't got the time." I said, "Berry, I can't go back." Okay, the next morning I went and sat on Motown's steps at six o'clock in the morning. I sat there and waited. And Berry came, "Oh, man." He said, "Come in here right quick." I said, "Berry, I can't go back without you hearing this." So he listened to the song and said, "Oh, man, they're really good songs, you know." He said, "But I don't hear no hit." He said, "Let's go back and cut some more." Okay, so I came back and gave the group the bad news. And so Marc Gordon said, "You know what? I met this guy named Johnny Rivers, and he has his own label, Soul City [Soul City Records] label. And if you come with us--he said, "If you go with him, you won't be lost behind The Temptations, The Supremes, and all of them, you know, because they're big time now, and you'll be first on the label." I said, "Yeah, well, okay." So, we went with Johnny Rivers. And we met Jimmy Webb, and 'Up, Up and Away' was, well, it started us off, and the rest is history. But every time I'd see Berry Gordy after The 5th Dimension got started, he said, "Well, that 'Up, Up and Away,' was that one of the songs you brought me?" I said, "Yeah, it was." It wasn't really, but I was messing with him. (Laughter) He said, "Really? I don't know, I didn't hear that."
Speaker 1: Okay, you went from the Hi-Fi's to The Versatiles. And how did you get the name The 5th Dimension?
Speaker 2: Okay. We were The Versatiles, and Johnny River said, "You know what? We need to change the name to something more up-to-date." Since The Beatles, and The Turtles, you know, and the Rolling Stones. So, just something else beside The Versatiles. So we threw a name in the hat, and everybody came up with names. So, Ron [Ronald Townson] and his wife, Bobette [Bobette Townson], came up with the name The 3rd Dimension, because 3-D [three dimensional] films were very popular then. So it was The 3rd Dimension. And he said, "You know what? That's cool, but since it's five of us, why don't we say The 5th Dimension, and make The 5th Dimension mean sound." So, and today The 5th Dimension is sound.
Story_ID: 482739
Speaker 1: So you signed with Soul City Records, okay. And you said you met--Webb was his first name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Jimmy Webb.
Speaker 1: Jimmy Webb. Tell me about him.
Speaker 2: Jimmy Webb, Marc Gordon was managing him. He was a writer, and he managed us [The 5th Dimension]. And we were all sitting in the room and said, "Man, if we just had some songs." "Yeah, if I just had somebody to sing my songs." He said, "Wait a minute." We said, "Well, here's the group, and you're the writer." So he said, "You know what? I got this song I'm writing for a play called 'Up, Up and Away.'" And he started playing it, and he said, "Sing this, sing that." Then he said, "Man, later for that play. I'm giving this song to you." So, that's the first song that we did by Jimmy Webb.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he wrote 'MacArthur Park,' 'By the Time I Get to Phoenix.' He turned out to be a very big writer.
Speaker 1: Okay. And he would write more songs for you, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Up, Up and Away,' and I can't even remember the rest of them.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, your very first record was a hit?
Speaker 2: Well, the first record was called 'Go Where You Wanna Go,' and it was going up the charts. And the Johnny Mann Singers heard 'Up, Up and Away' that we had done. And they were on the same label, and they decided they were going to just take the song and put it out, too. So, they took it and put it out. We were on the same label now, and they did our song. And the guy said, "Well, you know what? 'Up, Up and Away' is a little stronger than 'Go Where You Wanna Go,' so we're going to squash that and do 'Up, Up and Away.'" But now, we're going up the charts with our own company, competing against it. Fortunately ours won out, but it was shaky there to see how close you came from not being, and being, you know.
Story_ID: 482740
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about the group members from, from Hi-Fi [Hi-Fi's] to The 5th Dimension. Were they always the same people?
Speaker 2: No. At one time the, the original Hi-Fi's was [HistoryMaker] Harry Elston, who was one of the founders of The Friends of Distinction, you know, 'You Got me Going in Circles' ['Going in Circles'], and, "I can dig it, you can dig it, he can dig it" ['Grazing in the Grass'], he's the one that wrote that. And Floyd Butler, Fritz Baskett, [HistoryMaker] Marilyn McCoo, and myself--now when we had the original Hi-Fi's, we sang jazz, a very good jazz group. But we recorded one song called 'Lonesome Mood,' and it sold five copies; we all bought one (laughter). So I said, "You know what? Jazz is great, but we need--I like to still sing good music, but something with a funky beat that you can dance to, you know." And I had a dream. I mean I saw The 5th Dimension clear as day in a dream. I said, "We ought to do that, do this." And they said, "Well, no, you're a rock and roller anyway." They said, "We want to sing jazz." I said, "Well, you know what? You all go ahead. Because I saw this so clear, I know. So, I'm quitting, and you all find somebody to replace me." And Marilyn McCoo and I were sort of friends, maybe more or less trying to date, you know. So she said, "Well, no, I'm going with you." So, Marilyn left with me, and they went on their way. And it turned out to be The Friends of Distinction and The 5th Dimension, two different groups.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, the next members of the group were who?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Florence LaRue, Marilyn McCoo, Billy Davis [HistoryMaker Billy Davis, Jr.], and Ron Townson [Ronald Townson]. And Fritz Baskett was originally with The 5th Dimension, but Florence LaRue took her place because some boyfriend didn't want her to sing, you know. So she decided, "No, I'll help you train the girls." So, Florence came in. So--
Speaker 1: Okay. Now tell me a little about each of the members of The 5th Dimension. You talked a little bit about Marilyn earlier.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Marilyn is a classical musician. I mean she's a very, very good singer, you know. I mean she's well-trained and all. So, she was probably the most trained of all of us then. And Ron sang opera. He won third place in the Metropolitan Opera. And Florence, well, she sang pop. And Billy sang rock and roll. And me and Marilyn kind of sang jazz a little bit, you know. So, Billy and Ron were both from St. Louis [Missouri]. Marilyn and Florence were in California when I met them, but they weren't from there. They were from New Jersey or someplace, I forgot. But Ron and I went to school together. And Billy and I went to another high school in St. Louis [Charles H. Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri], but we were in the drum and bugle corps together. And he liked my sister and I liked his sister, so we were kind of (laughter) friends from that. And we're still friends to this day. You know, Ron died a few years ago here in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada]. And we had a reunion tour, and The 5th Dimension got back together with Marilyn and Billy for a couple of years. But when Ron died, that stopped that.
Story_ID: 482741
Speaker 1: It was said that your music was considered crossover. People didn't really know that the group was black. Is that, is that true?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, people say, "Well, in the first place, how did you all come up with that sound? You know, it's so different." But actually it was my fault, because I did not know what I was doing because of the sound. Because most people, if you're trying to start a group--if you start a country and western group, you want country and western singers. Or, if you got a rock and roll group, you want rock and roll singers. I didn't know no better, so I just knew these as friends, and we got together. And Ron [Ronald Townson] happened to sing, like I said, opera. And Billy [HistoryMaker Billy Davis, Jr.] sang rock and roll, and Florence [HistoryMaker Florence LaRue] sang pop. And Marilyn [HistoryMaker Marilyn McCoo] and I sang jazz, and that sound kind of infused, you know. And so when we started out, black people were like, "What is that y'all singing?" (Laughter) And I knew a guy that was promoting The Temptations in Los Angeles [California]. I'd done him a lot of favors--photography, and all that. And I said, "I got this group, man." And he said, "Yeah, I heard them." I said, "Well, I'd like for them to open for The Temps when they come." He said, "Well, man, yeah, but I don't know if that's the kind of music--." I said, "Hey, man, you owe me a favor." He said, "Well, okay." So he got us on the show with The Temptations. So we got on the show man singing, (singing) "You got to go where you want to go," and people said, "Y'all better go on off that stage and let them Temptations on." (Laughter) Black people almost broke us up, man first day. Somebody said, "Well, maybe you shouldn't go on with The Temptations. Maybe you ought to go on with Paul Revere and the Raiders or something." And ironically, that was the first group we went out with, Paul Revere and the Raiders. And we opened for them, tore the house down, and it worked. We were crossovers then. And we did--we finally recorded 'Up, Up and Away.' And we were doing 'The Johnny Carson Show' ['The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'] in New York [New York]. And while we were waiting for them to get the stage together, I just went out to look at the stage. And I heard these two white ladies in the audience saying, "You know what? I heard they were black." I said, "Oh, they don't even know what color we are." (Laughter) So then we got, we were working at Valparaiso College [sic. Valparaiso University, Valparaiso, Indiana]; we got the job there. And we got off the bus and the black kids were--what do you call it? They didn't want The 5th Dimension. They were--
Speaker 1: Protestors (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Protest- protesting, yeah. They were all protesting, marching and stuff, talking about, "We want more black groups. You got all these white groups coming." We got off the bus and I said, "Well, wait a minute." They said, "Well, you ain't no Temptations." I said, "Have you ever heard The 5th Dimension?" "No." I said, "Why you all knocking us, and you never heard us?" I said, "How many of you, twenty? I'm going to buy all y'all tickets to come to the show. And then when you see us, if it ain't what you think it is, then, you know, you got a right to form your opinion, but not before you even heard us." So we got them in the show, and they all came back, "So sorry, man."  They said, "You know what? The show was dynamite. And it wasn't right for us to be knocking nobody black trying to do something anyway." So that was one of the highlights of our career.
Story_ID: 482742
Speaker 1: Of course this was in the '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And civil rights and equal rights were--
Speaker 2: Very strong, you know. And I'd like to say The 5th Dimension helped open the doors, broke down a lot of barriers. Because people that wouldn't have liked R&B would come to see us, and people who didn't like country and western would come and see us. So, we were a country and western group, a jazz group. I mean we walked in a lot of cow dung and stuff, but for some reason we seemed to appeal to everybody. And so we wanted to use our music, man, to break down barriers. When people would come to see us for an hour or an hour and a half, and they'd forget all about their prejudices, you know. And if it could only go in the audience--I mean when they left the audience--and take it into the world, it would be great, the feeling that you get in the concerts. And one time Frank Sinatra--well, we were the only group that Frank Sinatra ever took on the road. He worked for the queen [Elizabeth II]. And Elton John and Ava Gardner and everybody was there. He saw us at Caesars Palace [Las Vegas, Nevada] and told the manager, "Hey, I want them to open for me at Caesars." And the manager said, "Well, they're doing so good in the lounge, we're going to have them in the main room for Christmas." He said, "I'm going in Thanksgiving, and I want them to open for me." So, "Okay, Mr. Sinatra." So, we liked the lounge; we were scared to death in the main room. But the best thing that could have happened to us was that we opened for Sinatra, and we got a feel of the main room. So when we went in December, we broke his record. He said, "No, this ain't going to do." So, he took us back in and he took us on the road. He loved the group. I think he had a little crush on Florence [HistoryMaker Florence LaRue], I believe. But then he wanted us to go to South Africa, and it had apartheid then. And he said, "But Sun City [South Africa] is different." I said, "No, it ain't no different." I said, "We're not going." We wanted to go so bad, but we wouldn't go because of apartheid. He said, "Well, Sun City is different from the rest." But still our African brothers couldn't go into Sun City like we could and be welcome. So we didn't want to go, so we didn't.
Story_ID: 482743
Speaker 1: Now, you also were friends with Sammy Davis, Jr.
Speaker 2: Sammy was the epitome of an entertainer. Boy, he was so great. I mean he's surely missed. And I got to know Sammy, and Ray Charles, and Lou Rawls. And you think of all the people that's gone, man, who helped pave the way for us. And it's kind of sad, but hey, they served their purpose.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your relationship with one, or all of those you just mentioned.
Speaker 2: Well, I told you Ray Charles was our manager.
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And even before he died, he was my brother's [Donald McLemore] son's godfather. And we used to play cards on the plane and all, man. And Ray would say, "When we going to play some more tonk or poker and all that?" I said, "Ray, we not going to play with you with them marked cards." (Laughter) He used to tease us about that all the time. And Lou Rawls and I lived in the same neighborhood about three or four houses apart in Encino [Los Angeles, California], back when somebody shot bullet holes in my car, because were the only two black families up there. But we opened for Lou Rawls, and then we got big and he opened for us. So, you know, it turns around. And Sinatra [Frank Sinatra] loved the group [The 5th Dimension]. And then the things that he did for black people--probably a lot of people don't know--he opened up Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada]. He helped break down segregation here. Sammy Davis--in fact Sammy, he wanted Sammy to work at the Sands [Sands Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada]. He said, "Sammy Davis, I want him to work in the Sands, or I don't work." So he got Sammy Davis in, and he did great. So, but at night he'd go back over to the black section to live. And Sinatra said, "No, no, no, you going to stay here at the hotel." The hotel said, "What?" "He's going to have a room here." So, Sammy was scared to death. He said, "Okay." He wouldn't even stay in the room at night. He'd just check in and then go back over on our side of town, you know. But Sinatra found out about that and made him go in the room. And he put two bodyguards outside his door, made him stay at the Sands. But that's how he really was deep down.
Speaker 1: What about your relationship with other groups of the time, like Little Anthony and the Imperials, and Friends of Distinction [The Friends of Distinction], and groups of that era? What was your relationship like with them?
Speaker 2: Well, when you get in the business, then you start meeting people and, you know, they have all respect for each other. I mean I've always liked Little Anthony and the Imperials, and The Temptations and all. And when we were all kind of growing up, they'd come to stay at my house, you know. And we got to be very, very good friends. And I ended up shooting pictures of half of the groups. So Little Anthony [HistoryMaker Jerome "Little Anthony" Gourdine] lives here. And you know, I started a celebrity softball team with Little Anthony and the Imperials, and [HistoryMaker] Sonny Turner, and Bubba Knight [HistoryMaker Merald "Bubba" Knight, Jr.] of Gladys Knight and the Pips, [HistoryMaker] Harry Elston of Friends of Distinction, me and The 5th Dimension, and my cousin Robert [HistoryMaker Robert DeBlanc] who worked with Marvin Gaye. So we started a celebrity softball team and raised money for charity and all. So, we raised seven hundred and fifty dollars for Haiti when they had the hurricane down there.
Speaker 1: Seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars?
Speaker 2: No, no, seven hundred and fifty dollars (laughter).
Speaker 1: Say it again.
Speaker 2: Seven hundred and fifty dollars.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: Just for the team. I wish.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Man, we can do it again. And now it's getting bigger, so we probably can raise thousands.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, okay, tell me about Bones Howe?
Speaker 2: Bones Howe is one of our producers. Man, and he would come up with all the songs. He would come up with most of the songs that we would do. And when he said 'Go Where You Wanna Go,' you know, I'm like--we were still black, too. You know, we didn't know nothing about this other side of the industry. So he said, "Well, just sing it." So he brought in The Mamas and Papas [The Mamas and The Papas] group; that was their first song. So they were going to teach us, you know. "Okay, well, they were going to do our song." And they showed us how to do it. And the song that we did turned out to be big, or bigger, than them, and we didn't see them no more. (Laughter) But Bones was great, he produced most of our songs.
Speaker 1: Is he the one introduced you to Laura Nyro?
Speaker 2: No. We were in San Francisco [California] performing there, and staying at this one apartment. And we were down--Ron [Ronald Townson] and Billy [HistoryMaker Billy Davis, Jr.] and myself were living in the same room. I had a kitchenette, you know, one of those. And we heard this singing on the floor up above us. We were rehearsing, and we both went out to the balcony together. And she came out and looked down, "We heard that singing up there. Who are you?" She said, "I'm Laura Nyro." And that's how we met her. "Well, I got some songs." So, we introduced her to Bones; maybe he knew her already, I don't know. But--
Speaker 1: So, what were some of the songs that you sang that she wrote?
Speaker 2: Oh, girl (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, was 'Stone Cold' [sic.]--
Speaker 2: 'Stone Cold' (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, 'Stoned Soul Picnic.'
Speaker 2: 'Stoned Soul Picnic,' yeah, that's one of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I can't remember what the others were.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: I hear the song and listen, I can tell you. But--
Story_ID: 482744
Speaker 1: Now this is probably around 1968, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, about (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Tell me about your Grammy [Grammy Award] nominations and your Grammys.
Speaker 2: When we first got nominated, we thought we might make one Grammy for the Group of the Year [sic. Best New Artist], you know, since there was this big thing about us and all. And then when Bobbie Gentry won that, we were like, "Oh, man, we're not going to--." And then after that, every song, "The 5th Dimension, The 5th Dimension." And I think we won three Grammys that year, so and that just took off.
Speaker 1: Now, 'Aquarius' ['Medley: Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In (The Flesh Failures)']. Tell me the story about, behind that song.
Speaker 2: That's the most phenomenal story about The 5th Dimension. We were working at the Americana hotel [The Americana of New York] in New York [New York], and Billy Davis [HistoryMaker Billy Davis, Jr.] lost his wallet in the cab. And so a guy found it and called up Billy, and said, "Hey, I found your wallet." And Billy said, "In New York you found my wallet." He said, "My money and credit cards and everything is in here." And Billy said, "That's phenomenal in New York for somebody to return your wallet with everything in it." So the guy who did it, Billy said, "Well, I'd like to invite you to our show." So, him and another guy came to the show at The Americana. He said, "Well, you know, I have a little show off Broadway that I'd like for you guys to come see, too." So we went to see it, and it was 'Hair' ['Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical'], and we heard this song, Ronnie Dyson doing 'Aquarius.' And we said, "Man, look here, we'd like to do that." He said, "Yeah." And he would have given us publishing and everything, but we were too dumb to take it (laughter). So, we missed out on that. So we brought the song back to Bones Howe, and it was a big hit. And it just goes to show that honesty pays. Because, because he turned in about three hundred dollars, he probably made three hundred million, you know, by us doing this song and putting him on Broadway.
Story_ID: 482745
Speaker 1: Now, you had a recording studio, didn't you?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No?
Speaker 2: I had a photography studio.
Speaker 1: Photography studio, okay. So, I got that wrong. Let's talk a little bit about, about the industry itself, as you mentioned, about publishing rights and royalties and things like that. Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: You know, when you first start out, you're so glad to have a song, just to hear it on the radio for the first time, man, you not even thinking about no publisher. I didn't know what publishing was and all. So I heard, some managers and producers, man, would take young kids' songs and change the to that, and then say they wrote half of the song, and take it and publish it. Oh, man, but now we know, and it's too late. (Laughter) But that's the way it was then. You know, if you were young, they just took advantage of you. And I heard one of the top groups at a major recording company in Detroit [Michigan], they had hit after hit after hit, and for two or three years none of them even owned a car. Because the company would say, "Oh, we need the money to put back in the business for a new recording," or, "you know, for getting you all together," or whatever; just taking the people's money. And even us, when we started out, we weren't making any money after two or three hit records. We said, "Well, where's the money?" They said, "Well, it's going back into the business. We got new recordings and all that." Then they sold our company [Liberty Records]. The record company sold out to somebody--Transamerica [Transamerica Corporation]. And Transamerica owned a record company, and all that. And we saw this big ad saying, "Their music," they had a big picture of us [The 5th Dimension], "their music is worth a hundred million dollars." I said, "If our music is worth a hundred million, where's our money, you know?" They said, "Oh, oh, we found a little money here," and then they started paying us. But we pulled the cover off of that. "Where did you get that figure from?"
Speaker 1: Was there a point where you got your own attorneys, and someone to start to looking after your money (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah. After a while you have to, everybody has to do that, especially when you get as big as The 5th Dimension. And if they--royalties--if they paid you fifty thousand [dollars], there's five hundred more thousand dollars hidden somewhere. And so it got so ridiculous until we said, "Well, hey, we're going to have an audit." "Audit?" Well, they send you a hundred thousand dollars, but when the audit--, "Well, we found two or three more hundred thousand." So when you mention audit, all of a sudden more money starts being found. In fact, right now to this day, we're audited.

Speaker 1: Now, going back to the group, did you always sing as a group singing together in harmony? Was there someone that would be the lead singer or, and then the others backed up? How was the group put together as far as that aspect?
Speaker 2: Well, when I first put The 5th Dimension together, the best thing you could do--you know, some people put groups together and they want to take half and then divide the other little money. No, I wanted it to be divided equally. And that meant everybody had to put in equal time and equal share, and they all worked equally. You know, greed can kill a whole lot of things. But because we did that, everybody worked together. And we had four, I saw four singers, okay, that I knew could sing their butts off. Me, I'm a photographer and baseball player, and I hated singing with a passion. And you know, that just happened by accident. And so I saw, I mean I just saw it coming together in this dream. So, now I'm the only one that wasn't really a singer. So, they all was learning songs. I said, "Well, you know what? I'd like to learn mine and take it home and learn it, you know, a little bit more." They said, "Okay, that's cool." So I got this guy to teach me the songs so I could be ready the next day. He'd be down in the basement playing, he say, "You sure you want to sing?" I said, "Shut up fool. I'm paying you, ain't I?" (Laughter) So, I would learn the one song to keep up. And little by little, I mean I learned how to sing background and all. So--
Speaker 1: So there were two albums that featured Florence [HistoryMaker Florence LaRue] and Marilyn [HistoryMaker Marilyn McCoo] on the lead. 'The Girls' Song'?
Speaker 2: 'The Girls' Song,' yeah.
Speaker 1: How did that song come about?
Speaker 2: We were running out of time (laughter) in the studio. And the guy said, "Well, look here. I think we'll just do the two girls on it." And it was a girl song, anyway. So, you know, that cut down the half the studio time, so they just went in and did that.
Speaker 1: So you were sayin- so was it, what company were you singing with now? What was your record label?
Speaker 2: Well, Soul City [Soul City Records] sold to Liberty Records.
Speaker 1: Okay. And then in '70 [1970], the group changed its label to Bell?
Speaker 2: Bell Records, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Bell Records, okay. And around this time, Florence and Marc [Marc Gordon] get married?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that right?
Speaker 2: And Marilyn--
Speaker 1: Tell me about that time.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I think he always had a crush on her, you know. One time we got the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, before you get into that story let's stop and change the tape. Okay?
Story_ID: 482747
Speaker 1: You were telling me about Florence [HistoryMaker Florence LaRue] and Marc [Marc Gordon].
Speaker 2: Florence and Marc?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I think Marc always had a crush on Florence from the very beginning. And that probably came to light when Godfrey Cambridge won 'The Dating Game,' and he couldn't go with Florence. So he said, "Well, I can't go, but you can take somebody with you," and all. So we were singing, so she said, "Well, do one of you all want to go?" I said, "Yeah, I'll go." We were going to the Bahamas or someplace. So, yeah, me and her were going to go. And Marc said, "What? You and Florence are going to go to the Bahamas? No, we got a job." He went and found a job. He wasn't going to let us go down there (laughter). So, it worked out good. So then they got married in a balloon. And then after that, Marilyn [HistoryMaker Marilyn McCoo] and Billy [HistoryMaker Billy Davis, Jr.] got married, and they're still married to this day, man; they have a great relationship. In fact, they have a book ['Up, Up and Away: How We Found Love, Faith and Lasting Marriage in the Entertainment World,' Marilyn McCoo, Billy Davis, Jr., and Mike Yorkey], they have a book out now, too.
Speaker 1: So, right after they got married, this is when you change labels to Bell Records. And tell me about what happens when you change to that new label.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't remember what songs we [The 5th Dimension] recorded with Bell.
Speaker 1: I think one of the songs might have been something that was co-written by Neil Sedaka, 'The Puppet Man' ['Puppet Man'].
Speaker 2: 'The Puppet Man'?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, in 1970 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is that on Bell? I don't know what song--you know, 'Puppet Man' came from Neil Sedaka, and that was quite an interesting song, you know, I liked it. It still wasn't that R&B--I'm still R&B oriented, you know. But hey, we did the songs, and they worked. So--
Speaker 1: Well, didn't Tom Jones do that same song that year [sic.]? Do you remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not the same 'Puppet Man.'
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: I think it was a different 'Puppet Man.'
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Story_ID: 482748
Speaker 1: In 1970, you met President Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon], is that right? Actually, how many presidents have you, have you met or sang for (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we met, met three presidents, and worked for two of them. And it's been, it was kind of phenomenal, I mean, working at the White House [Washington, D.C.] and actually meeting the presidents of the United States. You know, I mean that was a big deal. And one time we were singing for Imelda Marcos, they were the guests. But we didn't like Marcos, but the fact that we could do it for the White House, you know, we just went ahead and sang for them. But one thing I remember about the three presidents, when I looked in their face, all of them had the same look. It was like, "Yeah, man, if you only knew what's on this planet, you'd get the freak off of here (laughter)."
Speaker 1: Now, also, in--well, did you tell me which presidents they were? Do you remember which ones you met?
Speaker 2: Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], Nixon, and Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], I think.
Story_ID: 482749
Speaker 1: Now, also in 1970, one of my favorite songs, "One Less Bell to Answer," came out. And tell me about that song.
Speaker 2: Well, "One Less" (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who wrote that?
Speaker 2: I think Burt Bacharach wrote that, I'm not sure. I think he did, because I think somebody told me that [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick wasn't too happy because, you know (laughter), so--
Speaker 1: Right, because he was writing all her songs, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right. And we had two or three hits off that particular album. And so, we were just ready to move on. And some disc jockey said, "No, no, no, this song is jumping off the charts down here, so I think you better release this first." So we listened to it and we did. And it's a good thing, because it was another gold-selling record for us.
Speaker 1: 'Love's Lines, Angles and Rhythms' [sic.].
Speaker 2: And rhymes.
Speaker 1: And rhymes? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Love's Lines, Angles and Rhymes.' That was a terrific song, but The 5th Dimension had a lot of turntable hits, you know. "Ashes To Ashes" was another one of my favorite songs, big song, the most requested song on the radio, and it didn't sell nothing in the streets, you know, because nobody could dance to it, but everybody loved listening to it, but they listened to it on the radio; they didn't have to pay for it. But they were great songs.
Speaker 1: And so through the '70s [1970s], tell me about the '70s [1970s] and, as far as television. Did you ever work with Cher?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one TV show we worked with Cher, Sonny and Cher. But I don't remember. We didn't really meet them.
Story_ID: 482750
Speaker 1: Now, Billy [HistoryMaker Billy Davis, Jr.] and, and Marilyn [HistoryMaker Marilyn McCoo] leave the group [The 5th Dimension] and who are they replaced with?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, when people leave groups, different groups, they always think something bad happened, or there was some big breakup. But no. When we first got together, nobody really wanted to be in the group. I'm the one that convinced them, and for ten years we were. So, we were celebrating our tenth anniversary. And we said, "Well, we thought we'd be rich fast. We ain't rich yet." And it looked like we were going to go on, you know, not just dissolve the group. So, everybody would speak up and say how they felt. So Marilyn and Billy said, "You know what? We think we want to try to be individual singers. A group is so confining, and we want to do things on our own. And so, we'll stay with you and help you find two other singers to replace us." And so they helped us, and there were no arguments or nothing like people thought. So we're still very good friends today.
Speaker 1: So your final recording, was that 'Earthbound'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay. And that's, once again, Jimmy Webb was the composer?
Speaker 2: You're going into my Alzheimer's now (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I really didn't keep up with who wrote what, and all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I was just--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They'd call me up to sing, and I'd go in there and sing and go on about my business.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, did you tell me who replaced them?
Speaker 2: Back then, Margie Barnes [Marjorie Barnes] and Danny Beard were the two replacements. There's been a lot of replacements since then off and on, you know. So--
Speaker 1: So the band continued to tour?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it never stopped. Forty-one years this year, you know, and I semi-retired. I had back surgery, so I got a guy [Michael Mishaw] to replace me. And I said, "If you need me, call me. Just don't need me." So Florence [HistoryMaker Florence LaRue] is still continuing with the group, and Willie Williams and, and three other people.
Story_ID: 482751
Speaker 1: Speaking about Florence [HistoryMaker Florence LaRue], she was the lead singer on 'Love Hangover.' Tell me the story about, about that 'cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was after Marilyn [HistoryMaker Marily McCoo] and Billy [HistoryMaker Billy Davis, Jr.] had left, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, Marc Gordon heard the song on Diana Ross' album, and she didn't release it as a single. So he said, "You know what? Maybe we should do that song." We said, "Okay." So we went in and recorded 'Love Hangover,' and Diana Ross' conductor, I knew him very well. He called me up from London [England] and said, he said, "Diana Ross just heard this song, she said, 'Oh yeah, this song. Wait a minute, that ain't my damn song.'" (Laughter) So she called up Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy], "I told you we shouldn't have released that other song. I wanted to cut that song." And she stopped the song from going up the chart just to compete with us, "I want that song." So now we're on the Billboard [Billboard Hot 100], and we got two ads going up the chart, The 5th Dimension and Diana Ross, 'Love Hangover.' And we had paid one disc jockey. You know, you had to pay everybody to do things, you know. So, okay, well, so he got our record really started. And all of a sudden our record wasn't playing anymore, but Diana Ross' was. So we heard that--this is hearsay--but somebody made the record company an offer and said, "Well, we'll give you three records. If you buy one, we'll give you two," you know. So, you know, money talks. So, ours went down the drain.
Speaker 1: But you signed with Motown [Motown Records]. Is that after this happened?
Speaker 2: I don't remember if I did. But we signed with Motown because one guy there finally said, "Well, you know what? Motown didn't know what to do with you guys before, but you guys got a sound that we can do something." So, okay, we signed with them, and then he got killed. Somebody robbed him and hit him in the head or something; something strange happened to him. So we said, "No, we don't want to go with Motown since the guy is gone too."
Speaker 1: So what label were you on now, after--because Bell [Bell Records], you leave Bell, and Marc Gordon leaves Bell, too. Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I don't--Clive Davis' label [Arista Records], I'm not sure.
Story_ID: 482752
Speaker 1: Now you talked about the other members [of The 5th Dimension] getting married. When do you get married?
Speaker 2: Look here. I had, I had too much on my plate to be getting married; I mean, I was too busy. Back then when I was playing ball and doing photography and singing and all, man, I mean the last thing I wanted to be involved in was girls. And then when I was, it turned out to be such a bad relationship until I was through with girls. I mean, you know, if it happened it happened. So, then I happened to walk in the color lab one day, and there's this lady sitting up there. And I saw these guys peeping in the window looking at her. I said, "Who is that?" So, (laughter) so, they used to do my pictures in this lab. And I came in with shorts on one day, and this lady said, "Do you play tennis?" And I said, "Yeah, do you play tennis, too?" She said, "Yeah." And I said, "Would you like to play?" So we made a date to go play tennis. I mean she was dating somebody else, and I was too. So we were just talking about, I'm asking her questions, "Well, how do you deal with girls?" And she was asking me the same thing about guys and all. And we out there having such a good time, I said, "Well, you know, well, wait a minute. While we complaining and we're having such a good time." (Laughter) So, and it just happened like that. So, and we've been happily married over twelve years now. Man, everybody just couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me your wife's name.
Speaker 2: Her name is Mieko [Mieko Tone McLemore]. She's Japanese.
Speaker 1: Go ahead, tell me more.
Speaker 2: Tell you more?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Oh, well (laughter). Well, she's actually one of the bright spots in my whole life, you know. I mean, people say, "Well, man, if you got married, then she must be all right, you know." And like I said at my wedding, I mean, I'd met girls before and dated or whatever, that you think you like. But my [maternal] grandmother [Gertrude Whitecloud Shaver] taught me this. She said, "You know, if your heart tells you that's the person," she said, "scratch it. If your mind tells you that's the person, scratch it." I said, "Well, what then?" She said, "But if your mind and your heart tell you that's the person, then you got a chance." So, she told me this. And we've been together twelve years. I think I'm the longest boyfriend she ever had, too (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have children?
Speaker 2: No, we don't. I have one daughter from a previous relationship. And that's quite a story, too, because she's twenty-one years old now. But her mother [Lisa Starnes], I shot her for Jet magazine when she was eighteen, and I kept the same bathing suit and put it on my daughter for eighteen years; I don't know how I found it. And I duplicated the pose when she got eighteen, and put it in Jet, and they used it. So, it's really a cute picture. Now she's twenty-one and got a daughter. And I've shot her daughter in the same bathing suit, so I hope I'm still around eighteen more years.
Speaker 1: What's your daughter's name?
Speaker 2: Ciara [Ciara McLemore Rorabaugh].
Speaker 1: And your granddaughter?
Speaker 2: Mikala [ph.].
Story_ID: 482753
Speaker 1: Now going back to the group [The 5th Dimension], Ron Townson [Ronald Townson] left for a little while, and then he came back. Where did he go when he left?
Speaker 2: Well, everybody wanted to go on their own, you know, so he started a group [Ron Townson and Wild Honey] of his own. And he left the group and that didn't work out, so then he came back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had a reunion tour with Marilyn [HistoryMaker Marilyn McCoo] and Billy [HistoryMaker Billy Davis, Jr.] after that. But then when he died, that dissolved that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, tell me a little more about the reunion tour. What prompted you to do a reunion tour?
Speaker 2: Good question. All of yours are good questions (laughter). Well, Marilyn and Billy were signed up with the same management that we had. So he suggested, he said, "You know what? Maybe we ought to try a reunion tour together, since we're all under the same umbrella. So, we'll just do specialty things." And Donald Trump [President Donald John Trump] gave us the first job in Atlantic City [New Jersey]. So, it worked out really good; getting back together was phenomenal.
Speaker 1: Marilyn tells the story about--it was a surprise that you all came to her house. What was the story about that, about you all were, you all came to her house to surprise her, and Billy had set it up? I guess it was a party for her?
Speaker 2: Nope, I don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You don't remember?
Speaker 2: I don't remember that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter). Okay, now, what about--how does Donald Trump fit in with the group? How did you know Donald Trump?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't--he knew about the group, and he liked the group. So we worked at two or three of his hotels and all so. And Florence [HistoryMaker Florence LaRue] got to know him. I just met him in passing, so I don't know him.
Speaker 1: But the reunion tour--that was the time that you played at the Trump Hotels, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. That's one reason we got together, was because we had a job (laughter).
Speaker 1: And that was New Year's Eve. Is that right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 482754
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about receiving a star on Hollywood [Hollywood Walk of Fame]. How did you hear about this and tell me the story.
Speaker 2: Well, we heard about it, and we were so ecstatic. You know, I mean to have a star on Hollywood, I really don't know how it came about, you know. But people say, "You were deserving of it." So, and just the fact that we were there across from Grauman's Chinese Theatre [TCL Chinese Theatre, Las Angeles, California]--it's in a great place, too. So I go and look at it every time I go into Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], to see if it's still there (laughter). They tell me somebody's been stealing a couple of the stars. So, they left ours. Good.
Speaker 1: Now, Dick Clark, tell me about Dick Clark.
Speaker 2: Well, we did his television show ['American Bandstand'] a long time ago, and we remained friends. And then we ended up--the last thing that we recorded, he was involved in it, you know. And he's very sick now, so I wish him all the luck. But he was phenomenal. He came to our recording studio and listened to the last song. Some people say we invited him, but he'd just come and leave. But he stayed there for the whole session. And we got him to do the opening, saying, "The 5th Dimension's in the house." And that's Dick Clark doing that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is there anything that, so far that we have not talked about, that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: You mean besides winning a lottery ticket (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 482755
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tell me about how you came from Los Angeles [California] to Las Vegas [Nevada], or why you came to live in Las Vegas?
Speaker 1: Los Angeles, I mean I love Los Angeles. I had a lot of great friends, a great house, and it was kind of hard to make the decision to leave. But then one day I just--I don't think my wife [Mieko Tone McLemore] liked the house there so much, because it was so big and it brought back so many memories. And people would forget that there was my wife, and they would still come to the house. You know, it was always an open house, you know. "I'm not getting up and getting nothing out of the refrigerator.  Go and get you a drink."  And she's not used to that, being Japanese. "They going in our refrigerator." (Laughter) I'll tell you one story about my wife. When I first met her, I was taking her around to meet all my friends and all. And she's Japanese, so just out of nowhere one day she said, "You know what? There sure is a lot of black people named homes." (Laughter) So, I fell out.
Story_ID: 482756
Speaker 1: So you leave the group [The 5th Dimension] in 2006, just last year?
Speaker 2: Last year, last March.
Speaker 1: Okay. And that was because?
Speaker 2: Well, after forty years, you know--and then I was having problems with my back. You know, and as you get older--heart spasms and all kind of stuff. And the doctor just said, "You know what?" I said, "Well, the group needs me." He said, "Look here. You've been there forty years. Now, do you want to try to be rich and dead, or do you want to try to spend the little money you got now and enjoy life?" And you know, my wife [Mieko Tone McLemore], every year she wanted to plan something. We'd like to go somewhere for our anniversaries and all, and we couldn't plan it. Because, "Well, you might get a job," you know, and I'd have to wait until the last minute. But you have to book in advance, so we lost a couple of places that we wanted to go. And I said, "Well, you know what? I spent forty years with a group. It's time to spend a little time with my family."
Speaker 1: But with that said, tell me about Flashback.
Speaker 2: Flashback, man, that's--I told you I started a celebrity softball team with Little Anthony [HistoryMaker Jerome "Little Anthony" Gourdine], and Harry [HistoryMaker Harry Elston], The Friends of Distinction, The 5th Dimension, [HistoryMaker] Sonny Turner of The Platters, and my cousin Robert [HistoryMaker Robert DeBlanc] with Marvin Gaye. So we started for charity, and then that turned out to be very good. But I told you about what happened with Gladys already. So, I'm--
Speaker 1: Did you?
Speaker 2: We were singing on the stage--well, I'll tell you again.
Speaker 1: Tell me.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter). When Gladys Knight heard about the baseball team, in fact, she came to the game and cheerleaded one time. So on the closing night at the Flamingo [Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada], her husband's [William McDowell] birthday was that night, too. So she said, "Do you think you guys can get together and do a couple of numbers, just come out on stage and surprise him?" I said, "Well, yeah." So we got together, man, and we rehearsed a few songs and told a few lies. And we had such a good time together, man. And all these are original people, all original people, you know. So, if all the impersonators could do it, I know the original people could do it. So we got out and put our little tuxes on and went out and did our little choreography, and we turned the place out, out, out. I mean it was really good. So, then a couple of agents were in the audience. They said, "Man, I think you all got something." So we went and made up a name, the Flashback, and patented it and all. So, who knows what will happen to it, but if it does it's really very good. So I hope we will record something, just something special, maybe a Christmas album or something that will last forever.
Speaker 1: What are some of the other things that you're doing today?
Speaker 2: Some of the things I'm doing today?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Besides what I told you--eating and sleeping and dressing (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Playing softball and going to the casinos.
Speaker 1: I'm talking about school. Are you--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: You told me some photography, some new photography (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I'm going to UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] now taking up a course in Photoshop, because I do digital work, you know. But I'm trying to learn how to really do it, you know. I can't even write a letter on it, and my wife [Mieko Tone McLemore] teases me because I don't even check no e-mails. I just like to print pictures on it. But so far, it's doing great. So--
Speaker 1: So, you're still taking pictures.
Speaker 2: I'm still shooting for Jet, and I'm still taking pictures. And half the neighbors know I shoot pictures, and they're bringing their kids by. And even the mailman came by and held, and I had him hold the reflector. And he gets mad when nobody's around. "There's nobody to shoot today?" And one day the mailman was holding the reflector, and somebody passed by in their car and said, "Yeah, that's why the mail is late today," (laughter) so.
Story_ID: 482757
Speaker 1: Tell me, okay, you have done so many things. And you told me earlier that you like to go to, you know, traveling to places that you hadn't had an opportunity to visit, actually visit.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were there, but you didn't really see (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Besides traveling, what do you want to do now that you have not done? What is something that you would like to do?
Speaker 2: That I'd like to do?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: I'm doing it (laughter), retired, ain't got no job (laughter). So, no, I mean, you know, I just take every day as it comes, man. So, even when I wake up in the morning my wife [Mieko Tone McLemore] says, "What you going to do today?" I said, "Hey, I ain't got no job, so (laughter)."
Speaker 1: Okay. Well--
Speaker 2: So, so my friend, Richard Coleman, who's from St. Louis [Missouri], he's my gambling partner. Man, so whenever I go out, my wife says, "Yeah, you ain't going to work. I know you going with Richard. And I know where you going, to the casino." We got a couple of casinos over there that know, the machines know our names. "Hey, where's Richard (laughter)?"
Story_ID: 482758
Speaker 1: If you had to send a message to the future generations, what, what would you say?
Speaker 2: Well, first, I would say learn about the past. Because they don't even know nothing about our past generation, you know what I mean. I was shooting a couple of models here that were like twenty or twenty-one years old, and they said, "Well, so you sing?" I said, "Yeah, with The 5th Dimension." They said, "Who?" I said, "Well, you don't know The 5th Dimension?" "No." I said, "Do you know The Beatles?" They said, "Yeah, we know The Beatles." And I said, "We have more Grammys [Grammy Awards] than The Beatles, and you don't know us." So, something is radically wrong. And I thought about it, and it's been like through history. I mean I said, "Well, do you all know Dinah Washington?" "No." "Or Sarah Vaughn?" "No." "Duke Ellington?" "No." "Count Basie?" I said, "Where have you all been?" You know, I mean, all the artists, major artists--the Rolling Stones and Sinatra [Frank Sinatra] and everybody got all our songs from us, you know. So, you better go back in the past. And I would like to see that taught more in the schools, you know. You know, give us a little more credit for, for the past.
Story_ID: 482759
Speaker 1: What are your concerns for, for America, or even more spec- specifically, the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm more concerned about the human race right now. Because, man, it's getting to where you ain't going to be thinking about black or white; you're going to be thinking about saving your butt from these terrorists or something, you know. And when that happens, it brings people together, but it's too bad that's the only thing that brings us together, you know. We got to have something like 9/11 [September 11, 2001] before everybody pulls together, you know. And we're all on this planet together. And while we're blowing up each other--you know, I don't know why--I mean everybody wants peace, they say, and yet they don't--they're not striving for it. So, the one thing I pray for every night is that--whatever we can do individually and collectively to help bring about world peace and end poverty and hunger.

Speaker 1: What advice would you give to those who want to enter into the music business?
Speaker 2: Go do Photoshop or something (laughter). No I--hey, if it's your dream, then do it, you know. Like my [maternal] grandmother [Gertrude Whitecloud Shaver] said, "If there's something you really want to do, put a 100 percent in it and you'll get a 100 percent back," you know. Don't let nobody tell you that you can't do something without at least trying it. The only time you can't afford to fail is the last you try.
Speaker 1: Well, with that said, what do you think about hip-hop and rap music?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, all music has a place, their own place in history. You know, when our parents were growing up, "What is that y'all singing?" (Laughter) You know, we sitting there, "What is that you singing? Hip-hop?" And I think there's some very good talent in hip-hop. It's just that they're wasting it talking about people's mamas, and killing police, and hoes, and this and that. I mean, what is that? That ain't no music. I mean music should at least have a positive message.
Speaker 1: Who do you listen to? What's in your CD [compact disc] player?
Speaker 2: See all them tapes over there? I ain't listening to none of them. (Laughter) So, no, I like, I like everybody, whatever's playing. You know, I come in and my wife's [Mieko Tone McLemore] got this symphony on, and man, and I sit there and I dig that for a minute. And when she leaves, I turn on the rock and roll. But while she's there, I mean, I love it, you know. So I like music, all kinds, even some country and western. I wrote a country and western song. What's the name of it? 'If Your Phone Don't Ring, It's Me' [ph.]. (Laughter) I love the title so.

Speaker 1: Now, you have left a legacy. But tell me, how do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, again, my [maternal] grandmother [Gertrude Whitecloud Shaver], she said, "You know, you go through life, and you don't want to just be no statistic. You want to leave something, just leave something for the world." And I think we did that with The 5th Dimension. So, that's something that will always be remembered in a positive manner.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. I want to thank you for taking the time to tell us your story. It will be inspirational to the future generations.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you for considering me.

Speaker 2: That you took?
Speaker 1: That I took.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: Sammy Davis loved The 5th Dimension, and we loved Sammy Davis man. And believe it or not, he loved to cook, too. He used to bring a suitcase full of pots and pans and stuff. It was so heavy, I don't know how they got it on the airplane.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): That's pretty amazing. All right, ready.
Speaker 1: That's when Ray Charles was one of our--Ray Charles was our manager, and he'd given me one of my parts for a song back in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, next.
Speaker 1: That's Ringo Starr. I went to see his concert a couple of years ago. I went backstage, and I'm in awe of him, and come to find out he said he was in awe of me. So--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, ready.

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: That's Richard Roundtee- Richard Roundtree and myself at a celebrity football game for charity. So he's one of my main idols. When I grow up, I really want to be just like him.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, next.
Speaker 1: That's The 5th Dimension, the original 5th Dimension. And that's probably the only picture I have that's autographed by everybody, so I cherish this picture. Ron's [Ronald Townson] no longer with us, God bless his soul. But everybody else is still together.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: Believe it or not, this started out as a softball team. This is [HistoryMaker] Harry Elston of The Friends of Distinction, [HistoryMaker] Sonny Turner of The Platters, that's me, and that's Bubba Knight [HistoryMaker Merald "Bubba" Knight, Jr.] of Gladys Knight and the Pips. That's Little Anthony [HistoryMaker Jerome "Little Anthony" Gourdine] of Little Anthony and the Imperials. And this is [HistoryMaker] Robert DeBlanc who sang with Marvin Gaye. And we call ourselves the Flashback.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 1: Sometimes I don't believe that's me, because I'm really walking around usually in jeans and stuff. And somebody said, "Well, I guess you clean up real nice."
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Is that for an occasion?
Speaker 1: For a Flashback picture.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: This is my granddaughter, Mikala [ph.]; this is my daughter, Ciara [Ciara McLemore Rorabaugh]; and that's me at the senior softball team. One day we were having a game and they came up to cheerlead. And this is my wife, Mieko [Mieko Tone McLemore].
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: That's the softball team, the Anthem [ph.] softball team. That's my friend Marty [ph.] in the background, he's one of my neighbors. We taught him how to play tonk. So this was right before I got this grand slam home run, naturally (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: This is Jayne Kennedy. She was one of the first black sportscasters, and one of the few black girls who's ever been on the cover of Playboy. And I shot her first picture and got her her first job. She was my first million dollar model, and one of my best friends--her and husband, [HistoryMaker] Bill Overton, and all the kids.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: And this was a class project I had at UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada]. I was taking Photoshop, and they wanted to do something with masks and stuff. So I just chose Jayne, since she was one of my favorite models, to be the subject. So, I hope it passes.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: Believe it or not, this is my daughter's mother [Lisa Starnes] when she was eighteen; I shot her for Jet. And after eighteen years old, I took my daughter and put her in the same bathing suit. And then I duplicated the pose when she got eighteen and sent it to Jet, and they used it. This is my daughter.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: And this is my daughter's daughter, Mikala. And I took the same bathing suit and put it on her. I hope I'm around eighteen more years to do the same thing (laughter).

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: To be on the cover of Jet after shooting for them for forty years is kind of phenomenal to me.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): All right, ready.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a picture of my mother. I don't know how old she is on this picture. And that's her little brother in the middle, L.C., and her sister, Syl on the top, on the left.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: I think everybody recognizes this young man and his wife [Pat Nixon], Richard Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon], with The 5th Dimension and his daughter, Tricia [Tricia Nixon Cox], when we performed at the White House [Washington, D.C.]. I don't remember what year, but it was a very good year.
