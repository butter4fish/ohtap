Story_ID: 642130
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight questions that we always ask as kind of a warm up, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food.  I love seafood, and of--I guess it would be scallops.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, but I have more than one.  I guess the one that comes immediately to mind is turquoise.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Autumn, fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Anywhere where there's ocean and beaches.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is: do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Actually, I don't think so.  I mean, I have so many quotes I've collected that I'm very fond of and that are meaningful to me.  But I really can't dredge one up right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 642131
Speaker 1: Well, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] side, but separately; and then we'll put them together.  So can you give me your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's first name was Hugh, H-U-G-H.  She was named for her father.  And--
Speaker 1: So that's a--that's the story, is that she was named Hugh--
Speaker 2: Hugh Ella.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hugh Ella, E-L-L-A, Hancock, H-A-N-C-O-C-K. That was her name before she married my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hugh Ella Hancock [Hugh Hancock Gregory].
Speaker 1: Now, the Hancock name, in this part of the coun- well, this is in--where was she born?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Austin, Texas.
Speaker 1: Austin, Texas.  Okay.  And what year?
Speaker 2: Oh, she was born in, I think it was 1896.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was born into a family of two individuals who were also born in Houston [Texas]--I mean, in Austin.  Her mother and her father both had been products of associations where their mothers had been black or African American, and the fathers had been white.  In each case, the father sent them away to school to be educated in Oberlin, Ohio, at Oberlin preparatory school [Preparatory Department of Oberlin College] and Oberlin College.  My mother's father, I think, his name was Hugh Berry Hancock.  His father's name was John Hancock.  Hugh was born, I think, in about 1855 in Austin, Texas.  And his father, John, was a lawyer and a rancher, and who also spent some time in the United States Congress.  And when Texas threatened to secede from the Union, he left Texas for a period of time.  But he sent Hugh, his son, to Oberlin to be away from the war that was starting up or threatening to begin, the Civil War.  And Hugh lived there for all of his growing up years in Oberlin, Ohio.  And then he returned to Austin, but he met Susie [Gregory Thomas' maternal grandmother, Susie James Hancock] while he was there in Oberlin, who had been sent there also as well by her father.  And I--his name was O'Connor [ph.], but I don't know quite as much about him.  I know that his mother's name was Eliza or Elizabeth [Eliza Hancock], and the two of them were sent to Oberlin.  I'm sorry.  That was Hugh's mother was Eliza.  Susie's mother was Martha [Martha James (ph.)].  And she and Martha went to live in Oberlin as well, and that's where she met Hugh Hancock.  And when they returned to Austin after the war was over, they married and they lived in Austin at that time, and that's where they raised their family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother was born in Austin?
Speaker 2: Yes, both of them.  My mother was born there.  Now, I have done some family research, and I know that Hugh Berry Hancock's father, John, was from, I think it was Tennessee [sic. Alabama], where there was a Hancock family, and that was a John Allen Hancock.  I can't tell you the year that John Hancock, my grandfather's father was born.  I don't really remember.
Speaker 1: Well, now we're getting back towards the beginning of the 19th century, right?
Speaker 2: I guess, yes, yes.  Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Around 1800.
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: John Allen Hancock.  Now, I want to ask--are they related to the John Hancock?
Speaker 2: I believe that there was a family connection there.  They weren't direct descendants, but that Hancock, John Allen Hancock's family came originally from Virginia.
Story_ID: 642132
Speaker 1: So, now what did your mother's parents do for a living?
Speaker 2: My mother's mother originally was simply a homemaker.  She had four daughters.  My mother [Hugh Hancock Gregory] was the last one by ten years.  Her father, Hugh Berry Hancock [Hugh Hancock], started out as a teacher when he returned to Austin, but he became interested in politics, and so he was quite outspoken on some issues, and he also was a business owner.  He owned several saloons.  I think there were four saloons.  One was called the Black Elephant Saloon in Austin.  The other was the--another one was the H.B. Hancock Saloon, also in Austin.  And there were two more.  I can't remember the names.  The family left Austin, Texas, though, when my mother was a young girl.  The house that Hugh had built for his family is now a historic landmark.
Speaker 1: In what sense is it commemorated?
Speaker 2: In Austin.  Because of him being African American, Negro, black person, back in those days and having been a business owner as he was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And also, so involved in politics.  There were some articles written about him, about statements he made.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they eventually left, and they moved out to the Midwest.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story as to why he left Texas?
Speaker 2: Do you know, I can only guess at that.  I did write an article or rather a biography about him.  And my mother never really spoke of why they left Texas.  But it must have had something to do with the pressures that were being put on blacks at that time.  And his father [John Hancock] had passed away, I think, as well, and I'm sure he was a support to Hugh while he was there, even in getting those businesses going that he owned.  So they left, and I never had a specific reason as to why.  As I said, I can only guess.  And I do believe it had something to do with the conditions in Texas at that time.  And they went out to the Midwest.  They went to Chicago [Illinois] and to Evanston, Illinois; and also, they went to Portland, Oregon.  They were there for a while.  My father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] used to jokingly tell my mother that she'd been a gypsy, and then they left Oregon and they went to Nevada; to Tonopah, Nevada.  And Hugh, it seems, became interested in, I guess it was gold that was there that was being discovered, and Susie [Gregory Thomas' maternal grandmother, Susie James Hancock] became tired of it, I think, and went back to Texas with the children.  And Hugh stayed in Nevada, and I found a record of his death, and he died there.  And she went back to identify the body, but I don't believe that he was buried in Texas.  I really haven't found where he was buried yet.
Speaker 1: Now, when did--what did Susie do back in Texas?  Did she have to start working?
Speaker 2: Susie taught.  I don't know how she came by the training, but she taught for a while in a school that was called the DD and B school: deaf, dumb and blind.  She knew sign language.  And so, she did that for a number of years.  And also, with World War I [WWI], she became--she was hired by the YA--that's the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] or YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], to become a hostess for one of the--what would you call them--houses or places where the returning soldiers would come.
Speaker 1: The USO [United Service Organizations] or something?
Speaker 2: Similar to that.  That's not what it was called--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but, yes, it was similar to that.  So she was in that capacity for a while.  And then, after that was all over, eventually she moved to California and lived out there in the Los Angeles [California] area.  I remember my mother saying that she was somehow involved in real estate, but I can't tell you anything about that.  I had all these questions after there was no one around to ask them any longer.  So I don't exactly know what she did except that my mother mentioned real estate.  Also, she was very active in the Prairie View college alumni association [Prairie View A&M University National Alumni Association].  And someone told me that they considered her the mother of that branch out there.  I guess it was the Los Angeles branch of Prairie View [Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your grandmother actually went to--she attended Prairie View?
Speaker 2: She didn't attend Prairie View.  She was at Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio], but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --she did work at Prairie View.  She was--they called it matron of the girls.  She was in charge of the girls, the female students there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--now, did your mother accompany her mother and father on all these journeys and subsequently her mother?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, she did.  Yes, she did.  She was there.
Speaker 1: That's a lot of moving.
Speaker 2: It was.  That's why I said my father jokingly said that she was a gypsy (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  She really was everywhere.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Wonderful experiences, though.
Story_ID: 642133
Speaker 1: So did she--what, what did she say about that?  Were there any stories that she recount- you know, told you about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, she spoke to me of the desert in Nevada.  And my mother [Hugh Hancock Gregory] was an artist.  Not a professional artist, but she was a wonderful artist.  She painted, did lots of things.  And so, she painted some scenes from those days from her memory.
Speaker 1: Is there any--is that the place she liked the best?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know that she did.  I really don't know.  I think her fondest memories are really of Texas.  They did return to Texas, and I think that her fondest memories were there, and she had cousins there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so your mother had to change schools frequently.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I don't know very much about how that was handled really except, of course, she had to go to school.  But she never really discussed--like, she went to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] eventually for college, but I don't know what she did from grade school through high school.  I don't know where she was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother attended Fisk, and what did she major in at Fisk?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, because I don't know that they were that specific back then.  I think a lot of emphasis was placed on homemaking, you know, skills.  And I don't really know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: But she eventually took classes in education later on.  She didn't graduate because she met my father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] there.  He had just come to Fisk on business, so to speak, which I can tell you about in a little while, but while there, he met my mother.  And so, she didn't finish. I think it was in 1917 that they met or 1916; and then she left and they married in 1918.
Story_ID: 642134
Speaker 1: Well let's go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His first name was Thomas, T-H-O-M-A-S.  His middle name was Montgomery, M-O-N-T-G-O-M-E-R-Y.  And the last name was Gregory [Thomas Gregory, Sr.], G-R-E-G-O-R-Y
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His place of birth was Washington, D.C., and the date was August the--I think it the 31st--1887.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and where did they come from?
Speaker 2: Well, my father's maternal side is extremely interesting.  His mother, Fannie, was the daughter of--well, she grew up in Frederick, Maryland, first of all.  She was born in section of Frederick called Jerusalem; Jerusalem, Maryland, in 1856 on July 4th.  I remember that.  And she was born to Margaret Mahammitt [Margaret Mahammitt Hagan].  Mahammitt was Margaret's maiden name, and Margaret was married at that time to Whiting [Isaac Whiting].  I've forgotten Whiting's first name at this moment.  So she was Fannie Emma Whiting, but Margaret and Whiting did not stay together, and so Fannie's stepfather was George Hagan [George Washington Hagan], and so she became Fannie Emma Hagan [Fannie Hagan Gregory].  She grew up there in Frederick, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Now, before we go on, I want to talk about the name, because the name is significant.
Speaker 2: Mahammitt.
Speaker 1: It's spelled--how do you spell it?
Speaker 2: Interestingly, M-A-H-A, double M, I, double T.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Margaret Mahammitt was the daughter of a man [Jeremiah Mahammitt] who came to the United States from the island of Madagascar.  It was about 1820.  I have done a lot of extensive research on that family and that history, because my father used to speak of it often.  And we talked about it in the family.  It was oral history.  And so I set out to document it in the '70s [1970s].  And so, he came from Madagascar in 1820--in the 1820s, and he had come over, so the story goes, on an educational trip.  However, he was in Frederick, Maryland, and while there, he saw on the estate of Roger Brooke Taney [Roger B. Taney], who became the [U.S.] Supreme Court justice.
Speaker 1: The same one that--
Speaker 2: Dred Scott.
Speaker 1: --rendered the Dred Scott decision [Dred Scott v. Sandford, 1857]?
Speaker 2: Exactly, which is really interesting, seeing his lifestyle, but--at any rate, he lived at Frederick, and so Mahammitt saw this beautiful girl there, and he became infatuated with her.  And in the end, he decided he wanted to marry her.  And he came from a very prominent family in Madagascar, evidently, and his father was very unhappy when he found out that he planned to marry this person, and he considered that this woman, whose name--we said Jane [ph.], but also had found that she was called Serena--he felt that Mahammitt was marrying beneath him.  And he told him he did not want him to return to Madagascar.  That's our story, if he did, indeed, marry this woman, which he did.  Now--
Speaker 1: Now all of this must have taken a long time to transpire.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I guess.
Speaker 1: Because to get from Madagascar to--
Speaker 2: Yes, so--
Speaker 1: --you know, Virginia--
Speaker 2: --his journey.
Speaker 1: --is a long--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It could take some months--
Speaker 2: Indeed.
Speaker 1: --to make that trip.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Now--
Speaker 1: I want to also say, for anybody who's watching this, that--and if their eyebrows go up at the name Madagascar--we had at least three other interviews where people cite their ancestry in Madagascar--
Speaker 2: Ah, that's--
Speaker 1: --which is something I first heard about from Armstead Allen, who headed up the black studies department at Olive-Harvey College in Chicago [Illinois].  He has ancestry from Madagascar.  Since that time, I've heard three different people.
Speaker 2: Oh, my.  Am I the third or the fourth?
Speaker 1: The--maybe the fourth, I think, in our collection that have--they mentioned their ancestry--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --from Madagascar.  Most of them--I think all of them were either Arkansas or Louisiana.  They talk about that.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, my.  A lot of them, also, ended up in Virginia.  But they came over as slaves, mainly.  Mahammitt, we didn't know his first name.  My father wasn't certain of what his first name was.  He said he thought he remembered that it was Ali [ph.]; however, when I started researching the story, I was down in Frederick, Maryland, I saw that there was Jeremiah Mahammitt, which is really strange (laughter).  So perhaps he just became known as Jeremiah because that was a name that, there, was recognizable, doable, whatever--comfortable, so.  He was Jeremiah Mahammitt, evidently.
Story_ID: 642135
Speaker 1: So it's either Ali [ph.] or Jeremiah or maybe both (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, perhaps.
Speaker 1: Mahammitt--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: --and the name Mahammitt can be spelled so many different ways.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It's spelled in historical literature, with an O, with a U, with a, you know, the D at the end, a T, you know, so.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Well, you know, I used to question, Larry [Larry Crowe], why our story, our family oral history said that Mahammitt [Gregory Thomas' paternal great-great-grandfather, Jeremiah Mahammitt] came from a ruling family.  I was wondering, well, how on earth can they say that he came from a ruling family.  A ruling family?  And then, later on as an adult, when I learned more about Madagascar and met people from Madagascar, I found that there were several ruling families.  And so the fact that they described him as being from a ruling family was indeed significant.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So is that family still--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That far back, I haven't been able to go.
Speaker 1: With a name like Mahammitt, you would--it would be, you know, I mean it's a kind of Muslim name, so, you know, it would be harder to trace, I guess.
Speaker 2: Well, the thing is, I don't know precisely what part of the island he came from.  I'm not certain if he came from the capital area or from another area.  I'm not--really not very certain at this point.  One of my relatives, a niece, has thought that perhaps he came from a section called Mahajanga [Madagascar], I think, but that's not been determined as of yet.  Now, the people who lived up in the highlands in Madagascar, their names are different from Mahammitt.  It's like, one family I know is Rundriana Reveylo [ph.], you know.  So this Mahammitt name is certainly Muslim.  It sounds like it would be and may not be from the capital area, Antananarivo [Madagascar], but from another part of the island.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I've always been fascinated by the story and--
Speaker 1: Has there been any attempt by any members of your family or you to look into state department records of--
Speaker 2: Well, I even--
Speaker 1: I don't know how many old state department records exist [from the U.S. Department of State] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went through everything.  I went and spent time in the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] going through old records, the archives going through old records.  And for years, I couldn't find, and I practically lived in the archives, I couldn't find any record of a Mahammitt coming over to the United States in the 1800s.  There was no such person.  And this was in microfilm or microfiche records, which was all, you know, there was to look through.  And then one day as I was leaving the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, D.C.], I saw off to my left a room that had volumes, books, in it for passenger ships.  And I said, "Oh, my gosh.  Let me go in there."  And I saw a volume that was ships coming into the Port of Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland] in the 1800s, 1820.  So I pulled the one down that seemed like it would be appropriate, and guess what?  I did find a Mahammitt, but that spelling.  However, there was no Mahammitt prior to that years and years.  No Mahammitt after that at all.  So I said that must be our Mahammitt.
Speaker 1: Could be.  As we were saying the spelling could be any number of spellings.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Of course.  So there was this Mahammitt coming in to the Port of Baltimore.  And so it was right in that time frame, it was--I think it was 1820 or 1822, and so, it had come from Sumatra [Indonesia].  But I guess, you know, the ship could have done any, you know, number of circuits around and--before getting on its established route to the states.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is a unique ancestry.
Speaker 2: Oh, I tell you, I even called the embassy of Indonesia years ago, you know, because of the Sumatra connection, wanting to know if they had any records.  I spent quite a long time researching, collecting notes and information.  I started in, I think it was 1974, actually.  I believe that's when I--because my father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] and I had already spoke--always spoken of doing this together; going down to Frederick, Maryland, and doing the research.  But my father passed away before he was able to join me in that.
Story_ID: 642136
Speaker 1: You've written an article about Margaret Mahammitt [Gregory Thomas' paternal great-grandmother, Margaret Mahammitt Hagan].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And she did some special things, right?
Speaker 2: She was a fan- fascinating woman.  Quite a character.  My father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] stayed with her for a period of time--he--with her in her home in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, because she eventually left Frederick, Maryland.  And there's even a story about her departure.  She left at a time--I'd forgotten there were certain laws, black laws I didn't know in Virginia.  But evidently, she felt that it was wise to get out even though she was a free person--she was born free--and just decided that she should not remain there, and certainly she would have been stymied and not able to do what she ended up doing later on.  So she left Frederick, Maryland, on a train.  And it said that she hid underneath the skirts of some white ladies who were traveling so that she wouldn't be seen.  The threat, even for free blacks at that time, was such that she evidently felt if they saw her, they might try to claim that she was not a free person and make her remain there in that area, in Frederick.  That's all I know.  So she went to Pennsylvania, and she operated a laundry there.  But she also tried to enter a school there, I remember.  She wanted to get some training there, and she was turned down.  And so she demanded to have her money back.  She was a strong willed, feisty person.  And they--she insisted, because she had already paid, evidently, that they give her her money back, so they did.  She opened a laundry employing about forty people in Pennsylvania.  I think that was in Williamsport.  She eventually settled in Williamsport, but I know she spent some time in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And she also ended up in Washington, D.C.  Now, at that time, her grandson, my father, was in Washington, D.C.  Margaret was born in about 1825, do believe, okay.  So she came to Washington, D.C., and again, through research, I discovered that she opened a shop, downtown Washington on F Street, in which she said, "You must come and visit the--see the magic scale, the dressmaker's magic scale."  And she had a dressmaking business.  And also, while in Washington, she attended the school, and this is really fascinating, of a Dr. Hosford [ph.] in medical electricity.
Story_ID: 642137
Speaker 1: Medical electricity (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Medical electricity.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I was always unsure whether it was electrical medicine or medical electricity.  I think it's medical electricity.  But she went to--she attended Dr. Hosford's [ph.] sanitarium in Washington, D.C.  I found a record of that and of the fact that it did, indeed, exist.  And she returned to Pennsylvania to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and she established herself there as a practitioner of medical electricity, and she had all kinds of clients coming to her, patients; lumbermen and railroad people, and all the big persons, important people in the area would come to her for treatment.  And people have asked me was it like an electric shock, and I said, "I don't think so."  I really got a book on it.  I ordered one I read about online some years ago, and it did describe medical electricity.  It wasn't electrical shocks.  I really can't remember, now, I'm sorry, exactly how it was done.
Speaker 2: Was it vibrations or?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 2: Magnetism?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's a story too about one time--well, she was accustomed to having her patients when they were ready to go outside, and a white flag or some flag would be positioned outside of her place of business.  And the streetcar would always stop and allow her patient to get on.  Well, suddenly this stopped.  The streetcar company was not having the cars stop for her patients, and she was enraged.  And she--one of her patients or clients was the man who owned the streetcar company.  So I was told by my father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] that the next time he came in to her for treatment, she had him in a hot container that was very hot, and I don't remember whether there was water in there or not, but it was very hot, and that she asked him why he had stopped allowing the drivers to stop for her patients.  And she kept turning it up, turning it up, and turning it up until he agreed to have it happen again; agreed to let her patients board in a special way, that they would continue to put the flag--they would continue to honor the flags.
Speaker 2: What a story.
Speaker 1: She was like that.  Oh, she was quite interesting.
Speaker 2: Now, you published her story in--what magazine what was that?
Speaker 1: This was for the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History [Association for the Study of African American Life and History] during a Black History Month, and I was approached by a Ms. Miles [Willie Leanna Miles], who used to be with the association, and asked if I would please contribute a story to a magazine that was going to be part of their black history package for the month, and so I wrote about Margaret [Gregory Thomas' paternal great-grandmother, Margaret Mahammitt Hagan] at that time; and it was published there by them.  The Associated Publishers [Associated Publishers, Inc.] was the name of their company.
Story_ID: 642138
Speaker 1: So this is your father's grandmother, Margaret Mahammitt Hagan (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His grandmother.
Speaker 1: What about his father?
Speaker 2: We called her Grandma Hagan. His father was James Monroe Gregory, and he was originally from Lexington, Virginia.  He was born in 1849 in Lexington.  His father, according to what I've been able to find out, was Henry Gregory, and he was a free person.  I believe--I was told that he was a minister, that he was a preacher, a minister in Lexington, Virginia.  That was his--James Monroe Gregory's father.  His mother was Maria Gladman, who was from a free family in Lynchburg, Virginia.  Well, actually, let me go back a bit, because we always assumed, at least most of us did, that Henry Gregory was James Monroe Gregory's biological father, but he wasn't.  I found out, at some point, that that wasn't our name after all. I remember one of my cousins, Laverne [ph.], saying, "Well, you know, Gregory wasn't our real name."  But, at that time, I wasn't immersed in this family history, and I didn't ask about it more and discover anything else.  But then my cousin Fred Gregory [HistoryMaker Colonel Frederick Drew Gregory] and his wife Barbara [Barbara Archer Gregory] and I decided to make a trip down into Virginia.  We went to Lynchburg, and we found out there that Maria Gladman had been married to a William Lewis, and that William Lewis and Maria Gladman were the parents of James Monroe and Claiborne [Claiborne Gregory], two sons.  So that obviously when Maria married Henry Gregory, then the children were given his last name.  Maria Gladman and Henry Gregory left Virginia with their two sons, James and Claiborne for Ohio, and they settled in the Cleveland [Ohio] area.  Now, from my research I discovered that Henry and Maria didn't stay together, and she married again, a Waller [ph.], okay.  And Henry ended up in, I think, Evanston [Illinois] or Chicago [Illinois]; that area, but Illinois at any rate, and he remarried.  But James Monroe Gregory was evidently an extraordinarily bright young man, and he was in the--went through the Cleveland, Ohio public schools.  But evidently he experienced racism there, and I think that one time he, it is said, I believe my father said that he threatened to bring a gun to school or something (unclear) if he had to defend himself.  But he went on to Oberlin, and he was quite a speaker, quite an orator while he was a student.  And he entered Oberlin--he was, I believe, Oberlin preparatory school [Preparatory Department of Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], and he was about to, and in fact, did enroll in Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio] when he was contacted by Howard University [Washington, D.C.], which was newly established.  And General Oliver Otis Howard had heard about him and wanted him to come to the university to Washington, D.C., to be in its first graduating class.  And so he accepted that offer, and he did come to Washington, D.C.; and he actually became the very first student in what was called the collegiate department at that time.
Story_ID: 642139
Speaker 1: But he was an outstanding speaker, an outstanding orator.  He, after graduation from Howard University [Washington, D.C.] in 1872, because he got there, I guess, in 1868, there were two other students with him in that graduating class who came to Howard after he did, and the three of them, three men, graduated together.  He was the valedictorian for the class of three.  He stayed on as an instructor there, and he was a professor of the classics, I think of Latin as well.  I'm trying to remember what else.  But while he was dean, as well, he served in several capacities evidently.  He married--he met his wife Fannie [Gregory Thomas' paternal grandmother, Fannie Hagan Gregory], and I talked about Fannie's background.  She's the one with the Madagascar background.  He met Fannie because she was a student in one of his classes, and ended up marrying her.  And at that time, she had been--had come from Williamsport, Pennsylvania, because as I said, Margaret Mahammitt Hagan, Whiting Hagan, moved to Williamsport, and so Fannie came to Howard University from there.  There were not, as I understand it, very many young women who were being educated like that in those days.  But Margaret had her daughter come there to Howard to be educated, and that's where she and James Monroe Gregory met, and they married.  He--
Speaker 2: What year did they get married in, do you know?
Speaker 1: Let me see if I can remember what year they married.  I'm blocking on that right now.  I can't remember.
Speaker 2: Was it in 18-what?  In 18--that would be, yeah, this is your--
Speaker 1: My grandfather--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who was born in 1849.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I am blocked on that.  I can't remember the date that they got married.  Aye, goodness.
Speaker 2: Anyway (unclear)--
Speaker 1: But it had to be in the 1870s.  It had to be in the 1870s, I would think, at any rate.
Speaker 2: She graduates in 1872, so--
Speaker 1: He did, yes, in 1872 and started as an instructor there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: At that time.  He organized an organization.  He founded an organization for teachers of colored youth [American Association of Educators of Colored Youth].  I can't remember if that was precisely the name of it.  But he did.  He also was a protege in a sense of Frederick Douglass.  And there's a very interesting story there.  He wrote a biography of the life of Frederick Douglass, and in it I found, and no one else in my family had known before, but I had a copy of the book, and I read it, and I called my father's [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] attention to it.  I said, "Daddy, look."  I said, "It says that your father first met Frederick Douglass in New Bedford, Massachusetts, when he was thirteen years old," when James Monroe Gregory was thirteen years old.  So how he happened to be in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and how he happened to be in the home of Frederick Douglass there, I do not know.  But from that time on, he was--Frederick Douglass was his mentor.  He appeared in some of the programs and lectures--or programs, really; conferences where Frederick Douglass was a speaker.  He sometimes was, I'd guess you'd say, an advanced man for him, and sometimes he was a speaker himself.
Speaker 2: You know, you know what I'm going to ask next is, was he at the cotton exposition in 1895 [1895 Cotton States and International Exposition]?
Speaker 1: I don't know that.  I don't know that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, just--
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, no, he might not have been there either.  That's true.
Speaker 1: He also ran for office in Washington, D.C. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) or World's Fair?
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: Was he at the World's Fair?
Speaker 1: I never heard that he was.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 642140
Speaker 1: He also ran for office in Washington, D.C., but I think it was Blanche K. Bruce who got the office, who won that appointment or that election.  And he also protested about discrimination in the schools--public schools in Washington because colored students were not allowed to go to certain schools because they were.  And he protested that.  I think he brought a suit against the schools.  He and Fannie [Fannie Hagan Gregory] had three sons and one daughter.  My father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] was the youngest of the four of them by ten years.  As my mother [Hugh Hancock Gregory] was the youngest by ten years of her siblings, my father was the youngest of ten years by his.  His eldest brother was Eugene [Eugene Gregory]--his eldest sibling was Eugene, and then there was Frank, whose name was actually James Francis [James Francis Gregory], and then there was Margaret [Margaret Gregory Hawkins], who was named after her grandmother, Margaret [Margaret Mahammitt Hagan], and all lived in Washington, D.C., on the campus at Howard University.  In fact, they lived where, I believed, the Ira Aldridge Theater now exists; it's on that site.  But the family left Howard University.  James Monroe Gregory, family left, and moved to New Jersey where my grandfather had been offered the position as the head of the Bordentown School, the Bordentown industrial and manual training institute [Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth].  Was it that?  The Bordentown industrial and manual--and manual and industrial training institute or school in Bordentown, New Jersey.  So that whole family moved there.  And when they got there, when he took the position, it seems that the school was in rather shoddy condition and disrepair, and he managed to get the backing of a woman whose last name was Parnell [Delia Tudor Parnell] and whose father [sic. husband, Charles Stewart] had been an admiral, and who gave land to the school because of his interaction with her.  And so Bordentown had wonderful new buildings then right on a river--I've forgotten where, but close to a river--and my father said it was a wonderful place to grow up because he was still very young at that time when they moved there.  And all the family participated in the school.  Fannie was in charge of the females there, the women students.  And one of my uncles, one of my father's brothers, was a teacher there for a while.  And so they all pitched in.  They worked on the grounds.  They did everything to improve the school.  It was compared to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], though it didn't quite reach that pinnacle, but it was compared to Tuskegee at one time.  My father left there to enroll in Williston Seminary [Williston Northampton School] up in Massachusetts [Easthampton, Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 642141
Speaker 1: So this is about--your father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] is ready for the seminary.  This is--he was born in 1896 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, well let's see, about 1902 or '3 [1903]?  Right around that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is Williston--
Speaker 2: Williston Seminary [Williston Northampton School, Easthampton, Massachusetts] it was called.
Speaker 1: Williston Seminary.
Speaker 2: A private school.  Boarding school.  I think it was in Northampton, Massachusetts [sic.], I think.  I don't know, but it was in Massachusetts.  And my father was an incredible young man.  Now, when he was there, he had to be--I think he was the only student of color, at least, you know, of African descent there.  I believe that I heard him say that there was a student there from Mexico.  But he became the editor of the school newspaper.  He was active in sports.  He also was a star or the star of their debating team.  When I was researching my father's life to find out what I didn't know, to see what I might not have known about him, I called Williston and I talked to the archivist, and I mentioned to him that I knew that my father had been member--a member of a club or fraternity.  And he said that, "Oh, no.  That couldn't have been possible.  They didn't allow them there."  But he found out that they did.  And I gave him the name of the group that my father belonged to, and as it turned out, my father and some other students there who were not admitted, not accepted as members of these other one or two fraternities, formed their own.  So he made it happen, no matter what.  He made it happen.  He did it.  He did it because he felt that he had a right to do whatever.  So he graduated from Williston with quite an exemplary record and was accepted into Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Now, was he intent on studying theology?
Speaker 2: No.  Not at all.  They just called it that at that time.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Oh, that was just the name--the name of the school was the Williston Seminary.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But it wasn't a theological school?
Speaker 2: No.  Not at all.  It was not.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Thank you for asking.  So he entered Harvard in the class of 1910.  And that was a class that had in it T.S. Eliot, John Reed--
Speaker 1: Of 'Reds' fame?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: The colleges, yeah.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: T.S. Eliot the poet.
Speaker 2: Walter Lippmann.
Speaker 1: Walter Lippmann?  Really?
Speaker 2: Who else?  I am trying to remember--quite a number of people who became extremely well known.
Speaker 1: So it was quite a history so far.  We haven't even--and we're just scratching the surface now.  That was in the 20th century (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right (laughter).
Speaker 1: And so--so at Harvard now, he's graduate school at Harvard, is that true?
Speaker 2: No, no.  That was--'cause Williston was like high school.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And so then Harvard as a freshman.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And at Harvard, he was active in sports also, and he also became a member of the debating team.  And, in fact, at one point he was president of the debating team.  I remember my father telling me that he tutored Walter Lippmann in something.  I forgot what it was.  And he was a member of what was called, I think, the triangular debate.  That was it.  The triangular debate first time ever between Harvard, Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], and Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  He was on that team.
Speaker 1: Who won that debate?
Speaker 2: I don't remember (laughter). I don't remember who won it.  Just that it was a very historical moment.  And he was part of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Needless to say, I suppose he was the only African American (unclear)--
Speaker 2: There at that time?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, of the department.
Speaker 2: He may have been.  I don't know if he was all the way--Du Bois had been there before him.
Speaker 1: Right.  And then Woodson [Carter G. Woodson] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In fact, Du Bois, I think, was from the same class, I forgotten mention, when my Uncle Gene [Eugene Gregory]--because my father's eldest sibling Eugene graduated from Harvard before--you know, he was much older than my father, and he graduated from Harvard in the 1890s.  I've forgotten exactly what date, but he was in the class of W.E.B. Du Bois, I think.  At least they were there at the same time and they were friends.  But with my father, I don't recall that there was anyone there at that same time.  I'm not certain.  I don't think so, but I don't want to say there was not.  I just don't think so.
Speaker 1: Nineteen ten [1910].  Okay.  'Cause I know Hansberry also attended Harvard.
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was after my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  William Leo Hansberry.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And they knew each other.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, Hansberry's daughter, Gail [HistoryMaker Gail A. Hansberry], is one of my best friends.
Story_ID: 642142
Speaker 1: So your father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] like--he's on the deba- so he graduates, and--were there any stories about Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] that he shared with you, or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, do you know, my father never complained, Larry [Larry Crowe].  I never heard him complain ever about anything that took place at Williston [Williston Seminary, Easthampton, Massachusetts]--or maybe it was Williston Academy [Williston Northampton School] or Williston Academy, Williston Seminary--but he never complained of anything at Williston, and yet obviously, he experienced prejudice there, you know, just given the fact that he couldn't become a member of the established fraternities that, underground though they may have been, they existed.  And then at Harvard, I never heard him ever, ever say anything.  He never complained about any discrimination at all, any prejudice, any racism, I never ever heard it.  And yet there had to have been some.  He had to have experienced it.
Speaker 1: That's true. That's true.
Speaker 2: He had to.  Now, I found out through reading back through his letters and through papers when I was preparing the biography of my father for the 'African American National Biography' project, I found he had always wanted to work in the [U.S.] Foreign Service, to work for the state department [U.S. Department of State].  I didn't know that.  I know that--well, I won't say that yet--but I didn't know that.  And he really felt that he was going to get a position within the state department to go overseas, I believe, because that was indicated by these letters, this correspondence between him and others.  And he evidently had the support of some very influential people.  But this never did come to pass.  And later on in his life, there was something that happened that, looking back after I read--(pause) spare the heart.  But after I researched, I saw how much that meant to him, and I hadn't ever known it at all.  But he went on to graduate school at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], and then he was offered a position at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And so, like his father [James Monroe Gregory], he became a member of the faculty at Howard University.  He had been born there.  He was born on Howard's campus.  And so he became a teacher of English and drama.
Speaker 1: So when did he start at Howard?  Was he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) About 1912, I think.
Speaker 1: Nineteen twelve [1912].
Speaker 2: About 1912.
Speaker 1: And he had a--was it a master's from Columbia and a--?
Speaker 2: I don't think he actually got his master's.  He did graduate work there, but I don't think he did get a master's degree.  So at Howard, he was like he always was.  He was very proactive, very engaged in things and innovative, and he founded the Howard Players [Howard University Players].  There was already a dramatic group there, but in the English department, I think, but he founded the actual play group, the Howard Players there.  I think it was in 1917, not sure the date.  And he had been, when he was at Harvard, a member, a student in the class of Professor Baker [George Pierce Baker] who had insisted that the students write things out of their--plays out of their own lives.  And so when my father was a teacher at Howard, a professor of English there, and the head of the Howard Players, one thing that he had his students do was to develop plays from their own lives that told stories that were unique and different, and not just the scripts that had been written by white people.
Story_ID: 642143
Speaker 1: This is something that people would talk about a lot during the Garvey [Marcus Garvey] movement.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they would also discuss this, of course, during the Black Arts Movement days of the '60s [1960s], you know, the need to do our own work.  And it's--because I know even the early black theatres in Chicago [Illinois], Richard B. Harrison plays (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --they're doing William Inge plays, and they were like, you know--
Speaker 2: What about Karamu playhouse [Karamu House] in Cleveland [Ohio]?  Did that--they do the same thing there, I wonder?  Because that was a black theater group in Ohio.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think they actually in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] were doing plays written by white playwrights.
Speaker 2: Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Well, at any rate, that was something he [Gregory Thomas' father, Thomas Gregory, Sr.] felt very strongly about, and he instituted that there at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  He also started the debating team, debating society or the debating club there.  So the Howard Players [Howard University Players], the debating club, and he and Alain Locke--Alain Locke was a friend of his who was a professor at Howard at that time, philosophy.  He and Alain Locke collaborated on a number of things, and one of them was to begin a magazine for students so that students' work could be published in it.  It was called, The Stylus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I remember those three things in particular.  The Howard Players, the debating team and The Stylus.
Story_ID: 642144
Speaker 1: I said the debating team, the Howard Players [Howard University Players] and The Stylus (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, The Stylus. The Stylus, right.
Speaker 1: But I would like to say something more about the Howard Players.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: All right.  Howard Players.  And you just talked about The Stylus, the magazine that was founded.
Speaker 1: Yes.  He and Alain Locke started The Stylus.  One thing about the Howard Players is that they really moved outside of the university sometimes for their performances.  And my father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.], at a certain point, contacted Eugene O'Neill, the playwright in New York [New York], who had a play on Broadway of 'The Emperor Jones,' starring Charles Gilpin, a black actor.  And my father got Eugene O'Neill to agree to let Charles Gilpin come to Washington, D.C., and perform his role as the Emperor Jones with the Howard Players.  And that was an enormous coup.  It was just amazing that he was able to pull that off, but he did.  And as I heard--heard it told, it was the first time in Washington, D.C., that there was integrated seating for a performance.  It was held at what was then the Belasco Theater, right off of Lafayette park [Lafayette Square] in Washington, D.C., in the vicinity of the White House.  And I have a program from that performance.
Speaker 2: And this would. Now this is historical in a lot of different ways, because, you know; one, the features of Washington, D.C., that's often discussed in black history is the close proximity of the black population of D.C., you know, living in various levels of--all around the White House.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: Back in the days.
Speaker 1: I went to a White House conference about two years ago on blacks who--in the vicinity of the White House, and it was really very interesting and very informative.  There was so much going on.
Speaker 2: Right.  And so this is the first--now, what years is this you're saying?
Speaker 1: It had to be, again, here we go--he got there in 18--I mean, that's my father.  I'm thinking of his father [James Monroe Gregory].
Speaker 2: That's 19--
Speaker 1: My father (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) nineteen twelve [1912] or so, you say?
Speaker 1: It would have been after 1917.  Probably about 1920, maybe; 1918, 1920; in that--right in that time frame.
Speaker 2: Well, this is an era where Hart--the president was Woodrow--the end of Woodrow Wilson [President Thomas Woodrow Wilson], I guess, or--I know 1919 is when Wilson invited the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] to march down on Pennsylvania Avenue.
Speaker 1: Ay yai yai, really?  Invited them?  Good grief.
Speaker 2: They were in the White House.  They showed 'Birth of a Nation' ['The Birth of a Nation'] and--
Speaker 1: Oh, my god.
Speaker 2: --to the [U.S.] Supreme Court and the [U.S.] Congress.
Speaker 1: That is something.  Now, I never heard of that.  That's--
Speaker 2: And he said it's like writing history with lightning.  And he was a history professor.
Speaker 1: Yes.  That's right.  From Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] or Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey].  Princeton.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Princeton.
Speaker 1: Oh, my goodness.
Speaker 2: So this is the type of atmosphere we're talking about, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so when your father invites Charles Gilpin in--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --in this same era--
Speaker 1: 'The Emperor Jones,' yeah.
Speaker 2: --this is quite a coup.
Speaker 1: Yes, it was.  That I know.  And then, also, I have an article that was written about another play that he put--the Howard Players with my father--put on in Washington in another place, and it seems like--I think it was the secretary of the treasury who was headed for it, that was going to see that particular performance, and it was written up in the newspaper.  So he, he was--so, my father was like his father, extremely active person in many respects.
Story_ID: 642145
Speaker 1: Now, when did your--is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Yes, there is a story about how they met.  My father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] took a debating team to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And while he was there, I think it was when he was seated in the cafeteria with some other people, and he looked up and he said he saw this beautiful young woman stride into the cafeteria with her head up and her eyes blazing (laughter), and he said, "Who is that?"  And they said, "Oh, that's Hugh Hancock [Hugh Hancock Gregory] from Texas."  And that's how they met.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's dramatic enough (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).  My mother had just been disciplined for something and that's why she was looking the way that she looked with her eyes blazing and her head up (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Reprimanded, maybe, would be the better term.
Speaker 1: So that's how they met, and then they stayed--
Speaker 2: In touch.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They, they corresponded, yes, from that time on.  And then my father, another involvement of his in which he was very instrumental was establishment of the black officers training camp [Fort Des Moines Provisional Army Officer Training School] in Fort Des Moines, Iowa.  And that, I think, was in 1917.  Hope I'm right announcing these dates, but so many to try to remember.  But, he married my mother and 1918 in Baltimore [Maryland] at the home of his sister, Margaret; Margaret Gregory Hawkins.  She, at that time, was married to Mason Hawkins, and they lived in Baltimore.  And so my mother left Texas.  I guess she would--going back to Texas to prepare for the marriage, the wedding, and then she went to Baltimore to be married.  And they were married in my father's sister's home.
Speaker 1: Now this is in 19--?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighteen [1918].
Speaker 1: Married in 1918.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1918, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I think it was in May.  I think it was in May of 1918.
Story_ID: 642146
Speaker 1: Well, let, let me just stop and ask you a question (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, yes.
Speaker 1: --about, because we went by this so fast, and it's too important.  The black officers training camp [Fort Des Moines Provisional Army Officer Training School, Fort Des Moines, Iowa].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There hadn't been one.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  This is during World War I [WWI].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, at the time, highest ranking officer, and they wouldn't let him serve in the war with Colonel Charles Young--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I remember.
Speaker 1: --of Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And they had articles in the paper either in 1917 about him riding his horse to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], demonstrating the stuff there.
Speaker 2: I vaguely remember, yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: But, so, tell us.  Do you know any more information about the black officers training camp?
Speaker 2: A little bit.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know that there were--a group of black men got together, my father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] was one of the leaders of this group, to petition the war department [U.S. Department of War], as it was called then, to make some situation available for blacks to train as officers.  And there wasn't any such situation at that time.  And so they were successful in that effort.  And so, Fort Des Moines, Iowa was the place--that was the site that was allowed--was allocated.  Fort Des Moines--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Iowa.
Speaker 1: This is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that was where the black officers training camp was established.
Speaker 1: I just wondered--now that's an interesting topic for somebody to research, 'cause I have never heard of that.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I spoke about that.  There was a conference that, actually, the National Park Service held a few years ago in Tuskegee [Alabama].  And I heard about it, and I heard that it was about blacks in--was it the World War I?  I've forgotten what the overall theme was, but I said, "Ah, I must call them because they probably don't know about this black officers."  And they did not.  And so, I was one of the speakers there, and the topic was the black officers training camp at Fort Des Moines, Iowa.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay. So that's something that, you know, 'cause we've been interviewing black military officers, four star generals, three star generals, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And they weren't familiar--didn't happen to mention it, may not have known anything about it.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  They might.
Speaker 2: Maybe.
Speaker 1: They haven't mentioned it yet.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And we've interviewed several West Point grads, people who became officers through West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York], and those who became officers coming up through the ranks, you know, through--most of them became officers during, of course, you know, they are too young to have been in World War I, but they--
Speaker 2: Well, my father left Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] for a period of time to go out there.
Speaker 1: And so he was involved in a lot of things (laughter).
Speaker 2: He was.  He was indeed.  He really was.  It's incredible looking back to see how much he did do.
Story_ID: 642147
Speaker 1: So they get married in 1918.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you're not born until twenty years later.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Now this is--so they were older, an older couple (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  They were.
Speaker 1: --when you were born.
Speaker 2: I had five older siblings.  And when I was born, my sister Yvonne [Yvonne Gregory] was--she was at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], and I think she was--she was nineteen or twenty years old.  And the one at home, who was closest to my age, was eleven years older than myself, my sister Mignon [Mignon Gregory Wilson].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we always ask this question; when you consider your parents' personalities, their sense of humor, their dispositions, how they walk, how they talk, what they look like even, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My mother [Hugh Hancock Gregory].  I do take after my mother in the way I look, I'm told; in my mannerisms.  In certain photographs I look a lot like my mother.  Sometimes, I've looked at the mirror and said, "Oops, it's my mother" (laughter), you know.  So, I, but yet I have had people say to me, "Oh, you look just like a Gregory," which is my father's [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] family.  So I'm really a mix of both, but I think much more like my mother.
Story_ID: 642148
Speaker 1: Can you name your siblings, starting with the eldest--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) and just tell a little bit about them, what they're doing now, and?
Speaker 2: Certainly.  All right.  My eldest sibling, Yvonne was Yvonne Gregory.  My mother [Hugh Hancock Gregory] did not give her daughters middle names.  She said that there was no point in it because when we got married, we would just use our maiden name, Gregory, as a middle name.  So that's the way it's been, except that I really was feeling a little left out of things going through to school and everyone had a middle name but me, so I started making them up (laughter).  But really, Yvonne; and then after Yvonne there was Thomas Montgomery Gregory, Jr. [Thomas Gregory, Jr.], and after--we called--in the family, we called him Brother.  After him--Yvonne, Brother, then Hugh; Hugh Hancock Gregory [Hugh Gregory].  His middle name was my mother's maiden name.  And then there was Eugene Chandler Gregory [Eugene Gregory].  And--
Speaker 1: Are there historical reference to his--for his name, too?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  Not that I know of.  I think Chandler may have been the name of one of my mother's classmates when she was at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And then, but I'm not certain.  And then my sister Mignon [Mignon Gregory Wilson], M-I-G-N-O-N, and then I came eleven years after that, after Mignon.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My sister Yvonne was a very gifted student, very gifted child, and very precocious.  And she was awarded a scholarship to Northfield [Northfield School for Girls; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts], which was a boarding school and for her poetry, her writing, which was amazing for her age, the poems that she wrote then as a child, a young girl.
Story_ID: 642149
Speaker 1: So I know how often this happens, which is not very often, that we get an African American student at Northfield [Northfield School for Girls; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So was she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And back in those days--
Speaker 1: Was she the first?
Speaker 2: She was the first and she was born in 1919.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so she spent her high school years there at Northfield.
Speaker 1: What stories did she tell of those experiences?
Speaker 2: I don't remember hearing any stories at all.  I knew that she had a couple of very dear friends from that period, but I don't remember her telling any stories about it.  Yvonne became a journalist, writer, I know, for the Afro-American Newspapers, the one in Philadelphia [Philadelphia Afro-American].  I remember she wrote for the Afro-American newspaper in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  She covered some stories in the South of lynchings and other things for them, other such monstrous stories.  She wrote for Paul Robeson's newspaper, Freedom, in New York [New York]; was there for some time.  I remember that when I was a little girl, she took me to a rally, I think it was, that was being held for Paul Robeson in New York City.  She, let's see, for Freedom, for the Afro-American newspaper, Yvonne [Gregory Thomas' sister, Yvonne Gregory] eventually began to suffer from a mental illness, and so she wasn't able to really just embrace and to further move on with her talents.  She, afterwards, at a certain point, really, it was just like intermittent times, because like many people, she wouldn't take the medication she was prescribed; thought she didn't need it and thought she was smarter than the doctors and all of that.  I spent a lot of time with her.  She was, I guess, the one I was closest to for a long time, because she lived in New York and I was in Atlantic City [New Jersey], and so she often had me come there to visit.  And so when she was well, and it was wonderful, really, and she introduced me to many things, little things just like pizza.  And also going into a market, I can remember there was sawdust on the floor and sending me around the corner from her apartment building to a little store to get something for her, and she told me, "Now, don't worry when you go in there.  They're going to be speaking Spanish, but don't worry about it.  They understand English."  I remember when I walked in there, I blocked everything.  I couldn't think in English, I didn't know Spanish, and I was for a moment just speechless, dumb.  And then, suddenly, I came to myself and I spoke in English.  But for a moment there, I felt that I should be able to communicate with them in that language.  I was about eight years old.  And so I think that experience resonated with me for a long, long time.  I also sometimes have people there in her neighborhood stop and ask me questions in Spanish, and I didn't know how to respond.  Later on, you know, I learned Spanish.  But that was one thing I remember of--about--when--remember from visiting her.  She also took me one summer when she had a, what was it, a Rosenwald fellowship to write, and we went out to Montauk, Long Island [New York] and she had a tent out there, a large tent.  And I stayed with her for about two weeks, and it was just delightful.  It was wonderful being right there on the beach, near the beach.  I was so accustomed to that from Atlantic City.  I always loved the beach.  And right across the road from us were friends of hers, John [John A. Lomax, Jr.] and Alan Lomax's families.  They were collectors of songs of black people and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The great collector of these songs--
Speaker 2: Yes, work songs--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) legendary now.
Speaker 2: --prison songs.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Alan Lomax.
Speaker 2: Yes.  They were very close friends of hers.  And so I remember them.  And so that was a wonderful period, that summer, those two weeks there.  We used to go for walks, long walks on the beach, Yvonne and I.
Story_ID: 642150
Speaker 1: Did she have a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She graduated--well, she didn't graduate from Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  She attended Fisk, but then she found it very difficult to adhere to the rigid rules and regulations, which were true of most black schools [HBCUs], I believe.  Howard University [Washington, D.C.], when I started Howard was like that, too.  You couldn't go to certain areas, you had to be back by a certain time, and we were restricted as well for our protection.  But Yvonne [Gregory Thomas' sister, Yvonne Gregory] found that very hard to take.  She was very free willing personality.  So she went on to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and she finished there.  And then she went to New York University [New York, New York], NYU, for graduate work afterwards.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she stayed in New York from that time on.  She lived in New York.  But at any rate, the time that we spent up at Montauk Point [Montauk Point State Park, Montauk, New York], the time that I was there with her, I really loved it, and--
Speaker 1: How do you spell Montauk Point?
Speaker 2: M-O-N-T-A-U-K.  That's way out at the tip of Long Island [New York].  Very rough surf.  I can remember going in the water one day with my little two piece bathing suit and almost losing the bottom when a big wave came and knocked me over (laughter).  As I said, I was about eight years old at that time.  But, intermittently, I spent a lot of time with her out there.  And--
Speaker 1: Now she was old- she was--the age difference was such that she could have been, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother.
Speaker 1: --a lot of people have mothers that are younger.
Speaker 2: I could have been her child.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And since she didn't have children, I think I was like that to her.  And she said to me, you know, "I'm the beginning, and you are the end."
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And--okay.  So, now what about Thomas [Thomas Gregory, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: My brother, Brother, Brother, he, after finishing Atlantic City High School [Atlantic City, New Jersey], he went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and entered Harvard and graduated from Harvard.  Now, I never heard him complain about anything either.  But, I'm pretty certain, I think he was there in the--well, it would have been the early '40s [1940s].  He was born in 1921.  But he graduated from Harvard, and his area was chemistry.  And he went on to teach at Meharry College [Meharry Medical College] in Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he left there.  He really wanted, and I think was more inclined towards research.  And so years later he moved to Washington [D.C.] and went to work for the National Institutes of Health.  But National Institute of something, NIST; NIST [National Institute of Standards and Technology].  NI- National Institute of something in technology within the National Institutes of Health.  And he was able there to do research.  It was in the field of chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that was my brother, Montgomery.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And next was Hugh [Hugh Gregory].  And Hugh was, maybe the, probably the most interesting in many ways of my siblings, because he had a very, very strong personality, and he was a raconteur.  I mean, he could tell tales, stories, make things come alive.  He could write so beautifully also but so, like my mother [Hugh Hancock Gregory] said, all of her children could write.  But he did.  He just had a way of making you see things as though you were there.  He had a very strong personality.  And he graduated from University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] actually.  He lived in Chicago [Illinois] for a number of years.  And I think he went to Howard first, though.  He went to Howard for maybe one year and then out to Chicago.  And his major was archeology, actually.  Pretty certain.  But, of course, he never worked in that field, in that area.  He did a lot of work for corporations such as Lever Brothers [Lever Brothers Company], I remember, and--
Speaker 1: As a writer?
Speaker 2: No.  In marketing and advertising.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Writing, yes, 'cause he really was very, very excellent at writing.  Marketing and advertising.  And I just know that he found it very difficult, because at that time there were hardly any blacks in those fields, in those companies, and I don't think he was always very warmly welcomed and that the degree of disrespect he found sometimes was a little bit much for him, and he wasn't a person to take things lightly.  I can remember him telling me one time about some little man, he said, who insisted on trying to make trouble to him and how he followed up every interaction they had, my brother did, with a memo over and over again until he said the man became so scared, so frightened that he had an accident (laughter), because my brother had a way of putting things, as I said a very sharp mind, very keen, very perceptive, very articulate, and beautiful writer; and very, very--and had a lot of self-esteem, and sure of himself.
Story_ID: 642151
Speaker 1: So he worked for Lever Brothers [Lever Brothers Company] out in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No.  New York.
Speaker 1: In New York?  Okay, New York.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) By that time he was in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Lever Brothers and a couple of other companies.  There was a company that produced or manufactured detergent--I can't remember what that one was.  All.  I think it must have been All- that company, whatever it was.  And also for a company that had--Guinness stout.  Guinness beer.  Yeah, right.  But always in the area of marketing.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what about--
Speaker 2: Eugene [Eugene Gregory]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Eugene went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], and he was there, I think, for about two years and then he got married, and he--I think, worked in the government where he learned computer programming.  And he became quite adept at that very quickly.  And so he worked as a computer programmer up in New York for some time.  Like my brother Hugh [Hugh Gregory], he found it very trying, to put it mildly, because of the people he had to interact with and who were not really very warm, to put it mildly, to him.  And I know he described one time how he always said good morning to everyone, and usually he had people respond to him in turn, "Good morning," and he--one morning, it was a particularly beautiful day, a beautiful morning, the sun was shining and he was feeling good, and he walking down the hall and along came this little man he said never said anything.  And my brother said, "Good morning," and he, the little man, didn't respond, and my brother, who was about 6'1", very handsome (laughter), walked over, and, he said, picked him up by his collar and said, "You little SOB, what is the matter with you?"  (Laughter) Oh, my--I tell you.  So we--and my family had all kinds of stories.  Those are two of them.  My brother Hugh and my brother Gene.  Both of them were living in New York at that time.
Speaker 1: Now, what about Mignon [Mignon Gregory Wilson]?
Speaker 2: Mignon, she eloped when, I think, she was eighteen years old.  So she didn't really get an opportunity to work on her own or to--she didn't go to school, to college.  She could have gone later on, but she didn't.  She married and lived in Washington [D.C.] after that on Howard University's campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was a loving and delightful and intelligent, beautiful person.  She had a lot of creativity and a lot to give, and she could have excelled in school, but she just chose not to move on with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So her--did her husband [Ernest Wilson, Jr.] work at Howard (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 642152
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?  Now this is--you're in Atlantic City [New Jersey], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory.  I don't know how it is, but I remember being held in my mother's [Hugh Hancock Gregory] arms, standing out in the yard and having her point out the flowers to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was still small enough, obviously, to be held.  And that's my earliest memory.
Story_ID: 642153
Speaker 1: So you were telling me off camera, but how did your father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] wind up in Atlantic City [New Jersey] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Atlantic City.  Well, my father had been trying while at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] to get a national Negro theatre company started.  A national Negro theatre company.  And he was getting a lot of press, a lot of note from off campus, from out of the area, from magazines and newspapers elsewhere exclaiming about this effort and how marvelous it was.  And I think that he wasn't getting quite enough support at the university.  And at that time, my father had four children, and he wasn't making a lot of money, obviously, at the school, and my mother [Hugh Hancock Gregory] wasn't working.  And so when he had an opportunity to move to New Jersey, his father [James Monroe Gregory] moved to Bordentown [New Jersey], my father accepted the position in Atlantic City as principal of a school, and which paid more money, more money than he was making at Howard University, and he just took it and left.  And I must think that it had to be enormously difficult for him because of all he had put in to Howard University with the teaching; he loved it, and with the drama department, the Howard Players [Howard University Players], with the debating, The Stylus. He left all of that behind and moved to Atlantic City, New Jersey.  And what a difference.  What an enormous difference, a tremendous difference there was there.  But he went on to charge ahead and forge ahead and became known, as his school was the best run school, and people loved him there, and--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: New Jersey Avenue School [Atlantic City, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this was--was this like an all-black school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: I figured he would be in those days, so New Jersey Avenue (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it was.  And he became very active in the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America].  He was an official over the Boy Scouts there.
Story_ID: 642154
Speaker 1: Now, Atlantic City [New Jersey], is there a black neighborhood in Atlantic City, or did you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There certainly was then, yeah.  There were a couple of sections that were black, but the Northside, where we lived, was a black community definitely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there were, well, one or two other areas, but that was, I think, the main area, the Northside.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We lived on North Ohio Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was saying off camera that everybody pictures a Monopoly board when we think of Atlantic City.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  And I went to Indiana Avenue School [Atlantic City, New Jersey].  My father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] would not have any of his children go to the school where he was principal [New Jersey Avenue School, Atlantic City, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: So was he--what was the population like in Indiana Avenue School?
Speaker 2: All black.  Yeah, it was still within the black neighborhood.
Speaker 1: About, well, can you kind of guess like what the percentage of African Americans, you know, was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lived there?
Speaker 1: --in Atlantic City in those days?
Speaker 2: I'm terrifically bad at that.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I'll tell you, when I went to junior high school, we were certainly in the minority.  And when I went to high school [Atlantic City High School, Atlantic City, New Jersey], we were certainly in the minority.  The junior high school I went to was integrated.  I went to elementary school up until sixth grade.  Seventh and eighth grade were in the--it was just Atlantic City Junior High School [Atlantic City, New Jersey], and--'cause it was the only one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was very, very integrated.  There were maybe two black teachers there, and one of them was my godmother.  I was in her homeroom as it turned out.
Story_ID: 642155
Speaker 1: And then for, for high school you went to--
Speaker 2: Atlantic City High School [Atlantic City, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: --Atlantic City High School.
Speaker 2: It was the only public high school.  There was a friend school and there was a Catholic school.  But Atlantic City High School was the public high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was an excellent school, wonderful school.
Speaker 1: So Atlantic City [New Jersey] sounds like it might be a fun place to grow up.
Speaker 2: I thought so.
Speaker 1: Was it?
Speaker 2: I thought so.  Now, I, of course, went through from kindergarten all way through high school there.  And I did run into some times that were difficult, some challenges; for instance, when I was in high school, I was a member of the theatre group.  And I remember on one occasion trying out for a part in some play, I don't remember what it was, and went to auditions, and there had been a few people before me who were reading or saying the lines for this particular--that we were asked to say, and there were a couple who hadn't yet gone.  I was the only one--all of the students, all my classmates clapped for me over and over again.  And there's a woman who was in charge of the drama guild, that's what it was called, the drama guild, never gave me a part.  Wouldn't do it.  One time I was so incensed, and my father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] had written for the Encyclopedia Britannica an article on the Negro in drama, and I was so incensed with this woman, that I took a brochure of which contained the text of that article, and I went into her and I just said, "I thought you might be interested in this," you know.
Speaker 1: Did she respond in any way?
Speaker 2: Oh, not really.  I did get a part in a play eventually, but, you know.  She couldn't cast me anything else.  She put me in as a milkmaid (laughter).  I think it had to be a maid of some sort.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, actually, your development is being arrested because you can't participate fully in school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was very good in art and in drama, and in foreign languages.  And so I took art, and I was a member of the art club.  And I took Spanish, and I was a member of the Spanish dance group we had there.  A Spanish dance troupe, and I was a member of the drama guild as well, and also a speakers bureau.  We had an organization called speakers bureau, and when community organizations would request a student to come and speak on a particular topic, one of us would be selected.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to do it?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Before what kind of audience was it, black audience?
Speaker 2: Just--not always.  Just--but these were community service organizations.  I don't remember which in particular.  I also used to give dramatic readings.  I can remember doing that for church groups when they were having particular kinds of programs.  And I enjoyed that.  In my house, we had all kinds of books, you know, quite a library.  And I remember being very young reading Shakespeare [William Shakespeare].  I mean, in Atlantic City, there wasn't an awful lot to do all the time, and so having your own library there like that was just fabulous.  I got to do a lot of reading on my own as well as having been read to as a child growing up.  And so, my father never pushed me toward an interest in theatre at all.  Never did.  He never tried to push me into anything.  Neither.  He--neither he nor my mother [Hugh Hancock Gregory].  But I just developed an interest in drama and theatre.  And so, when my sister was in high school, Mignon [Mignon Gregory Wilson], she was before me, I think that they closed the pool there, because they didn't want to have blacks and whites swimming together.  So there were things.  I never--when I was there, there was no such thing as a swimming pool (laughter).  I knew it had existed.  It used to be there, and probably was boarded up.  That was it.  But most of us got along very well together as students.  And I'm still in touch with some of them today.  But there certainly was prejudice.  It surfaced in certain ways just like my example of the woman who was in charge of the drama guild, you know.  Things like that.  Now, I can remember another time when I was in a Spanish class.  One--my teacher at that time I think was struck by the fact that I was so good at the language, learning it and the way that I looked.  And he didn't know what else to say.  One day he said, "Now, I know who you remind me of."  And I looked at him, and then he said, "Dorothy Dandridge."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, for heaven's sake.
Story_ID: 642156
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were some of the, the black--now Dorothy Dandridge certainly was a star--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the '50s [1950s].  Who were some of the--were, did you pay particular attention to the African American stars (unclear)--
Speaker 2: There were not that many at that time.
Speaker 1: But I remember when the movies would come out, you know, it would be a lot of excitement, you know, if you had like 'Porgy and Bess,' you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Well, Lena Horne.
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.
Speaker 2: Lena Horne--
Speaker 1: 'Stormy Weather' was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Dorothy Dandridge.  Excuse me (cough).  Yeah, but I can't at the moment, really.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a black entertainment strip in Atlantic City [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: I would guess, yes.
Speaker 2: Kentucky Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the place.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Kentucky--now 'cause so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was the spot.  Just Kentucky Avenue, yeah.  That was where the Club Harlem [Atlantic City, New Jersey] was located.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the Club Harlem had all the big black entertainers there.  Billy Eckstine and Redd Foxx and whoever, you know, were there.  And that was on one side of the--Kentucky Avenue, on one side of the street.  On the opposite side of the street was another club called Grace's Little Belmont [Atlantic City, New Jersey], and you could hear Wild Bill Davis' music just streaming out of Grace's Little Belmont onto the street.  And there was Club Harlem across the way, and they had what they called the breakfast show, and people would be up all night and come to the breakfast show (laughter).  It was quite an exciting place, let me tell you.  So, that was Kentucky Avenue.  That was the black street of entertainment.  And then there was Timbuktu [Atlantic City, New Jersey] around the corner, and Wonderland [sic. Wonder Gardens, Atlantic City, New Jersey].  So there were all these (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Timbuktu, actually--okay.  Wonderland.  These were all black entertainment establishments?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: I wondered if--yeah, if the black community had, you know--in most cities that had any major population had an entertainment venue.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Yes.
Speaker 1: In my little hometown, we had two black theatres (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Yeah.  Oh, that's right. There was a black theatre, too.  It was called the Alan Theater [Atlantic City, New Jersey].  But yet there were other theatres that were open to blacks, so I didn't experience any discrimination when I was coming along.  However, I think it was true when my siblings were in school that they weren't open as they were in my day, because I was much, you know, so many years later.  But the Alan Theater was the one that had been primarily a black theatre, black movie theatre definitely.  And there were some black eating establishments also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there a principal one of those?
Speaker 2: I can't remember. I don't know.
Story_ID: 642157
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Atlantic City [New Jersey] was a tourist attraction for other black people from around the East Coast (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, but, you know what?  They weren't allowed to stay in the hotels, and so consequently, there were a lot of guesthouses that were owned by blacks, and black people who would allow certain rooms in their homes to be as accommodations for people coming from out of town.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So black tourists coming to Atlantic City--now, there was something.  Now, I heard of something called 'The Green Book' ['The Negro Motorist Green Book'], I think or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know.
Speaker 1: --of the--there's a book that black families could acquire, you know, through the black newspapers that would let you know where you could stay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --in different cities--
Speaker 2: I don't know about it.
Speaker 1: --where you could go, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I knew the places, but I didn't know about the book.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  There was a book, and you can see it online, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: I don't know--I found out about it doing these interviews, because I didn't know about it.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.
Speaker 1: But, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't think I knew about that.
Speaker 1: Some guesthouses in--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there was a section of the beach which was the place where people would congregate.  In fact, even though we could go to any other section of the beach we wanted to when I came along, if my friends and I, when we were teenagers would go to another part of the beach, we'd say, "I wonder who's in town this weekend?"  You know.  And the only way to find out was to go back to the Missouri Avenue Beach [Atlantic City, New Jersey], and so we did that, because everyone went to the Missouri Avenue Beach, all the entertainers went there.  When they went to the beach, they went to the Missouri Avenue Beach.
Speaker 1: And so you would, so you'd definitely see them at the beach then.
Speaker 2: Some of them.  Some of them, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, do you recall meeting any--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --big entertainers or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --celebrities?
Speaker 2: Not when I was growing up there, I didn't.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Later on I did, but not when I was growing up there.  No.  I wasn't allowed, you know to go to clubs, and then the few that came down on the beach, I mean, they were off to themselves along--they sat along a certain wall--what did we call that?  Glamour Row or something (laughter).  I forget.  There were some chairs there, you know, but I never marched over and met anybody.
Story_ID: 642158
Speaker 1: Now you were a little kid during World War II [WWII].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, do you have any recollections of the activities during World War II?  Was there rationing or anything like that?
Speaker 2: I remember hearing about rations.  I remember some little burners that my mother [Hugh Hancock Gregory] used to have.  I've forgotten.  It was cold and it had what now, you would shutter at it, asbestos pad.  I remember was under it.  Some sort of little burner.  I remember hearing about rations.  I remember hearing about Japanese, and I remember some little hide and seek game that one or two friends and I would play where we say the Japanese were coming, you know. So that, you know, I recall.
Speaker 1: Did either one of your brothers have to serve or were they too young?
Speaker 2: My brother, Hugh [Hugh Gregory], did.  In fact, he was one of the Tuskegee Airmen for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Briefly.  He didn't stay with that outfit, but he was originally.  Excuse me.  He was--
Speaker 1: So he was originally chosen as one?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thought I'd ask.
Speaker 2: I think he did something he wasn't supposed to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And so they--
Speaker 1: Do you know what the story is?
Speaker 2: I think he was showing another of the Tuskegee Airmen who was new some maneuvers, and he just went over bounds, and he did what he should not have done in some way, and they said, "Thank you, but no thank you."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in the plane, he--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  They're in Tuskegee [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Did something he--he went out of his way to do something.  He overstepped the bounds.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Some of us were always overstepping the bounds some way or another.
Speaker 1: All right.  But he didn't--but he never got hurt or anything--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --as a result (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No.  No.  He never did.
Speaker 1: --or hurt anybody else?
Speaker 2: No.  He did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so.
Speaker 2: I remember when he was getting ready to go.  I remember he was in the bathroom shaving, and I remember going in there and sitting and watching him shave, knowing that he was getting ready to go.
Story_ID: 642159
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite teacher?  Any favorite teacher or mentors during this period of time?
Speaker 2: In high school [Atlantic City High School, Atlantic City, New Jersey], I had, I think my favorite teachers were my two Spanish teachers there. Senor Prezioso was the first Spanish teacher I had.
Speaker 1: Can you spell his name?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Senor Prezioso.
Speaker 2: Like Mr. Precious.  It was a capital P-R-E-Z-I-O-, Prezios, -S-O.  P-R-E-Z-I-O-S--
Speaker 1: Senor Prezioso.
Speaker 2: But it's, P-R-E-Z-I-O-S-O.  Yeah.  Prezioso.  That was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Carmen Prezioso was his name.
Speaker 1: His first name was?
Speaker 2: Carmen.
Speaker 1: Carmen?  Okay.
Speaker 2: He was the one that taught us Spanish dancing, a few of us who were interested, and we had this Spanish dance troupe.  He taught us how to dance something called la jota.  I learned how to play the castanets (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the other teacher was a Mr. Alexander Hughes.  He was the head of the department, the Spanish department.  And he was a fine teacher.  They both were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In high school.  Junior high school [Atlantic City Junior High School, Atlantic City, New Jersey], I can't remember having a favorite teacher.  I will tell you about one teacher I liked very much until--this was--she was a--Dr. Fox [ph.] was her name.  And she was an English teacher.  And a very, very good English teacher.  We had wonderful teachers there in those schools.  And then one time, she began to recount her class, the class that I was in, an experience that she had when she was out west, and she said that, "Oh, and the Indians [Native American], you could smell them coming around the corner."  I was horrified.  I was horrified.  And from that point on, I think I was about eleven years old or twelve, my estimation of that teacher, I lost all respect for her from that point on.  You know, I really had no respect for her after that; I couldn't imagine anyone saying something so awful (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 642160
Speaker 1: I know earlier we were looking through some of your photos.  And, you went camping a lot apparently, a lot (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yes.  My sister Yvonne [Yvonne Gregory].  My oldest sister had not only taken me one summer to Montauk Point [Montauk Point State Park, Montauk, New York], but another summer, she had me come up to New York to attend a camp called Camp Woodlea that was located in Salt Point, New York.  It was about an hour and a half out of Manhattan, out of New York City [New York, New York].  And it was a lovely experience.  It was an integrated camp, both black and white; and some of the children there, I think, were children of friends of hers.  I remember that's where I met E. Simms Campbell, the cartoonist.  His daughter, Liz [Elizabeth Campbell Parks], was there at that time when I was there I remember.  And it was I think what you call a progressive group at that time.  A progressive camp.  It was just a--beautiful surroundings.  There was a pond there where we could look at tadpoles and things like that.  And we had to wash with cold water, which was kind of hard (laughter), and I learned to swim there.  And I went bike riding there.  We learned how to take care of horses, and we camped outside sometimes, and I don't remember ever being afraid at all, even in the out of doors, you know, in the woods; nothing above us but the sky.  It was wonderful.
Speaker 1: Were both sexes there or just--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, in the camp.  Yeah.  But where we camped outside, for instance, I think I showed you a picture that we were all girls there in that little enclave.  Yeah.  It was great.  I was also a Girl Scout.  I was Brownie scout and Girl Scout.  So in Atlantic City [sic. Berlin, New Jersey], I went to (laughter) a Girl Scout camp that had the name Camp Longacoming, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Camp Longacoming?
Speaker 2: --because as it was explained to us it was so long a coming, the camp.  We didn't have a camp for so long, it was so long a coming they named the Camp Longacoming.
Story_ID: 642161
Speaker 1: All right.  And you--and then you spent a lot time with your sister in New York City [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Did the family--did you travel with your mother [Hugh Hancock Gregory] and father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.]--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--
Speaker 2: No.  I mother and father's travels were all done when my five siblings were little.  And when I came along, they had been to Canada, and I don't know where else.  I--but when I came along, and my parents were so much older, I was really more, in terms of travel, with my sister, Yvonne [Yvonne Gregory], going up to New York, and then with my sister, Mignon [Mignon Gregory Wilson], traveling to Washington [D.C.].  And I never went down to Nashville [Tennessee] to visit my brother [Thomas Gregory, Jr.] when he was there at all.  But they were always in touch with me.  I would get records and books from them, and they were very, very loving siblings, my brothers and sisters.  But in terms of travel with my parents, no, I didn't get to do anything like that with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were in high school [Atlantic City High School, Atlantic City, New Jersey] from '53 [1953] to '57 [1957]?
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 1: Fifty-six [1956]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You graduated in '56 [1956]?
Speaker 2: I graduated in--I'm sorry.  I graduated in '56 [1956], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  And you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know Rosalind Cash, of her?  Yeah, she was in my class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were from kindergarten all the way through high school.
Speaker 1: And--okay.  What was she like?  Now, she's--she was really a fine actress.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And Rosalind also loved to sing and had a good singing voice.  And she was very athletic.  She was very active in whatever sports we had going on in elementary school [Indiana Avenue School, Atlantic City, New Jersey], junior high school [Atlantic City Junior High School, Atlantic City, New Jersey].  I remember we were walking down the street one day, I think it was on Ohio Avenue, and Rosalind said, "Well, we're going to be friends all of our lives, aren't we?"  (Laughter) I said, "Yes."  And we were both then maybe in the second grade.
Speaker 1: Now, she had an interesting career.  She was--I saw her in 'Black Girl' [sic.], when they made a movie of that.  She was in 'Omega Man' ['The Omega Man'] with Charlton Heston.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And she was in several blaxploitation movies (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.  She was.
Speaker 1: 'Melinda' was one.  I know there're some others.
Speaker 2: And then she got a part in an ongoing television series, too.  What was it?  'General Hospital?'  I've forgotten which one.
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: But there was one.  In fact, she came to the Washington area, but to Baltimore [Maryland] one time, to be in a play, to perform in a play.  And the same day that the play she was in with her name was advertised in The Washington Post there was my ad for my program ['The Magic Door'] that I had eventually in television.  And I said, I wish I'd saved that issue of the newspaper.  I didn't do it.
Story_ID: 642162
Speaker 1: So, and you're also friends with--I have to look back at my paper now.  I forgot her name, but I know the woman who--your parents [Hugh Hancock Gregory and Thomas Gregory, Sr.] are friends with the woman who raised--you know, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, [HistoryMaker] June Cross?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  June Cross.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I remember when June first came to Atlantic City [New Jersey] as a child.  And she was to be raised by my mother's friend, Peggy Bush; was very close to both my parents.  And Peggy had gone to school in Washington, D.C., at Miner's Teachers College [sic. Miner Teachers College; University of the District of Columbia], and that's where she first met my parents.  And my father was responsible for bringing a number of teachers to Atlantic City and Peggy was one of them.  And she was married, but never had children.  And she--in her home, the house that she and her husband [Paul Bush] had, there was a ground floor apartment and people would rent it out in the summers.  And so, several summers, June's parents rented it.  They weren't married--don't think they were married.  But they would come there and stay, and Peggy was a very warm person and very interested in the child, and so when, at a certain point in the relationship of those two, they separated, the mother, Norma [Norma Storch], asked Peggy if she would agree to raising June.  And so Peggy did.  So that's how I grew to know June--how we all grew to know June.
Story_ID: 642163
Speaker 1: Now, when you were on the--now, how were your grades in high school [Atlantic City High School, Atlantic City, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: My grades were good.  They were good, but they were abominable in math and algebra, which I had no love for.  I can remember saying to my mother, "Why is it necessary for me to take these subjects?"  I did extremely well in English and foreign languages and in history and in geography; but when it came to math, I hated it.  I really did.  But otherwise, I did quite well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't do well in those subjects.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have good counseling about college in high school or did you need it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  But I didn't need it, you know.  My parents [Hugh Hancock Gregory and Thomas Gregory, Sr.] were my counselors, and I didn't really have any need to go to the counselors in the school for anything.
Speaker 1: Did they attempt to counsel even though?
Speaker 2: I don't remember that they did any particular outreach, but they didn't need to, you know.  I was interested in going to Sarah Lawrence [Sarah Lawrence College] in Bronxville, New York, or to--what was this?  Bennington College [Bennington, Vermont] up in New England or to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  Now, in the end, I chose Howard University because my brother, Hugh [Hugh Gregory], the one with the strong personality, and my brother, Gene [Eugene Gregory], both, but especially Hugh, thought that I needed to go to a school where there was more of a black presence, because going through the Atlantic City schools, it was complete integration for me in my time; and they just thought it would be good for me to go to Howard University.  So in the end, I went to Howard.
Story_ID: 642164
Speaker 1: So Howard University [Washington, D.C.], you were saying off camera you were great friends with Gail Hansberry [HistoryMaker Gail A. Hansberry], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Gail and I met when we were freshmen at Howard.  We were there together.  Yes.  And I know that my father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] knew William Leo Hansberry, her father.  I heard so many stories at home growing up about people my father knew and had known, like E. Franklin Frazier, who was there at the university.  I took a class from him just to sit in and be in his class.  I took a class from Sterling Brown [Sterling A. Brown] simply because I wanted to have that experience.  I didn't need to take it, but I did take it, as I took the class from E. Franklin Frazier.  It was a wonderful place to be in many respects.  And Gail was one of my fellow students there.  I joined the Howard Players [Howard University Players].  I also was active in the Spanish club.  I think--and--or I started out in art.  I started out as an art major.  But it was the first year of art was so much like the art I'd had at high school [Atlantic City High School] in Atlantic City [New Jersey], that I didn't stick with it.  It really was like a repeat, repetition of what I'd already done.
Speaker 1: Did, did you really have a verve for art?  I mean, did you draw a lot at home or paint (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did.  I won awards.  I can remember, in fact, I think I have a certificate with me here.  I won three Gold Keys one year in an art contest.  That was national.  I think it was a national contest.  I loved art.  I guess that was my first love, and I--I was going to say about that--that I really--oh, fashion design was what I liked eventually.  I decided I wanted to be a fashion designer.  That was the first thing that I hooked on to in my mind, you know, that I wanted to be a fashion designer.  But, so art, art was the first thing.  And then, it was hard for me to decide what I wanted to do while at Howard because I did really love art and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were the art instructors (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Is this past the era of Aaron Douglas or was he--?
Speaker 2: Well, Lois Jones Pierre Noel (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Lois, okay.
Speaker 2: --was there.  Lois Jones, she was there.
Speaker 1: Lois Mailou Jones?
Speaker 2: Yes, Lois Mailou Jones.  At that time, she was Lois Jones Pierre Noel.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: She was there.  Yes.  And she--I don't think I took a class from her though.  I didn't have her as a teacher, but I was in that art department for a year.  And then I couldn't decide what to--really, I loved drama and I loved languages.  And then, enter my brother, Hugh [Hugh Gregory] (laughter), okay?  And he insisted that I should not try to become too much involved in drama or in art because there were no opportunities that were firm opportunities, and that I would end up living on a shoestring.  And he knew because he lived in New York [New York], and so he said, "You don't want to do that.  You would be ridiculous to do that, and what you need to do is to get into education.  And that will always be something you can rely on."  Well, he was right, but it just meant that I didn't really pursue--when I was in high school, my art teacher said to me, "You know, you ought to major in art."  When I was at Howard, Dr. James Butcher [James W. Butcher], who was one of the instructors of the drama department, said, "Sheila [HistoryMaker Sheila Gregory Thomas], you ought to major in drama."  But Sheila ended up majoring in Spanish.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's what I did.  And with a minor in education.
Speaker 1: Now, you were a good Spanish student, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A letter that my--oh, my favorite teacher at Howard was a wonderful, wonderful man from Puerto Rico and his name was Dr. Jose Ferrer Canales.  He was a remarkable teacher.  He was just wonderful.  And I--I was going to tell you--what was it about him?  Well, he entered me in a Spanish declamation contest in which we had to memorize and recite with some emotion or appropriate emotion, gestures and so forth of Spanish poetry.  I won every time.  But the letter, that's what I was about to tell you about.  When I was finishing Howard and was applying to the District of Columbia Public Schools to teach, the letter that he wrote, the letter of recommendation, at the end he said, "And I must tell you that she was the very best--my very best student in my conversation class."
Story_ID: 642165
Speaker 1: So you were his best student?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He said I was his best student in his conversation class.  And I loved him.  I really did, he and his wife [Ana Hilda Betancourt].  His wife was from Cuba, he was from Puerto Rico, and they had me over to their home several times.  He gave me as gifts on a couple of occasions some wonderful books of poetry.  And years after left Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], he would call me back to come and recite poetry for special occasions.  And I still have a letter from a Puerto Rican poet whose poetry I recited, because Dr. Ferrer [Jose Ferrer Canales] asked me to participate in a program, and this man wrote to me and thanked me so much when he returned to Puerto Rico.  So he was excellent.  He was wonderful.  He was a very expressive person (laughter), and he would teach and he would just be full of emotion and, you know, you could just feel it.  And so one day in the class there was a long table.  He was at one end and I was sort of at the other end, and he paused after he'd been speaking, and he looked and he said, "Senorita Gregory [HistoryMaker Sheila Gregory Thomas], is everything all right?  What is the matter?"  And I said, "What?  Oh, oh."  I said, "Oh, I was just so involved in what you were saying," 'cause evidently I was looking like this (demonstrates), maybe had a pained expression on my face (laughter).  It was simply because I was so carried away by whatever it is that he was speaking about or describing.  He was that way.  And I found him to be a wonderful, wonderful teacher.  I know that he really, I'm sure, would have hoped that I would follow through with the language, you know, that I would go on.  I had actually thoughts of doing that, but I took another route.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you take any French at all?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I had French in high school [Atlantic City High School, Atlantic City, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I didn't have it--did I learn in high school?  No, no, no.  Not in high school.  I had French at Howard University.  That's where I had it.  I had an instructor--who was it?  Dr. Valaurez B. Spratlin [Valaurez Spratlin].  He was the head of the Romance language department.  He was from Nebraska, I remember, and he knew one of the Mahammitts out there.  There was a Mahammitt out there who owned a catering business.  And Dr. Spratlin knew him.  But I did take French.  I think he was my teacher.  I think he was head of the department.  Maybe he wasn't my teacher, but he was head of the department-
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: --there.
Speaker 1: Since this is Howard University, a black college [HBCU], was there any discussion about the Moors in Spain or the contributions of the Moors in Spain?
Speaker 2: About what?
Speaker 1: The Moors in Spain and the contributions of the Moors in Spain (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Moors?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Right.
Speaker 2: Oh, I was passionate about that.  I really was.  Yes, indeed.  I know that in Dr. Ferrer's classes, certainly attention was called to the presence of the Moors and how much they contributed to Spain, in music and art and architecture.  And I was just captivated by the history of the Moors in Spain and how they ruled Spain for centuries.  They did.  Several centuries.  I've forgotten how many now, but it was just incredible history.
Speaker 1: I've just forgotten--I've just remembered that--what Charlton Heston's 'El Cid'--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --the movie blockbuster came out when you were in college.
Speaker 2: I don't think I saw that.
Speaker 1: You didn't see it? It was like a--
Speaker 2: I don't know.  You know, 'El Cid' wasn't such a great figure, you know.  I mean, he was trying to get the Moors out of Spain, you know.  Not just the Moors, the gypsies [Romani] and the Jews and (laughter)--.
Speaker 1: But the movie came out and the movie--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --depicts the Moors and the interaction between the Cid and the Moors and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  I don't even remember that.
Speaker 1: --of course, he portrayed the saint in the movie, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't even remember that I saw that.  I may not have.  You know, I don't remember.  I'm sure I would if I had, but for some reason I did not see that movie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But, yes, I was certainly--the Moors certainly were a subject, definitely.
Story_ID: 642166
Speaker 1: All right.  So, did you get a chance to do any foreign travel?  Did you get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did.  After I left Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], one of the--I went to Europe with my then husband [Marion Curtis Thomas, Sr.], I--at that time was married, and we went to Europe and got to go to Spain, and where do you think I wanted to go?  I wanted to go to the south of Spain where the Moors had been most predominant.
Speaker 1: The Alhambra--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Granada [Spain] where the Alhambra is.  And I went to Sevilla, Seville [Spain], and I went to Malaga [Spain] and Madrid [Spain].  Madrid, Granada, Malaga, and Seville, yes.  And at that time also went to--my sister, Yvonne [Yvonne Gregory], at that time, was living in Munich, Germany.  And her--he wasn't her husband--they were--had known each other since they were very young in New York [New York] as young, creative people, and he was German, but had grown up in France and then moved to New York.  And that's when they knew each other.  So they were together as partners and they lived in Munich.  And so we visited there, and also we went to France to Paris, and they met us there; and then went to--also to Rome [Italy].  Didn't get to England or to Ireland, but just to France and Italy and Spain.  But my main passion then was to go to see where the Moors had been and to go to the Alhambra and seeing the magnificence of that architecture there.  Oh, my.  It was just something else to behold.  It was wonderful.
Story_ID: 642167
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the- you being such a good student at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], it would, I was--I'm kind of surprised that they didn't have a program that sends students to Spain.
Speaker 2: No.  At that time they didn't.  Now, I remember that there was a--some sort of grant or fellowship that I could apply for that I found out about, and I think it may have been called the Lucy Moten Fellowship [Lucy E. Moten Fellowship].  And I did apply for that to go to South America.  But I think that it was too much, much too expensive and somebody was giving me suggestions about what to put into it and how to--what to incorporate into it, and I think it just got to be a little too much.  I think looking back on it, it was crazy, you know.  Too much.  And so I did not get it.  And now that would have been my opportunity to do so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To, you know, while I as a student.
Speaker 1: Now, you met your husband [Marion Curtis Thomas, Sr.] at Howard, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had--I met my husband while I was at Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.  And you end up getting married the same year you graduated?
Speaker 2: Oh, after I graduated.  Yes, we did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was from Texas actually.
Speaker 1: Now, did you graduate with any special honors or anything?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, no.  I just think it was noted that I--I can't remember how they did that in the program that showed that you--little something beside your name, but nothing, you know, major.  No.
Speaker 1: So that your teacher said you were his best student ever?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, that should be something.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I, you know, I loved the language.  I loved languages period, and he was a fantastic teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's Jose Ferrer?
Speaker 2: Jose Ferrer Canales.
Speaker 1: And that's--the last name is spelled?
Speaker 2: C-A-N as in Nellie, and Canales. C-A-N-A-L-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I actually got it right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He eventually returned to Puerto Rico and went to teach at the University of Puerto Rico [San Juan, Puerto Rico].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So your hus- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And he also interpreted.  He translated the Lord's Prayer into Spanish as well, and I remember that.
Story_ID: 642168
Speaker 1: So, your husband was from Texas?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was from Houston [Texas].
Speaker 1: From Houston.  Okay.  And what is his name?
Speaker 2: Marion.  M-A-R-I-O-N.  And his middle name was Curtis.  Marion Curtis Thomas [Marion Curtis Thomas, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did he do?  What was he--well, at that time, I don't know--had--if he was earning his living the way he--in a career or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I met him, he had come from the University of Illinois where he had been a student in architecture.  And he moved, excuse me, to Washington [D.C.].  And he hadn't completed his studies yet, and he was working for an architect in Washington.  And then he went on to re-enroll in college, and he attended Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and graduated from Howard with a degree in architecture.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: He had a very interesting family history in a way.  His father was really like a cowboy.  His father worked his way through Prairie View [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] by roping horses and breaking horses and stuff like that.  And his father, and I think an uncle also, used to go on cattle drives.
Speaker 1: And he went to University of Illinois?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he didn't finish there.  He finished at Howard.
Story_ID: 642169
Speaker 1: You went directly to teaching in the elementary schools, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was looking for something to do that wasn't traditional.  I knew that I was equipped to teach, but I did not want to teach in the traditional way.  I wanted to find something where I could use conversation and to teach the children without starting out with grammar.  And my cousin Francis [ph.], who at that time was an assistant superintendent of schools in Washington, D.C., called me and said there was such a program actually that had started in Washington called FLES: Foreign Languages in Elementary Schools.  F-L-E-S.  And he suggested that I look into that, and I did.  And it was just what I was looking for.  It was an opportunity to teach young children the language by immersing them in it as much as possible and using a lot of props, in other words, so that you'll touch the door and say that was la puerta, you know, and you'd walk in in the morning and you'd say, "Buenos dias," you know.  And so they just learn, because you'd say it, they'd say it back, and they practiced and we had all kinds of props.  It was a very creative program, and for that reason I liked it very, very much.  And we had a small group of teachers.  There weren't many of us.  And we were throughout the D.C. area.  Each one of us had two or three schools a day, about eight or nine classes a day.  But each class was only for twenty minutes, just enough time to go in and do it and leave and--the children learned beautifully.  They learned very, very quickly.  We had the best students, the ones they considered to be the best students, which wasn't always fair because sometimes there were students who may have been gifted in languages who weren't gifted in other areas.
Speaker 1: As yourself.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: As yourself, yeah.  Yeah.  So that did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So--
Speaker 1: --yeah.  I could see how that could, like--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --take talented students out of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So it was an excellent program.  We had a wonderful woman as director of that program, and I liked it.  I do remember one time going into a class, and I think it was during Black History Week [Negro History Week].  At that time, we had Black History Week.  I don't think it was Black History Month.  And I knew my students, they were probably--we started in third grade, and I think these were probably my fourth grade students, possibly the fifth, but fourth grade; and I walked into the classroom, and I asked them questions, like, in Spanish, what is special about this week, you know, or something about the--and they just stared at me.  I was like--.  I couldn't believe it.  What is wrong with these kids?  These aren't the same children I taught.  And then I found out they were afraid to raise their hands because they had this teacher who was like this.  She was very rigid, and they were like little automatons, little robots, you know.  And they just didn't move or speak, and finally I asked the principal if I could transfer my kids out of that classroom somewhere else, because I felt that they were inhibited.  They were inhibited from really expressing themselves as I was accustomed to seeing.  So she let me do that, and we had class in the auditorium.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was it a--did you utilize--with Washington, D.C., being sort of an international city with a lot of embassies and programs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah.  I did.  Not then.  No, no.  Not when I was teaching.  I don't think I did. I think, yeah, I took them--no, that was later on, no.  I did not, at that time, in that program.  No.  Does not do that with the elementary kids.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you taught in the FLES program for how many years?
Speaker 2: Yes.  About six and a half years, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Six and a half to seven years, and then, I already had one little boy [Marion Curtis Thomas, Jr.], and I was expecting another child.  And so that's when I stopped in that program, and I didn't go back to teaching at that time.
Speaker 1: So this is 1967, approaching '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: About 1968, yeah, going in--yeah, around that time.  Exactly.  Right.
Story_ID: 642170
Speaker 1: Now, did--were any members of your family involved in the Civil Rights Movement during this period of time?
Speaker 2: Let's see.
Speaker 1: There's so much going on.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, I can remember when I was at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] that I remember standing with some students outside of a Woolworth store [F.W. Woolworth Company] and handing out fliers, and we were supposed to say, "Would you like to know why we are protesting?"  And I wouldn't have fared too well in the situation as those brave students.  Like one of my former classmates, Diane Nash, who transferred down to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]--
Speaker 1: Oh.  So you knew Diane Nash?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: She was in the freshman, I think sophomore, and then she went on down to Fisk.
Speaker 1: Now, she has gone down in history as one of the organizers of the Freedom Rides.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Or one of the mainstays of the civil rights.
Speaker 2: I know.  I know.  Never would have expected--Diane was such a quiet person, you know (laughter).  But--
Speaker 1: She's about the same color as you.
Speaker 2: Lighter, I think.
Speaker 1: Light, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think she's lighter than I am, with light eyes and light hair, really, naturally, so.  But I remember standing outside with this--and just knew, you know, how awfully hard it must be to steel yourself against the onslaught of the screams, taunts, and physical attacks, because all I had to do was say, "Would you like to know why we are protesting?"  And I didn't handle that too well, because one young lady walked by and I said, "Would you like to know why we are protesting?"  And she did this (gesture) (laughter).  I said, "Young lady, would you like to know why we are protesting?"  You know.  I just couldn't help it.  And, in other words, you know, you really think you're going to pass me by and ignore me like that and not acknowledge that I'd asked you a question?  I found that very difficult.  I really did.  That was the only thing I ever did, really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my family--well, my sister, Yvonne [Yvonne Gregory], was very active in civil rights; I mean, just in going down and covering stories about all kinds--but that was before Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] day, you know.  She was doing it way back then, and--
Speaker 1: What you're saying establishes, like a lot of our other interviews, that there were activities going on before Martin Luther King.
Speaker 2: Oh, indeed, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And a lot of people have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] wrote about travel on the railroads for Crisis magazine [The Crisis], and what that was like going into the South.  He volunteered to go down there, and then he wrote about it for Crisis magazine, you know, what he experienced and how it was.  So that my family was involved at various periods of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now was--was the Woolworth segregated here in D.C.?
Speaker 2: Was what?
Speaker 1: The Woolworth lunch counter segregated?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I also--my first experience in segregation was such was here in Washington, it was in Washington, D.C.  And then again, one time when I went to a wedding of a close friend in Charleston, West Virginia, and not being able to go into the five and dime there to get a hotdog, you know, or if you did, you had to stand up.  You couldn't be seated at the counter.  But, yes, definitely.  We didn't go, when I was a student at Howard, away from certain area.  14th Street I recall--well, that's where Woolworths was, but evidently what was going on there was probably similar, you couldn't sit down I suppose.  That's what it was.  Like in West Virginia, you would have to stand up.  You weren't treated like an ordinary, regular, normal customer.  But we went to Hot Shoppes in that area, we went to stores like shoe stores in that area, but we didn't go downtown.  We did not go downtown
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Nor did we go to restaurants downtown. We went to black restaurants.
Speaker 1: Now this, this is the fourth time this week someone's mentioned a Woolworth demonstration.  Just for the record.  It is the fourth time this week.  Well, this is--and in some cases, the Woolworths were segregated and in other cases they were sympathetic demonstrations, like in Chicago [Illinois], because of Woolworths being a national chain, and, you know, segregated in North Carolina and other places in the South.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, in Atlantic City [New Jersey], we were able to go into Woolworths and all of those places, you know, when I came along.  Again, it was different from my brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: And I've heard from people that the dynamic of a place that's on the coast or tourist place is that the rules are relaxed, even in the South, on some level.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: Not completely relaxed, but, and if you're on the Gulf [Gulf of Mexico] in Biloxi [Mississippi] or New Orleans [Louisiana] or something, there's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Interesting.
Speaker 1: --it's not as--some things are strictly segregated, and other things are, there's a--
Speaker 2: A little laxed, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I know that Club Harlem in Atlantic City on Kentucky [Avenue], I mean, 'cause we're always there, you know, there was a--quite a popular and well known club, nightclub all over the place.  Larry Steele and his 'Smart Affairs,' for whatever year it was, you know.  They were dancers who performed, and they had all kinds of things going on.  The breakfast club, as I mentioned.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, Larry Steele from Chicago (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, really?  He was from Chicago.
Story_ID: 642171
Speaker 1: So you had your second child [Joel Thomas]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and--okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you took a hiatus from work.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: A hiatus for a moment.
Speaker 2: I did.  And then I didn't go back.  I'm trying to remember.  It was that I decided that I didn't want to go back to teaching.  I think I was finding some of the schools I went into to be a little difficult.  I remember going in--I hate to say this, but I remember going in to one school--and I was in all-black schools--in to one school to teach Spanish, and it was not an attractive environment at all. You know, this particular atmosphere in the school.  And I asked for the principal, and I was told that he was out on the golf course, you know, so, come on.  That was one experience.  And then another school I went in to, the maintenance man told me he had been very upset because the principal had locked a student in the broom closet or something.  And one time, I actually saw her kick a student and say, "Take that.  Now you know what it feels like."  So, you know, I just--
Speaker 1: And these were black teachers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Doing this to black students?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This was all foreign to me, you know.  And then what was really, really one of the most terrible, really shocking situations for me was, there was this young teacher about my age who taught at, not one of the classes I went in to--lower than--mine were third, fourth and fifth, and when I stopped by her classroom one day, she began to talk about her students within their hearing with me standing there in the most disparaging tone and words, and I couldn't stand it.  I could not stand it.  And I never, ever went back that way again as I was walking around, you know.  But I was about ready to leave and I thought, well, maybe I'll find something using the language in some other capacity not within the school system.  I loved teaching, I really did.  I got a lot out of it.  I felt a lot of reward from seeing the children learn.  One--I had one little niece who was very quick at languages also.  And one time, when she had a day off from her school, I took her with me around to visit my schools, and I would introduce her to one of my students using Spanish, and introduce him to her and they knew what is a, "How are you?  What is your name," and all kinds of things, and I could just carry on a conversation.  So that was so rewarding.  I enjoyed that, seeing this happen.
Story_ID: 642172
Speaker 1: I guess it's the time to talk about 'The Magic Door.'
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, after I stopped teaching at that time to give birth to my second child [Joel Thomas], another little boy, I decided that I wanted to do something different and thought I would look for something else to do where I could use the language.  That was the first thing I thought of, using Spanish.  And then a friend called me and told me about auditions at a television station for a program.  And so I said, "Ha, well, might as well try that.  Why not."  And so, I called.  That was Channel Seven, WMAL [WMAL-TV], it was known at that time.  Now it's WJLA-TV [Washington, D.C.].  But then it was WMAL.  So I called and I spoke to the program director, and he told me that auditions were closed.  He was very sorry, and then he must have asked me a question or two, and we went on talking and talking and talking.  And so, finally, he said, "Well, look," he said, "I'd like to have you come and do an audition."  So even though he had considered the auditions closed, after talking with me, he asked me to come in and audition and I did.  I was the one who got the job.  So I started out with a talk show being a producer or co-producer, I can't remember, on a talk show.  And then they told me that they really wanted me to develop a children's program.  So then I knew, well, that was actually why they had hired me, because they had a children's program then that was quite different from the one I went on to develop.  But I said, of course.  I went ahead and put together some ideas, and my mother [Hugh Hancock Gregory] actually thought of the name 'The Magic Door,' and so I started the children's program called 'The Magic Door.'  And I was--
Speaker 1: Now, what is the magic door?  It may seem obvious to people, but what did you intend the name, 'Magic Door' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'The Magic Door' is to open a door onto all kinds of experiences and exposures for children, and also it was because--really what we did was to make the door look magic.  I can remember there was sort of special effects that were used in the beginning (gesture) (laughter).  It really made it look magic.  And I was by myself for some time and eventually got a Muppet-like character we named Jellybean.  In fact, I had a contest so children in the D.C. area [Washington, D.C.] could submit names, and we chose Jellybean.  He was a green Muppet-like character.  I used him--I integrated Spanish into the program.  It was an hour live show, Monday through Friday.  And--
Speaker 1: That's--that would be--that sounds like something that would really be daunting to a lot of people today, to think of doing an hour live show--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: --five days a week.
Speaker 2: --it was done.  And--
Speaker 1: Was it interactive?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did people call in?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't like that?
Speaker 2: No.  I was just me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the format?  What was the format of the show?
Speaker 2: You know 'Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'?  Okay.  I had the pleasure of meeting him eventually, but it was more like 'Mister Rogers.' Me talking to the child--the children through the television and introducing them to things as, just as I'm speaking to you.  And I had certain things--I did certain kinds of projects, science projects, simple science projects; reading stories; I had the Muppet; I taught Spanish.  I was about to say, I incorporated that into the program.  Two brief segments and then the first half hour another one.  I mean, one in the first half hour, another in the second half hour.  And Jellybean helped with that.  I would teach Jellybean Spanish.  And also, I, at one point, decided it would be a good idea to have the children learn about different cultures; ways of not only speaking, like, Spanish, but different ways of eating, different ways of dressing, different customs; and so I did a program on India.  And I used--was able to make use of--people at the University of India [sic.] were very supportive.  And I had someone come on, and I wore a sari and there was a lady who came on and she wore a sari, and we talked about the foods and all kinds of things just on the level that children from three to six could appreciate and understand; not anything too complicated.  And I was asked to do one for Japan.  Someone, after they'd seen India, a woman who was associated with the embassy of Japan, contacted me and asked me if we would please think of doing something on Japan.  And an African embassy, I've forgotten which one now.  But I was going in that direction at a certain point.
Story_ID: 642173
Speaker 1: I had to learn to use chopsticks because I wanted to demonstrate to the children how people ate with chopsticks.  So that was done as a program [on 'The Magic Door'].  We did the things on--eventually we had a theme for each program, and one of the themes I recall was on rules and regulations.  And the Muhammad Ali happened to be in town [Washington, D.C.], we found out, and we said, "Oh, wouldn't it be great if we could get him to come on the program during rules and regulations."  You know, maybe if he knew what we were going to be doing, he would be able to think of some way to fit into it.  And indeed he did.  He came on and sat there and just as--as if he were so comfortable--and as if he'd been doing it all his life.  He sat there and went on to talk to me about rules and regulations and the importance of them in his life and how once when he had not followed them, how he lost a fight.  He was great.  He was the greatest.  He really was great.  He really was, so.  And then we developed a segment called, "I Want to Be" [ph.] that we would put into--I had a--John Steptoe, who was a young black writer of children's books, come on and talk about his books and how it was that he came to be an author, a children's book writer.  There were a number of things we did like that.  I can hardly remember all of them, but that was one segment that we developed along the way.
Speaker 2: And the--the only other recurrent character was Jellybean?
Speaker 1: That was it.
Speaker 2: Who portrays Jellybean?
Speaker 1: Oh, John Wilson was his name--George Wilson.  George was an announcer.  He would come on with station breaks and announcements and things like that.  And so George was delighted to be Jellybean.  He was very good at it.
Speaker 2: So did he--was he just the voice of Jellybean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just the voice.
Speaker 2: --or did he--and then there was a puppeteer?
Speaker 1: Well, no.  Jellybean was a pup- you had to put your hand up in side of him and make him move and so forth.  And George did that.  And he was his voice (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So he was a puppeteer and the voice?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: All right.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  It was his voice.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That sounds like quite a show--
Speaker 1: One time I took--we took a trip to Puerto Rico.  Spanish, you know.  And we went to a little village called Loiza Aldea [Puerto Rico] which is a village which is full of African traditions.  And every year they have a parade and they make masks, African masks, and it's all African traditions.  These people are all descendants of Africans who came over to the island or who were brought over to the island, and so that was it.  And other things, I forget what else we did.  We took other trips around the island.  That was excellent.
Speaker 2: It sounds like it.
Speaker 1: So there were just a myriad of things really that I was able to explore with that program.  We did Black History Month or week, whatever it was at that time--month, I guess; and I was able to introduce black history in there, into the program.
Story_ID: 642174
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was Negro History Week [Black History Month] then, I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, the show is launched in '69 [1969], is that?
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969], yes.
Speaker 1: Now this is a year after the assassination of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  A year after some of the worst riots in U.S. history in several cities; Chicago [Illinois], even my hometown, Dayton [Ohio]; and here in Washington, D.C., a tremendous riot here.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.  That's right.  Oh, yes.  I remember that well.
Speaker 1: So the rhetoric in the country was: let's try to do something to heal racial and divide.  You know, federal government, you know, mandated that corporations integrate, you know, in some (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so, and the media was under the same kind of scrutiny.
Speaker 2: And at that time, and I know that's true because they were hiring news reporters and so forth, but at that time, children's television also had the spotlight on them.  In other words, there were organizations like Action for Children's Television which were insisting that there be better programming for children.  That was also going on at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And indeed, when I took over--when I took over, but when I created 'The Magic Door,' there was another program.  There had been another children's program there, and it was--had lots of cartoons, okay?  And I did not want cartoons in my show.  I didn't want any cartoons.  And at first the program management thought, well, that wouldn't be possible.  You know, how else are you going to handle all that time?  And I said, "We can do it."  And we did.  They got rid of the cartoons.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The typical children's show, if I may, would be a host like the Old Ranger or they were Whitman Jake [ph.] or something like that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Mr. Green Jeans on 'Captain Kangaroo.'
Speaker 1: Oh, he was a little bit better.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well most locally produced shows that have some character who would--captain somebody, who would introduce, like, cartoons.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the cartoons are 'Popeye' cartoons ['Popeye the Sailor'], Bugs Bunny cartoons, and then the animals--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and the people would beat each other up and then--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's what I think of the cartoons (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, I thought, I began--when I was there and looked at a lot of these cartoons, 'cause I really hadn't done that as a child.  I said, "Gosh, these are really for adults."  And the people in the control room, we'd be sitting there cracking up laughing at the cartoons.  I said, "These are really--," they were geared towards adults.  A lot of the humor was.  But, at any rate, and 'The Magic Door' was able to have them do away--I was thankful for that--with cartoons, and we did not continue to have them at all.  There was one little animated--what would you call it.  It wasn't a cartoon.  One little animated thing that I did like.  It was a little character named Jot.  And actually he was produced by a church group somewhere in the South, I think.  But Jot was good in that he was always doing something.  He might get into trouble, and then he'd find out he could have done it better another way.  So that one I could deal with.  That I felt was okay.  And it didn't have religious overtones at all, but it was just a nice little few minutes of this little animated character doing things that children could relate to.  And so I did have that in there.
Speaker 1: I remember 'Jot,' I believe.  Yeah.  So--
Speaker 2: I also--well, let me say this.  One thing I liked doing was being able to bring the children in to the studio, some children from the schools, so that they could see how this really happened, you know, because they had no concept, of course.  All they knew was that I appeared on the screen in that box that was a television.  And so on several occasions, I was able to bring in students, children from the schools, and they just loved it, you know.  They really did.  And I also brought about a community involvement program called, Magic Door in the Streets [ph.]. And I got--the station [WMAL-TV; WJLA-TV, Washington, D.C.] was very supportive in things like that.  I got them to let us go out--I've forgotten how often, maybe once a week or once every couple of weeks, to some preschool or recreation center; wherever children in a structured environment, and I'd go out and Jellybean had a cousin, Oscar--no.  I can't remember what his name was, but I used to take the other one out, you know, to things.  And then McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] would provide food.  Of course, now, shudders, you know (laughter).  It's not the healthiest thing.  But, McDonald's would provide burgers and things for the kids, too.
Story_ID: 642175
Speaker 1: So Jellybean's cousin had to go out because Jellybean had to do announcements on the station (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Right.  Exactly.  And then I thought, well, gee, wouldn't it be good to have a tie in with the D.C. schools [District of Columbia Public Schools].  And so I approached the then--who was superintendent--I guess superintendent of schools--and talked about it.  And we worked out a routine or system where children in certain schools--what would they call them--some Section 8 [sic.] schools or something.  I've forgotten what they--any way, children in certain schools. Yeah, Title VIII would tune into the show for certain segment--a certain segment every day or I don't know if it was every day--but periodically at any rate.  It was a relationship that was developed between 'The Magic Door' and the D.C. schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they used the program, you know, you're in the classroom, you know, during the day?
Speaker 2: I found out while I was there, if I can tell you about a little--I'll give you a little story.  I taught--at one school where I taught, when I was in the FLES program [Foreign Languages in Elementary Schools], I found out about a little boy who they said was gifted and talented, who really was far beyond what any other children his age were.  He was in kindergarten.  And I met him, I went to the classroom where he was, and I realized he wasn't getting what he needed there.  I had been told that one time, when some--when he was in preschool at another school around the corner, that a game had come in for children in an older age group, and he had taken it apart and read the directions and played it, okay.  So now he was in kindergarten.  And the day that I was able to get around to that class and I asked the teacher, "Well, where is this little boy, Robert [ph.]?"  And she said, "Oh, he's out on the playground."  And she went on to tell me about how, you know, she just couldn't relate to him, and you know, something like that.  So that's when I said, "Oh, let me try to get this child out of here."  So at that time, my older son [Marion Curtis Thomas, Jr.] was in a Montessori school, and I approached the director of that school, and I asked her if she would consider this bright child, you know, on scholarship, on a scholarship, and I met with his parents, and they were amenable to that, definitely were appreciative and grateful for the opportunity for this child.  And so the director of the Montessori school said to me, "Well, if you can just get the paperwork that I need to me by such and such a date."  Well, I taught at both of the schools, that one where he had been and the one where he was in kindergarten.  So I spoke to the teacher who had been his teacher in preschool, and she was involved in other things in that school as well, and I said, "I need to get whatever paperwork you have on Robert."  Well, then after that, I never saw her again.  I was only in that school for a certain time every day and then I moved to another school, and I could never find her.  And I would ask for her and I couldn't find her.  And then the deadline passed.  And sometime after that I saw her.  I said, "Whatever happened?"  And she said, "Oh, the principal," and she said his name, "told me not to get involved."  Years later, 'Magic Door,' I'm in my office, I am told that there's a little boy on the phone named Robert.  I speak to him, and asks me if I can come and visit the children sometime.  I said, "Well, where are you?"  "St. Elizabeths Hospital [Washington, D.C.]."  I said, "Well, Robert, let me see what I can do."  I hung up, I called right back, I found out, I think from him where he was in particular.  I asked to speak to the person in charge, and I said, "I just spoke to this little boy.  I remember him from elementary school.  What is he doing there?"  She said, "He doesn't belong here.  He comes here on a daily basis as if he were going to school," she said, "but they just didn't know what to do with him."  And that's the last I ever knew about him.  I have always wondered what happened to him.  But that was so sad, so distressing to think that this child, who had so much talent, was just shunted aside because the teacher didn't know how to manage him, didn't know what to do with him.
Speaker 1: I heard a couple other stories, similar stories about students that were way advanced, but their parents didn't know what to do, and then the school didn't do anything.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm just--think of how many children end up in jail, you know, or whatever, other circumstances, because people just didn't try.
Story_ID: 642176
Speaker 1: So now, what, what was your time slot?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was from, I think eight to nine [o'clock].  And I think at one point it was also earlier.  I mean, they changed it once, so I know it was from eight to nine at one point, but I think it had been earlier also, 'cause I can remember having to get there very, very early.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's on at a time when most children would be--they're getting ready to go to school or going to school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The ones at home would be the ones that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: --younger--
Speaker 2: That's right.  So the earlier time slot was the one that made, you know, seem to make--to be better, in other words, because it was geared to three through six years old, but children of all ages watch.  I even had adults tell me how they enjoyed the show, too (laughter).
Speaker 1: Like 'Mister Rogers' ['Mister Rogers' Neighborhood']--you know a lot of adults--I know when I went to college, people watched 'Sesame Street.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Sure.
Speaker 1: College students liked it.
Speaker 2: I used to find out--we'd find out sometimes 'Sesame Street' and 'The Magic Door' were doing similar things, and we were on--overlapping, you know, so it wasn't like we looked to see what they were doing.  It's just that same kind of thought, you know, about what you'd do, what kinds of things would educate children in an entertaining fashion, what could you do to make whatever it was palatable, entertaining, and fun.
Speaker 1: Now, this 'Magic Door,' you know, has a short lifespan--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but for about four or five--was it four years?
Speaker 2: Just about.  Three and a half to four years.
Speaker 1: Three and a half years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have any overtures from public television at all about the show?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I did not.  I had--they had their own things going at that time.  There was 'Electric Company' ['The Electric Company'] and 'Sesame Street.'  I guess 'Mister Rogers' was still on the air.  I think I mentioned I got to know Mr. Rogers [Fred Rogers].  In fact, he recommended a consultant for me that he thought I would like, and he thought we would get along very well together.  Unfortunately, that didn't come to pass.  But, I was--I know that some people had approached Channel Seven, WMAL [WMAL-TV; WJLA-TV, Washington, D.C.], wanting to syndicate 'The Magic Door,' because someone in the promotions department told me.  But they did not want to do it, you know.  They--they said no.  And so that did not happen.
Story_ID: 642177
Speaker 1: Now, what was going on in the television industry in these days, because I--all I know is that there was a demise of locally produced children's programming.  It started and it stopped in my hometown.  It stopped in other places, and by, I guess the late '70s [1970s], it almost virtually disappeared.
Speaker 2: I know, they seemed to have really.  When I started ['The Magic Door'], as I said, they had been one there that was, you know, a lot of cartoons.  It was a nice program, but great, many cartoons were in there.  But there were still shows on when I was there.  'Sesame Street,' 'Mister Rogers' ['Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'], 'The Electric Company.' I don't remember if 'Captain Kangaroo' was still on at that point.  I really don't remember, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He was.  He stayed on 'til the '80s [1980s] I think.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, so there were other shows going on when I was there.  And as I said, there was a lot of attention.  The Federal Communications Commission was--a lot of pressure put on them to see that programs for children were better than they had been, you know, more educational and substantive than they had been previously.  I mean, that was my experience.
Story_ID: 642178
Speaker 1: Now, tell us what happened at WMAL [WMAL-TV; WJLA-TV, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: In terms of my time there?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, I think there were a couple of things or so during that time, because there were so few blacks in broadcasting, we had an organization we put together, those of us in Washington [D.C.] who were black in broadcasting, called Blacks in Broadcasting [ph.], and we had a lot of shared concerns and so forth.  And so I think that we were looked upon as subversive in some way, really, by station management.  And I can only remember that, for instance, one of the people at my television station did not join it because, I think she was fearful of how she'd be looked upon, you know, by station management.  And I can remember that it was something that you didn't discuss openly.  We weren't doing anything.  We were simply an organization of black broadcasters.  But it was something new.  We were all new to broadcasting.  I mean, there hadn't been any.  And so that was just something that they looked (unclear) at, you know, a little suspicious of it.  That was happening.  I was a member.  Then--I was putting together mostly the ideas for the program ['The Magic Door'], coming out of an educational background, coming out of, I don't know, a creative family, family in education for generations, being a creative person; and the director was put on as the co-producer of the program, okay.  He was the director, co-producer; and I was the co-producer.  And I was not the producer, which indicated that I couldn't have put it together by myself, okay.  Now, sometimes that person did have something to contribute, yes.  But overall, I was the reason why that show was there and was substantive and was popular.  So I said one time, I think when contract's up for renewal, though were not at that moment, but I knew down the line I said to them, I approached the management and I said, "You know, I really want to go--to get the credit for producing the show to being the producer."  And they told me that wasn't their policy.  They just didn't do it.  And I said, "Okay.  Well, then if you don't think that I'm producing, there are some things only I can do."  I don't remember if I said this specifically to them in this way, but I stopped producing the Spanish segments.  Zap.  And nobody else could fill in.  No one else could do it.  There was nobody else there in that station at that time who was capable of doing it.  And we limped along.  They pulled in somebody who was an educational consultant to come and help put the program together.  And I had these Spanish speaking people calling the station and asking what happened to the Spanish segments, you know (laughter).  So there was this stuff I created, you know, this turmoil there, and you know.  And, of course, they were not happy with me for that.  I felt very strongly about it.  I even had an attorney, a lawyer I knew tell me that everything would be fine if I would just acquiesce and just not make a big issue of this, let it go and I'd continue to be there.  I could not do that.  My conscious.  I just couldn't do it.  I wasn't able to accept it any longer.  I'd been doing it all along, and I just felt it was unfair.  So for that reason, and another being that when the Congressional Black Caucus was holding its hearing on the media, I was, I guess, contacted, and I agreed to go and to testify on my experience and knowledge at that point of the media, you know, blacks in the media.  And I think I had done that probably without even consulting the station management.  I just did it.  And so--I think that was probably frowned upon as well.  Oh, I'm sure it was.  And so, eventually when contract renewal came up, sure enough, just as that attorney had told me, they decided they would let me go.  "Thank you very much, but this is the end."  And so I was terminated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is abruptly too, I mean, then so the public didn't know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't know it was going to happen.  I shouldn't have been surprised I supposed.  But I did not know it was going to happen.  And I really, with that program, would have liked to see it go on to become more than it was even, you know, just--there was so much that could be done.  And as I said, I was on the road to doing some other things, the path, but didn't get to do them.
Story_ID: 642179
Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Ma'am, can you please give us your full name and spell it for us again?
Speaker 2: Sheila is my first name.  S-H-E-I-L-A, Gregory, G-R-E-G-O-R-Y, Thomas, T-H-O-M-A-S [HistoryMaker Sheila Gregory Thomas].
Speaker 1: And, ma'am, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Eleven, eleven, nineteen thirty-eight [November 11, 1938], in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: My title right now is vice president of Diversified Environmental, Inc. [Washington, D.C.], and I am a writer and editor there, an all 'round person in many respects.  It's a company that my son [Marion Curtis Thomas, Jr.] owns, and I helped him establish it a number of years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is October the 26th, 19--2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in Silver Spring, Maryland, 914 Silver Spring Avenue, in the offices of Diversified Engineering [Diversified Engineering, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And we are completing an interview that we began, I think, on Tuesday--I think, Tuesday or Wednesday; well, earlier this week in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So before we go into the outline, there are some corrections I think that we have and some updates that you want to give us.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I made a mistake when I was speaking about my mother's father's father, Hugh Berry Hancock's father, John Hancock.  I said that he grew up in Tennessee, but that was incorrect.  He went to school there, but he grew up in Alabama, and his father, John Allen Hancock, was in Alabama, not Tennessee.   So that is the correct.  I had forgotten.  For some reason or other, I would always get Tennessee and Alabama mixed up when I thought of them, because I know that John Hancock--Hugh Berry Hancock [Hugh Hancock], my grandfather's father, went to school there.  But their home was Alabama.  That was one item.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there was something else.  That was the--when I was speaking of my ancestor Mahammitt [Gregory Thomas' paternal great-great-grandfather, Jeremiah Mahammitt] coming over from Madagascar, and that he saw this beautiful woman, the story goes, in the household of Roger Brooke Taney [Roger B. Taney], I neglected to say--I said that he married her and stayed there.  But he, I found when I went through records and deeds in Frederick, Maryland, I found that he was buying and selling property over a period of time, which was extremely interesting.  He obviously had money.  He paid for this young lady even though it's, I always heard that she was a free person, and indeed in the archives, the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration] in Washington, D.C., I saw in the Taney household, I can't remember the year, that there were a number of free colored females.  And so she was obviously one of them.  But he paid thirteen hundred dollars.  It is said that he sent to his bank in New York [New York] for the money and paid that money to Taney, and he married her, and they lived in Frederick from that time on.  He, as I said, was buying and selling property.  My father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.], I remember, also said that he raised racehorses.  So it's quite an interesting story, an awful lot to it; probably more.  I don't even know.
Speaker 1: So this is a white man buying a black woman from another white man.
Speaker 2: No.  He's not a white man.
Speaker 1: He's not a white man.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Not Mahammitt.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Mahammitt's from Madagascar?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  All right.  There we go.  There we go.  That's it.
Speaker 2: I've heard Madagascar referred to by one of the Malagasy people as an Afro-Asian country.  Afro-Asian island of people.
Speaker 1: That's right.  All right.  Now I've got it, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So that I wanted to make certain I got correct.
Speaker 1: So the question was whether--if they were free woman--if she was a free woman, how come he had to pay money?
Speaker 2: I can't imagine.  The only reason I can think of is that perhaps Mahammitt was accustomed to doing this, you know, I mean, in his culture with his people.  I have no idea.  Or maybe this was just an arrangement that Taney insisted upon.  It could have been that.
Speaker 1: It could be because as he said, remember what he said in the Dred Scott decision [Dred Scott v. Sandford, 1857].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That the Negro has no rights that the white man is bound to respect.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: None.  So that's--
Speaker 2: But I thought--I was astonished when I saw that there were several females who were free living in his household.  I was really astonished at that, 'cause I found it after I don't know how many months and years of going through records, and then one moment there that was.  I had missed it before.
Story_ID: 642180
Speaker 1: Another possibility there too is kind of, maybe far out, but usually a colored person is foll- followed in the condition of their parents.  I mean if your mother was--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --enslaved and you were enslaved, if your mother was free, you were free.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I know.  I've heard that.
Speaker 1: So.  I mean, I don't know.  That might be worth exploring, too.
Speaker 2: But then her mother would not have been--had that rule been the case there, since she was not a slave.
Speaker 1: Right.  I mean that sort of possibility that her mother might have been white.  I mean, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I don't know either.
Speaker 1: That's an odd kind of possibility, but--
Speaker 2: I just always thought, and other members of my family thought, it was interesting, curious, you know, that she was free, because that's what the story was, that she was free.  But like other things that I found later on based on their oral history, it was true.  There were these three women living there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  There are some things like Benjamin Banneker's mother [Mary Bannaky] was actually white.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I didn't remember it any way.
Speaker 1: That's why he wasn't a slave in the situation he was in.  Maybe that's one of the reasons.  But, yeah, I'd say every now and then you'll see that.  I mean, you don't see it much, but--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, at any rate.  Well, there's something else too, right?
Speaker 2: No.  There wasn't anything going back, what we were discussing before I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure that was it.
Story_ID: 642181
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, we were talking the end of 'The Magic Door,' the television show.  And we were talking about the reasons, you say, you kind of stuck your neck out on an issue of principle and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I was telling you that I had gone to testify before the Black Caucus [Congressional Black Caucus] hearings on the media, and do you know after the fact I realized that I was the only still employed person who testified (laughter).  I hadn't been aware of that until afterwards.  And I looked back to see who the others were who had, and I said, "Good gosh, I was the only one who was working."  You know.  That was quite something to discover.
Speaker 1: Well, it showed some courage.  Showed some courage (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, it did take that.  One thing I didn't mention that, while I was there at the station, at WMAL [WMAL-TV; WJLA-TV, Washington, D.C.], and with 'The Magic Door' I did some other things as well.  I was instrumental in getting one of the newsmen interested in a story about the Spanish speaking community in Washington [D.C.], 'cause it was really growing.  And a man came in, I can't remember if he called me ahead of time or if he asked for me when he came in or if someone just called me to say that maybe I would be able to help the gentlemen, but he had been a broadcaster in his country.  I think it was from South America, and he was looking for a position and was hoping for an interview with someone at the station.  So I took his paperwork, his application or his resume in to the program manager.  And he just showed such complete disinterest that I felt awful.  And when I walked out of there and was on my way back to my office, this newsman saw me and he said, "Sheila [HistoryMaker Sheila Gregory Thomas], what's the matter?  Is something wrong?"  And then I went on to tell him how distressed I was and disturbed by the fact that no interest or consideration was being given at all to this man.  You know, obviously, there wouldn't be any given then.  So we talked, and he decided based on what I was saying that he would like to put together a documentary.  And so it came to be, and it was called 'Spanish Spoken Here.' It was excellent, and I did the translations from Spanish into English, and I also did the voiceover simultaneously for the Spanish that was spoken on the program.  And I felt very, very good about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's--how long was it before the station did anything similar again?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have no idea really, not involving the Spanish speaking community.  Not at that time.
Story_ID: 642182
Speaker 1: So, well, this happened abruptly from what I understand, you leaving 'The Magic Door.'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you didn't really plan for an exit, or?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  I was not aware that it was going to happen at that time.  I had no prior warning that it would take place, that they would dismiss me, as it was called in the newspaper article.  It was--I was taken by surprise definitely.
Speaker 1: Now from what--the notes that we have here, you were replaced by another black woman.
Speaker 2: Yes, of course.
Speaker 1: And the incident reinforced the image of WMAL's [WMAL-TV; WJLA-TV, Washington, D.C.] bad reputation in the black community and minority community.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's what I heard.
Speaker 1: And at one point, the license of the station was in jeopardy, you know, by the FCC [Federal Communications Commission].
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm aware.  I heard that.  Yes.  Well, my program was very heavy duty into their community relations.  I found out whatever their records with the federal communications were buoyed by my program, by me in that program.
Speaker 1: Did they ever reach out to bring you back?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  No.  They never did.
Speaker 1: And did the show--did you ever watch the show afterwards?
Speaker 2: I did maybe a couple of times.  Just a couple of times, but no more than that; if a couple of times, maybe once.  But I couldn't do that very easily.
Speaker 1: How were they doing?
Speaker 2: It was okay.  It was similar, but it wasn't quite the same.  Didn't last very long, maybe a year, maybe two years; I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was definitely an effort to soothe the feelings of people who were upset because I was no longer there by putting in another black woman in there; you know, it was supposed to do the trick.
Story_ID: 642183
Speaker 1: So.  Now, what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Well, I felt a little bit of relief also in that I didn't have to get up so early in the mornings anymore, and I was able to do more with my children [Marion Curtis Thomas, Jr. and Joel Thomas] at times that I would normally not have been able to.  And just felt a little--some freedom.  And I'd started out to do some independent consulting, but then I got a call from [HistoryMaker] Sterling Tucker at the D.C. city council [Council of the District of Columbia].  He was the vice chairman, and he asked me if I would--if I'd be interested in coming to work for him.  And I did go there, and I was his media coordinator and community relations as well.  And during that time, I went out and conducted some interviews in the Spanish speaking community because--I can't remember whether it was Sterling's idea or mine, but again, the Spanish speaking community in Washington [D.C.] had grown so, and we decided--I decided, he decided, we decided that it would be a good thing to have a compendium of information available to the community that would give information about certain services in the city available to them, and there was nothing like that up until that time.  Also, there was someone at the Urban League [Greater Washington Urban League, Washington, D.C.], Sterling Tucker was also still involved.  Maybe he was still head of the Urban League, I can't remember, in D.C., but he certainly had a connection there.  And there was a guy named Frank Fuentes [ph.], he was Puerto Rican, was working there.  And Frank and I collaborated on putting together a compendium of information that would give information to Spanish speaking people bilingually.  It would be in English and Spanish about services in Washington.  And what we did was we decided that we would have people call certain of these utilities and ask in Spanish a question.  And if they couldn't get a response back, if it was no one who could handle it, then we noted that in this book or else we just didn't include them at all.  But I remember getting a lot of calls and communications after the book was published from government agencies who wanted copies of it.  It was really meant for the D.C.'s Spanish speaking community.  It was for their benefit.  But I went around and interviewed people.  That was what I did to ask them about their business as a Spanish speaking community who were included in the book.  But it was well done, very well received.  And WTOP Radio [Washington, D.C.] and television [WTOP-TV; WUSA-TV, Washington, D.C.] did a--what do you call it--they highlighted it one day or evening, saying that it was something that had been really very much needed and they praised it.  So it was a good project, well received.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So this is in the--now, we're in the--around 1975, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: About 1974, '75 [1975], yeah; right within that period.
Story_ID: 642184
Speaker 1: So in '76 [1976] is the note I have, you began working as a public information specialist in the Bicentennial Office at the National Park Service.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Someone I met, who was with the National Park Service, said that they needed someone like me in there to take a look at the programs in the national parks, to see how minorities were represented, to look at how--review how minorities were represented, and that there was a lot coming up during the bicentennial year, and they wanted to be certain that everything was done appropriately.  So I first wasn't sure if I wanted to start working there.  I've never worked for the government before, really, federal government.  And I--my concern was always about being able to have some creativity in my work, and I didn't know that that would be possible there.  But I found out that it was eventually.  And, as I said, I did go and start there with the National Park Service as a public information specialist.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is--did you--were there any revelations that you--I mean, what was revealed to you by being involved with national parks as it concerned African Americans?
Speaker 2: Well, there were very few, and any positions that were meaningful there in the parks service, except the EEO [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] officers, people in the EEO office, in the Bicentennial Office, there was an African American secretary and then myself.  So that was immediately apparent.  Also, I can't say that there was an awful lot of interest on the part of most people I came in contact with, with doing anything, making any changes in what they already had going on.  In fact, a man who also was in that office said to me one day from behind his newspaper that minorities are very alone on the totem pole, which I was shocked to hear said, you know, to me.  And I think, I'm not sure if it was when I was still a public information specialist or when they created another position for me, that I got to take a look a film they were putting together.  They said that it was just the beginning stages, and they were inviting people to come out and review and look at it.  And they asked me to be one of those persons to come to Harpers Ferry [West Virginia] to take a look at this film about minorities.  And I had a couple of questions about it, a couple criticisms about it, but they were disregarded.  I think I was told that it was really over and done with, but the impression had been in the beginning that there would be an opportunity to make comments, and therefore, to maybe impact some changes.
Speaker 1: So were you the only African American person in a position to even criticize what was going on?
Speaker 2: Yeah, except for anyone in the EEO office, if they ever had an opportunity to do so.  But, no, there was not--I was it in the Bicentennial Office--in the national office, the headquarters.
Speaker 1: So you were there--the bicentennial that year was 1976, so were you just there for that year or?
Speaker 2: No.  I stayed on.  They asked me to stay with--on as a public information specialist permanently.  But I didn't want to be a public information specialist because I didn't see that there was any creativity involved with that.  So they did create a position for me, and that was the position of cultural education specialist.  And in that capacity, I was able to get out to some of the parks and see what they were doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And I also was able to become quite involved in a program at Harpers Ferry national park [Harpers Ferry National Historical Park] called Heritage Days: The Black Perspective, and it was a program that the Association for the Study of African American Life and History had proposed to the park service, and the park service agreed to do it.  And it brought speakers in and performers and all kinds of people.  It was beautiful.  Very, very well done over a period of three or four days.
Story_ID: 642185
Speaker 1: And what were the speakers--were they thematically speaking about the presence of African Americans in historical times around the Harpers Ferry [West Virginia] area?
Speaker 2: Some of it, you know.  It was just on all--various kinds of topics.  And very honestly, it was so long now, I can't even remember the details of it, except that it was excellent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were these authors of books primarily?
Speaker 2: Some, yes.  Some.  Some people--some were people in broadcasting--put together a panel and I really wish I could tell you more about it, but I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, now, you were--now, I don't want to skip ahead too fast, but you continued to become an independent writer and consultant, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In a period of time.  And in '84 [1984], you wrote an article about one of your ancestors, Margaret Mahammitt [Margaret Mahammitt Hagan] of Maryland.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  A woman who had been with the Association for the Study of African American Life and History for years, Ms. Miles [Willie Leanna Miles] called me one day and asked me if there was something I could contribute to a black history publication coming out for Black History Month, and could I write about one of my ancestors.  And so I decided to write about this woman that I greatly admired and found intriguing.  In my background, she was my great-grandmother, my father's grandmother, Margaret Mahammitt.  And the name of the article--the title of the article was 'Margaret Mahammitt of Maryland.' She was born in Frederick, Maryland, in a section of Frederick called Jerusalem at that time and grew up there and was quite a character; remarkable, remarkable woman.  And I heard my father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] speak of her so often.  So I did write that article about her, her life, what she did, what she had accomplished.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this was published by the Association for the Study of African American Life and History?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The Associated Publishers [Associated Publishers, Inc.] was their publishing arm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was that in the Negro History Bulletin [Black History Bulletin]?
Speaker 2: That wasn't in the Negro History Bulletin.
Speaker 1: The Journal of Negro History [The Journal of African American History]?
Speaker 2: No.  In other words, this was a publication that they put together especially for Black History Month that year.
Speaker 1: So it was an anthology of articles (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  It had several articles in there by other people as well about family, really--the importance of family.
Story_ID: 642186
Speaker 1: Now this is, I don't know what happened--if anything happened before this you want to talk about, but in '87 [1987] you actually played a role in a movie called 'Jaws: The Revenge,' right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes (laughter).  That was fun, yeah.  I was up on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] and they were holding auditions for parts in 'Jaws: The Revenge,' and so I went in and auditioned and I got a part as an extra.  It was freezing cold, and we did a lot of the shooting out on the dock, you know, by the water, and there was this fake shark out there in the water (laughter).  It was really quite, quite entertaining.  It was fun.  I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: And so they used the, the Vineyard as a stand in for the fictional town of Amity [Amity Island], I think it was--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  They changed the storefronts of it, you know, the names of the stores.  And then later on they went down to the Bahamas to do the rest of it.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to be in that part (laughter).
Speaker 1: You didn't get a speaking role that required you to be in the Bahamas (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I didn't get to the Bahamas.
Story_ID: 642187
Speaker 1: Upon returning to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] from Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts]--now, did you do public relations work at Martha's Vineyard during the time that you were there?
Speaker 2: No.  When I was there, I did teach a class in Spanish at the Nathan Mayhew Seminars there [Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts], and I also put together a special evening bringing in people in the community who were Spanish speaking for a special evening--I can't remember the program, it was very, very nice--just to try to integrate them into what was going on outside of what else they were doing, and to give some interaction between them and some of the other people in the community.  So I can't remember what the name of that evening was, but I enjoyed putting it together.  It was a special event.  And that was done for the Nathan Mayhew Seminars also, it was held there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now does your family have a history of going to Martha's Vineyard over time?
Speaker 2: No.  Not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  We were happily ensconced in Atlantic City [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.  It was just a resort type place?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So how was it that you, you know, ended up in Martha's Vineyard for the--was it just a vacation?
Speaker 2: Actually, I'd been there before for vacation, but I ended up going there to live because I had a friend who lived there, and I was invited to come up and stay there, and I did.  I went up and stayed there for about two years, two and a half years.  I enjoyed it.  It really reminded me very much of home.  Atlantic City.  It was prettier than Atlantic City and more inaccessible than Atlantic City.  Atlantic City is an island.  It's on Assateague [sic.], an island, and a lot of people don't realize it 'cause you can get there so easily across bridges, but it's an island.  And so, Martha's Vineyard was to me very much like being at home.  It had what I loved about Atlantic City, which was being by the ocean [Atlantic Ocean].  I really enjoyed it.  I liked it very much, and I liked the quiet of it in the wintertime.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay. Okay.  So what brought you back to the states?
Speaker 2: To D.C.  It was just time to come back.  It really was.  And my sons [Marion Curtis Thomas, Jr. and Joel Thomas] were here and they were with their father [Marion Curtis Thomas, Sr.]; and I needed to get back and do some things with and for them.
Story_ID: 642188
Speaker 1: Now you interviewed [HistoryMaker] June Cross for a production entitled the "Secret Daughter" for PBS' [Public Broadcasting Service] 'Frontline.'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'd known June since she was a little girl, because she came to Atlantic City [New Jersey] to live with a very, very close friend of my family.  And so I knew her from the time she was maybe about four years old on up.  And I was present at part of the program that they were putting together.  I can't even remember how I happen to be there, but the director or producer, one of them, said to me that there was something they were trying to draw out of June and they weren't able to get her to say it or express it, and would I take over and interview her for a segment and see if I could manage to make her express herself more about the subject that they were hoping to have her talk about more.  So I did.  So it was like I was supposed to go out--in there loaded for bears, you know, and I really felt, you know, a little unhappy about having to almost be on the attack a bit with her, but it did get her to say a little more than she had previously.
Speaker 1: Now, can you kind of recap what the story is, what the issue was in the June Cross story?
Speaker 2: With June?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  June was the child of a white mother [Norma Storch] and a black father [James Cross] who was an entertainer.  And they would come to Atlantic City in the summers when he was appearing there locally.  And they rented a ground apartment, ground apartment from this friend of my family.
Speaker 1: Now this is significant, because a white woman was with a black man.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They couldn't stay in the hotels in Atlantic City, right?
Speaker 2: Probably not.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I would guess, you know.  And for a long time anyway, blacks when they came to Atlantic City, couldn't stay in the hotels anyway.  They had to stay in guesthouses or people in the community were good enough to rent rooms to them.  But they--the hotels just were not places where blacks stayed for a long, long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wanted to make that point before we moved on.
Speaker 2: Sure.  And that may have been true at that time too with June's parents.  But at some point, the couple were separating, and the mother asked Peggy [Peggy Bush], our friend, if she would consent to keep June and to raise her.  And so she agreed to do it.  Peggy didn't have any children of her own.  And she--
Speaker 1: Well, this is Peggy?
Speaker 2: Bush.
Speaker 1: Bush.  Right.
Speaker 2: So she decided to do that.  And so she had June all the way through her growing up years into college and out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And June did visit her mother and her stepfather [Jack May] periodically.  She spent time with them, but her home was really in Atlantic City.
Story_ID: 642189
Speaker 1: So the 'Secret Daughter' won an Emmy Award in 1997, and was honored that same year with a DuPont-Columbia Award for excellence in broadcast and journalism [Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award].
Speaker 2: And it was called "Secret Daughter" because June [HistoryMaker June Cross] really felt like a secret in that she was living with Peggy [Peggy Bush] in Atlantic City [New Jersey], and when she went to visit her mother [Norma Storch] and her stepfather [Jack May] out in California, she wasn't really acknowledged as her mother, Norma's daughter.
Speaker 1: Right.  So that's the pain of the story.  And that's the issue that they had to resolve?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did they ever resolve it in the story?
Speaker 2: She and her mother in actual life?  Well, they were close.  I mean, they were never not close.  I don't think.  And she did, yes, get to talk about that with her mother.  And don't ask me to remember (laughter) exactly what they said, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was there.  It was part of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The opportunity she had to talk to her mother on camera.
Speaker 1: Now, during this period too, but you were pivotal in that story, you know, getting to the core of the matter, because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was asked to try to get her to talk about her mother more, to be more--to see if she could be a little more realistic, perhaps, about what that relationship had been, because it truly was difficult, had to be.  But she was--they felt she was glossing over it, the separation from her mother.
Speaker 1: And Ms. Cross has written a book about the same situation.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And this is why 'Frontline' did that documentary, because of the book ['Secret Daughter: A Mixed Race Daughter and the Mother Who Gave Her Away,' June Cross].
Story_ID: 642190
Speaker 1: In 1996--now, during this same era, you're working on 'Frontline,' you were also helping your oldest son establish his business [Diversified Environmental, Inc., Washington, D.C.].  This is Curt [Marion Curtis Thomas, Jr.], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Curt.  My son Curt.  Yeah.  He had been working in his father's office.  His father's an architect, and Curt was working in his office, and he just decided that he wanted to do something on his own.  And so he felt very strong about it.  I decided that I would help him establish this business, so I helped him get it off the ground, and I stuck with him and with it and have up until this time.  Though sometimes I haven't been there on an ongoing basis.  I have pulled back for a little bit sometimes up until maybe about a couple of months ago.  I was going in about two, two and a half days a week still.  And more recently, because they needed some additional help in some areas that I could contribute to, I've been going in every day again.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And is your major contribution in writing proposals or something like that or what?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's what I would imagine.  And his business does what exactly?
Speaker 2: He's an environmental contractor, and that means that he sends technicians out to remove asbestos, mold, lead based paint, PCBs [polychlorinated biphenyl], hazardous materials from all kinds of buildings and structures; private residences, government buildings.  He has a contract with the U.S. Department of State, and the business has been contracted to go overseas to many, many countries; all over the world.
Speaker 1: And in the meantime, you've written, like, two--in addition to working for your son, you also work for your former husband [Marion Curtis Thomas, Sr.] too, right?  You're a vice president (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that was what I did as soon as I got back from Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  He had--my ex-husband had a program in the D.C. schools [District of Columbia Public Schools], I think even outside of D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. He may have had one in Baltimore [Maryland].  But he had schools that he would give awards to, give awards to students who excelled in science.  And so he needed a brochure created for the program, and he asked me if I would come to the office and design a brochure.  So I did, and then he asked me if I'd stay on and help with the marketing and public relations, and so I did that.  And that's when, at a certain point my son, who was also working there, wanted to go and launch his own business and I went with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you also, you wrote--now, you've done this ongoing, I guess, since the '90s [1990s] right, you've helped your family businesses.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my son.  Yeah, with my son I have.  Yes.
Story_ID: 642191
Speaker 1: And, but you also wrote--had time to write--to do genealogical research, and to write three biographies that were published by the 'African American National Biography' project.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I was trying to think about how I found out about that, whether I was contacted or whether I found out about the 'African American National Biography' project. I think I found out about it, and I called their offices and I said that I would like to do--to write a biography of my father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.].  And they said that, yes, he was on their list actually.  And so I was contracted to write a biography about my father, and then I suggested also that I would like to write a biography about his father, my great-grandfather [sic. grandfather], James Monroe Gregory.  And they agreed to that.  Then they suggested my mother's father, Hugh Berry Hancock [Hugh Hancock] of Texas.  And so they agreed to have me do that.  So I ended up writing three biographies for that project.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And before that, I'd written a biography of my father that I'd coauthored with a person who really had started to do--write her thesis on my father, Kyleelise Holmes [Kyleelise Holmes Thomas] was her name.  And because she had done so much work on my dad with respect to his involvement in theater, I decided that I would invite her to work with me on this biography, which was for the D.C. Public Library's [District of Columbia Public Library] website called The Black Renaissance in Washington, D.C. [The Black Renaissance in Washington, D.C., 1920-1930s] And so, that was the very first one that I wrote about my father for.  And then the 'African American National Biography' project came afterwards.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What projects are you currently working on or what big project are you planning on?
Speaker 2: Well, my big project, which is always there in the wings, is to write a book about my family (laughter).  And I have done bits and pieces in spurts, very sporadically throughout the years, and I haven't really brought it to a culmination, you know, at all.  But something I'd been wanting to do and it really needs to be done because of the fascinating history on both sides of--I think one thing that has been difficult for me is there's so much of it.  It's, I guess, you've been able to tell just from talking to me in this interview.  There is so much and just how to tie it all together, if I had a lot more time--had had a lot more time, and if I had a lot more time, even at present to spend on it, then I think it wouldn't be so daunting.  But it's that I've had to do it in spurts because of other obligations, other commitments, working, that I haven't been able to make the progress with that, that I would like to.
Story_ID: 642192
Speaker 1: Is there a one core lesson that comes through your family history; or one core thing that, you know, I guess, makes your family successful?
Speaker 2: I've often been asked that, you know.  What is it about the Gregory family.  And I must say, they've been like--just let me say this.  My brother Hugh [Hugh Gregory] was the first black valedictorian of Atlantic City High School [Atlantic City, New Jersey].  And my brother Gene [Eugene Gregory] was the editor of a newsletter, a newspaper, the student newspaper there; I guess it was a newspaper or magazine.  There were all these firsts.  My father [Thomas Gregory, Sr.] and his history, all of the things that he accomplished.  My cousin Fred Gregory [HistoryMaker Colonel Frederick Drew Gregory], who was the first commander, I think, of the space flight and first--what else besides first commander?  First pilot, I believe, of a space craft.  They've been so many.
Speaker 1: I think he was the second African American to walk in space.
Speaker 2: Maybe. I know there was someone before him also.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Guion Bluford, I think was the first--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --but I think Fred Gregory was the second.
Speaker 2: So there have just been so many members of the family who have accomplished so many interesting things, and some of them where they've been the first African American to do whatever that was.  I don't know what it is except it's just a legacy of excellence, of pride in what you do, and working to the best of your ability, and having some talent and intelligence along with it, and just the spirit to make things better.  My family has always enjoyed life.  I started to say loved, and I guess loved part of it.  Helping, you know making contributions, being able to help other people.  I enjoy doing that as a teacher and also with my program 'The Magic Door,' and with the Spanish speaking community when it was new, being able to do things that made a difference there in a small way.  It's been true throughout our family, and I don't know what else to say about it.  But there's a lot of pride in previous accomplishments, a lot of pride in the family history, and I guess to keep it going.  And it just seems like a natural thing to do.  It's nothing that people--my family sit around and discuss, you know, what can we do next.  But it's just that we end up doing things that are meaningful, and I guess it's because of the legacy there.
Speaker 1: So you have a pattern set over time and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the continuity of associations of time.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And things that just seem normal to us, natural to do, not caught up in materialism and trying to be important, or outdo someone.  It's just a matter of being ourselves and being the best we can be as ourselves and having a lot to offer.
Story_ID: 642193
Speaker 1: Now, if you look back over everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  That's always a good question.  The thing is that, there were some things that I might have liked to do, but had I done so, perhaps it might not have been the best choice.  So I think things have worked out for me the way that they needed to.  I really do.
Story_ID: 642194
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: When I was in high school [Atlantic City High School, Atlantic City, New Jersey], we were asked to give a statement for the yearbook, what our life ambition was.  And I woke one morning, 'cause I struggled with that and I struggled with that, and I couldn't think, what's my life ambition?  And it came to me like this (snaps fingers), and it was to see the awakening of a sleeping multitude.  And so to see the awakening of a sleeping multitude to me, at that point, meant that there're so many of us who haven't had opportunities, haven't seen opportunities, haven't been able to take advantage of opportunities and who need to wake up to these things that are out here and find a way to just change their lives.  And so now, that's happened a great deal.  You know, it's been happening, and so at this point, I think it's a matter of trying to still help those who are in such need.  I mean there's money being spent for frivolous things all the time, and it would just bring lots of money, and it would just be so fantastic if people would find a way to get together and really educate little kids who are growing up without their parents and help them to find--well, my son [Joel Thomas], my younger son is actually working with a non-profit organization which is doing that, helping--well, helping students who are already in college to learn more about the working world and to get internships in corporations where they can learn about what's really going on in the professional world.  So I don't know if that makes sense, if it's clear or if it's clear enough, but just that, to see education just more--playing more of a role or being more accessible.  I think that's it.  And it just isn't even that.  It's that the parents or the people who are the caretakers of these children just need help themselves and knowing even what to do to make it possible.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Does that--is that clear at all, 'cause I feel like I'm sort of rambling through it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you're saying that we've got to get everybody involved in this project--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the parents and the teachers and everyone else?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's--what is it?  It takes a village.  It does.
Story_ID: 642195
Speaker 1: Did you have any reflections on the struggles of the District of Columbia's public schools to right itself?  There's a long history of superintendents and projects and people.  Everybody was--they were excited about Barbara Sizemore [HistoryMaker Barbara A. Sizemore].  They were excited about [HistoryMaker] Ruth Love.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Michelle Rhee.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: You know, who's--over the years, do you have any ideas about it?  Any thoughts?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I can speak to that at all.  I know that when I was in the schools, and we talked about that, I was disappointed, you know, quite a bit by circumstances, situations in certain of the schools, and I felt that there were a lot of teachers who were there just marking time, who really didn't have the best interest of the students at heart in any profound way.  And other than that, as I said, I don't think I can speak to it.  I have not been involved with the D.C. Public Schools [District of Columbia Public Schools] at all in a long, long time.  And, of course, just like everyone else, I'm an observer to an extent and a bystander.  And I don't think I can say anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It seems to--it seems that they're making some strides now.  I read in the newspapers that there seem to be some improvements with the students in how they're performing.
Story_ID: 642196
Speaker 1: Over the years, have you--have any thoughts about children's television?  I know there's hardly any on the networks anymore.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have had.  I have had.  I, for instance, always thought it was so important and I still do, for children to be able to relate to people, to human beings instead to these animated characters.  And there're so many animated shows.  There're some that are cute.  They're captivating.  They grab the children's interest, and they're fun and so forth.  But it's just that I think 'Mister Rogers' was a wonderful, wonderful program.  'Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.'  And I think 'Sesame Street' is.  I don't know what happened to 'The Electric Company.'  It's not still on.  But I think there just need to be programs where children can see other people and learn like that, and not from these quick little artificial images, you know.
Speaker 1: Seems there's a philosophy that you have to have a--some sort of an avatar human being or in the form of a cartoon character in order for kids to relate to it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Instead of actual people.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: You know, you're right, 'cause all of them, everything from 'Arthur' to Muppets to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, I don't--
Speaker 2: And they're just glued to the sets, you know, to the television sets and watching these things over and over and over and over again.  And I don't think that's very good.  I don't think it's very healthy.  It certainly isn't very creative programming.  It's easy.  It's easy for the networks.  It's easy for the stations.  They don't have to pay anybody.  They just buy these shows and they put them on the air.  And they don't have to pay a person like myself or a Mr. Rogers [Fred Rogers] or someone else to do it.  They don't have to pay a producer, they don't have to pay a director, they don't have to have a staff.  It's easy.  It's easy for them.
Story_ID: 642197
Speaker 1: Well, looking back over your career, again, what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: Today would be my professional legacy.  I was saying to my son [Joel Thomas] yesterday, my younger son called me yesterday evening, that I think being able to have this interview with you is a legacy, but not a professional legacy. It's a legacy for my children, my grandchildren, any others to come, the rest of my family members, because it allowed me to talk about our family history, and that to me is important.  As I said, I've been wanting to write about it, and I haven't managed to do it except in these biographies.  But professionally, again, it would be the writing that I've been able to do about my family; and my family and writing about my family, I think, and just being able to document all of the things that have come to pass through the time, you know, through the generations, because there have been such remarkable and interesting occurrences and accomplishments.  But that's the most important thing to me.
Story_ID: 642198
Speaker 1: Now, tell us something about your family. I know you mentioned them along the way, but you have how many sons?
Speaker 2: I have two sons.
Speaker 1: Two sons.
Speaker 2: My older son is named for his father [Marion Curtis Thomas, Sr.], but we call him Curt [Marion Curtis Thomas, Jr.], C-U-R-T, from Curtis.  That's his middle name.  And my younger son is Joel.  It's Joel Gregory Thomas [Joel Thomas].  Joel is the younger one, as I said.  Curt has two daughters, he's married, and he has two daughters, Rachel [Rachel Thomas (ph.)] and Monique [Monique Thomas (ph.)].  Rachel is now twelve and Monique is ten.  Joel has--had two little boys for the last few years, but now they've been joined by a little baby sister who's nine months old.  But he has Joel II, Joel Gregory Thomas II [Joel Thomas II], and Javier Gregory Thomas [Javier Thomas (ph.)], yes.  So he has Gregory in his name as well.  And then the baby's name is Iyana.  Iyana Marie Thomas [Iyana Thomas (ph.)].  And so they both live in the area, yeah, the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.
Story_ID: 642199
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything we haven't discussed before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I can't think of anything right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Makes sound) How would I like to be remembered?  As a decent human being.  As someone who has tried always to be a giving person, to contribute something for the betterment of other people in a variety of ways, I think.
Story_ID: 642200
Speaker 1: This is a photo of my mother, Hugh Ella Hancock Gregory and my father, Thomas Montgomery Gregory, Sr. [Thomas Gregory, Sr.]. My mother, by the way, never used Ella.  She didn't like that.  She was Hugh Hancock Gregory.  And my father, again, Thomas Montgomery Gregory, Sr.
Speaker 2: About what year was that?
Speaker 1: That was on the occasion or around the time of their fiftieth wedding anniversary.  They were married in 1918.  So when would that have been?  What year would that have been?  Fifty years after, fifty years hence.
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968]?
Speaker 1: Nineteen--yeah.  Would have been about then.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Definitely.
Speaker 2: Let's start with this one.
Speaker 1: All right.  That is a photo of my father as a young man when he was with the black officers training camp [Fort Des Moines Provisional Army Officer Training School] out in Fort Des Moines in Iowa.  And--
Speaker 2: Why don't you give his name again?
Speaker 1: Thomas Montgomery Gregory, Sr. As I said, it was only--when he was with the Fort--the black officers training camp in Fort Des Moines, Iowa.  And he and my mother had, I think, at that time they were either engaged or just married.  The other photo is of my mother when she was very young at about the time that they were engaged or married, first married.  Hugh Hancock Gregory is her name.
Speaker 2: That's around 1918 or so?
Speaker 1: I guess. I should have said the years; is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: My father's grandmother, Margaret Mahammitt Hagan.  Mahammitt was her maiden name, but she was married twice.  Her second husband was Whiting [Isaac Whiting].  Her last husband was Hagan [George Washington Hagan].  So she was Margaret Hagan in the end, and that picture is a photo of her when she had a business establishment in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.  That would have been in the late 1890s into the early 1900s.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This photo is of Jane [ph.] or Serena, who was the mother of Margaret Mahammitt Hagan.  And she lived in the household of Roger Brooke Taney as a young woman, and that's where Mahammitt [Jeremiah Mahammitt], who came from Madagascar, saw her and ended up marrying her.  We don't know what last name she used, but since she was in the household of Judge Taney--he wasn't then a judge, he was a lawyer--we just referred to her in the family as Jane or Serena Taney.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That is--this is a photo of my father in the middle and his father on the left, James Monroe Gregory; his mother, Fannie Emma Gregory [Fannie Hagan Gregory].  She was the daughter of Margaret Mahammitt Hagen.  And so she was really Fannie Emma Hagan.  And my father, Thomas Montgomery Gregory, Sr. is in the center.  The photo was taken on the grounds of the Bordentown School [Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth] in New Jersey [Bordentown, New Jersey] where James Monroe Gregory was the head or the director for many years.
Speaker 2: Next.
Speaker 1: This is a national--a Texas historical site in Austin, Texas, which happens to be at the home site of my mother's home where my mother, Hugh Hancock as she was then, grew up.  Her father, Hugh Berry Hancock [Hugh Hancock], had this house built, and because of his status in the community at that time, this has been nominated and appointed as a Texas historic site, his home--their home.  That is my mother's father, Hugh Berry Hancock, who was of Austin, Texas, and who owned several businesses there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is the homestead here?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's it.  That is the actual house that my mother was--lived in as a young girl, as a child, built by her father; the house that her father, Hugh Berry Hancock, had built for his family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is three or four generations of my mother's family.  My mother's sister, Nettie; Nettie Hancock [Nettie Hancock Washington], who married Booker T. Washington, Jr., is on the left there with the white collar.  Next to her in the center is her mother, Susie James Hancock, the wife of Hugh Berry Hancock.  And on the other side is my own mother, Hugh Hancock.  Seated in the center is Susie's mother, Martha, Martha James [ph.]; and on her left is Booker T. Washington, III.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This one has curled up so much.
Speaker 1: Oh, oh.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: He has to shoot it fast (laughter).
Speaker 1: That photo is of my brother, one of my brothers.  That's Hugh Hancock Gregory [Hugh Gregory], and he's the one I've referred to as having quite a strong personality.  He was quite a captivating person.
