Speaker 1: If you will, Ms. Lett Simmons [HistoryMaker Barbara Lett Simmons], let's begin talking a little bit about your mother, starting with your mother's name and where she grew up as a child and that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: All right, my mother is Jessie Lorraine Proctor Lett.  She was born in Lebanon, Tennessee, in 1888, and she came to Battle Creek, Michigan, as a child about four or five, and went to school at the Seventh-day Adventist academy.  She and her mother, who was a barber, lived in the home of Elder James [Hannibal] Lewis, whom we called Granddad, but he, both he and his wife were very warm, wonderful Seventh-day Adventist friends of my parents, and always was the grandparent in our minds.  My mother's grandparents, who would have been our, had deceased and the same in terms of my father's [Benjamin Lett] grandparents.
Speaker 1: Did your mother ever talk about what precipitated the move from Tennessee to Michigan?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My grandmother, her mother, had lost her husband, who was a carpenter, and what my mother's study in nursing and a couple of my sisters who were also nurses, come to know the man died of lockjaw, which is tetanus poisoning that we now know, but that, of course didn't exist at that time.  He just stepped on a nail in his carpentry work and his foot swelled up and he died thereafter and the foot never healed, so that's more recent knowledge ascribed to what was the real cause of death.  But, my mother was a little girl, less than five, and so they were perfectly willing to make a move, and of course, Elder Lewis had been in Lebanon, Tennessee, proselytizing for the Seventh-day Adventist church which, as you probably know, is centered historically in Battle Creek, Michigan, and, of course, Mrs. Ellen G. White, the prophetess of the faith, is buried in the same cemetery [Oak Hill Cemetery, Battle Creek, Michigan], probably less than fifty feet from where my mother and father are also buried.
Story_ID: 315191
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Jessie Proctor Lett] ever talk about what life was like as a little girl growing up in Battle Creek [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  As a matter of fact, she lived in a very, very wonderful part of the city, and there were very few people who looked like us in the city, in Battle Creek, and she lived in the west end of town, where Elder [James Hannibal] Lewis lived, of course, and they had to go to a pump, like a community pump, for the water.  The water was not, you know, a faucet in houses in those days and, of course, we're talking about before the turn of the century from the 19th century to the 1900s.  And, that's where she met my father [Benjamin Lett]; you know, the whole family all know the story that dad's mother, our grandmother, used to be very incensed that he would throw the water out and take the pail to go get water when he saw my mother at the pump getting water, and my grandmother had apparently just brought the water in; you know, there was (laughter).  My father didn't talk very much.  He's a very laconic man and even all through our lives he was laconic, but I could see him doing that (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, did your mother ever share any stories with you about, you know, just what daily life was like for her and that kind of thing, and what it was like going to the Seventh-day Adventist school?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did, and what's interesting, it was in great retrospect that I have come to know that my mother lived a very unique and different life than most young, black children of her day and time, and the household in which she lived, was reared in after age four, she lived what would easily be considered by anyone a privileged life.  She went to this special, you know, black people weren't free, weren't welcomed at public schools, and here she was in what is clearly a private church school and because of the status and stature of Pastor James H. Lewis, she was accorded privileges, I'm sure, and treatment that was not usual for a little black girl.  She enjoyed school, was a very good student, did very well, and then later--oh, and her mother was a barber so her mother, she just was not a disadvantaged child, except as America's racism makes all people of color disadvantaged.  Her mother had a barbershop and her second husband, who was named Taylor [ph.], was also a barber and they had what we would today call a contract with the Seventh-day Adventist hospital, which was run by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg in Battle Creek, of course, and that was a huge and unique worldwide known hospital.  Very, very wealthy people went there, but my grandmother and her husband had this contract and they cut the hair of all of the patients at the, well they called it the Battle Creek [Medical Surgical] Sanitarium [Percy Jones General and Convalescent Hospital, Battle Creek, Michigan], but Dr. John Harvey Kellogg had created all of the appropriate foods for the Adventist faith.  The Adventists do have very rigid dietary habits, and we were raised that way, as was my mother.
Story_ID: 315192
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your father, starting with his name, and his background and where he grew up as a child.
Speaker 2: My father is named Benjamin Harrison Lett, also tells you when he was born.  He was born in 1888, at the time of the election of [President] Benjamin Harrison, who was president of the United States.  His mother was, indeed, a Republican, as was Benjamin Harrison.  He was an only child and my mother [Jessie Proctor Lett], likewise, ended up being an only child, but he lived in rural Mecosta County, Michigan, and you know, Michigan, you view it as a thumb, as a hand and a thumb; well, he lived about here in Michigan, and that's called up north from down here in Battle Creek [Michigan], which is the southwestern part of the state, so he was going south to find a wife at age eighteen, because the people all up here were relatives and, while he had limited education, he only went through the seventh grade, he did know that you weren't supposed to marry people who were too close to you as relatives.  So, he went south.  South meant Battle Creek, Michigan, to find a wife and he found my mother there.
Speaker 1: And did he ever talk about what life was like in rural Michigan?  What--did he live on a farm?
Speaker 2: Yup.  They had, they had, well they did lots of cash crops because his mother was a widow and he knew a lot about gardens.  As a matter of fact, we, our family in Battle Creek, he had not only our home, which by the way, he bought before he married my mother.  It was a notion of his and he told it to all of my brothers.  You always get a cage before you get a bird (laughter).  So, I told him, "I'm glad that my husband didn't believe that because I wouldn't want to live in a house he selected.  I would want to live in a house I selected."  But, nevertheless, he did have a home in Battle Creek, but he had seven acres outside of town where he had a garden and every one of us grew up knowing that every Sunday, not Saturday because we were raised Seventh-day Adventists, all day Sunday was spent in that garden working.  You know, getting out the weeds and collecting and getting rid of potato buds and then, of course, at harvest time harvesting that crop and we knew that when we got all loaded up and ready to leave the farm, we knew what we called out to the farm.  It was actually no building.  It was just land.  He was going to stop about four or five places before we got home, because he always shared watermelons, string beans, potatoes, tomatoes, all of the things that he grew, with the widows in the church, because he believed that it was the responsibility of the church in the community to look out for widows and orphans.
Speaker 1: And, perhaps because his mother was a widow as well?
Speaker 2: Right.  That well could be, that well could be.  But because we know distinctly we were going by Sister Buckner's [ph.] house, Sister Singy's [ph.] house, Sister Simmons' [ph.] house, because he had good fruit that he was going to give them.
Story_ID: 315193
Speaker 1: So when your father [Benjamin Lett] headed south to find a wife, did he talk about what kind of work he found and that kind of thing?  How he was able to, you know, save to get his own land and build a house?
Speaker 2: Right.  He certainly did.  He went to Dowagiac, Michigan, which is not terribly far from Battle Creek [Michigan], and was a lumber jack, but my father wasn't a very tall guy.  He was a stocky fellow, but he's only probably about 5'6", and he was strong, very strong.  And he was a lumberjack.  And then he also work at the gas company making coke and we learned about that because, as we grew up, he was in the coal business.  He actually was a contractor to haul coal and coal was the major form of heat in those days, and consequently we know that throughout what was the [Great] Depression in America, my family and father continued to work and feed, at that time, seven children and never, ever had any welfare or any public assistance.
Speaker 1: And did he talk about the process in terms of mining coal and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, he could look at coal and tell whether it was hard or soft coal now, you know, and he could walk in a room and tell you how many tons of coal that room would hold.  Those are skills, I guess, that come from being in the business, but probably my first economics course and lesson I learned from my father.  All of us would, our radio was in what we call the parlor, because there was a parlor and there was a living room and the children were not in the parlor, you know, just to horse around, (laughter) so, but we could listen to our radio programs in there and we listened to what was called 'The Lone Ranger' and Tonto, and the company that advertised for the station for that program was Silvercup bread [Gordon Baking Company], and so we would always say, "Now Daddy, be sure and bring some Silvercup bread, buy us Silvercup bread."  And we just were little ambassadors for the Silvercup bread company.  Our father told us, and I'll never forget.  I never have forgotten. He said, "I will not be buying Silvercup bread.  Silvercup bread is made in Detroit, Michigan.  We live in Battle Creek, Michigan.  Meisner Brothers Bakery [E.C. Meisner Baking Company] is where I buy our bread that your mother [Jessie Proctor Lett] doesn't make, and Meisner's Bakery is here in Battle Creek, Michigan.  Mr. Meisner buys coal from me to heat his bakery and to sell his bread.  He also buys coal from me for his house where his family lives, and so I buy my bread from Mr. Meisner, and he buys coal from me, and I will never be buying Silvercup bread for you, because the Silvercup people don't buy any coal from me.  And that's how you have the shoes on your feet, the clothes on your back, and the food on this table."  It was a very simple economics lesson and I must have been about six, and I had siblings who were, you know, older and younger, but I never forgot that story.
Story_ID: 315194
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestry?
Speaker 2: Actually, we had a very small family, and people always called us the Lett family, and they called us a clan because I, in fact, had twelve sisters, eleven sisters and brothers, there were twelve of us and my mother [Jessie Proctor Lett] and father [Benjamin Lett], and the grandmothers; my father's mother and my mother's mother, but that was really all the family we had, because my mother and father were both only children, so we didn't have aunts and uncles, and we therefore had no cousins except they had some cousins and, you know, Merze Tate, for example, here in Washington, D.C. was at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] until she retired, got her graduate, did her graduate work at [University of] Oxford [Oxford, England], and went to my alma mater, Western Michigan University [Western State Normal School, Kalamazoo, Michigan] now, which at that time was called Western Normal Teachers College [sic.], in Kalamazoo, Michigan, when she was eighteen, but she graduated from Western in 1927, the year I was born. I graduated from Western in 1949, and was vice president of my senior class, and so our family was really small.  We always attended up north in Millbrook [Township, Michigan] and Mecosta County [Michigan], we attended what was called the early settlers picnic [Old Settlers Reunion] every summer.  We looked forward to that.  We loved that, but that was 106 miles from Battle Creek [Michigan], our home, to our grandmother's home, where my father's mother still was living, and every summer we went there and we loved that, and it was old settlers and there were about four or five names, and everybody in that whole aggregation of people, you know, probably three or four hundred or more people, were named, you know, some one of these four names.  They were Cross, Tate, Lett, Phillips [ph.], Green, (laughter) early settlers of Michigan.
Story_ID: 315195
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your grandparents, and why don't we start with your paternal grandmother, your father's [Benjamin Lett] mother, starting with her name.
Speaker 2: Her--my father's mother was Esther Jane Lett Chandler [ph.], and she, she was someone I just admired very much.  She was probably 4'11" maybe.  She weighed about eighty-eight pounds.  She had pure white hair.  All of the time in my life that I knew her, she always had white hair, long white hair, coarse, coarse hair like a horse's tail, but--and weather-beaten because she really did work in the field and outdoors and assumed full responsibility for her household.  She had a cat that ate salmon while she would drink tea and eat toast because she wanted to, not because she couldn't do better.  If she could buy salmon for a cat, she could have bought salmon for herself (laughter), but she was an eccentric person and I admired her because she had, to me, lots of courage called guts.  She didn't ask for anything, and she didn't expect people to, you know, cater to her and she didn't cater to many people either (laughter).
Speaker 1: In what ways was she eccentric?
Speaker 2: Well, I know that she went to the Methodist church and she would go to church, we would go in, we'd sit down, she didn't really fraternize.  The church obviously, now, she's a black woman and not terribly black at that in appearance, but the people were white and she nodded to them, but she did not engage in discourse, and I was aware of the that, but she knew who everyone was and she knew what they were in terms of their human qualities.  They were good or not such good people, and she certainly knew that and she was not at all bashful or reticent about sharing that with us children.
Story_ID: 315196
Speaker 1: Were there any concerns on her behalf, or that she [Simmons' paternal grandmother] may have shared, with her son [Benjamin Lett] marrying a woman [Jessie Proctor Lett] who was a Seventh-day Adventist?
Speaker 2: No.  I'll tell you the, one of her eccentricities is something that, as a sociology major, I have been concerned about all of my life and maybe it was a survival skill.  I'm not sure and I'm not willing to make that as an excuse or statement, but I found that she really did subscribe to [Ellen G.] White is right, and she did things according to her rules in terms of what was appropriate and acceptable to white people, and I remember her saying to me when I was, you know, high school age and could raise questions.  She had always been Republican and I couldn't understand why she would be a Republican, or why she ever was.  She, at that time, wasn't and the reason she wasn't was because my father said, "You should send that old-age pension check back to Mr. Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt].  You are a Republican, you don't believe in Democrats.  Democrats got that for you and you shouldn't have it.  How can you spend the money that Mr. Roosevelt got for you?  And so, she did vote for Mr. Roosevelt at some point in time along the way, but not in '32 [1932].  She also made a statement that I have never forgotten.  She said, "No black person ever did anything for me.  Everything that I've gotten in life, I got by myself or else a white person helped me."  And, I was appalled.  I couldn't believe that, and that's because there were benevolent white people, and I'm perfectly aware of them, and I, myself have a very dear personal friend who is, indeed, a white woman and I just wasn't raised, you know, being one or the other, either or, was never that clear.  People, are who I was aware of, and that you treat human beings and people a certain way, and when we were not accorded that same treatment, we thought that was terrible, but we attributed it to their breeding, not to their race.
Speaker 1: Did your grandmother pass at all?
Speaker 2: Never, never.  She didn't and probably could have.
Story_ID: 315197
Speaker 1: Did she [Simmons' paternal grandmother] ever tell any stories or have any stories of people who did pass?
Speaker 2: She didn't think much of 'em--yes, yes.  She knew people who did pass, and she didn't think that that was right or noble, but on the other hand, I thought that her posture was even more ridiculous, you know?  I mean, how could you ascribe everything right and wonderful and lovely to a group of people who, first of all, created and executed a peculiar system called slavery?  But, you know, and that's interesting because her sister, my grandmother's sister [sic.], Merze Tate, was the mother of Dr.--no, her sister was named Myrtle [Lett Tate], and her daughter was named Merze Tate, who I indicated was here at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] for a number of years, outstanding, brilliant woman.  She was one of the first three women in America, black women that is, to ever receive a doctorate from Harvard University [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and you know, that was, I think, in 1942, something along that line, because as I indicated, she got her bachelor's degree at Western Michigan [University; Western State Normal School, Kalamazoo, Michigan], and she still has a record at Western Michigan, because she got all A's in every single subject for her entire tenure at the college, and she finished in three years instead of four, so that's why her record still stands; because no one's going to beat--you know, most people go to college four years.  They don't even try to do it in three years.
Story_ID: 315198
Speaker 1: What about your maternal grandmother?  What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Elizabeth Taylor [ph.], and she was, you know, almost a contrast to my, to my father's [Benjamin Lett] mother.  My father's mother was, oh, very earthy and proletariat-type person, and my grandmother who was the barber, was a very dainty, very sedate, very fashion-conscious lady, who was personally an exceedingly attractive woman.  She had four husbands.  That kind of tells you that she was (laughter) attractive, and she was very proper, very proper.  You would never hear incorrect English or any vulgarity of the slightest dimension come out of my Grandma Taylor's mouth, and I think one of the things that I just relished about my paternal grandmother was I heard her one day say, "Damn!" And I thought isn't that wonderful?  (Laughter) I thought that was just, just marvelous.
Story_ID: 312363
Speaker 1: Ms. Lett Simmons [HistoryMaker Barbara Lett Simmons], we left off talking about your maternal grandmother [Elizabeth Taylor (ph.)].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is--are there any other stories you'd like to share with us about her?
Speaker 2: Well, I thought that it was unique that my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, my mother's [Jessie Proctor Lett] mother, really knew how to access the system, because my mother had the opportunity to work in that wonderful, unique Dr. John Harvey Kellogg hospital [Battle Creek Medical Surgical Sanatorium; Percy Jones General and Convalescent Hospital, Battle Creek, Michigan], and she learned everything that the nurses learned and knew it well and, see, Battle Creek [Michigan] at that time, had a Battle Creek College [Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Michigan], and it had a very significant nursing program, and those people all did their clinic work at this John Harvey Kellogg's sanitarium, and you do know that John Harvey Kellogg is who created the cereals, that his brother, W.K. [Will Keith Kellogg] got registered in his name, so Dr. John Harvey, who was, in fact, a real medical doctor, could not use the Kellogg name and W.K. had the factory that made the cereal that John created, and his company was called Battle Creek Food [Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company; Kellogg's], and he did, indeed, design the dietary program for the Seventh-day Adventist church.  All the substitute meats made out of soybeans and there was soy burger and metalline [ph.] and prosts [ph.] and roasts and all of those kinds of things that all were made out of glutamates that were not meat.  They were made out of beans and those kind of substances, but the, see my grandmother had this wonderful opportunity for her daughter. And my mother was like a nurse, and black people couldn't even go to nurse's training in Battle Creek or anyplace else, I mean few places in America.  When my sister, Clara [ph.], who is my mother's fourth child, way, fifteen years old than I am, when she finished high school and wanted to become a nurse, there was Homer [G.] Phillips [Hospital] in St. Louis, Missouri, where she could be accepted, Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center] in New York [New York], and Freedmen's Hospital [Howard University Hospital] in Washington, D.C., the only three places in America in 1934, where my sister could go take nurse's training.
Speaker 1: Not even in her home town?
Speaker 2: No place in her state, let alone her home town.  But yet, my mother had access to all of that, not with formal portfolio, but, you know, they can't take knowledge out of your head once it's there.
Story_ID: 312364
Speaker 1: Ms. Lett Simmons [HistoryMaker Barbara Lett Simmons], what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory. For some reason, I think it had, it was on a Sabbath and my sisters and brothers, the older ones, were all dressed up because they were going to Sabbath school and they let me be in the picture, and so, and I was little and I wasn't dressed up because I wasn't going to Sabbath school (laughter) and I have seen that picture and maybe that's why I have the memory, because I didn't, I wasn't happy how I looked there with my beautiful sisters and brothers in their lovely Sabbath school clothes.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about the Seventh-day Adventist faith.  Did you grow up in a true Seventh-day Adventist home, sundown, quiet, and you know, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, we read the Bible every night 'cause we had to study our Sabbath school lesson every day; you know, when you went to church on Sabbath--
Speaker 1: Which was Saturday for Seventh-day Adventists--
Speaker 2: And the first thing you would respond to was whether or not you had studied your lesson daily, which means seven times, and that was done as a family matter.  We read the Bible through as a family and I always liked that.  I liked that being together as a family and, you know, we could do that in the parlor and I liked that, too (laughter).  One of my really, really, really great and wonderful and relished memories is that on Friday night, when the sun went down, everyone had their bath, all of the shoes were lined up.  They had all--that was somebody's job.  Every week you had your own chores and, you know, I had my turn to where I had to polish everybody's shoes, and you know, it looked like a shoe store, all those shoes in a row, but they were all done and that, all that had to be done before the sun went down on Friday evening.  We had loved the Sabbath because it was, you didn't have, you couldn't work on Sabbath either.  Well, that's what our father [Benjamin Lett] used to say.  He said, "These children want to keep Saturday and Sunday, too," (laughter) "so they don't have to do any work," but we did enjoy Saturday night.  When the sun went down Saturday night, my mother [Jessie Proctor Lett] had like a party for us every Saturday night, and that's why we didn't even, it didn't even occur to us that other kids were going to movies and dances and doing other things; because we were fully occupied at our house and my mother would make big hamburger sandwiches for us, and that's about the only time we ever had hamburgers.  We had hamburgers on Saturday night, we had popcorn, we had--she made fudge and sea foam, chocolate fudge and sea foam.
Speaker 1: What's sea foam?
Speaker 2: Sea foam is a candy also, but it's made out of the whipped eggs, the white of eggs, and so it's a very light candy and it's, and it does, it looks like sea foam, the foam of the sea.  As a matter of fact, I sold that candy for my mother to get our church service--church money, because my father had a lot of children he was supporting and take care of and that was the way my mother helped too.  She would make this candy and every Wednesday after school I would then go, I had like regular customers that I sold fudge and sea foam to, five cents a package, they'd be, you know, way bigger than any nickel bars.  You know, those bars you pay ninety-nine cents for now, (laughter) my mother sold for a nickel.  But I always came home with, you know, all, and so the math was correct.
Story_ID: 312365
Speaker 1: Could you give us your siblings' names and their birth order, including yourself?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My oldest sister was Elizabeth [ph.], and Elizabeth was born in 1909; Henry Harrison [ph.] was second, born in 1912; Franklin Thomas [ph.] was third, and he was born in 1914; Clara [ph.] was fourth, born in 1916; and Don, Don Carlton [ph.], the child who died shortly after being born, see my father [Benjamin Lett] had his boys circumcised, and Don bled to death because they did not know that the nurse who bathed him the next morning, the day after he was born, had not seen that the blood, that it was stopped before, after she bathed him and he really bled to death.  There was no such thing then as blood transfusions, and so he was born two years after my sister Clara, '16, [1916], so he was born in 1918, and then my sister Edna [ph.], who is presently my only living sister, she was born in 1920.  She's now eighty-four, and will be eighty-five in January.  Buddy [ph.] was born in '22 [1922].  Buddy, we called him, but his name was Floyd Benjamin [ph.], which is after my father.  His middle name was my father's first name. Charles [ph.].  Buddy was the first one we lost that we knew.  Don [ph.], of course, had died back in 1918, but Buddy died in 1968, and he was only a young man, like about forty-eight years old and, and he, and then my brother Charles followed him and Charles was born in 1925, and I was born in 1927, and so Buddy was three years older than Charles, five years older than myself, and we knew him really well, and Buddy was, Buddy looked different than the rest of us.  He was, he had freckles, red freckles and sandy hair and light brown eyes where the rest of us had very dark eyes.  He looked just exactly like my father except for his hair wasn't black enough, wasn't dark--
Story_ID: 312366
Speaker 1: Was there ever a time when all twelve children lived in the house at one time?
Speaker 2: Never.  No, the four older--I used to treat my four older sisters and brothers like they were company because they just, they just visited us.  They were in college right before I was born.  My sister, Edna [ph.], went to college.  Now, she's just seven years older than I am.  She went to college when I was in the sixth grade [at Franklin School; Post-Franklin School, Battle Creek, Michigan].  I used to write her letters in college and it was just recently, last week, I was in New York visiting her and we were talking about the fact that who knew me, was not any of my sisters and brothers, my husband [Samuel J. Simmons] is who knew me!  'Cause I spent more time, I lived with my husband fifty-three years.  He just passed last year, so, and Edna said, "Well, I know you."  I said, "Ed, I was an eleven-year-old kid when you went away to college.  So, you never knew me, the adult, the woman, the mature person, and now the old lady," (laughter).  And, I don't think we stopped to think about that.  We think because someone is our blood that they know us.  They don't.  They knew who we were when we were ten and eleven years old.
Speaker 1: Let's talk--
Speaker 2: I didn't do the last three children.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  After Chuck [ph.] was me, '27 [1927], and then Jeannie [ph.].  Jeannie was my sister closest to me in age and in our relationship, 'cause I just lost her in '99 [1999] and I still miss her very much.  She, she was a nurse and Clara was a nurse.  Edna was an educator, but Jeannie was, she was born in, I'm three years older and she was born in 1930, and then Raymond [ph.] was born in '32 [1932] and Robert was born in '36 [1936] and his name is Robert Delano Lett, after [President Franklin Delano] Roosevelt, because Franklin Delano Roosevelt was president and I remember he sent my mother [Jessie Proctor Lett] a picture for my brother that, who was named for him.
Story_ID: 312367
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the street that you lived on growing up?
Speaker 2: Sure, 65 Fonda [Avenue, Battle Creek, Michigan], 65 Fonda was the house my father [Benjamin Lett] had bought for five hundred dollars in 1907, '07, that he took my mother [Jessie Proctor Lett] into when they married in '08 [1908].
Speaker 1: And could you spell the name of the street?
Speaker 2: Sure.  F-O-N-D-A.
Speaker 1: Fonda. And, can you kind of describe your community for us a little bit?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Our house was a corner house and so we had a huge yard.  Our yard, I remember my father used to say, sixty-six rods.  I didn't know what a rod was, (laughter) but I remember hearing that.  We had apple trees and pear trees in our yard.  We also had grape arbors, and alongside where the grape arbors were, were my mother's clotheslines and my mother had nine lines, because she washed lots of clothes and my mother always put her clothing together; you know, like only the sheets were here and then the pillow cases, and then would come all of the--our external clothes, you know, like the boys' shirts and pants and stuff and the girls' dresses, and then the underclothes and the socks, and they had a place.  And I thought, I thought that was a given.  I thought everyone hung their clothes out that way.  Only to learn when I got grown and had friends here in Washington [D.C.], they would put up a sock here and a pair of pants here and a shirt there.  I said, "Oh, that isn't the way you hang up clothes," (laughter). I really thought there was order to everything.  I didn't know.
Speaker 1: So did your mother run a very orderly house?
Speaker 2: She did, she did.  Her house was never as messed up as mine gets, and I said it's because she must have had, you know this is, of course, in retrospect.  She must have had tremendous management skills, 'cause she ran that household and things were in order and things were in their place and everything had a place, and we knew that.

Speaker 1: So you were kind of describing your community [in Battle Creek, Michigan] a little bit for us.  So, you all lived in a corner house and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  And our corner house therefore, had the streetlight--was on the corner of these two streets.  On the other side was an empty field and then a factory, but my father [Benjamin Lett] had bought that house long before there was any U.S. Steel [United States Steel Corporation], Byer and Steel Company [ph.].  That came there later.
Speaker 1: That was the factory.
Speaker 2: That was the factory.  And all on the houses on Fonda [Avenue], across the street from us, see our side of the street, ours was really the first house and then there were only four houses down to the end of that block, but across the street were houses.  The Weidemanns [ph.] lived there, and the Bungers [ph.] lived there, and they had heavy German accents, and my mother [Jessie Proctor Lett] could talk just like they did.  It was really a gift, and our neighbors, of course, were all white and we were the only black family in that community, and then later a black family moved on a street one, two streets from us, and they were the Jeffersons [ph.].  We were just delighted.  They had one son, and it was Mrs. Jefferson and her sister, Mary [ph.], and her husband, of course.  So, it was a small family.
Story_ID: 312369
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, there was a pond also behind the houses of those German people.  There was a railroad and there was a pond, and it was the Battle Creek River, that's what it was, and we used to go down there.  We swam down there and we fished down there, and that was right in our neighborhood, our community.  When I hear trains that reminds me 'cause I had heard trains, living where we did, and the most wonderful smell in the world, that's still when I go past bakeries.  My mother [Jessie Proctor Lett] baked bread on Wednesday and Friday, and she made six loaves of bread and always two big pans of rolls, and that odor just permeated the house.  When you came home from school and opened the door, you knew mom had baked, and she baked our desserts all the time, too.  Each one of us had--she knew what each of us liked.  My favorite was elderberry pie.  You can't even find elderberries now a days.
Speaker 1: What are elderberries?
Speaker 2: Elderberries are little tiny round berries, and they come, they're like a bush.  You know how the head of broccoli is--well, elderberries grew that way.  They would be--here would be the stem and then these would just, they were wonderful, and you just did like that and all the berries would come off.
Speaker 1: What did they taste like?
Speaker 2: Better than blueberries, I thought.  (Laughter) And my substitute nowadays is blueberries, for elderberries.  Yeah, and she made elder--she would can the elderberries during the season when they were around and we found them, you know, along the road and in the woods.  That's where we found the elderberries, and mother would make preserves and she canned them so that she could make pies during the winter.
Story_ID: 312370
Speaker 1: What was the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Franklin [Franklin School; Post-Franklin School, Battle Creek, Michigan], Franklin Elementary School, and they did a big article in the Battle Creek Evening Enquirer [Battle Creek Enquirer] newspaper when my brother Robert [Delano Lett (ph.)] finished Franklin School, and they called it the end of an epic, because for thirty-eight years there had been a Lett child in that school, and they had a picture in the paper of my mother [Jessie Proctor Lett] and father [Benjamin Lett] and my baby brother, Robert, who is a man residing in Atlanta, Georgia now.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your teachers at Franklin Elementary School?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes indeed.  The principal was Ms. Martin [ph.], and one of my favorite, my favorite teacher was my sixth grade teacher, Miss Piker [ph.].  I had a second grade teacher who I thought was terribly mean, and her name was Elsie Wheelock [ph.]; I always remembered her name.  I had another mean teacher and her name was Ms. Hutchins [ph.].
Speaker 1: What made them mean?
Speaker 2: Because they didn't want to answer questions; you know, when you ask questions she'd say, "We're not talking about that.  Now just sit down and be quiet, [HistoryMaker] Barbara [Lett Simmons]."  I talked a lot.  (Laughter)  I know I talked a lot as a little kid, because my parents called me Bell Clapper.  That was my nickname.  "Barbara's in there talking like a little bell clapper," (laughter).
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite subjects in elementary school?
Speaker 2: All of 'em.  I loved everything.  I just loved school.  I really loved school, but I was impressed with Miss Vesta [ph.], and this shows when you're a child, while you just don't know.  There were very few black children in that school, so my brother Buddy [Floyd Benjamin Lett (ph.)], who's five years--seven years old than me, had taken me to school that first day, and we're walking down the hall and he's taking--he knows exactly where I go.  I would go to kindergarten, and he was taking me down to Miss Vesta's room, who was the kindergarten teacher, and this other teacher, whom I didn't know, came by, put her hand on my head and said, "Hello, little Lett."  And I said, "Buddy.  They were expecting me."  (Laughter) I was just delighted to think that the school was there waiting for Barbara to come!  Do you see?  That white teacher which saw me, a black girl, with my brother, she didn't have to be any kind of rocket scientist to know that I was a little Lett.  But, I accorded her all kinds of wonderfulness because she knew my name and had spoken to me.
Story_ID: 312371
Speaker 1: Did you think it was odd that you went to school with white children or were you just so removed from what was going on in the rest of the country?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were removed and see, our religion [Seventh-day Adventist] was so circumscribing that it made us further removed, so the community out there, you know, even we didn't know black people in Battle Creek [Michigan], 'cause we didn't live near any black people and the church we, my mother [Jessie Proctor Lett] had us going to, was a very different kind of church.  It wasn't the Baptist church or the Methodist church, so here we are going to this church where there very few.  It's a small, you know, pretty soon enough black people were proselytized to be Adventists, so that we did indeed have our own Berean church [Berean Seventh Day Adventist, Battle Creek, Michigan], but prior to that we went to the Sabbath--we went to the [Battle Creek] Tabernacle [Battle Creek, Michigan], which was the white peoples' church.
Speaker 1: Do you ever recall any incidents of racial tension or were you pretty much accepted?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were accepted.  We were accepted and therefore got a very perverted view of what the world was about and what it was like, and what people were like, and it wasn't, and I remember this so distinctly, when I was in high school [Battle Creek Central High School, Battle Creek, Michigan] my mother went to a church meeting and I don't know I was there, or I happened to be there, and I heard my mother stand up on the floor and say, "We must have our own church.  We must have it because I have watched my children grow up with white children and when they got out of high school, those white children could go to the telephone company and get a job.  They could go to the dime store and get a job.  They could go downtown anyplace and get a job.  My girls and my sons could not get jobs and we have to have employment for all of our children and so if we had a black church, then we would have a black minister," 'cause we had a white minister.  It was a black church with a white minister because there weren't any black Adventist ministers early on and Elder Vidato [ph.], was our pastor of our church.  And then, you know the ministers we got?  They were all foreigners.  There was Rev. Lawrence, I mean we never called him Reverend--Elder Lawrence [ph.], Elder Blanton [ph.], Elder Ford [ph.].  They were from Barbados, Trinidad, Jamaica.  I had never seen a black American Adventist minister until we, I was college age.
Speaker 1: But did you not consider them black?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I thought they were black, but I knew they were different.
Story_ID: 312372
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you in elementary school [Franklin School; Post-Franklin School, Battle Creek, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Very good.  I thought, I had to have all A's, and my father [Benjamin Lett] always, you know, said, you know, "That's your job.  You go to school and I go to work, and your mother [Jessie Proctor Lett] works here at home, and you need to do your job just as well as you can," and so if you brought Bs home, he'd say, "Well, what are you doing with all these Bs?"  I said, "Daddy, I got a good card.  I got, I got nine A's and four Bs."  He said, "Well, whatcha doing getting those Bs?"  He said, "If there are A's, you should get A's. Now if there isn't anything any better, then all right, I'll accept all A's."  But, he really did, and he did that to all of us.  So, when I was in junior high school [Southwestern Junior High School, Battle Creek, Michigan], I had gotten something like eight all-A report cards, and they wrote it up.  There was an article in the newspaper about it, and you know what my father's response to that was?  Kids must be pretty dumb these days; if you can get all A's, then your competition must not be very great.
Speaker 1: How did that make you feel?
Speaker 2: That I always had to keep striving.  That's what that did.  But I can see, in retrospect, that to a lot of people that would have made them say, oh well, heck, nothing's ever good enough, just don't try.  But, somehow his negative psychology worked on us, I don't know why, because everyone wanted to meet dad's approval, we really did, every single one of us.
Story_ID: 312373
Speaker 1: And during the elementary school [Franklin School; Post-Franklin School, Battle Creek, Michigan] years, what type of child were you?  You told us that you talked a lot so you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I did.  And I was very good in athletics, very good.  The guys would choose me before they chose a lot of the other guys when we were choosing teams, and when my brother, Chuck [ph.], was the captain, I was always the very next person he chose, 'cause he knew I was good.
Speaker 1: What sports?
Speaker 2: He knew I could catch, and he knew that I could hit, and the other boys knew it, too.  They knew I was better than they were most of the time.
Speaker 1: So, this was baseball?
Speaker 2: This was baseball, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was it your favorite sport?
Speaker 2: Oh, I love baseball because, well, we had that empty lot right next, right across the street from us, and that's where we were.  My mother [Jessie Proctor Lett] never had to look for us, you know.  She'd look out the window and that's where we were, right over there.  And, we played marbles.  I was a marble champion when I was in, like the fifth grade, and my picture was in the paper and my father [Benjamin Lett] came home and he said, he said, "[HistoryMaker] Barbara [Lett Simmons], do you know what my customers said to me today?  They told me they saw my son's picture in the paper, that he had won the marble championship."  I said, "Well, didn't you tell them it was me?"  He said, "Yes, I told 'em," but he said, "They didn't think that a girl ought to be a marble champion."  And I said, "Well, that's just because I'm good."  (Laughter) No, it really is very interesting what does things to you, and so I always thought anything guys can do, I can do better.
Story_ID: 313590
Speaker 1: --and daddy [Benjamin Lett].  I just, I said, "Man, I would have left him."  (Laughter) And she [Simmons' mother, Jessie Proctor Lett] said, "I love your father."  I said, "I couldn't love him that much," (laughter).
Speaker 2: So, why would you think that about your dad?  That you just couldn't love him as much as your mother did--
Speaker 1: Because she really, she accepted everything.  I argued with my father all the time, and what I didn't realize, being a child, I didn't realize he didn't do that to my sisters.  He didn't do that to anyone but me.  And my mother said it was because I was more like my father than any of the children.  And she said "I think he"--you know, when you see yourself in someone, you know your ugly parts and you don't want them to have that.  So, you're harder on that child, I think.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 313591
Speaker 1: When you were in elementary school [Franklin School; Post-Franklin School, Battle Creek, Michigan], did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: Yep, yep.  My--the scariest dream I ever had was that something happened to my mother [Jessie Proctor Lett], you know, that my mother would be gone, that she died.  That was, I really didn't want anything to ever happen to my mother.  I just knew everything would be all right as long as my mother was around.  She'd solve anything.  She could solve problems.  But the dreams, but what I loved, I used to dream about, I was going to be a medical missionary and go to Africa and Asia and Thailand, all those foreign countries that the [Seventh-day Adventist] church had missions in, and that's what I thought I was going to do and be, and then when I got older I said, I realized there's a lot of missionary work to be done right here, right around here, and then in studying social work I just learned a great deal.  I really--I'll never forget what my father [Benjamin Lett] said.  When he, I came home, it must have been my sophomore year [at Western Michigan College of Education; Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan], and he said tell me about, tell me about what that is you're studying, and I said, "I'm going to be a social worker."  He said, "Tell me what they do."  And I said, "Well, they help people that, you know, poor people, sick people, lame people, people that are handicapped, and they help 'em."  He said, "Help 'em how?"  He said, "Are they nurses, are they doctors?"  I said, "No."  He said, "Well, how do they help?"  You know, these were hard questions.  I didn't, and I wasn't, you know, I was a sophomore.  I didn't know.  I didn't really know.  I didn't have answers that I was satisfied with, even.  So, I did think more about it and I did ask my teachers, my professors, and I would come home, you know, because Kalamazoo [Michigan] was only twenty-four miles from Battle Creek [Michigan], so, it only cost me like seventy-six cents on the train to come home, so I usually came home every weekend, so I could go to church and enjoy Saturday night with my family, 'cause I really looked forward to that.
Story_ID: 313592
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little about junior high school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep.
Speaker 1: Did you attend a junior high school or were you still at Franklin [Franklin School; Post-Franklin School, Battle Creek, Michigan] during the junior high school years?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  It only went to the sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was the name of the junior high school?
Speaker 2: Southwestern [Southwestern Junior High School, Battle Creek, Michigan].
Speaker 1: And, what were your experiences like there?
Speaker 2: Great.  I was on every single team.  I was on the volleyball team, the track team, the basketball team, the baseball team.  I just had a wonderful time in junior high school.
Speaker 1: And, what were some of your favorite subjects in junior high school?
Speaker 2: Math, always.  And I, they had a nice scheme there.  When you went in the seventh grade, you had a homeroom teacher.  My homeroom teacher was Ms. Rosa [ph.].  She was a very buxom woman, but very direct and I liked her and she liked me, and you had her until you graduated in the ninth grade.  Your homeroom teacher moved up a grade when you moved from seventh grade to eighth grade to ninth grade.  She did, too, then she became that teacher for homeroom, but she happened also to be the math teacher, so I took algebra from her in the ninth grade.
Story_ID: 313593
Speaker 1: And who were some of your friends in junior high school [Southwestern Junior High School, Battle Creek, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Oh, my friends were the Parkers [ph.].  They were a family that lived at the end of our block and they had a big family that almost matched our family.  Betty [ph.] and Mary Ann [ph.] were--Betty was my brother Chuck's [ph.] age.  He's just two years older than I am, and Mary Ann was my age, and Clifford [ph.], was--Clifford was their brother and he was their age, so the Parker family.  But, do you know what I now know?  Those people were on welfare and they got a big, like a shopping bag of [Kellogg's] Corn Flakes and Mary Ann would ask me if I could go with her to stop by the city hall on the way home from school, and I did, and they would give her this big bag of corn flakes, and so the guy said, "Would you like a bag of corn flakes?"  And I said, "Yes.  I thought it was wonderful."  And I took the corn flakes home and my father [Benjamin Lett] had a fit.  He said, "No one feeds my children but me!  I feed!"  And he told my mother [Jessie Proctor Lett] I had to take those corn flakes back to where I got them.  I really didn't want to do that, because he wanted to be sure I hadn't asked them for the corn flakes and I assured him that I had not; that the man offered them to me, and I followed mother's rule.  They have to offer it three times before you can take it, and he offered it to me three times and then I took 'em, and that's when I took 'em and brought 'em home, and because Mary Ann got 'em, dad said, "That's all right, let the Parkers have it.  They don't make decisions for this family."
Speaker 1: Were the Parkers a white family?
Speaker 2: Yes.  No black family but us, and so my father said, "I make, and your mother, make the rules here.  You live by the rules of this house.  This is where you live.  These are the people who tell you what you do.  Parkers don't decide that for you.  We do."
Story_ID: 313594
Speaker 1: When I knew he [Simmons' father, Benjamin Lett] meant that was when the principal gave Mary Ann [ph.] some mittens in the wintertime, it was winter, and, oh those mittens looked wonderful.  Now, we had gloves, but gloves have fingers and, you know, gloves are not as warm as mittens, but anyway, my father said, 'cause he came home at noon.  That's why my father knew what was happening with this family.
Speaker 2: Did he come home for lunch?
Speaker 1: Every noon, every noon.  He came home for lunch.  And so, and he wanted to know what'd you learn today, and you better have learned something, because what, were you wasting time or you weren't paying attention, you know?  It was on us if we hadn't learned anything.  So, anyway, we put our mittens, or our gloves, on what was a floor register; you know, in our house the registers were on the wall, but in the kitchen it was a floor register and I thought it was made that way, so you could put your mittens there, or your gloves, and 'cause that's what I always saw.  All the grownup people's clothes were down there.  So, I had these nice new mittens that Ms. Martin [ph.] had given me, on the register and when I finally came home and he was washing his hands, he looked down there.  He said, "Jessie [Jessie Proctor Lett], where did those mittens come from?"  And she said, "Barbara [HistoryMaker Barbara Lett Simmons] brought those home."  So, he asked me, you know, I had to go stand before dad and tell him where I got those mittens.  I got those mittens from Ms. Martin.  I said, "I went with Mary Ann by her office and she gave Mary Ann a pair, and she said, 'Well, Barbara, would you like a pair of these mittens?'  And I said, 'Yes.'"  He said, "Jessie, call Ms. Martin, tell her Barbara will return the mittens when she comes back at noon from lunch," and I had to take the mittens back to school and give them back to Ms. Martin, because whatever my father's children needed, he'd provide it for us.  And, if he didn't provide it for us, we didn't need it.  It was that simple.
Speaker 2: And, do you think your father felt so strongly about issues like that because he was, you know, a black man and with this large family and that perhaps that was the expectation; that he couldn't take care of his family and couldn't provide for his family.
Speaker 1: That very well could be what was going on in his head, but it was there for a lifetime, all of our lifetimes and, you know, when I've talked with my sisters and brothers and dad and mom both expired in '70 [1970], you know we hear our parents all the time.  I'm seventy-seven years old.  I'm still hearing my mother say things.  I'm still hearing my father say things and I thought it was interesting, my older son [David C. Simmons], who is an attorney, was with me this past week and he said, we were ready--oh, we had gone out to dinner.  He said, "You know, I hear dad [Samuel J. Simmons].  I heard dad saying things to me."  And I said, "Hmm."  I said, "You know, angel, I do too.  I hear my dad."  And I said, "Look, my dad, my dad would be a hundred-and-some years old if he was alive, but I still hear him."
Story_ID: 313595
Speaker 1: What high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: The high school, Battle Creek Central [Battle Creek Central High School, Battle Creek, Michigan].  See, there was just Southeastern [Southeastern Junior High School, Battle Creek, Michigan] and Southwestern [Southwestern Junior High School, Battle Creek, Michigan] junior highs and W.K. [W.K. Kellogg Junior High School, Battle Creek, Michigan].  Those were the three junior highs.  There were eleven elementary schools, and one high school, and the in the suburb was Lakeview [Lakeview High School, Battle Creek, Michigan] and a Catholic high school [St. Philip Catholic Central High School, Battle Creek, Michigan]; so, you know, Battle Creek [Michigan] was a city of a population of about 45,000, and it's one of the All-American cities, you know?  It had those, had those big cereal factories, Post [Postum Cereal Company; Post Foods] and Kellogg [Kellogg Company; Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company], and it had, it had, well you know, after World War I--I mean, World War II [WWII], the [Battle Creek Medical Surgical] Sanitarium [Battle Creek, Michigan] was just taken over by imminent domain by the government and it became Percy Jones General [and Convalescent] Hospital, [Percy Jones] Army Hospital [Battle Creek, Michigan], and so that huge edifice, I mean it had inside swimming pool, tennis court, bowling alleys.  It was a tremendous physical facility, you know, unlike anyplace else in the world at that time, and so, so it was a very neat town and black people didn't, in the great immigration north that took place, people went to Detroit [Michigan].  They didn't go to Battle Creek.  They went to Albion [Michigan], which was a city not far from us, and to Flint [Michigan], and to give you quick insight into my father's [Benjamin Lett] rearing, he told us, the girls in the family that we couldn't go with boys who were from Flint or Albion.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: Because they were probably, now this is what I'm saying, they were probably recent arrivals from the South, and I'm sure he thought he was better than those people who had migrated to Michigan from Alabama and all those places in the South, and my father knew nothing about the South.  He had been born, this is his grandfather who told him about going with the general in the Civil War, who wrapped railroad tracks around telephone poles in Oglethorpe, Georgia.  I heard, I heard those stories in the Civil War, and he had fought on the side of the North in the Civil War against the South.
Speaker 1: This is your great-grandfather.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This was my father's grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yup.  So, I'm sure that there was a quiet, rural elitism in what my father was saying to us.  We couldn't go with a guy if he was from Flint or from Albion.
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of interracial dating that took place in Battle Creek?
Speaker 2: No.  In college [Western Michigan College of Education; Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan], I dated some white boys but I, I mean they passed the test.  They had been in my high school [Battle Creek Central High School, Battle Creek, Michigan] and one was a guy who was a movie star for a little while.  His name was Robert Kendall, and he was raised Seventh-day Adventist, so he was all right, and--
Speaker 1: Was it accepted or was there some resistance to it or--
Speaker 2: No, it was not accepted.  It was not accepted and, and you tried to have enough other couples so that it looked like a group of us went some place rather than any coupling as such.
Story_ID: 313596
Speaker 1: Going back to high school [Battle Creek Central High School, Battle Creek, Michigan], what kinds of activities were you involved in in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, see, I worked on the school paper [The Key] and I worked on the yearbook, which was the Paean, and then I was in horseback riding, and I was in GAA, which is the Girls Athletic Association, and then all of those sports, and in high school I received the highest award, which was a sweater; I mean, they actually give you the sweater.  Now see, you know, for the first four major varsities, you got a letter, and then you got a pin, and it was BC, and the B was gold, or yellow, and the C was blue, because our colors were yellow and blue, blue and gold.  And, I did, you know, I belonged to the international relations club and the Spanish club, and I belonged to everything.
Speaker 1: And, were you still active in all the different sports, the volleyball team, the basketball team, and all the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I was on the debate team in high school, and we won.  And that was very different because they didn't have girls on the debate team, it was all guys, and I was a black girl.  But Mr. Postam [ph.] thought I was great.
Speaker 1: And what was it like when you travelled to other schools for games and that kind of thing?  Was there any surprise at, like, the integration at Battle Creek Central High School [Battle Creek, Michigan] when you travelled to other schools in Michigan?
Speaker 2: Not in high school.  In college [Western Michigan College of Education; Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan].  When we, when our debate team went from Western Michigan, we were going to Indiana University, which is in Bloomington [Indiana], and we stopped in Kokomo [Indiana], we were going to eat, and they wouldn't serve us.  So, we just went on but I was--
Speaker 1: They wouldn't serve you because some of the kids were black?
Speaker 2: No, 'cause I was black.  I was the only black person.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 313597
Speaker 1: All the other kids [from Western Michigan College of Education; Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan], and this was both the men's and the women's team, and my partner, Pat Mancini [ph.], and I had decided that we wanted to ride with Dr. Blyton [Gifford Blyton] (laughter) because our women's coach, Ms. Annie [ph.] (unclear), who was a brilliant, wonderful woman, drove like this--you know, on the accelerator so that you were going back and forward all the time; she didn't just put it on and leave it steady, you know?  And so, we did--and we had ridden with her a lot all over.  So, we didn't want to ride with her to Bloomington [Indiana].  So, we early on said, "We think that the girls and the men's and the women's team oughta go down as a mixed group and not as just all men and all women."  And so, they didn't have any problem with that.  But what was interesting was that other people stopped and ate, but we stopped and couldn't eat and that was true all the way, every place in Indiana, and that night at nine o'clock, we still couldn't get anything to eat, and Dr. Blyton would go in and he said, "I want to see your manager."  And so, the manager would come and he would say, "I want to know if you serve everyone in here."  The manager would say, "Yes."  And then, they would see lil' ole brown me, and they'd say, "All but her."  And so he would just be mad and storm out.
Speaker 2: Did any of your classmates resent you because of that?
Speaker 1: No.  Do you know what was interesting?  I received, when my husband [Samuel J. Simmons] passed this past year, I received a letter from a young man named Gerald Eppert [ph.], who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], who was a peer of ours, was in school with us, was on the debate team, and he wrote me the letter.  He said, "I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your husband."  He said, "I don't know whether you remember me or not, [HistoryMaker] Barbara [Lett Simmons], but I'm"--and he told me who he was and that he was on the debate team, and that he knew me as part of the debate team--and that he never had forgotten the experience in Bloomington, Indiana, where I could not be served and, consequently, Dr. Blyton didn't let the team--no one could be served if I couldn't be served.  And, he wrote me that letter just this past year when he read in the paper that my husband had expired.  So, it must have had some impact on him, but the kids never said anything.  The kids just kind of felt sorry for me, and that was a strange posture for them because I had never been a person who elicited sympathy of any kind on any level; so, as a matter of fact, they thought I was kinda--haughty (laughter).

Speaker 1: What were your thoughts about college when you were in high school [Battle Creek Central High School, Battle Creek, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Oh, there wasn't any question I was going to college.  My sister was in college and I had brothers who had been in college and my brother, Chuck [ph.], was in college at the time, 'cause he was only two years older.  He wasn't, he went to college at Albion [Albion College, Albion, Michigan] because they gave him a big ole scholarship.  He was an All-State football player, so he didn't really like that school too well and the community, and so he ended up going to Emmanuel Missionary College [Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Michigan], which is Seventh-day Adventist college in Berrien Springs, Michigan, down by the fruit belt, Benton Harbor [Michigan].  He went there for a while.
Speaker 1: Where were you thinking you would like to go to college?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew I wanted to go to college, I knew I wanted to go to college where I could get as good a scholarship as possible because I remember as a little girl sitting at the dining room table at noon and my mother [Jessie Proctor Lett] always read the letters to everybody, you know, from the kids, and my older sister and my brothers and everybody, and when Edna [ph.] would write my father [Benjamin Lett] would say, he'd say, "I got a letter from Edna," and my father would say, "And so what does she need now?"  And it wasn't that Edna needed things.  She wrote every week.  But, I knew that my father was paying for everything for my sister to go to school, and that it was expensive, and what he conveyed to me, whether he knew it or not, was that it was a sacrifice and I said, he'll never sit and read my letters to the younger kids because I'm taking all of the money and need--I have so many needs as a student.  I said, I'm going to work and I'm going to go to school, and he won't be able to say any of this noontime lunch stuff about me.  Now, that's what forms people and we all need to understand that, and so I got a scholarship from Western [Michigan College of Education; Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan] and I just closed the door to everything else.
Speaker 1: You got a full tuition scholarship?
Speaker 2: I had a full tuition and I went over there and they found--I got a job where I could work for my room and board.  So, I didn't need a thing.  And I didn't need anything from Daddy, okay?  Oh, no.  My mother said I hurt him very much because, she said that I didn't keep--that thought was not a private thought.  I did--I let dad know I didn't need anything from him, and of course, I know, I know how painful that had to be because even though he talked about it, he had great pleasure in knowing that he did supply and support his children, and that everything they needed, he was the answer to it.
Story_ID: 313599
Speaker 1: And, what year did you graduate from high school [Battle Creek Central High School, Battle Creek, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-five [1945], you know, right at the heart of the war [World War II, WWII], and, you know, Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] died that spring and I had guys in my class whose parents picked up their degrees, their high school diplomas because they had already gone to service in some instances and in other instances they had actually been killed, so the war was real to me and then I went to college [Western Michigan College of Education; Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan] that fall and they weren't taking--schools were giving guys priority, G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], so you know, depend on what you were taking whether or not you would get in school or not.  If there were guys who wanted, were veterans coming back who wanted your slot, you just didn't get to go.  So, there were only seven girls, or I should--excuse me, seven black girls at Western Michigan University, and there were thirty-five black guys.  It was the most black guys I had ever seen in my life, and you know, it was really nice 'cause we did get to pick and choose, and I knew, I had very clear notions of what I was looking for.  He had to a) be smart and to have good health and be good looking, and that was all I wanted.  I wanted a smart, healthy, good looking black guy, and that's what I was looking for, and that's what I got!
Speaker 1: I was going to say, did you find him?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Story_ID: 313600
Speaker 1: What were you thinking you would study when you went to college [Western Michigan College of Education; Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew after I got there as a social worker, my father [Benjamin Lett] said, "You mean, a daughter or mine is going to college and going to make her living off of peoples' pathology?"  He didn't use pathology, but, you know, people who are in trouble, people who are disadvantaged--people who are poor.  He said, and you're going to make your living off of poor people!  And so, that didn't sound very noble to me.  Didn't sound like what I thought I wanted to do, but that was what I wanted to do.  But he didn't make it sound like that was a worthy thing to be and aiming for.  So--I told him I'm going to take education so I'll be a teacher, too.  He kind of smiled at that.  He said, "Or you could be a nurse or you could be a librarian, but a social worker?  Gotta make your living off of other peoples' hard luck?"  That was exactly how he put it.  Well, so, I graduated with both majors and a minor in phys ed [physical education], and I finished my student teaching and I, in fact, kept it a real secret from my father that I could have left school a half a year earlier, in January.  I didn't need to come back to school at all, but by then, I had already been elected vice president of the graduating class, so no way I was going to leave school.  So, I didn't tell him, and I finished with 152 credits instead of 120, which normally you would have when you, to get your degree.  And I finished with a Michigan social work certificate, a Michigan teaching certificate, and my AD [associate degree].  So, I thought all of that was just wonderful, and my last semester, I told my father that I would like to, I'd like to live, I didn't want to work.  I had worked every year for white people in the community and wonderful experiences; I mean, I worked for the Lights, the Dr. [Richard Upjohn] Light family, he was married to [Rachael] Mary Upjohn [Light Meader].  Kalamazoo [Michigan] is noted for the Upjohn [Company] pharmaceutical plant, and they're millionaires, and I took care of two of their children and the other girl, who went to college, too, she had two--they had four boys.
Story_ID: 315199
Speaker 1: Ms. Lett Simmons [HistoryMaker Barbara Lett Simmons], you were telling us about the Light family that you worked for.
Speaker 2: Right.  I, they were, Mary Upjohn [Rachael Mary Upjohn Light Meader] was a wonderful, good person.  I enjoyed living, I had an apartment of my own and I felt, I was very comfortable.  They bought me a bicycle, so I went to school [Western Michigan College of Education; Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan] and I came back, and I love kids anyway, always have loved kids, and I had the two older boys and the other student had the two younger boys; you know, one was really a baby and a great coincident occurred; just about five years ago, when I went back to homecoming, who was the provost and vice president of the university, but Timothy Light, who I had taken care of as this little boy and he just, he said, "The warmest memories of my childhood were with you in the house as a student taking care of me and my brother, Kurt [Kurt Christopher Light]."  And so, he brought me up to date on his brothers and stuff.  But here, this man had been to China; as a matter of fact, he was married to an Asian woman and he was back as the provost for the university and, you know, to have someone come and tell you, this guy was probably six maybe, four to six when I was in his life and here he had warm memories.  He says, "Those were the best years in my childhood."
Story_ID: 315200
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about what college [Western Michigan College of Education; Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan] life was like, what it was like.  You didn't live on campus, so what was life like and what did most of the blacks do?
Speaker 2: Well, first we organized the club, called the College Club [ph.].  The College Club meant college kids, and we had socials, we met in the community center [Douglass Community Association] in the City of Kalamazoo [Michigan], and that was the community center in the black neighborhood, and Mr. [Joe] Pettiford, who ran that, and Ms. Overby [ph.], was, she had been my roommate when I stayed at her mother's house my senior year.  She was, she worked there, but she graduated ahead of me, and the College Club planned things.  We, you know, we always had a dance and social at the community center during homecoming, and then when black kids came back from other classes, they came to our event and--
Speaker 1: Did any blacks live on campus?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Jean [C.] Browning, who is from Grand Rapids [Michigan], lived on campus.  Her father [Dr. Eugene S. Browning] was a doctor and she, she was only on campus a year or two.  She didn't graduate from there.
Speaker 1: Why didn't most blacks live on campus?
Speaker 2: Because they really, a) it was expensive and b) they really didn't encourage it and they would even, when black students applied, they would tell them, well the Kings [ph.] and the Dungies [ph.] keep students.  You know, those were black families that lived in the community that had space in their house that kept students and historically had done so.  I mean, they were almost like an adjunct to the university housing department.  My husband [Samuel J. Simmons] lived at Mrs. King's and Mr. Pettiford, when he was a student there, he was, you know, considerably older than us, he had lived at Mrs. King's and my husband used to meet, you know, other black alums years later, who had been there years, and--well, my husband's own brother, Timothy Williams, had lived with Mrs. King and he, like sixteen years older than my husband, he had lived at Mrs. King's.  There were generations of people who knew the King family, 'cause they lived at the Kings or the Dungies.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: We made our own life.  Black people, black students made their own life, except that is their social life.  But see, because I had this unique kind of rearing in the Seventh-day Adventist faith, I wasn't looking for dances and theaters, and that was part of the reason that I was comfortable going home every weekend, so, what other black people did on the weekends, I'm not too sure I know 'cause I went home.
Story_ID: 315201
Speaker 1: So, when you graduated from college [Western Michigan College of Education; Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan], what did you do next?
Speaker 2: I taught in Battle Creek [Michigan], but I only taught in Battle Creek for a year because my husband [Samuel J. Simmons] and I had married that fall, and he was finishing a particular program he was doing in the field of social work at the [Michigan] State Prison in Jackson, Michigan, and so that took him, it wasn't just the summer.  He had to, he was still doing it in September and October and November and he then went to Detroit [Michigan] after he finished that.  (Laughter) It was interesting because I was at the orientation for new teachers in Battle Creek in August of that year, and the girls, the other teachers, knew that I got mail from Jackson Prison, 4000 Cooper Street [sic. 3100 Cooper Street], Jackson, Michigan, and so they were, and I'll never forget one of the ladies asked and she said, she said, "This guy you write to at Jackson, Michigan Prison--did you say you're going to marry him?"  I said, "Yeah."  She said, "You're going to marry him."  I said, "Yeah."  I didn't know she thought he was an inmate.  That didn't even cross my mind.  But she thought he was an inmate.  So, yes, I married him, and yes, they came to the reception and stuff and yes, they met him and knew that he was not an inmate.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And when did you all move to Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: The [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy administration.  The Kennedy administration asked my husband to come and he came from serving in Michigan as the executive director of labor mediation for the State of Michigan (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you-
Speaker 2: --under [G. Mennen] "Soapy" Williams, who was the governor.
Story_ID: 315202
Speaker 1: We moved to Detroit [Michigan].  I moved to Detroit after that first semester in Battle Creek [Michigan].
Speaker 2: Okay, so in 1949, you moved to Detroit and were you teaching in Detroit?
Speaker 1: I then went to teach. My son [David C. Simmons]--I had a son in '50 [1950], and he was born in June and I went, I taught in--I went to teaching in September of 1950 in Detroit, and my husband was in graduate school and working at Sophie Wright Settlement House [Franklin Wright Settlements, Inc., Detroit, Michigan]; you know, that's group social work (laughter).
Speaker 2: And what were your thoughts about Detroit?  I mean, were you starting to see that the way that you grew up in Battle Creek was very different from that of other African Americans?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I--that's when it; I mean, it harkened in on me for real in Detroit.  For example, one day my husband and I were on the bus.  We were going to work, crosstown bus, and I saw a man on the street beating a lady up.  You know, I mean physically attacking her, hitting her, and I pulled the cord and Sam [Samuel J. Simmons] said, "You don't get off here."  I said, "Yes, that man is beating that lady.  We gotta get off and stop him."  (Laughter) He said, "Sit down, honey.  No (laughter) you aren't going to off the bus to do that."  And then, he tried to explain to me what would happen.  He said, "The lady and the man would both beat you!"  And I said, "But I would be helpin' her."  He said, "Nope.  She wouldn't see it that way."  That was all very, that wasn't easy to puzzle through, you know?  I hadn't witnessed anything like that ever in my life.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 315203
Speaker 1: What were you experiencing in terms of race, though?  Were you seeing that things [in Detroit, Michigan] were not as integrated as they were in Battle Creek [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  My husband [Samuel J. Simmons] and I, when we got our little place we needed, we needed, like, I didn't have a pail or a mop or a broom, you know, to take care of my house.  I mean, it was really a room, but I didn't have any of those things that I just took for granted and I went down to Crowley Milner [Crowley Milner and Company], which was a department store, probably comparable to our Heck's [Heck's Department Store], and I wanted what the ladies I saw getting, sitting there, 'cause I was learning, while listening and looking.  They were getting what were called PCs, which was purchase certificates, and they came in a book and you would get a book out for three hundred, for three hundred dollars' worth or five hundred dollars' worth, or a hundred dollars' worth.  So, I said, "Oh, that's what I'll do."  So, I thought I'll get some of those.  And here, these women, their husbands worked in the factory at Ford [Motor Company], or some other plants, and the plants were on strike, you know, so they weren't making anything.  I mean, you know, there was no income.  I was a teacher, you know, that's a signed contract, and my husband was a social worker and that's a signed contract at Sophie Wright Settlement House [Franklin Wright Settlements, Inc., Detroit, Michigan], and when I went and sat down, the man said, "Oh, you don't have any credit established."  I said, "But I'm only twenty-two.  I just got out of school."  He said, "Well, we can't give you any purchase certificates if you don't have any credit."  I said, "But how am I going to get credit if no one will give me credit."  He said, "Well, I don't know, but sorry."  And I was just absolutely flat out refused and turned away, and I never forgot that, and so I called my husband and I told him.  I said, "You know, we don't have any credit established anywhere."  He said, "Well, why don't you go to Hudson--"I said, "We'll never get it at Hudson's."  That was the real store, J. L. Hudson's.  I said, "If Crowley Milner won't give it to us, you know Hudson's not going to."  He said, "Just go ahead and apply anyway.  See what they say."  So I did.  Hudson gave me, they said, "Oh, you don't want purchase certificates.  Why don't you just get a charge account and, you know, you get whatever you want and you pay for whatever you get at the month, and if you can't pay for all of it, you come back and talk to us and we'll figure out a schedule, how you'll pay for it and how much you'll pay."  And I thought, oh, isn't that lovely.  That's so wonderful.  I just went home, just ecstatic.  I told my husband and he, I said, "You know what?  We will never spend a dime at Crowley Milner's.  They wouldn't even take a chance on us.  They wouldn't give us anything, so we don't give them anything."  He said, "Fine."  And we lived in Detroit until we came here [Washington, D.C.] in 1960.  We had never spent a dime at Crowley Milner, and they went out of business and I was glad when they went out of business, I was glad when they went bankrupt, I was glad when bad things became to them because they were a company with no faith.  (Laughter)  I thought it was all just quite right.
Story_ID: 315204
Speaker 1: What were your teaching experiences like in Detroit [Michigan] in the early '50s [1950s], early to mid-late '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I taught at Russell University [Russell School, Detroit, Michigan], that's what we called it.  Russell University was on Russell Street on the far East Side of Detroit, where there was gross poverty and all of the pathologies that accompanied that, and I had students who can tell you who their mother was, and their dad was Mr. Bob [ph.], and Mr. Bob just stays with us on the weekend and other times he lives on the West Side.  You know, I learned more sociology in my first year at Russell University in Detroit, than I had learned all four years in my formal classes [at Western Michigan College of Education; Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan], and I had, I just, I had a wonderful time because the kids were great.  The kids were wonderful and the kids, like, they loved you.  The kids loved the teachers, they really did.  They wanted to play with your hair, they wanted to touch you, and they wanted to look at everything that you had on.  You were truly scrutinized by your students there, but you were loved and I liked that, and--
Speaker 1: So, Russell University, was it a public school?
Speaker 2: It was a public school.  It was called Russell School.  It wasn't--the teachers called it Russell University, (laughter) and said, "You're going to learn a lot here, girl."  And it was a big school.  It went to the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: And what grades did you teach there?
Speaker 2: I taught--well, first I had to teach third because when they introduced me as the sixth grade teacher, some other teacher used her bumping privileges, her seniority, and she said, "That's a new teacher.  She came from Michigan.  What's she doing teaching sixth grade?  I put in for the sixth grade.  I was supposed to get that."  And that teacher did get it, and the principal explained it to me and I understood that, so, and respected it and I taught third grade for one year.  Then, the next year I did get a sixth grade [class].
Story_ID: 315205
Speaker 1: And so, in 1960, you all came to Washington, D.C. when your husband [Samuel J. Simmons] was recruited by the Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] administration or--
Speaker 2: Right.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: It's '61 [1961], see the election was in '60 [1960].  He went into office in January '61 [1961] and they were staffing all of '60 [1960] and so my husband went in '61 [1961] and the kids and I didn't really come until after, 'cause the school year had started and the kids wanted to finish their year, then we went.
Speaker 1: So, you came like the summer of '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Of '2 [1962].
Speaker 1: The fall of 1962.
Speaker 2: Right, no, well, we came the summer.  We came as soon as school was out in '60 [1960], the '61-'62 [1961-1962] school year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then you began teaching in Montgomery County, Maryland?
Speaker 2: Yeah, then I started teaching in Montgomery County, that's correct.
Speaker 1: And, tell us a little bit about your experiences teaching in Montgomery County, Maryland.
Speaker 2: Well, it was interesting because Montgomery County was just then doing their integration from the '54 [1954] Brown versus Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka], and the, so they wanted a black teacher, but that's what they wanted.  They wanted one black teacher and I went, they did an interesting thing because the principals interviewed you, but you were interviewing the principal.  It was a two-way street, and you both had to agree, and the principal could offer you the job or not.  Just because you were being interviewed didn't mean you were going to get that job, and I was offered the job by a principal in Gaithersburg [Maryland], and she really did, but I don't know where she was from but she had the heaviest, most severe southern accent I had ever heard in my life, and I just didn't think I could listen to that.  I just, I mean, you know, it required full attention to understand her.  That's how heavy, and, of course, this was a white woman and I wasn't sure how that was going to set, plus I had heard all these stories about white people, how they think, feel, and believe about black people and so I had some question marks, and I was interviewed by another principal named Antoinette McKeever, and she was at Glen Haven [Elementary School, Silver Spring, Maryland], and I just, first of all I could hear and understand her very well.  She sounded like an American (laughter), so I did enjoy her and I--she asked me, and I cam- I was willing to go.
Story_ID: 315206
Speaker 1: What was it like living in Washington, D.C. around that time?  It was somewhat the height of the Civil Rights Movement.  Were you starting to become involved in civil rights issues, or what was it like living in D.C. at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, we lived in a community where we still live, 'cause we bought that house in '60 [1960] and still live there.  It was a section in Northwest Washington, where a group had spent a lot of time called Neighbors, Inc., and they were anxious to have an integrated community, and it was very interesting, 'cause one of the major central figures in that body were the Caplans, Marvin [Marvin H. Caplan] and--hmm--it's interesting--Mrs. Caplan's [Naomi Weltman] name escapes me at the moment--but, she was explaining to me that they would show us some housing, because they wanted my kind of black person in their neighborhood, okay?  So, and my husband [Samuel J. Simmons] was too busy to look for any housing, and I did have to come down and do all of it myself. I went through forty houses, and I gave a point value to the features in the houses, and then took the five best ones with the greatest number of points for my husband to see.  He saw the first two and said, "Whichever one of those you want, I'm for that."  And, he never saw any of the others.  But, and we are where we are because of that.  We were the only black family to be on that block.  It was a cul-de-sac.  It's still a cul-de-sac, and there were thirteen houses on that cul-de-sac, and the owner of that house was also the builder of that house and several other on the street, and the architect that lived next door to him had been the architect for that house that he lived in and his own house, and the architect did the houses and he did the building, Mr. Greenwall [ph.], and that's the house we chose and that's where we live.
Story_ID: 315207
Speaker 1: What was it like living in the city [Washington, D.C.] at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, you still couldn't do much.  My husband [Samuel J. Simmons] and I had been here in '52 [1952] for a meeting and we stayed at his brother's house because no hotels would accommodate us at that time, and then we came back again, and where we stayed was what is now what is the [Capital] Hilton [Statler Hotel], there on 16th Street--
Speaker 1: The Capital Hilton.
Speaker 2: Capital Hilton.  And that was the first hotel I ever stayed in in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Were you starting to become involved in civil rights issues?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Because my husband was very involved in civil rights.  His graduate work that he did and the project he was doing at the [Michigan State] Prison [Jackson, Michigan] grew out of his sociology and we integrated the restaurants in Kalamazoo [Michigan].  We couldn't eat at Schensul's [Cafeteria, Kalamazoo, Michigan], which was a cafeteria downtown.  We couldn't go to any of the restaurants, and they put salt in our coffee and, you know, did things like that and this was in the '60s [1960s], I mean, yeah, this is in the '40s [1940s], I mean, '47 [1947], '48 [1948], '49 [1949], and as my son said at my husband's funeral, you know, "Everyone thinks that civil rights took place in the '60s [1960s], but," he said, "my mother and father were twenty years ahead of that.  That was twenty years later for them that other people were talking about civil rights.  They did it in the '40s [1940s]."  And that was true.  And restaurants in Kalamazoo had to serve us and my husband knew how to go to court on Mondays to prosecute these owners of these hotels and restaurants who were in violation of the civil rights, because Michigan had an accommodations law passed in 1940 [sic.] by [Charles C.] Diggs [Sr.], who was a congressman here; his father [sic.], who had before him been a state senator in Michigan and had passed the [Equal] Accommodations Act [of 1938] in the State of Michigan.  But, it was only true for Michigan.
Speaker 1: And, what did the Accommodations Act say, that all people had to be served (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Had to be served, absolutely.
Story_ID: 315208
Speaker 1: And so, in 1968, you went to work for the [U.S.] Department of Education.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well see, I had been--I had been here [Washington, D.C.] teaching prior to that and when--I was calling myself taking a leave of absence in '65 [1965] and I just very much enjoyed my husband's [Samuel J. Simmons] work and worked kind of with him, you know, just as a volunteer, and then I became the education coordinator for the city's poverty program [United Planning Organization].
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: That was in '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: And what were your responsibilities?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in charge of the Head Start program and the education for black kids in this city.  Now, the superintendent was black and there were lots of black teachers in the school system, but poor people, and there were ten, what were called NDC [ph.] areas; those were designated super poverty areas, and I had a staff of about thirty-two people, who were called education action team people, and they were to see that schools behaved respectfully and treated all students, you know, poor kids, appropriately and fairly and, you know, I had to teach mothers how you access things on behalf of your children because this system, even though these are black people, they are part of a system and they do things based on that system and it isn't always good for your kids, and you have to let them know that you are the customer, that you are the client and that you are to receive services for your children as well and it's not just the clean well-washed kids who are supposed to, you know, be serviced in this institution called education--
Story_ID: 315209
Speaker 1: And from there [United Planning Organization], you went to the [U.S.] Department of Education?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to, yeah, WTI [ph.] and to work on this program, which did this adult education for people who were now going to be teaching adults.
Speaker 1: And you were, like, you developed training and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, training modules that we used and I had a staff, and see, our job was harder because, you know, I would be in Vermont and I would open up a full week program, I would open it up on Monday morning and that was, like eight hours a day for a whole week that my staff was going to be left there.  I would leave on, maybe Tuesday or Wednesday and go start another program in some other city in Pennsylvania and any one of the other fourteen states, but what our job was, to help these counselors and educators deal with hardcore unemployed minorities, mainly black but also Hispanic and sometimes Highland Appalachia--Highlanders, and, you know, folks with other kinds of uniqueness about their experiential backgrounds.
Speaker 1: And how long did you do that?
Speaker 2: I did that from--'til '72 [1972].
Story_ID: 315210
Speaker 1: I think we left off at around 1972, when you decided to start your own business [BLS and Associates].  Why did you decide to start your own business and what kind of business was it?
Speaker 2: It was staff development and training at, I called it the person-centered approach because I tried to help people see that people who work in your company or your institution, that if they feel that they have a stake in it, they get more pleasure out of what it is they're doing, they can see the connectedness in terms of the cog that they are a part of, and that you maximize your own productivity, and that this just makes sense, because this way everyone's a win-win-win.  There are not winners and losers.  It doesn't have to be that way, and so I enjoyed it and I enjoyed the people, but I found that I was getting more work from commerce from businesses who want to increase the black ink than the people who were dealing with other human beings, which is what I really, that was my real goal, to see that there's a difference when you are dealing with people.  So, I turned it into suggesting to educational institutions that we could help teachers maximize their educational productivity of their students by this person-centered thesis and so we had some basic assumptions that we asked people to evaluate and subscribe to, and if you couldn't subscribe to those basic assumptions, then I didn't want to train you.

Speaker 1: And around the same time, in 1973, you were elected to the D.C., Washington D.C. Board of Education [District of Columbia State Board of Education].
Speaker 2: Right.  Because what I had done for them, for the school system, was the superintendent search for a superintendent here, and--
Speaker 1: So, you were on the search committee, or--
Speaker 2: I was the commercial person, the head hunter, so my firm did the head hunt for them.  We did the head hunt for the director of the [Washington, D.C.] Urban League [Greater Washington Urban League], and I brought [HistoryMaker] John [E.] Jacob through to D.C. from California.
Speaker 1: Through your company--
Speaker 2: Through my company, through BLS and Associates.  And so, I did the search and got, brought [HistoryMaker] Barbara [A.] Sizemore here for the D.C. Board of Education.  [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry was, at that time, the president of the board, and Barbara Sizemore who, by the way, just died last week, or last month, was an absolute genius.  She is a brilliant, brilliant woman, and the most hard-bitten racist in D.C., always prefatorily admitted that Barbara was a brilliant woman, but--and so, I just learned a very great deal about flagrant bigotry here in D.C., and it was the behavior of both.  That's why I said bigotry.  Black people and white people against a brilliant educator/administrator like Barbara Sizemore because there were black people who were every bit as vicious as were any of the white racist bigots.  They were bigots, too, and they were black bigots.
Speaker 1: Do you think she was just a little before her time?
Speaker 2: Without question.  She was twenty years ahead of her time, but she was doing the appropriate thing for the people 'cause she was going to churches and to community things and educating the people who were the parents of the children that she was educating.  So, it all would have worked out if the bigotry by the racist hadn't been so severe in this community.  See, they were, they were sexist bigots and they were racial bigots.  And they were also elitist because they didn't really give a damn about poor black girls and boys learning to be competent, capable, comfortable, contributing citizens.  That's the truth of the matter.
Story_ID: 315212
Speaker 1: What would you say are some of your most--proudest accomplishments on the D.C. Board of Education [District of Columbia State Board of Education]?
Speaker 2: Okay, that's a great question because what pleases me and, like you say, if you live long enough it'll come back around, I was anxious to see--I believed in equity.  That was, that was a real part of my mother's [Jessie Proctor Lett] milk.  So, I thought there should be fairness and rightness to everything and I did not approve of black people discriminating against other black people any more than I did what white racists would do to black people, just for the simple reason that your skin was different, and in education there is an elitism, and it's called the elitists who read and write and the people who work with their hands and fix, build, and create and do, and they were called the vocational career training people; and so, even the teachers, I saw that.  Teachers who taught the vocational skills were somehow looked down upon by the teachers who taught English and math.  It was unbelievable to me that this country somehow could find a way to divide and discriminate in every category.  If it wasn't race, then we'll take the curriculum and based on that we'll discriminate.  This government was giving at the time fourteen dollars to school systems for every one dollar in vocational technical education.  This, now imagine that.  Now, that's another form of elitism.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Who said that the only way to learn is through numbers and letters?  A lot of people learn through notes and pictures and symbols, but the result was that here we had this elitism going on in our school system equally as severe as any other racial divide that was occurring, and when I read the history, and I did, because I lived here now and this was my city, that if you were a hoity-toity, you went to [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.], but if you weren't hoity-toity, and you had a generous supply of melanin in your skin, you went to Armstrong [Manual Training High School, Washington, D.C.], and that people actually operated in those two kinds of tracks that were imposed by black people.  I found that the most outrageous and ridiculous thing I had ever heard of in my life.  So, I said, well then, you know, we ought to do something about that.  I thought everything that was a problem ought to be fixed, yeah.  So, I volunteered to be chair of the Career/Vocational Technical Education [CTE] committee, and we built in that period.  Now remember, they had just passed in 1969, the Vocational Education Act [sic. Vocational Education Amendments of 1968] and MDT act [Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962] and they were just becoming implemented in the '70s [1970s].
Story_ID: 315213
Speaker 1: Manpower Development Training [Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962 (MDT)], because, you see, the government knew they had to retrain people for the work force because here this big third of our jobs had gone overseas, and so the jobs that required least, they were gone over there because the companies didn't want to pay union wage for people to do de minimis kinds of work.  The net result was here we were having this large number of people who had been automated out of work, out of employment, which was going to be devastating to our country.  You know, if two-thirds of your residents are going to end up on welfare, a country can't survive that way; I mean, what kind of country in society would we have if that was the case.  One-third of the people can't support three-thirds.  You know?  The whole society.  So, I knew we had to do something about that.  So, we had to get some equity and people seeing that these are inextricably intertwined, and that those who build and create and fix and do, are absolutely necessary, and so I spent time helping people see, look.  We're going to have a big conference.  We're going to have all the bright minds in the world meet in this, you know, forty-story building and there will be workshops and things going on in here, and we've got all the brain power of the country here, but what we're going to do is we're going to have the electricity go off and we're going to have the toilets go out, and let's see how long those geniuses can survive in that building, engaged in their noble thoughts and their elitist notions. While they're busy they would give their life for a plumber.  They would give their life for an electrician and the people had to understand that we live interdependently upon each other and that that's how we have a good life in this country, and because what that man can do with his hands is so inextricably intertwined with my comfort that we pay him well for it, so he can educate his kids to be a craftsman like he is or to go to college and do something else, if that's what they want to do.  But, that man had to have a good salary and his work and his effort had to be respected and approved and appreciated; well, so in this school system we, at that time, had ninety-eight programs that kids could be engaged in.
Speaker 2: Vocational programs?
Speaker 1: That's right.  Vocational, technical programs, from being a file clerk where all you needed to know was the alphabet, to pneumatics, so that you move to some sophistication in the area of air conditioning and refrigeration.
Story_ID: 315214
Speaker 1: And how has that changed over the years?  Did the programs decrease over the years?
Speaker 2: Sure they did.  And when I went back, when I went back to the schools, the only time, you know, after I left the [District of Columbia State] Board [of Education], the only time I ever went back to a school board meeting to testify was to, just to plead with my fellow colleagues to keep the technical, we had these vocational, technical schools, five of them, we had all kinds of auto mechanics and body work and all that out at Phelps [Vocational High School; Phelps Architecture, Construction and Engineering High School, Washington, D.C.].  We had shoemaking, we had shoe repair, we had cosmetology and barbering, manicuring, all that whole area.  We had the whole culinary arts area, real honestly, there are service, there is need in this town for culinary art specialists.
Speaker 1: And so, today what is the situation?
Speaker 2: All the vocational technical schools were closed, wiped out.
Speaker 1: Now, what about the resurrection of McKinley Tech [McKinley Technology High School, Washington, D.C.], which actually opened this year.
Speaker 2: Right.  After being out five years, but three years that this mayor [Anthony A. Williams] claimed he was going to open it.  For three years.  I want you to know the principal, the director, I think they call him, down there, has been on payroll for three years with no staff and no students.
Speaker 1: But, is McKinley Tech the kind of vocational school that you had envisioned when you were pioneering all of this?
Speaker 2: It's a piece of it, only a piece of it.  Because it's only information.
Speaker 1: Right.  It focused a lot on information technology, medical technology--
Speaker 2: And bio.
Speaker 1: Bio, and broadcast technology.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, do you consider that vocational?
Speaker 2: Yup.  That is.  Because those people leave the completion of those courses with a competency certificate, so they have an entry level into the career, while sure they need more study and more work, but at least they have an entry level.  Our average high school student finishes with a high school diploma, which is a heartbeat record.  He can't do anything.  He doesn't have--and unfortunately sometimes they don't read too well, nor do they compute too well.
Story_ID: 315215
Speaker 1: Do you think that we'll see--so this year, 2004, we did see the resurrection of McKinley Tech [McKinley Technical High School, Washington, D.C.] reopen.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What do you think--do you think that that's going to become a trend and that we'll start to see other, some of the other vocational schools open, or we'll start to see other vocational schools or, what are your thoughts on that?
Speaker 2: I'll tell you.  I really, I really would like not to share my thoughts on that, 'cause I don't have good, I don't feel up and positive about it.  I'll tell you what I'm afraid will indeed happen.  McKinley Technical High School will become an area high school and it will have all white students in it, and the black kids still will not have a chance at acquiring masterfully a skill to become competent, employable human beings.  That's what I think, and I think that the black kids that get in it are going to have the same kind of pull as if their mom and dad were some kind of specialist somewhere--
Speaker 1: The whole [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.]/Armstrong [Manual Training High School, Washington, D.C.] thing again (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.  That repeated.  That's what worries me.
Story_ID: 315216
Speaker 1: Ms. Lett Simmons [HistoryMaker Barbara Lett Simmons], when you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: That, you know, as a seventy-seven-year-old person knowing that, you know, my life is, for all intents and purposes, over, and what I can impact or have any influence on is de minimis.  I understand that, realize that, don't exactly resent it, but wish that it wasn't as true as it is.  The net result means, then, that I don't believe in wasting time because I think there's little of it, and I'm in a hurry to see some things happen.  That's why I initiated the recall of the mayor [Anthony A. Williams] we have in this city [Washington, D.C.] who has disdain for the community, who is arrogant and who is unfeeling; who by his practices, by my observation, prefers white people for all administrative and executive positions.  He doesn't seek out, you know, if it was a white company that said, "Well, we didn't hire any black people because there aren't any."  And they say you got to look harder.  You got to figure out new ways to find 'em and that's your job.  This man gets away with it because some people say he's black.  I don't think he's black.  He says he's a Republican.  I don't think he's a Republican, I mean a Democrat.  He is a Republican because the basic premise in the Democratic Party is that we're opposed to vouchers and he has more vouchers and more charter schools than any state in the United States.  His behavior belies everything that is basic in terms of principles of the Democratic Party.  He went out and raised money for Connie Morella, a Republican congresswoman, when we had only six slots until Democrats could take over the [U.S.] House [of Representatives], and if that could happen, we would have a black man, Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel], chairman of the [House] Ways and Means Committee, the most powerful committee in the United States Congress, and [HistoryMaker] John Conyers [Jr.], chairman of the [House] Judiciary Committee, an equally significant and important and powerful committee because they select the judges around this country who incarcerate the young black people in this country.  And, this man helps to keep, to inhibit that from taking place.  Now can I say that that is a black man who is a Democrat, when his actions belie that?  And you look at the chairman and directors of every one of his departments.  There was a time when the director of all of the agencies in the country--you know, they have secretary of state's organizations, professional fraternal groups, the auditor generals, the attorney generals, all of this, people holding those positions in the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] had been black people.  They are all white people now.  Who is in charge of family, health and children?  A white, gay woman.  Who's in charge of -- just go down the line, every single--mental health, a gay white woman.  Now, you know I don't know that those necessarily are prerequisites that he insists on having as qualifications, but I think it's no coincidence that these frequently are factors that are known because they are not, you know, closet people.
Story_ID: 315217
Speaker 1: I know this isn't the part of the interview that you were expecting (laughter).  But, what I think, feel, and believe, makes me who I am, and why I've done what I've done in life, and that's why, part of the reason I initiated and worked 180 days to get this man [Mayor Anthony A. Williams] recalled, and if the slot machine fiasco hadn't come along, we would have succeeded.  We would have succeeded.  But I couldn't, in good conscience, tell people who were volunteering to get signatures to recall this man when the slots came along and said we'll give you ten dollars a name, two dollars a name, six dollars a name, and they were doing our names for free because they believed in it, and they said, "[HistoryMaker] Ms. [Barbara Lett] Simmons, you know if I just go out here and get ten petitions filled out, I've got two thousand dollars, and my family could use it and need it," and I could say, "no man, you don't do that.  You can't do that.  I mean, we gotta, we got our own agenda."  I couldn't do that.
Story_ID: 315218
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you haven't done yet that you'd still like to do, other than get Anthony Williams [Mayor Anthony A. Williams] recalled?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I am going--we got him in the primary.  Were you aware that he lost his whole slate, the only person that he successfully defeated was me.  Now, do you know that I understand that $45,000 was spent to get me and I've had two terms and I believe in term limits, and I wouldn't have had, wouldn't even have been trying for this term if my husband [Samuel J. Simmons] had been alive 'cause I had promised him I wasn't gonna run any more, but when Mr. Anthony Williams, in a staff meeting, made me a matter of the agenda and said that I had to go and that he told that to his staff people, and that they would be sorry, that would be an impact on them if I didn't go, which of course, you know, isn't exactly the thing that government permits, but if I'm important enough to that man for him to make me an agenda item on his agenda with his senior staff, then I know that I would be doing a wrong thing to all of the unborn children in this community not to run, and so I ran.  And I was defeated, not by very much, but I was defeated.  But, after all, I've won nineteen elections in this city.  So, he did have to spend money to get rid of me, and he succeeded (laughter).
Story_ID: 315219
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a community activist who acted on her beliefs, not articulated them.  Didn't sing them and make slogans, but who put myself on the line for them.
Speaker 1: And what do you think your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: I hear other people use it now and it was a set of terms that no one had used commonly, and that is, I want people to act upon what they think, feel, and believe, because I think it's the combination.  You know, don't tell me what you believe, don't tell me what you think if you don't believe it, 'cause people can engage in, you know, it's called rhetoric, it's called, you know, phraseology, putting nice terms together.  I call 'em wordsmiths, you know?  So, I think that people thinking, really giving thought and feeling.  You got to have some humanity in it, and believing it, that an action is called for, but action must be part of that equation, and we have too many people say, "Oh, yeah, [HistoryMaker] Barbara [Lett Simmons].  You know, I believe that, too.  I think so-and-so."  But there's no evidence that they either think or believe.
Story_ID: 315220
Speaker 1: Any regrets?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not sure.  The court is still out.  I hope that my fervor in what I think, feel, and believe, does not serve to do any harm to my two sons [David C. Simmons and Robert A. Simmons], who are remarkable young men, who do not hold as strongly as I do whatever it is they believe, and I would hate for them to be victims of their mother's strength (laughter) and what some people call strong willed-ness, because anyone who is honest will admit that whatever I did in my life was not for me, it wasn't for personal enrichment and it wasn't for--I think Dr. Dorothy I. Height [HistoryMaker Dorothy Height] said it best.  She said that "[HistoryMaker] Barbara Lett Simmons is a woman of her convictions, who will not be muted for purposes of popularity," and I think that she very cogently capsulized me, because I think she's someone who looks at people honestly, and she's had lots of people to look at, and I don't mind going into her (unclear) and having her evaluate and judge me.

Speaker 1: That photo was taken for my, for the [Paean] yearbook my junior and senior year in high school [Battle Creek Central High School, Battle Creek, Michigan], 1944 and '45 [1945] and that particular article is talking about--I was serving as one of the speakers for our commencement.
Speaker 2: That's David Clay Simmons, that's my number one son who, at that time, was about three-and-a-half, not yet four years old.  He is sitting on, at a church, a big Baptist church in Detroit, Michigan at the time that Emmett Till had been killed in Mississippi, and the church and the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] were raising funds and really being--black people in the country were very agitated.
Speaker 1: In 1992, those are the sisters and brothers, the six of us that were left out of a family of twelve siblings, three girls and three boys were yet alive and that's my oldest sister, who is in front of me sitting.  She, Edna [ph.], was an educator and I was an educator, and my sister, Jeannie [ph.], who is three years younger than I am, was a nurse of some forty-three years.
Speaker 2: Which one is Jeannie?
Speaker 1: Over to the left, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: That's Jeannie?
Speaker 1: That's me.
Speaker 2: That's you, that's Jeannie.
Speaker 1: That's Edna, the older, the oldest one.  And that's Jean.  And then my brother Chuck [ph.], who is just two years older than I am, and then both of those brothers, Raymond [ph.], you just touched, and that's Robert [Delano Lett (ph.)], and they are younger than I.
Speaker 2: Very good.
Speaker 1: Rob is ten, nine years younger than I am.  Raymond is five years younger.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's a picture with marching with [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson, and this was in the '80s [1980s] at the time that we wanted Jesse Jackson to run for president of the United States, and so that was in about 1984.
Speaker 2: Now, sometimes you'll see my put them sideways.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We fix that later on.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: We do it because we actually got a little bit better reproduction.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: We use some computer software later and turn it back around, so--describe this one.
Speaker 1: This is at the stone, the memorial stone for my mother and father.  They're both buried there.  That's in Oak Hill Cemetery in Battle Creek, Michigan, and the six surviving children in 1990s, were at that scene there.  That is also the scene, the cemetery, where Ellen G. White, the prophetess of the Seventh-day Adventist faith is buried, and where Sojourner Truth is also buried, and they're really in view of my parents' grave.
Speaker 2: Let me get set up on the first shot.  Okay.  So, tell us about the first one--
Speaker 1: This is my older sister, Edna, who is seven years older than myself.  Charles [ph.] is next.  He's two years older than I am.  Clara [ph.] is --
Speaker 2: Slow down just a little.  Charles--and then this is Clara.
Speaker 1: Her name was really Clara Belle.  Clara Belle Lett, but she didn't like the Belle and so she called herself Clara.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And then next we have--
Speaker 1: She's a nurse, was a nurse, has since expired, and Jean Marie [ph.], who is three years younger than myself, and she is, she was the first nurse to graduate from Harper Hospital School of Nursing [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Now, is that the one in the upper right or is that the one--
Speaker 1: Upper right.
Speaker 2: Okay, good.  And then moving down to the three--
Speaker 1: Below her is my oldest sister.  We called her Betty Boo [ph.], but her name is Elizabeth [ph.], and then that is my baby brother, he is the youngest of the twelve, Robert, who is below my, the oldest.  He's in the lower right hand corner.  Next to him, going left is Franklin [ph.], my second oldest brother, and then Buddy [ph.]--
Speaker 2: Hold on one second.  Just wanted to make sure--sometimes it takes me a little longer to get set up and you can talk about it.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, now we're over to Buddy.
Speaker 1: Buddy, Buddy was in the [U.S.] military and he is, his name was Floyd Benjamin Lett [ph.].  He's only about five years older than I am.  Raymond is at the far left and he's about five years younger than I am.  And that's me.  I'm just north of Raymond (laughter).
Speaker 2: Great.  And then we'll move over to your dad.
Speaker 1: Yeah, at the center is Dad, Benjamin Harrison Lett, and my mother, Jessie Lorraine Proctor Lett, and my oldest brother, my father's--
Speaker 2: Hold on one second, I'm still on your mom.
Speaker 1: Okay.  My oldest brother, Henry Harrison Lett [ph.], was my father's first son and he thought his sons were wonderful.  There were seven sons and five girls.
Speaker 2: Okay, let's go ahead with this one.
Speaker 1: Well, that's 2000 A.D. in December, because the Electoral College for an election in America occurs around December 18th, following the November election of the winners and then the Electoral College meets. And all over America, in every state house, the ballots are cast by the electors in the, what is called the electoral college, to determine who the president of the United States is and will--who will be inaugurated in January, and on December 18, 2000, I did not cast as an elector of the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.], and we have three electoral votes.  I did not cast my vote for Al Gore, who was the winner of my state just unanimously, and it was to use that window of opportunity to stress that here were almost a million citizens in the District of Columbia, in the greatest democracy on the face of the earth, who had no representation.
Story_ID: 312034
Speaker 1: That's a picture of me with personalities that are selected by the staff and sponsors for the [Paean] yearbook, of kids in the class [at Battle Creek Central High School, Battle Creek, Michigan] and I was a junior and those are junior, other fellow junior class members.
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: The Central Key [The Key] was the name of our high school paper, our newspaper.  The Paean was the name of the yearbook and this picture is in the Paean, but it is the total staff of The Key, and I was the girl sports editor for The Key and also for that yearbook.
Speaker 2: Ready.
Speaker 1: The Pan-American Club [ph.] were kids, first we all were taking Spanish, and the sponsor of the class, of that particular class activity was Ms. Bay, Ms. Vivian Bay [ph.], who was the Spanish teacher.  She taught Spanish to us, and I belonged to that club.  That's an extracurricular activity also.  I did participate in a lot of after school stuff.
Speaker 2: Go ahead whenever you're ready.
Speaker 1: The GAA board was the Girls Athletic Association board of directors and I was on that because I was very active in girls sports; as a matter of fact, when I finished high school I received the highest award for having been on twelve varsity teams during my three years in high school, and I was captain of some of them, like basketball, and we had horseback riding and a lot of, it wasn't just team sports.  We had some individual sports, bowling, horseback riding as well.  Well, as you can see, that's in the early '70s [1970s] when the hairstyle was the afro (laughter) and those are two colleagues of mine and we were [District of Columbia State] Board of Education members for the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] public schools.  To my left in the picture is Dr. Therman Evans, who was an at-large board member as was myself, and to my right in the picture is John Warren [ph.], who now resides in California.
Speaker 2: This picture is taken at the press conference of the previous picture, same conference. [HistoryMaker] Barbara Lett Simmons in the '70s [1970s] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Accompanying me in this picture, which was taken in the [U.S.] Virgin Islands, after I had won the election in 1973.  I was an at-large school board member.  Those were two people very central in my campaign and election, Roy Watlington and his wife, Jan Watlington, of the Virgin Islands, but they were both in Washington [D.C.], living in Washington.  Roy is a professor at the University [of the Virgin Islands], and Jan representing the Virgin Islands with representative delegate [Ron] de Lugo.
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Community activist was the common description for me in those days.
Speaker 2: What period of time?  I mean, we kind of know, but what--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was in the '70s [1970s] as well.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Latter part of the '70s [1970s].  You see, the bushes are not quite as big (laughter).
Speaker 2: That picture, I love because it is a person I deeply respect and admire, [HistoryMaker] Dr. Barbara A. Sizemore was superintendent for the schools in the District of Columbia.  I did the search for the, superintendent search for the public schools and Barbara was the person who, out of 104 applicants, finally received the appointment and that was, she was the first black woman to be appointed superintendent of a major urban school system.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--he was mayor in Mississippi, Mayor [James] Charles Evers, brother of Medgar Evers, who was assassinated.  He was attending the Congressional Black Caucus dinner in 1973, I guess it was.
Speaker 2: Now, I can do Mayor [Tom] Bradley with you, because I moved my light.  So, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  That picture is with Mayor Bradley from out of California and he was attending the Congressional Black Caucus as well.
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: That was in 1973 and '4 [1974].
Speaker 2: That's me with him there, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Barbara Lett Simmons with [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson in 1973.
Speaker 1: Okay, now just go right down to the one below that, (unclear).
Speaker 2: Below is superintendent, Barbara Sizemore, Barbara A. Sizemore with Jesse Jackson and, oh, and Mayor, and Mayor Bradley.
Speaker 1: Now, just slide over to the right and get you and David.
Speaker 2: Now to the right is David Clay Simmons, my eldest son and myself, and that was, David had just not been back very long from having studied in Leningrad, Russia [Saint Petersburg, Russia], at the University of Leningrad [sic. Leningrad State University; Saint Petersburg State University, Saint Petersburg, Russia].
Speaker 1: And what year would that have been?

I had been elected in '73 [1973] for my first four year term and this was a campaign for reelection in '77 [1977], and I had a student in my picture with me because I felt that I was a school board member for, as an advocate for students, so students and teachers were my constituents, contrary to the adversarial relationship that too many boards of education have with their staff.
