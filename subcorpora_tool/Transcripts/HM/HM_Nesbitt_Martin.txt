Story_ID: 620688
Speaker 1: I'd like to ask you--let's ask about your father first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And can you tell me about--give me his name and what you know about his growing up?
Speaker 2: His name was Marvin Nesbitt.  He was born in Tennessee, a place called Promise Land, Tennessee, which was a farm, a city, a farm in a city (laughter), and the land there was given to his grandfather by the slave owner who promised his slaves the land if the South were to lose the Civil War, and that's why it was called Promise Land, and it's on the books in Tennessee as a, a village called Promise Land.
Speaker 1: All right and where's this in Tennessee?
Speaker 2: It's near Clarksville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: And how do you happen to know of this history going back like this?
Speaker 2: Well because we still own the farm and everybody in the family always refers to Promise Land, they kind--you know.  They, they always say, you know for a while--as a young boy it took us a while to--young kids, it took us a while to figure out what the Promise Land was to keep--our parents kept saying, "Yeah, we're gonna go to Promise Land."  We thought they were talking about heaven or something but it was an actual place, it is an actual place and there's a, there is a civic building there now.  I--it was just dedicated or re-dedicated this summer that documents this whole history of it.  I didn't--my sisters [Marva Nesbitt and Marjorie Nesbitt] went back, I couldn't.  But, so I don't know exactly what it's like there and how they've documented the history of this area, but you know it's--you can search the Internet and find stuff on this place Promise Land, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: And what about its history can you tell--do you know much more about it and you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I don't know much about it other than there was certain deed restrictions on the land, that it could only be sold from one Nesbitt to another Nesbitt, so that's why it's been in our family all these years.  So no one other than a Nesbitt can, can own this land unless we all agree.
Speaker 1: The reason that, that's very uncommon a story with black people so, I mean usually the story is that people lost their land, so it's--that's--
Speaker 2: It is very unusual.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's very unusual, but you know the family still owns this farm.  Now it's chopped up now in many ways because I think it was split amongst my grandfather [Babe Nesbitt] and his siblings and then when they all had children it was then divided amongst their children, and then divided amongst us.  I, I don't know how many different ways this land has--
Speaker 1: Do you?
Speaker 2: Now I have one uncle who is--kind of assembled a bunch of little pieces and owns a chunk of it and as I understand it.  My sisters and I have the largest pieces that he doesn't--this other uncle doesn't own.
Speaker 1: That I mean that's, it's just a very unusual story 'cause most of the stories are that blacks, they lost their land you know and not, and also the restrictions (unclear).  Now I know your parents divorced but do you--how much of your--do you remember your father talking about his growing up?
Speaker 2: No, not really, not, not, not much.  I mean I remember him talking about being on a farm and you know having you know cows and milking cows and chickens and, and slaughtering pigs and all that kind of stuff, but you know on a day to day, from a day to day aspect on what his life was like down there, I really don't know much.
Speaker 1: Now how old were you when your parents divorced?
Speaker 2: You know I was probably twelve when they split up and like fourteen by the time they were divorced (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 620689
Speaker 1: I'd like to--can you describe your father [Marvin Nesbitt] to me?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was very outgoing, you know, great sense of humor.  He was generous with his friends and, and he was, he was, you know, we grew up in the city and you know my father moved to Columbus [Ohio] when he was I think in junior high school or high school, and you know he had a reputation around town as kind of being a tough guy, an enforcer you know, and that was, that was certainly true.  I mean one of the things that allowed me to kind of grow up in the inner city and not get caught up in all the bad things that were going on around me was the fact that all the bad guys were afraid of my father (laughter), so I was able to kind of go my way without worrying about getting sucked into, you know, dangerous or negative things because people were afraid to engage me.  And I, I can recall many occasions when you know there was something threatening on the horizon and you know a, a fight, a, a you know somebody about to use drugs or something and then when I was recognized and say, "Oh, you know," they would say, "that's Jack Nesbitt's son. Let's, let's get out of here," (laughter) you know, "we gotta--let's leave him alone."  My father's nickname was Jack (laughter) so not very closely related to his first name, but.
Speaker 1: How did he get that nickname do you know?
Speaker 2: Because Jack was slang for money and he was a hustler and he all--when he was a teenager, when he was--he was always doing odd jobs, doing entrepreneurial doing this, and he had this reputation for always having money in his pocket, so they called him Jack (laughter) and it stuck.
Speaker 1: So do you, did he--he didn't talk about growing up.  Did he talk about his growing up, you said no?
Speaker 2: He, he talked about growing up in Columbus.
Speaker 1: Right so.
Speaker 2: He talked about his Columbus years and not so much about his--
Speaker 1: So, so tell about, so what age--do you know what age he was when he moved from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He, he--
Speaker 1: Did he move from Promise Land [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yeah they moved from Promise Land to Columbus.  I, I think he was a, you know junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Like maybe twelve, eleven, twelve, thirteen something like that.
Speaker 1: And did he talk about the time in Columbus 'cause you said he went to East High School and?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know he talked about you know just having a hustle, cutting lawns, doing landscaping work, you know buying old things, fixing 'em up selling 'em.  You know he had some friends who were not good guys and he, you know, leveraged their (laughter) lack of ethics and figure out how to make cash on it.  He was a, he was a hustler.  He had his, you know, he had his fingers in a lot of different things and then he worked after, after high school he went to apply for a job as an iron worker at a place called the Ohio Malleable [Ohio Malleable Iron Company, Columbus, Ohio] and he told the story as the guy asked him if he knew how to operate a furnace and he said, "Oh yeah, absolutely I know you know how to do that," and the guy said, "Okay, let me see you," and he just started trying to figure it out.  He'd never even seen that machine before (laughter) and but he wound up getting that job and worked there for a long time before he and his brother opened a fish market together, about I don't know maybe about eighteen or--well, let's see I was, I was fifteen, or fourteen or fifteen when they opened the fish market called Southeast Fish Market [ph.] in Columbus and they--from there that was sort of how he made his living.
Speaker 1: Now how large, how large a family was he from?
Speaker 2: He had, there were six of them, yeah so he had five brothers and sisters (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 620690
Speaker 1: Do you remember your grandparents on that side?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  My grandfather--I don't ever remember him working so I think--now I don't have a recollection of this, I think he just sort of retired when they moved from Tennessee to Columbus [Ohio] and you know he had--all these kids they bought a nice big house.  They had a sort of what was to me a big house in Columbus and I remember him just always being there and I used to go and stay with my grandparents when I was in kindergarten--before I started kindergarten I would stay with them while my older sister [Marva Nesbitt] was at school.  My parents [Margaret Latham Nesbitt and Marvin Nesbitt] were working and he was always there, and he was mean (laughter).  He wasn't very--he, my grandfather on my father's side just wasn't a very like you know loving grandfather.  I mean, I guess I suppose he was loving but he wasn't cuddly you know.  His name was Babe [Babe Nesbitt] and I can't remember exactly, I can't recall exactly what year he died but he died relatively, when I was relatively young.  I was still in elementary school [Kent Elementary School; Buckeye Preparatory Academy, Columbus, Ohio] when he died and I don't know the details but my grandmother [Myrtle Thompson Nesbitt] just died like three years ago, okay.  So and my grandmother on my father's side she was really, really beautiful, and so I'm now just putting the pieces together as an adult saying you know, I think my grandmother was a lot younger than my grandfather.  Now he--she was ninety-two when she died, so she could've been--let's see if that was in the '70s [1970s], forty years ago she could've been in her fifties when he died.  He must've been in his early seventies.  So they might have been fifteen or sixteen years apart or something like that, and I haven't quite put the pieces together and I need to do that before, before we lose everybody, but I think she was his second wife, but I'm not quite sure.  Nobody ever really ever talked about it.  I don't know if you've--you've probably heard this kind of stuff as you do The HistoryMakers.  Nobody really talked about it. I think because I have some uncles on my father's side that I'm not sure why I call 'em my uncle and I think I call 'em my uncles because they're my father's half-brothers okay, so.  But the interesting thing was a whole bunch of Nesbitts came to Columbus at around the same time because they all bought houses in the same neighborhood 'cause my--you know my grandfather lived on the street, my uncle lived across the street from him, my father bought a house, so there were probably four or five households of Nesbitts right in sort of a two or three block area, that was growing up and we run from house to house you know in the summertime, sleep wherever you ended up.  All you had to do was call and say that I'm at Uncle Joe's [Joseph Nesbitt] house or I'm at you know at Aunt Lizzie's [ph.] house or I'm over at Aunt Myrtle's [ph.] house and that was fine.  So we had kind of a whole community going there.
Story_ID: 620691
Speaker 1: Now your mother, can you tell me about her?  Her name?
Speaker 2: Yep, Margaret Latham [Margaret Latham Nesbitt] is her maiden name, Margaret Nesbitt of course later after she married my dad [Marvin Nesbitt].  She was from, born in Logan, West Virginia and her father [Raymond Latham] was a reverend and a coal miner in West Virginia and they wound up moving from West Virginia to Columbus, Ohio because my mother had asthma and the dust from the coal was bad for her and so they moved the whole family to Columbus.  That--there was thirteen kids in my mother's family so she had twelve siblings and they all moved to Columbus.  My mother was really smart, a really good student sort of a straight A student and she actually turned down a full ride scholarship to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] to marry my dad, and so she got married when she was eighteen and they were seven years apart.
Speaker 1: So he was seven years older?
Speaker 2: He was seven years older than my mother.
Speaker 1: Now, how--where was she in the pecking order of the thirteen?
Speaker 2: Somewhere like almost dead smack dab in the middle.
Speaker 1: Okay and--
Speaker 2: She had, let's see had Jerry [Jerry Latham] and Howard [ph.] and Michael [ph.] and Norm [ph.]. She was the fifth youngest.
Speaker 1: Did they--are they, did they all live?  I mean all the thirteen?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh yeah, I mean they're all--I mean they're obviously--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --they're starting to die off now but yeah all thirteen--let's see, everybody made it to fifty.  So I had--they were, and they were all in Columbus, so I think I had something like--
Speaker 1: You have a lot of extended family, wow!
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I had on my mother's side of the family forty-nine, forty-nine first cousins.
Speaker 1: That's a--I mean that's a lot.
Speaker 2: And everybody lived in Columbus, they're there--yeah, they were everywhere, and, and you know then I had probably--I, I have never really counted, but I probably had eighteen or something on my father's side, first, first cousins and so my grandmother [Myrtle Thompson Nesbitt] lived--we--
Speaker 1: Now is this your grandmother on your mother's--
Speaker 2: On my father's side, my grandmother on my father's side lived on a street called Linwood [Avenue] which was the next street over from where we lived on, on Wilson [Avenue] and we lived on the corner of Newton [Street] and Wilson.  They lived on the corner of Newton and Linwood, so an alley separated our houses and they were kitty corner and Newton was a very minimally traveled street.  So holidays, 4th of July for example, my mother and her family would all be at our house and my father and his family would be at my grandmother's house and that whole block was just all kids running around between the houses, eating, playing football, whatever.  They were just--we just owned that neighborhood (laughter).  It was a big family.
Speaker 1: Now did your--now what age was your mother when she, when the family moved?
Speaker 2: I, I think she was twelve or something like that.
Story_ID: 620692
Speaker 1: So did she talk about growing up in West Virginia 'cause she was--they were in the, sort of the backwoods of West Virginia, in a way right?
Speaker 2: Not sort of (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Smack dab in the back, I mean the first time we went there as kids, we said, "You all lived in that?  Thirteen people lived, fifteen people lived in that?"  He said, "Oh no, we couldn't all fit."  So they lived with cousins and relatives and friends.  I mean they had, there was no way they could even live in the houses that were there and I mean describing those places as houses is generous.  They were definitely in the, in the backwoods.  We, we use to laugh as kids just going there.  It's like I can't--we couldn't believe it.
Speaker 1: Now how far is it from Charleston [West Virginia] or anything, is it?  Is it, or is it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know I remember it just being a couple, two or three hours from Columbus [Ohio], maybe four hours (unclear).
Speaker 1: So driving--'cause there was a--that, that's--
Speaker 2: It's not too far from Huntington, West Virginia, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause the drive--it's not that far, there's a lot of relationship between Ohio and West Virginia.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, it's close.
Speaker 1: 'Cause my family--
Speaker 2: It's right there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They share a border.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I, you know people don't realize--I guess when you think about Ohio you just don't think about West Virginia, but West Virginia's right there.  It's not far.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause we just did a program with Skip Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] earlier and there isn't, I mean we couldn't even find production people there.  We take everything down there.
Speaker 2: Oh, out in West Virginia?  Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: So, so but you know if you're you know if you know you kind of want to get over the Mason Dixon Line right, you're going okay well Ohio's right there.
Speaker 1: Right, so now what did she describe about her growing up?  Do you remember, was she more (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In, in, in West Virginia?
Speaker 1: Well, what let's start with Virginia, did she?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean you know look, I don't think there was much happening in West Virginia, you know.  There were, you know they had a big family and my grandfather [Raymond Latham] was a, a reverend and a coal miner and sh- my mother [Margaret Latham Nesbitt] played the piano and there was music always in her house.  My grandfather was a real--had a great, great singing voice and everybody in my mother's family and there a lot, there was a lot of music in the family and everybody played an instrument and there were some, a lot of real talent and so you know I think they were--you know their life revolved around certain, the coal mines, the church and the music until they came to Columbus.
Speaker 1: So she was the middle child, a lot of times the middle children are sort of lost in you know that large group, but did she?  Go on.
Speaker 2: No I just think, I think they were so spread out that you know there winds up being a lot of adults in the younger kids' lives, right?  Because their brothers and sisters are so much older, but that, there (laughter) that just reminds me of my oldest, my oldest uncle.  There were so many, he had so many nieces and nephews, he stopped trying to remember names.  He called all his nephews New York and he called all of his nieces Sweet Thang (laughter), so that's how you knew he was your uncle 'cause, "Hey, New York," everybody would turn around, "Hey Sweet Thang," that's just, that's just what he called his nieces and nephews so.
Speaker 1: So what did she say about moving to Columbus, I mean besides--'cause her--so, did your grandfather--I mean did her father, your grandfather, did he continue to minister, preach when he moved to Columbus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so there was another family called the Byrds, the Byrds and they all moved to Columbus around the same time up from West Virginia this big migration and maybe it had something to do with--I don't understand the history of it like I do Chicago [Illinois] now, but you know maybe there is something to do with work that brought all these people up from West Virginia at the same time.  But they came and established a church together, Hosack Baptist Church [Hosack Street Baptist Church, Columbus, Ohio] and you know it was a, it was a decent sized church.  And I had one side of the pews would be the Lathams and the other side would be (laughter)--I mean we just, most of them they were really big families and they all sort of took ownership of Hosack Baptist Church and their life--lives revolved around that and you know I think at that time I just think coming from West Virginia there really wasn't much of a sense of opportunity, and a path and you know where to go and how to get, how to get there in our family and I think that's kind of reflective--you know it's a lot of talent.  I think that's kind of reflected in sort of how everybody's lives revolved around the church and, and you know their day jobs there.  They're laborers or domestics and that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: That's the black community too, the church was the center, but the church was a very important part of even stability.
Speaker 2: Very, yeah stability and keeping folks on the right track (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 620693
Speaker 1: Can you describe your mother [Margaret Latham Nesbitt] to me though?  You said she was smart.
Speaker 2: So very smart you know, you know very curious intellectually without I think necessarily being on an ambitious path anywhere but just a certain intellectual curiosity.  Very, you know wise and loving and giving.  Very religious so she played the piano for the choir, was the choir director at the church, you know a, a, a church girl (laughter) you know I think is how I would describe her in her youth.  But also very you know as a mother, very aware of wanting you know a better way of life for her children than, than she had and focused on that without being pushy or demanding but focused on how do I get the best education for my kids and create opportunities for them that I didn't have, because it was true and she was very cognizant of it that every generation in their family had done better than the prior generation and she felt an obligation that we had more opportunities than, than she did.
Story_ID: 620694
Speaker 1: How did your parents meet?  Did your father sweep her off her feet? Is that what happened?
Speaker 2: So funny story. They met at a skating rink, and my mother--
Speaker 1: Roller, roller skating (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Roller skating rink and my mother, of course, couldn't skate (laughter) so she was only watching on the side and my father was like the best skater in the whole place, right?  And she tells the story that he was just showing out and, and you know trying to do every slick move he had and ran smack dab into the wall, but apparently had told, you know, when he saw her that--told his friends he was going to marry her.  So that's how they met that, that day.
Speaker 1: And seven years apart too, so he was--
Speaker 2: Seven years apart.  So he was, yeah he must've been in his early twenties at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay now how many siblings in your family?  Give me your, your birth order of kids in your family.
Speaker 2: I have an older sister, Marva Nesbitt and then there's me and then I have a younger sister Marjorie [Marjorie Nesbitt].
Speaker 1: You liked the Ms.
Speaker 2: Margaret [Nesbitt's mother, Margaret Latham Nesbitt], Marvin [Nesbitt's father, Marvin Nesbitt], Marva, Marty, Martin [HistoryMaker Martin Nesbitt] and Marjorie.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's so many (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's nice though.
Story_ID: 620695
Speaker 1: So what is your earliest memory of growing up, Marty [HistoryMaker Martin Nesbitt]?
Speaker 2: You know my earliest memories are being in the house that, you know, I spent most of my earlier years in running back and forth between my grandmother's [Myrtle Thompson Nesbitt] house and our house, helping in the garden.
Speaker 1: How old are you at this time that you're (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know probably three or four you know.  I remember always being in the garden eating tomatoes, sneaking and picking tomatoes and eating them out of the garden and sneaking cookies out the cookie jar in my grandmother's house, and it was okay to get caught by my grandmother, but not by my grandfather [Babe Nesbitt] (laughter), who was mean and you know and then I remember finally making--and I had a lot of cousins around so my Uncle Joe [Joseph Nesbitt], my father's brother, closest brother, closest sibling lived around the corner and he had two sons and they were both a little older than me, but I always hung around them and then my father [Marvin Nesbitt] and his brother's best friend [Collins Eberhardt] lived on the same street and he had three boys and so there were just a whole crew of us and I just remember you know we'd all meet early in the morning on the corner.  You know even when I was in kindergarten and they were, they were older and we'd all walk to school together.  Our fathers were all very, very close and they used to hunt, they used to go rabbit hunting and they would--you could never do this today, but they would wait 'til we went out for recess at school and then they would drive up in their trucks and cars and we would hop the fence and jump in the trucks with them and they'd take us hunting and we wouldn't (laughter) go back to school you know, so I remember those days.  And then they would take--after we hunted they'd take us to--you know they'd stop at a bar and get a beer and you know they'd buy us orange Crushes and we drink pop or root beer, something after a day of hunting and then we would go home and clean the rabbits that we caught and put 'em in the freezer, and so I remember--you know I have a lot of fond memories of that.  I remember we had this neighborhood, we had some of these big, it was all sports, of course all these boys and there were sports around and every street had a team, a football team and you know the younger six, seven year olds would start these football games like the you know the Wilson wildcats that was our team.  We played the Linwood [Avenue] lions right, and we'd get playing and then one team would start winning and they'd--kid would run off and go get an older kid that lived on his block and then one of 'em on our team would go get an older kid that lived on our block and by the time you got to the middle of the afternoon this thing had all escalated where there would be all high school kids playing football and all the little kids who started the game would be on the sidelines watching, but it was very, you know, sports kind of dominated my early childhood.  You know we just--
Speaker 1: Do you think it was football because of Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] or I mean 'cause I--you know I was thinking you were gonna say basketball.
Speaker 2: Well, football, well I think it was a couple of reasons.  One, football yes because one it was easy, we could play in the street or we had these parkways on Wilson [Avenue] where we lived.  There were parkways--these, it was like an oval like the size of a race track right in the middle of the street and there was grass and we could play tackle football right in front right--it was like a little football field right in front of our house, so it was easy and then Ohio's just a big, big football state and I didn't really get into basketball.  I mean I played basketball 'cause my uncle had a basketball court in his backyard.  So I played it all the time, we played it all the time but football was more important until--to me, until I got to probably tenth grade [at Columbus Academy, Gahanna, Ohio] where they sort of, they flip flopped and I started to be more into basketball than football (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's--okay.
Story_ID: 620696
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up, and I'd like if you could go all the senses, but.
Speaker 2: Well you know when I think about the sights, I mean I think about that parkway in front of our house and I think about the alley between Wilson [Avenue] and Linwood [Avenue] because that was my path to all the boys (laughter), 'cause I only had two sisters [Marva Nesbitt and Marjorie Nesbitt] and so I was always--shot out of the house, out the backyard, out the back gate behind our house and down the alley to my--the Eberhardts. That was my father's [Marvin Nesbitt] and uncle's best friend Collins Eberhardt.  They lived behind us three or four houses down and I would shoot out our back gate, run up the alley and into their backyard and run right into their kitchen and then we'd run right out their front door and run down the street to my uncle's house.  And so the, the sort of the visual of that neighborhood and running back and forth is, is you know top of my--you know my mother [Margaret Latham Nesbitt] was a very, very good cook and so the, just the smells of you know what she whipped up every day.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Like the ham and greens and fried chicken, and you know just everything you think you'd find in a you know--so every kind of soul food you can--banana pudding and you know, and everything she made was just--she just was good, she's really a good cook.  I mean people all still say that Collins Eberhardt use to say, "Marty [HistoryMaker Martin Nesbitt], I don't even like ham," (laughter), "but your mother--," it's the only ham he'll eat is when my mother cooks it.  So she's just a, she's a really phenomenal cook.  So I, I--the smells of, of that I remember, and you know my mother played the piano.  She played the piano all the time and so just coming in the back door from the kitchen I could hear her on the piano playing gospel music.
Speaker 1: What was one of her favorite songs, do you remember anything you--?
Speaker 2: You know, 'Amazing Grace,' well listen she played--she was the choir director so she played everything and even as the music became more contemporary gospel music she would, she would play all that, all that stuff you know just everything.
Speaker 1: So what is your earliest--
Speaker 2: 'Precious Lord.'
Speaker 1: 'Precious'--'Take My Hand' ['Take My Hand, Precious Lord'].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah just whatever.
Speaker 1: So what, what--so you grow up in the family church, is that what you're telling me or--what church did you attend?
Speaker 2: Yeah Hosack Baptist Church [Hosack Street Baptist Church, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: For your whole growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, now so the, the--those memories and sights and sounds are all sort of from pre- you know pre-kindergarten through seventh, sixth, seventh grade [at Crestview Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio].

Speaker 1: And then it's interesting because it's a clear sort of demarcation sort of at, at that time all the innocence of childhood and all that stuff started to go away and some of my cousins and friends you--you know first they would start out smoking and then they started marijuana and all of these, all of these innocent boys all focused on sports, started really taking different paths, and I was always a really good student and like I always got straight A's in elementary school and, and my cousins were all protective of me for that reason and so for example when they would all like start experimenting with cigarettes and pass 'em around they wouldn't let me have a cigarette.  "Nah, you're the smart one, you know, you're the athlete, you're not, you can't do this," and even when they started it, then it sort of escalated to drugs and they started smoking marijuana and that kind of stuff.  They were like--first they would not let me experiment and then they would not even do it when I was around, you know and I'd walk in on 'em and they would you know tuck it all away and so that was kind of--things started to change and, and my mother [Margaret Latham Nesbitt] sent us--and they had desegregation of schools around this time and I'm thinking this must've been in the early to mid-'70s [1970s] and so we--
Speaker 2: Busing?
Speaker 1: --had an opportunity (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Busing.  Was it busing?
Speaker 1: So we had an opp- my mother--we had an opportunity to leave the neighborhood schools and go to a different school.
Speaker 2: Is that--what school was that?
Speaker 1: So we were--where our house was--
Speaker 2: What was that neighborhood school first?
Speaker 1: Yeah the neighborhood school was a--the elementary school I went to was called Kent Elementary School [Buckeye Preparatory Academy, Columbus, Ohio] and then the high school that I would've gone--a junior high school that I would've gone to if I had stayed would've been Roosevelt--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Junior High School [Roosevelt Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Why did they have, someone had to have Crestview?
Speaker 1: Well, well that's where I went.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I left--so my mother did all the paperwork and we got bused from--we walked to Roosevelt High School, Junior High School and we got bused to Crestview Junior High School which was in a white community on the North Side of Columbus [Ohio], right off Weber Road, and I went there as a sixth grader and then, and then so now every day I'm, I'm leaving the community and the friends whose parents didn't bus them were there and they kept sort of that, just escalating and spiraling is better, probably a better word and with their habits and what they were engaged in and, and the first shock to me that something was different was I had a guy who lived down the street who we all idolized, he was older than us but he was a great athlete, great basketball play in the neighborhood.  His name was Tony Jones [ph.] and he got in a fight and shot somebody and that was like a kind of a wakeup call and I don't know exactly what year that was, but that's when I remember um, you know it's different where I am versus and, and where I lived.  So where I was going to school and where I really lived were two starkly different places, and so my memories they kind of shift once I started, once I made that move to this, to this other school and, and I'd sort of think about the places differently.
Story_ID: 620698
Speaker 1: Now, Marty [HistoryMaker Martin Nesbitt] that's also your father [Marvin Nesbitt] and your mother [Margaret Latham Nesbitt] divorced around that time too, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: Right, isn't this--now was that hard for you, as a, a young--?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah it was very hard.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: It was very, very, very hard, it was tough and you know for a while I didn't really deal with it real well and I lived with Collins Eberhardt's family for probably eighteen months or something a year and they, they they're parents so Annette Eberhardt and Collins they were divorcing about the same time but so their boys were all going through the same thing and I went and lived with them, and they all were getting bused to Crestview [Crestview Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio], so we'd walk to--so I had that group of friends at Crestview.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My, my youngest sister [Marjorie Nesbitt] and the Eberhardts all went to Crestview.
Speaker 1: So were--was that decisions that your, both mothers made do you think (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay so, so the mothers were close?
Speaker 2: The mothers were close, yeah we were close.  I mean we were close, close and the mothers talked and we'd get these kids outta here and, and Annette Eberhardt was her name.  I called her Aunt Sweet Pea.
Speaker 1: Sweet Pea.
Speaker 2: Everybody called her Sweet Pea but I called her Aunt Sweet Pea and, and you know she just took me in like come on, we're gonna nurture, you know we're gonna get you through this and you know 'cause I didn't know what was going on but there was dialogue between me and Sweet Pea and my mother and trying to figure out what was the best way to help me get through this transition.
Speaker 1: Well 'cause it's your father.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let's get to through this transition.
Speaker 1: Right, it's your father and you're the only boy.
Speaker 2: I was the only boy.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, so now how about your--what is your relationship with your sisters at this point, 'cause you're--are you like spoiled because you're a boy or you know how girls always have the chores and?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, no, not at all I mean we sit there, everything was kind of split equitably between the--you know I did my rotation in the, in the kitchen and my rotation, I--so, I, you know I carried my weight.  No, they were and always have been very supportive and you know they were always around and available and we, we were close then and they got it and there was no, you know there was no distance between us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that period was you know that was kind of like an eighteen month period. It wasn't that long.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It seemed like a long time at the time but it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well for a young person--
Speaker 2: For a young--yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's a long time, yeah.
Story_ID: 620699
Speaker 1: So I got to--I was at Crestview [Crestview Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio] and--
Speaker 2: Now how are you as a student--I mean I know you said you were a good student but how are you as a young person?  What is going--you know are you quieter you know, are you rambunctious, are you a person who thinks inside their head?  I mean what?
Speaker 1: No I was--I wasn't quiet, I wasn't rambunctious, I was always--you know my recollection is that I was always--adults always--
Speaker 2: Liked me.
Speaker 1: --liked me because I was engaging but well behaved.  I always wanted to please the adults and I always said yes ma'am, and yes sir and did what I was told and didn't get in much trouble unless I was with somebody else who did something bad (laughter).  So I was, I was a decent kid, and I was like that in school. I mean I always remember being liked by teachers and I always remember being a leader in school.  So I was a nice kid, but I wasn't a soft kid.  So I was respected on the playgrounds and, and I remember at Crestview there was another African American kid who was a bully and one day finally--and he was threatened by the fact that I was more sort of the class leader and all the kids sort of--and eventually just the conflict came where we had--somebody had to prove who was boss, and I remember the fight starting and looking over at the teacher (laughter) and she was like rooting for me (laughter), and rather than breaking up the fight so you know I was, I was pretty well respected.
Speaker 2: So you held your own with that fight, did you?
Speaker 1: Come on, I won it.  I was--so I was a nice kid and I was obedient and I was diligent with my students but--with students, but I grew up in a tough neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Right, so you did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was protected from getting involved in all that stuff because my cousins wouldn't let me but you know I fought them.  I was the youngest of the boys in that little crew, but I fought them, I played sports against them.  I was always you know getting pushed around and but I loved to compete and I used to like to say, "Okay, let's wrestle again, let's wrestle again."  So I was, I wasn't afraid to get into it with anybody and I wasn't afraid to compete and so--but I wasn't a bully and I was compassionate and I--you know so I think the teachers really liked that, that sort of combination of this kid's a tough kid, he's not a soft kid but he's a really nice guy, which is what I wanted to be, and I think part of that was my father [Marvin Nesbitt] was a tough guy.  I mean my father was not just respected in the streets but he was feared.  Okay, so I was, so there was that bal- but then my mother [Margaret Latham Nesbitt] was very, very religious and so that was sort of that combination of having both of that, both of those things in the household that I think gave me a sense of, of, of being a leader and a protector but also being compassionate and, and kind and, and that kind of stuff and so I, I mean I just--that was just part of me.  It wasn't intentional, I wasn't conscious of it.  It's just who I was.
Story_ID: 620700
Speaker 1: How did you not go down the other path is what I'm trying to wonder?  Do you think it was the experience at Crestview [Crestview Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio]?  I mean 'cause it's so easy for kids to--I mean you know and especially black boys.  I mean you know--
Speaker 2: No, I think--look, my mother [Margaret Latham Nesbitt] was very religious and she talked to us about, I mean she--my father [Marvin Nesbitt] who drank alcohol for so--so I'll say this but my father had a very high emotional intelligence, okay?  He wasn't intellectual like my mother by any stretch but he knew what was good for us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So though he drank, he never, ever had an ounce of alcohol in our house and it wasn't until I was a teenager that I ever even saw him.  So even when we went hunting we'd stop at a bar, my uncles would drink beer or have a glass of whiskey or something, my father would drink a Coke [Coca-Cola] if I was there.  Okay, so he--and so my mother talked about not smoking in the house, she talked about not drinking and we went to church [Hosack Street Baptist Church, Columbus, Ohio] every Sunday.  Every Sunday we went and then on every Wednesday there was choir rehearsal. I wasn't in it but I had to go and sit there.  And so that was that foundation at home, and then I think as you sort of have a discipline to not en- engage in that stuff early and people respect that and I think my friends and cousins around just wouldn't even let me at a certain point.  They took it as their responsibility to say, "You know you can't do this, you are, you're the smart one, you're--," and they would ask me questions, "Well, Martin [HistoryMaker Martin Nesbitt] figure this out, what is this?"  You know, how do you, how do you do that and you know they would all like laugh and say, "Marty okay can you figure out my homework and show me how to do this," and I was younger, a couple of years younger, but I would figure out their math homework or whatever and you know my mother bought this, the encyclopedias 'cause I think every black family who had you know ambition of getting their kids a better education, 'cause we had this--and I use to sit down and I used to read 'em; like I would spend hours just going through those encyclopedias and reading about everything and, and I wasn't really conscious of it but my mother and my aunts used to always call me the absent minded professor because I'd always forget to take out the trash, and do my chores but I'd always be down there reading those encyclopedias, just reading about everything you know and so when stuff would come up with our friends I would know stuff, right (laughter).  I would describe stuff, I would know what things were, what they were used for.  I wouldn't know anything in depth, but I knew that short definition that was in the encyclopedia.  So, you know people just started respecting who, who I was.
Story_ID: 620701
Speaker 1: Now what was the experience like at Crestview [Crestview Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio] then?  I mean how many black students?  Do you remember any--'cause this is 19 you say '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, let's see I left, I went to Crestview in gosh, let's figure it out.  We have to back up.  I graduated from high school [Columbus Academy, Gahanna, Ohio] in '81 [1981] which means I was there in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nineteen seventy-seven [1977]?
Speaker 2: --seventy-seven [1977] was, I was a freshman at and--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --so it would've been like.
Speaker 1: Seventy?
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974], '75 [1975], '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Somewhere around in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So yeah probably '74 [1974] to--'73 [1973] to '76 [1976] I was at Crestview.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Something like that.
Speaker 1: Was there any discussion about busing in Columbus [Ohio] or were you aware of anything going on?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah I was aware of sort of the social issues and there was a fragment of kids, sort of the, you know the--the, the--(unclear) sort of, I'd say the sort of the ignorant kids that were, wanted to be racist 'cause we were all too young to really know what it was all about anyway, but there were, there was that and there were threats and they'd call us the N word and all that stuff and you know we had to fight and you know run to the bus, but that was a small--that was, that was you know, that wasn't everybody.  It was just a small group of kids.  There were a lot of kids who were fascinated to see black kids you know and they were curious about our hair and, and, and they were nice and they were like a lot of boys who, I remember a lot of boys who were into sports and we'd play sports at recess and, and they were nice, you know there were a lot of--so I don't have--I know there a lot of, there was a lot of racism and stuff there but the way we viewed it because of who we were in our neighborhood and how we--all these boys we could play, we viewed that as sort of the adventurous part of, like we gotta go deal with these dudes who are racists and they gonna call us names and they gonna wanna fight and we gonna--you know, that was kind of the adventure part of it and then there was the new friends part of it, and there were a lot of white kids there who we really loved.  You know like oh, he's cool, and he's cool and we you know we all laughed and tried to figure out how to tell 'em apart right, because when we got there I know they said we all looked the same but I thought everybody who had blonde hair I was like--you know 'cause I had never been exposed to white people.  I had not been around 'em and so it took me like a couple of months to figure out you know who different people were.  If they had the same hairstyle I'd, I struggled, but you know that, that was really the way it was.  I mean and they had the same issues and we would laugh about it, I mean we were kids and so we, I, I became really good friends with a lot of, a lot of kids, a lot of white kids on campus.
Speaker 1: Now you say on campus?
Speaker 2: Well, it was at the school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was in the school, at the school.
Story_ID: 620702
Speaker 1: But, but the other question I have for you Marty [HistoryMaker Martin Nesbitt] is, is this--how many?  Well first of all your best friend Eberhardt, is he in school with you too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, so there were three, there were four Eberhardt kids, three of them Brian [Brian Eberhardt], Kevin [Kevin Eberhardt] and then Annette [sic. Nannette Eberhardt] all went to Crestview [Crestview Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, but Brian was your age?
Speaker 2: Brian was, Brian was my age and Kevin was my younger sister's [Marjorie Nesbitt] age.  How do you know all this?
Speaker 1: No, I don't, I'm just listening to you okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You remember that stuff?
Speaker 1: Okay, no I do, (laughter), I listen well.
Speaker 2: So yeah and, and so we all went to Crestview, and then my oldest sister, Marva [Marva Nesbitt] and their older brother, they had an older--another older brother Steven [Steve Eberhardt] who was the same age as my sister.  I don't know where Steven went.  Steven and Marva went--Marva went to a, a--got bused to a different school.  I think it was because she was in, she went to Whet- she was in high school at the time I think.  So she went to Whetstone High School [Columbus, Ohio] which was all--in the same North Side of the city and I'm not sure where Steven--I think Steven never got bused.  He went to East.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh he went to East?
Speaker 2: He went to East High School [Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Well East High School was an all black experience really.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: That everybody wanted, and everybody wanted to go to East.
Speaker 1: Right, right--no, 'cause I remember even growing up in Newark [New Jersey], we were such country bumpkins.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right, right yeah.
Speaker 1: We tripped over (laughter), (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everybody wanted to go to East High School.
Speaker 1: They have a good team.
Speaker 2: They had good sports, they had the orange and black colors, the Tigers [East Tigers], everybody.  My father [Marvin Nesbitt] went to East and so their parents let them go to East, it was a mistake but--
Speaker 1: So now what, so how are you and your best friend you know, how do you do in that experience at Crestview?  How were you and Brian or is it just?
Speaker 2: Nah we both--did find out Brian though we were the same age, his mother [Annette Eberhardt] had held him back a year so he was in the same class as Kevin his brother and my sister.  So I was a year ahead of them, but you know we all did fine and we had fun.  I mean we just, we were like playful, we like, we made fun out of everything.  So, we did not complain about going to Crestview, we like we dug it.  I mean it was a new adventure.  We (unclear) and we played sports and then but so we would have to take the city bus back home because the school bus left right after school so we had, we would have to take the bus and we'd go downtown.  And transfer and then come back to (unclear), and we didn't complain about going to Crestview.  We, we really liked it.
Story_ID: 620703
Speaker 1: So how, the teachers, the experience with the teachers, they were fine and there was?
Speaker 2: They, they were fine.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher there?
Speaker 2: I liked, I liked 'em all, I mean I liked--I had a math teacher named Ms. McCormick [ph.], I remember she was good.  I liked--I had my teacher in the sixth grade was Ms. Chamberlain [ph.] and Ms. Chamberlain loved the Buckeyes [Ohio State Buckeyes] and if--it right--if they lost, on Monday morning she would wear all black and she would pull the curtains down and it was a horrible day if they lost, and she was a tough teacher and but I--she, she came to like me.  I remember being liked by the teachers, I didn't have any--there was no, I didn't feel like there was any racism or, or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I think part of that--only thinking back okay, not--I didn't, wasn't thinking this at the time but I think part of it was the kid I was you know.  I was a pretty nice kid you know and I was engaging and I was empathetic and, and I was kind to other kids, but I was a leader and so I think they, I think teachers liked me.  In fact, when I later got to high school [Columbus Academy, Gahanna, Ohio], there were some negative blow back from other kids because they thought I was like the teacher's pet you know, that kind of thing.  Ms. Distlehorse [ph.] was an English teacher, now 'cause I went--Crestview [Crestview Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio] was an elementary and junior high school so I went--
Speaker 1: So six, seventh and eighth (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went from six, it went, well I think it went from--
Speaker 1: To ninth?
Speaker 2: Kindergarten all the way, kindergarten all the way to ninth grade.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: 'Cause that was before they did a middle school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right. That was before middle schools, right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It went to ninth grade.
Story_ID: 620704
Speaker 1: One day a counselor came up to me at Crestview [Crestview Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio] and said, "Look, you know, there's this organization called A Better Chance and they give scholarships to kids to go to private schools.  You should really apply for this and go interview," and so I remember on a Saturday morning my mother [Margaret Latham Nesbitt] took me to this big interview hall and there was hundreds, thousands of kids in there.  They were all being interviewed for a scholarship, and I wound up getting picked for this scholarship.  There was another African American kid at Crestview who was a good friend of mine who I think was their first choice, but his family made too much money.  His father was a principal and his mother--and he was a more disciplined student than I was, but his--he didn't qualify because he was--their household income was too high.  So I was the choice, and so I left Crestview after eighth grade, and I got this scholarship and I went to the Columbus Academy [Gahanna, Ohio], and that changed the trajectory of my life, that move.  I went to the Columbus Academy which had been around for hundreds of years, a hundred years and when I went on the campus the first time I didn't, I hadn't, I didn't even know it existed.  I didn't even know what it was, and it was this big old rolling campus, this brick buildings, a beautiful place.  I had no idea it was even there, and but I got this scholarship and I went there and so in the ninth grade I went to a private, all boys private school.
Speaker 2: Now is, isn't there a girl's version of the--
Speaker 1: The Columbus School for Girls [Columbus, Ohio] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Columbus School for Girls.  So this is--how close are they located?
Speaker 1: The sister school.  Columbus School, well the Columbus Academy was in Bexley [Ohio] on Nelson Road between Main Street and Broad Street and CSG, the Columbus School for Girls was right around the corner like Drexel [Avenue] and Broad, but in the early '60s [1960s] the Columbus Academy moved from their campus on Nelson Road to Gahanna [Ohio] and so they were probably fifteen minutes, twenty minutes apart at that point, but they still had the brother sister school relationship.  They were our cheerleaders 'cause we use to share the same track and for, for track and field and did all our parties and activities together.
Speaker 2: Can you talk about--now A Better Chance when was it first created though?  Do you know?
Speaker 1: I don't know when A Better Chance was created.
Speaker 2: You know because Deval Patrick [HistoryMaker Deval L. Patrick] also did A Better Chance.
Speaker 1: Is that right?
Speaker 2: Did you know that?
Speaker 1: I did not know that.
Speaker 2: 'Cause he was here in you know Chicago [Illinois] now but a lot of times they you know people got placed in eastern schools so I you know.
Speaker 1: I was lucky.  Well, I'm not sure I was, I'm, I'm not sure what--Columbus Academy had a spot, it was in my neighborhood, not my neighborhood, in my city so I stayed. I had another friend, a woman, a girl at the time her name was Sidney Davis [ph.] and she also won A Better Chance scholarship and she wound up going to a school in Syracuse [New York], and then she, after she graduated she went to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  I haven't seen her in twenty-five years, but I remember we were friends and we both got the scholarship.
Speaker 2: Were you friends at Crestview?
Speaker 1: We were friends.
Speaker 2: Or in the neighborhood?
Speaker 1: Yeah, how did I meet her?  Her--she had a cousin who played, was in sports and stuff and I met just became she came to games and stuff so we met then, but anyway we were, we were friends and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --we both wound up getting a scholarship.
Speaker 2: So they interviewed you and?
Speaker 1: Interviewed me, then I had to take a test and you know they took my, you know, like transcripts and all that and financial aid information and I got the scholarship.
Story_ID: 620705
Speaker 1: I want--two things I want to ask you. Do you remember the day you got your letter of acceptance?  Do you remember that day, and do you remember the first day of school [at Columbus Academy, Gahanna, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I remember, yes, I--well I remember finding out that I got the scholarship through the counselor at school [Crestview Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio], and not getting a letter at my house.  I don't know why.  Maybe their letter did come to the house, I just wasn't aware of it, and I remember I played football, little league football once I got to the sixth grade.  So I was a football player, I mean I had a lot of experience.  First of all, we played football every day practically in the neighborhood and then I started playing little league football when I was in the sixth grade, and then so by the time I got to ninth grade I was, I knew I wanted to play football so I went to campus for two days before school started.  So I started going to the school before school started, and I remember the coach asking me if I'd ever played football before and I said, "Yeah," and he said, "What position did you play?"  And I said I played cornerback which is a defensive back, right.  He thought I said quarterback which I've never played quarterback, right.  So he made me a quarterback and that lasted for my whole freshman year 'til he really figured out I couldn't throw a football.  You know I was not a very good quarterback, but I couldn't find the way to tell him, "No.  I said cornerback not quarterback," (laughter), but so I remember that and I was very small at the time.  I was kind of a late bloomer physically so I would--I mean I was, I weighed like 118 pounds and this was a high school.  I mean these kids, some kids were over two hundred pounds, and then I remember--so when I got, when school finally started I, there were a certain set of guys that I knew because they were on the football team, but I wasn't respected on the football team because one, we hadn't started playing yet; and two, I was really small.  And I remember walking--well, now this was a campus and there were different buildings and it was on you know, I don't know a hundreds of acres that this school was on and I remember walking from one of the academic buildings towards the cafeteria and being challenged by a kid and he was behind me, and we were walking down the stairs and there were a bunch of boys around and he was making you know sort of these, sort of derogatory jabs at me while I had my back turned and sort of poking me on my back and I stopped on the stairs, I turned around and I grabbed him around his neck and I wrapped his head around the rail, this metal rail and he had braces and his mouth started bleeding and I was--just made the statement that it doesn't happen this way, right (laughter).  I'm--the guy you think I am, I'm not that guy.  I mean I'm a nice guy, I'm gonna be a nice guy and respectful but I'm, you're not gonna bully me, and that sort of established who I was on campus, but I was still very, a very you know nice kid, but I grew up a lot at, at school, both physically and emotionally and.
Speaker 1: In what way?
Speaker 2: You know a lot of things were very different there, the traditions and the hierarchy and sort of the you know, you know the path that you were expected to take and the hurdles you had to cross and just the whole way things were systematized and traditionalized there and I had no, I had no respect for that kind of system when I came.  I didn't know how to respect it and I you know, as a freshman I think I was a little immature and sort of ignoring some of the rites of passage and stuff that they had set up there, but I quickly adapted and, and learned to respect sort of the way things worked and, and what the expectations were, but it was also very challenging for me academically because up to that point I was never really challenged academically.  I could you know get A's you know without really trying that hard and I--it took me a couple of years to figure out you know you gotta do the work, you gotta do all the work like in advance so you can review it, so you can (laughter) you know, and so there was a period while I was smart enough to do you know okay, I wasn't performing at sort of my potential because I just didn't have the skills.  Nobody had taught me how to prepare for the rigor that was at that school.  So there was a period of adjustment there.
Story_ID: 620706
Speaker 1: Does it take you, you know you're until your junior year to find your step, or you said it--you know to understand what studying was about and--but I wanna ask a question before that.  How many blacks are at Columbus--you know, you call it CS, Columbus School?
Speaker 2: Columbus Academy [Gahanna, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Columbus.
Speaker 2: Yeah, CSG is the Columbus School for Girls [Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: The Columbus Academy is where I went.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how many blacks are there?
Speaker 2: There are--in my class there are four of us, a set of twins, me, and another guy, yeah there were four of us.
Speaker 1: Okay and so does that mean like there're sixteen in the whole school then?
Speaker 2: Probably not, that was probably a--oh, no there were five of us, there were five of us.  I'm forgetting another guy, but one guy didn't make it.
Speaker 1: He didn't finish?
Speaker 2: He fin- he, yeah he--after his freshman year he dropped out so there wound up being four of us, Kevin Richardson, Mike Crawley [Michael Crawley], Matt Crawley [Matthew Crawley] and me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I hope I'm not forgetting anybody else in my class. That would be horrible.
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, Kevin, there were brothers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mike and Matt Crawley were twins.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see okay.
Speaker 2: So Kevin Richardson, Mike and Matt Crawley and me.
Speaker 1: Are they all from--were they, they weren't all Better Chance [A Better Chance], though?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: I was the only scholarship student (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I see, so did they come different social economic?
Speaker 2: Yeah they were more solidly more middle class.  Kevin Richardson's parents were both in academics.  I think one--his father was a--his mother was a principal and his father taught school, oh I think.  But his father has a college education, neither of my parents [Margaret Latham Nesbitt and Marvin Nesbitt] had a college education.  My mother got a college degree at around the same time I did, but Kevin Richardson's father I think was like a Division I basketball player at Missouri [University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri] or something, and Mike and Matt Crawley's grandfather was a doctor so and I think that his grandparents helped them through, through school, so they were really more solidly in the middle class and I was, you know, not.  Now, if it weren't for my parents' divorce I may have not been able to qualify for that scholarship either, I'm not sure but there were--so there were four of us.  There were, you know and then there were a handful in the other classes.  There might have been twelve or thirteen altogether, something like that when I was a freshman and then that sort of fluctuated as one class graduated and another class started.
Story_ID: 620707
Speaker 1: But the same time I started at Academy [Columbus Academy, Gahanna, Ohio] there was a new headmaster. He came his first year and he had moved there from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], his name was Bo Dixon and he and I really connected.  He kind of understood where I was coming from.  He had spent his whole career, his whole--(unclear) he was a white man, probably in his mid thirties or late thirties at the time when he got this job, his first position as a headmaster, and he had spent his whole life in private schools and he went to Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Undergrad and, and but for some reason he and I really connected.  He liked me, I liked him and he brought in a headmaster--the head of the Upper School named Tim Golding, who I really liked too, who, who liked me, and so they were as compassionate and patient and understanding as you could ever hope for.  I mean they really kind of nurtured me, I mean where they could've easily said you know, they could've given up on me early on and it could've been a horrible experience, but they really nurtured, and then the football coach when I was a freshman, he was kind of an army guy, tough regimented you know he was, he was good for me because he made me like you know, "Get here on time," "Do your homework," and I had him for an algebra class and I really, that, that his class helped me realize that I was capable of doing it because he was so regimented that you know he made me, because I was on his team, "Give me your homework every day."  We had a test every Friday so there wasn't time to fall behind right (laughter), and, and so he knew I was academically capable because I always got A's in his class because he was just on top of me the whole time and I, so he--I started learning how to study and how to prepare in his class, and so things just kind of fell the right way for me but I was, I think as a kid I didn't shut, shut them down.  I mean I was open to listening and taking their advice and, and you know all the things that were my own personal characteristics before I brought to the school and they were receptive to that.  So I think you know they stuck with me.
Story_ID: 620708
Speaker 1: Then as a sophomore, when I was a sophomore [at Columbus Academy, Gahanna, Ohio], Bo Dixon brought in a new basketball coach [Jack MacMullan] and athletic director and he was probably the most important, became the most important figure in my life at that point.  He really, he was an assistant coach on a football team and a head basketball coach and I went through this physical transformation between my freshman and sophomore year.  So I went from being this very small 118 pound kid to a six foot, 170 pound sophomore. I just grew like crazy overnight and I went from being the third string running back on the freshman football team to the starting varsity running back as a sophomore and this, there was a senior who had been a three year starter who was coming back and you know he came back to, for his senior year I think and he had that job and they decided it was so close between the two of us at the time we got the first game that they said you know okay, they let him play the first quarter and they said okay--they gave him the benefit of the doubt.  I thought I outplayed him all through you know training camp and all the scrimmages and everything but they gave him the benefit of the doubt.  He was a senior, he had been a starter and so they said, "Okay he'll play the first quarter.  Nesbitt [HistoryMaker Martin Nesbitt] you'll play the second quarter and whoever has the best performance is our starter from, for the rest of the season."  And so he played the whole first quarter and they put me--and the score was zero, zero at the end of the first quarter and I'll always remember it's a big moment in my life, right?  So I go in at the beginning of the second quarter, the first play I'm in they call my play and they call my number and they give me the ball.  Gone, sixty yards, touchdown, never looked back and so I had the job and that was a moment of like, a moment of success and where I really felt like man I'm--you know, there's--I'm unique in some way.  I can really, I'm really good at this game, and I started to, things really started to come together for me.  I started being more confident in the classroom and--
Speaker 2: Now this is sophomore?
Speaker 1: That was my sophomore year.
Speaker 2: That's your sophomore year, okay.
Story_ID: 620709
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so the year this basketball, our basketball coach came to the academy [Columbus Academy, Gahanna, Ohio].  His name is Jack MacMullan.
Speaker 1: MacMullan--I was gonna say, I've heard, I mean it was written about you know I read about his influence on you so.
Speaker 2: And he was and so he, he, he was a very--I mean between Bo Dixon and Jack MacMullan, I mean I think, two very unique, powerful educators, special, special guys.
Speaker 1: So it was the creating of the structure?
Speaker 2: It was the creating the structure and it was.
Speaker 1: Accountability?
Speaker 2: It was, it was accountability, it was installation of discipline, like this is going to be hard, right?  This is going to be the hardest thing you ever do, but that's what it takes, you know?  And you, and we're gonna do it, so we were sophomores.  The basketball team, he came, he couldn't believe how bad the team was, and his first year there we won one basketball game.  We won one--we were 1 - 20.
Speaker 1: Now you're playing, what teams are you playing at that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: So we're playing, well at this time we're playing all this sort of, all the, a lot of suburban schools, New Albany [New Albany High School, New Albany, Ohio], Dublin, Marysville [Marysville High School, Marysville, Ohio], Olentangy [Olentangy High School, Lewis Center, Ohio], Westerville, those kind of schools, and that changed over time 'cause we got better but we won one game as, as sophomores and then, but he worked us and he changed the whole culture and he opened up the gym and he had all kids from the city come to play and we played--if you didn't show up every day in the summer to play, there was a problem and my junior year we were, we won, we went from winning one game to winning twenty.  We were 20 - 5 in my junior year.  We made it to the regional finals and then my senior year we were 29 - 1.  We lost one game, we lost the state championship game.  That's the only game we lost and so and but he was organized, disciplined.  He had this tremendous capacity for unconditional love which was--the way, the way he felt about you and treated you wasn't conditioned on how good you were or how well you played or how your grades were.  It was unconditional and it was a powerful, it was a powerful inspirational way to treat kids and he just raised the expectations for us on everything and if I didn't do well in a class, he'd call me to his office and he'd have the test sitting right in front of him, um-hm, you know and so he was, he was--and they were a team, MacMullan and Dixon.  They were, they were powerful.
Story_ID: 620710
Speaker 1: And you know so academically I started to really grow and mature and became a better writer.  I always a good math student, and.
Speaker 2: That's what I was wondering.  So you liked math more, where were you on?
Speaker 1: I was just, I was good at it, but I was kind, I was--as it turned out I mean I was pretty well rounded.  I became a pretty decent writer at the school [Columbus Academy, Gahanna, Ohio] and I really started to get into it and you know have some success.  You know that kind of fuels everything and I just really started to feel like I could compete with anybody there academically and that was one thing about me.  I think a personal characteristic of mine was that I loved competing.  I didn't really care for--I loved winning, but the only thing I hated worse than losing was not competing, and so I just loved competing.  So once I got in the classroom I figured out man I can compete and if I really study I can get a grade as good as this guy you know and I really started to go after it and, and so I--you know had, but wound up being successful there.  I was captain, I became captain of the football team.  We had all this great success.
Speaker 2: Right, so you were playing football and basketball?
Speaker 1: And basketball.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay and now what about Todd Alexander, wasn't he--he was on the basketball team too?
Speaker 1: He was on the football and basketball team.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: And he was one of my better friends there, still is and he wound up going to the Naval Academy [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland] playing basketball there and Kevin Richardson--it was great because everybody (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kevin Richardson was black, right?
Speaker 1: He was black.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Kevin Richardson wound getting a full ride basketball scholarship to William and Mary [College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia] and he played there.  Mike Crawley [Michael Crawley] was really good, track, really good at track and field and he wound up running track at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].  As I said Todd went to the Naval Academy.
Speaker 2: What about his brother?  What about Matt [Matthew Crawley]?
Speaker 1: His brother, his brother--it's funny because they were twins and Mike was always the better athlete.  His brother just wound up going to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] and--not just, he went to Ohio State and became a doctor.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And Michael was in IT [information technology], and works for the federal government.
Story_ID: 620711
Speaker 1: So now when it comes--what other things are influencing you?  So school has a major influence?
Speaker 2: So it had a major, major--
Speaker 1: Major?  It was (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean it was the, no it was the.
Speaker 1: It was everything?
Speaker 2: The Columbus Academy [Gahanna, Ohio] was the, I mean now, now, now at this point by the time I'm a junior and senior, you know you got crack cocaine epidemic in my neighborhood it's, I mean people are in jail.  Now all the guys that I played football with and hung out with, they are--I can tell you, Tony Jones [ph.], in jail for shooting a guy.  Another guy, Tony Battle [ph.] was hanging out with him, used to play basketball with, basketball and football with us, he was with them when they shot the guy.  He's in jail, my cousin drugged, all, all drugged out.  His brother who had enrolled into the [U.S.] Army, by the time I was in college [Albion College, Albion, Michigan], he killed himself.  He committed suicide at my house, he was staying with my father [Marvin Nesbitt].  He had drug issues and all that kind of stuff.  I would say 80 percent of the boys that like were that, my, that crew that I hung around with, they were dead, or in jail or on drugs.  I mean now the Eberhardt boys made, well the oldest--
Speaker 1: I was gonna ask about them (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) was Steven who went to East [East High School, Columbus, Ohio], Steven Eberhardt [Steve Eberhardt] who went to East.
Speaker 1: You said bad decision?
Speaker 2: Bad decision, wound up--nobody knows exactly what happened, shooting accident, paralyzed from the neck down, shot by accidentally, maybe.  Who knows what really happened.  He--a few years ago died and, but he, he got shot so Bo--Steven's dead, my cousin, my father's--Uncle Joe's [Joseph Nesbitt] son, the oldest one Joe [Joseph Nesbitt] died, suicide.  His brother John [ph.], we called him Timmy, Timmy was his middle name dead, drugs.  Tony Battle his sister, he was involved in drugs, his sister's dead, got shot 'cause they came looking for him.  Just all these people, just around me and I was--I would--lived at home.  First in the morning I'm off to Columbus Academy, I'm in sports every season for the whole year, three sports.  I don't get home 'til eight o'clock at night.  I got three, four hours of homework.  I don't see, I mean I'm just and then my friends start shifting, my non-school friends start turning into all of these other athletes around.  When we got old enough to drive, so all these other athletes at different schools, we started coming together as friends, and so our, my world changed into sort of sports and school, sports and school.
Speaker 1: What happened to the Eber- what about the, the other--Brian [Brian Eberhardt] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So the so the Eberhardts stayed because I think they--
Speaker 1: What about Brian?
Speaker 2: Brian?  They wound up being, having successful careers. I mean they both are in accounting, they both went to college.  They were, they were athletes, they both played football in college and so they, because they got out of that and were going to Crestview [Crestview Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio], it kind of put them on a different trajectory.  You know I think the academy changed my trajectory a little bit from theirs but still I think they were on a very positive trajectory, and they're solid guys. I talk to 'em you know every couple of years or so.  They're doing fine.
Story_ID: 620712
Speaker 1: So what happened, what happened with your college choice?  How did you--how did that come about because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you know, I was originally--so we had a lot of success in basketball.  I was a really good football player, okay?  And so I had a lot of opportunities to play football at places after, after--
Speaker 1: So people came recruiting?
Speaker 2: College. People came recruiting me, and some Ivy League schools, a couple of Big Ten schools [Big Ten Conference], you know a couple of mid-major schools.  I had a lot of opportunities to think about football.  I was the central Ohio player for the year and I was the leading scorer and leading rusher in the whole.
Speaker 1: This was shocking--he (unclear); he was in charge of both teams or?
Speaker 2: No, he was the assistant coach in football.
Speaker 1: Football, okay.
Speaker 2: But he was the head coach in.
Speaker 1: In basketball?
Speaker 2: But I loved him and I loved basketball more.  I liked football, I, but I liked the games more than I liked the practices in football you know you have six days of practice and one game.  In basketball you have like three games a week and practice is fun and so I really wanted to play basketball and I had a lot of pressure to play football so I didn't want to let people down so I decided to try to go someplace where I could play both.  So I wound up going, thinking about Division III schools 'cause I wasn't a good enough basketball player to play at a higher level.  I think I--physically I was talented enough, but I wasn't skilled enough because I was playing all those other sports.  So I wound up going to a school that period- every year a couple of people at academy [Columbus Academy, Gahanna, Ohio] went to called the Albion College [Albion, Michigan] and I just visited a few schools, liked it, decided to go, but I made up my mind when I went there.  Well, so I, I get there on campus before school starts and there's two a days for football.  So I leave the freshman dorm, I'm walking down and there's another guy who was a football and basketball player.  His name was Dave Valkanoff and he was a big, two sports star in Michigan and he and I were the prized football recruits, and he was the quarterback and I was the tailback and we were walking, we were meeting for the first time and walking to the first day of two a days and this other group of guys walks right in front of us, heading in another direction and we ask 'em where they're headed and they said, "Oh, today's the first day of open gym for basketball," and we looked at each other and I said, "Man you know I always liked basketball better than football."  He said, "Me too," and we never went to football, we never showed up.  So the two prize recruits for football never showed up to the first practice.  We went straight to the basketball gym and started playing.
Speaker 1: You could do that?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I mean it was, it was our--that was our choice.
Speaker 1: So you played on the basketball team?
Speaker 2: So I played on the basketball team.
Speaker 1: And he--
Speaker 2: And Dave and I wound up, Dave Valkanoff and I wound up--we were captains, three, three year captains for the basketball team, but, but here's the thing, here's the thing.  We go to that first day of practice and I remember bringing the basketball up court and throwing a pass and this kid ran through the pass, intercepted it, faster than I had ever seen anybody move in my life, and it was at that moment that I knew that my career in sports was limited (laughter).  Right, because here I was at a Division III school, that wasn't even on the map from a basketball standpoint, and the best athlete that I'd ever seen in my life just stole a pass that I threw.  Now, that moment was an important moment for me.  I can--I made up my mind that I was gonna get really good (laughter) grades in college because there were--that this was the end.  I realized that this was the end for me for sports.  That beyond college I, there was gonna be--it was just and sort of I guess I knew that, but you know boys all--you think, you know that's the way boys think, and at that moment I knew he, Tracy Gardner [sic. Tracy Garner] was his name, it changed my life.  Now, I didn't know this then, but Tracy Gardner still holds the national record in the high jump at the Division III level.  So he was 5'10" he jumped like 7'2" or something.  So he was this crazy athlete, I don't even know why he was there (laughter), he should've been someplace else, but he changed my attitude about what I was gonna do in college, and so the first day there--classes hadn't started.  The first day of classes I dove into those books and I started off getting great scores academically and created a great routine and I kept it up through for four years.
Story_ID: 620713
Speaker 1: Now how, how large was Albion [Albion College, Albion, Michigan], how is?
Speaker 2: About two thousand students.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's a small liberal arts.
Speaker 2: Small liberal arts school.
Speaker 1: Okay, was it an adjustment from Columbus Academy [Gahanna, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I was totally, by the time I got to college, totally, totally, totally prepared you know.  I was.
Speaker 1: And what did you thinking you would major in then?
Speaker 2: You know I, but here, here was the other interesting thing though was I hadn't still wasn't, I still didn't know what was out there, right?  I still didn't have a grip on sort of what the possibilities were, and I was thinking boy you know if I could someday like be a city councilman or you know that would be great, or a manager of some store or something you know, I, I kind of sort of had my sights set on like if I could just have you know enough money to, to do this or do that and have a solidly middle class lifestyle that would be really, really cool.
Speaker 1: Now, now with you--why a city councilman? Was there someone that you had seen in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it was just, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: --Columbus [Ohio] politics that you admired--like who?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a city councilman. I was friends with his son.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Jerry Hammond.  I don't know if you remember that name but he was the, he was on city--African American and on city council [Columbus City Council] and lived on the same street that I lived on when I was in high school.  I knew his daughter and I knew his son and you know I just admired him.
Speaker 1: Well that represented success too.
Speaker 2: It represented success to me, and you know when I was in the, the academy I mean the notion of going on a vacation, like when people would say, "Oh, where are you going for Christmas break?"  "What do you mean where I'm going?  I'm going home," (laughter).  They were like, "Oh, we're going skiing and we're going this and that."  That was just even foreign concepts to me.  I had no idea as to what the wealth of possibilities were out there, and so I kept my eyes and ears open at Albion, but I came out with pretty modest expectations as to where I ended up, wanted to end up but I knew I wanted to have a great academic record.
Story_ID: 620714
Speaker 1: And then I had an economics professor (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause this, this is really, this is the early '80s [1980s] you were there from '81 [1981] to '85 [1985] is that it, right.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, and I met a, I had a--so I was in this program called professional management [Carl A. Gerstacker Institute for Professional Management; Carl A. Gerstacker Institute for Business and Management] which was--it was for--
Speaker 2: At Albion [Albion College, Albion, Michigan]?
Speaker 1: At Albion and so it's their accelerated business program, and I had an economics professor there named Larry Steinhauer and Dr. Steinhauer was a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and that's when I first learned about the University of Chicago from him.  I said, "So where did you go, where did you go to school?"  And he's like, "I got my Ph.D. from the University of Chicago."  I said, "Really what was that like?"  And I started talking to him about it and stuff, and was a sophomore and he said, "Yeah, you know you're in the professional management program you should get a, you should think about getting an M.B.A.," and I had met a friend who was in the program whose dad worked for Kellogg's [Kellogg Company] and his father had an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago and so I started getting like what is this M.B.A. thing?  And as a sophomore I had a class, a technical writing class with a teacher who was her first year.  Her name was Geraldine Rothchild [ph.] and she had come from, she was from New York City [New York, New York] and she taught at a small school, I don't know which one outside of New York but lived in Manhattan [New York] and moved to one of the rural, kind of small town lifestyle, get out of the city.  So she came to Albion and she taught a technical writing class, it was like a business writing class that every professional management student had to take and we all were intrigued that she was from New York City and da, da, da.  So we would all sit down and talk to her.  One day she said to me that oh, yeah she had friends that lived in New York that were investment bankers.  I said, "What is an investment banker?"  And she said, "Oh, I don't know what this guy really does, but I know he made seven hundred thousand dollars a year."  And I said, "What? No way. Nobody in the world makes seven hundred thousand dollars."  I had never heard of anything like that.  I mean I, I--the fact that somebody made that much money was a foreign concept to me.  I had no idea, and I was like, "Okay, so now he's--where did he go to school?"  She said, "Oh I think he went to like Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] or something."  I said, "Really?"  So I really started thinking about I wanna get an M.B.A., and I started focusing on it and it's one of those things when you--it's always been this way for me.  It's like if you really want it and you act like you should have it, it comes to you, right? (Unclear), so, I became singularly focused on like I'm going to the University of Chicago and I'm gonna get an M.B.A.  And.
Speaker 2: Is that your sophomore year or your junior year?
Speaker 1: This is my sophomore year, like in the middle of my sophomore year I, I figured that out.
Story_ID: 620715
Speaker 1: I have this, a friend there, Kevin Shrier [Kevin J. Shrier] who is now a partner with me in this business that have The Parking Spot [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: He was at Albion [Albion College, Albion, Michigan]?
Speaker 1: He was at Albion. We met the first day freshman year.  So we all, we started on the--you know I would tell him about stuff and we would like figure it out and so we started on this track together to try to figure it out and I learned as we started interviewing as a, as a senior for jobs.  Now I'd done internships in an accounting firm and I'd--but I learned that General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] had this program that you worked for them and then they gave out these fellowships to certain employees and they paid for them to go to business school, and they paid them half their salary while they were in school and I thought to myself, now how many employees at General Motors?  And they said, "You know there's eight hundred thousand employees," and I said, "How many of these fellowships do they give out?"  "Three."  And some, for some, for some reason in my mind I said, I told myself I'm getting one of those, right?  So I went and I interviewed for a job at General Motors and I got the job.  So I said forget accounting, 'cause I was really kind of focused on I was going to be an accountant, I said forget accounting, I'm going to General Motors.  I wanna work in finance, I'm getting this fellowship, and graduated from Albion.
Speaker 2: So now are you living in, 'cause Albion's in?
Speaker 1: It's in Michigan, it's in.
Speaker 2: But how far from Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 1: It's an hour and a half. It's close.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's close.
Speaker 2: So you're in the area.  So you're living in the suburbs at that point are you when you work at GM?
Speaker 1: Yeah I go; I live in Southfield [Michigan].  So Kevin Shrier has a brother who's older.  Let's see he's eight or nine years older than Kevin so, he already, he's an accountant.  He owns a house in the suburbs of Detroit, he's single.  I graduate, I had lived with him in the summer 'cause I did internships, and so I graduate.  I go to live with him, move in and I start working at General Motors. Now this is how fate works right?  When I get there my first day they're remodeling the offices on the floor where my office was. Where I was supposed to be sitting wasn't an office, I was going to have a cube, but they're remodeling.  There's no place for me to sit, to sit.  There's literally no place for me to sit.  There's only one place that has room for me and it's the office of the treasurer, and literally for the first few months, I'm sitting sharing his desk with him.  He's the treasurer (laughter), I'm sharing his desk with him and I'm like--this is now, see now I know because of Jack MacMullan, I know what it takes, right?  I know this is gonna be really hard.  You gotta work harder than you ever did before, but there's a path, right?  So I'm all, because of MacMullan and Dixon [Bo Dixon], and my academic experience and success I'm now, I'm ready.  I get there the first day, I'm ready.  I know what it takes.  I find out what time he gets to work, I'm there a half hour before him every day.  I don't leave that desk until he leaves every day, right?  I was like I'm getting that fellowship and I, I worked my behind off and all of a sudden he starts sharing his work with me.  He was like, "Okay, they're giving me all these numbers.  I gotta check this, I want you to make sure these things are right."  And I was like, "I don't know how."  He had an HP 12C, I remember the name.  He said, he said, "Can you check to make sure that these--?"  They were these APRs [annual percentage rate] for these special financings, they were on automobiles and there were advertisements that were going out and he had to sign off on that what they were going to say on the commercials were true and correct and he wanted me to check the numbers and I didn't know how to use an HP, right and he gave it to me and he taught me.  So I'm sitting there with the treasurer and he taught me how to use it, and they, they came to me and asked me if wanted to apply for a General Motors fellowship.  I applied for it, I got it, I got accepted into the University of Chicago [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois] and I went.
Speaker 2: And that's what year is that?
Speaker 1: So that was '87 [1987].
Speaker 2: Eighty-seven [1987], so you worked there for two years.
Speaker 1: I worked for General Motors for two years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: After my first year I applied for the fellowship, I got it, I went to the University of Chicago.  Now to be a GM fellow-able, you only had, you could only go to Stanford [Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California], the University of Chicago, Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts].  There were only like five schools you could go to.  They weren't just giving people fellowships anywhere.  There, you had to go to one of the top business schools.  This, this was your, the first filter to the highest level of management at General Motors.
Speaker 2: Did they expect you to come back when it (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 620716
Speaker 1: So back to what we were talking about before.  The General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] thing, the job, getting a job at General Motors in the African American community was the job!  It's like you got a job at General Motors, in Detroit [Michigan], at the world headquarters, on West Grand Boulevard?  You know 'cause we had family members that, that worked at General Motors in factories all over, all over the place.  I mean so they were you know at Fisher Body [Fisher Body Corporation], at Ford [Ford Motor Company], or at Chevy [Chevrolet] at all these different General Motors plants and my first year at GM they asked me to take some photos and they wound up putting me and a couple of other employees on the cover of the annual report.  So all my relatives all over the country who worked at General Motors saw the annual report and they go, "Oh, that's my nephew, that's my cousin, that," so they thought just because I was on the annual report like I had totally arrived, that's just you know we don't know, right?  So I, I was into General Motors because everybody thought it was a good job.  I knew that it would be you know respected in the community and in the family and everything.  So that's why, that was one of the reasons I went.  I mean it wasn't so much that I was into cars, but having General Motors was a prestigious job and in the black community.
Speaker 2: Now this is also the time of--was Iacocca [Lee Iacocca]--was he had taken over Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yep, that yep that was.
Speaker 2: Was it a little bit before or around that time?
Speaker 1: It was a little bit--it was after that because Iacocca had taken over Chrysler when I was in high school [Columbus Academy, Gahanna, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Okay, oh so it was after.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay 'cause, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But he was still there though.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think he was still there.
Speaker 2: 'Cause he--you know these are the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know Reagan's [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] in office.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right, okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Investment banking is big you know, so what are your--what, what do people say when you go to business school [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois], are they like why, or?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so I mean people were like, "Are you out of your mind? You're leaving a job at General Motors to go back to school?"  But I said like, "Nah look, it's a fellowship, they're paying for me to go to school," plus I was getting half of my salary while I was in school so, come on.
Speaker 2: Which you can't beat.
Speaker 1: Come on!  So, that was made it more palatable, but I'll tell you when I, when I got married, well when I got engaged, my wife's [Anita Blanchard] mother was like, "Okay, something doesn't smell right right.  He was working at General Motors and he left to come back to school," you know 'cause it's--you know the pay--that was, it didn't make sense.  As you mentioned earlier, she's like, "This boy something's wrong. Nobody leaves a job at General Motors."  So.
Story_ID: 620717
Speaker 1: When you come to the University of Chicago, 'cause the University of Chicago Business School, had it changed?  Had it--'cause it now has a name now, it's (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Booth [University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois], yeah, it's Booth.
Speaker 1: Was it Booth--was it?
Speaker 2: It was just the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.
Speaker 1: And so how did you find that 'cause it can--the University of Chicago can be intense in some respects.  Was it any different then?
Speaker 2: It was very intense.  It was very intense.  Anyway I felt, it was, I felt kind of isolated with this incredible workload.  Highly, highly quantitative, so it was you know it was a, a quantum shift from even from Albion [Albion College, Albion, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Now where is Steve Schneider at this point?  Is he?
Speaker 2: Oh, Kevin Shrier [Kevin J. Shrier]?
Speaker 1: Kevin, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Kevin Shrier. So when I left and went to General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] he went to work for Andersen Consulting [Accenture PLC] and he came to Chicago [Illinois], yeah and then he got accepted in the business school at Northwestern [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois] the same year I got accepted to the University of Chicago.  So he went to Northwestern when I went to the University of Chicago
Speaker 1: Those are two different business schools--
Speaker 2: Two very different business (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in terms of experiences.
Speaker 2: Oh, and I went down, I went down and went to some of his classes and he came to some of mine, two totally different schools.
Speaker 1: So now what are you thinking you're gonna do after the two years, and I mean when did you meet your--when did you meet Anita [Nesbitt's wife, Anita Blanchard]?
Speaker 2: So I met Anita my first year of business school.  We were at a mixer for African American students in the graduate schools at Robie House [Frederick C. Robie House, Chicago, Illinois] and we met.
Speaker 1: And you got married when, after?
Speaker 2: Three years later.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were a year out?
Speaker 2: In 1990.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what are you--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was a year out.
Speaker 1: You were a year; so what makes you--what are you thinking at that point?  I mean are you--'cause when you get into business school there're different tracks.  Now what did you do between first and second year?
Speaker 2: So I was, I worked at, I worked at Amoco [BP Amoco Corporation; BP Corporation North America Inc.] for the summer and, and (unclear) it was like a financial planning position or something.  And then I was, but I was a major--I had a specialization in finance and a concentration in marketing, and I didn't know what I was going to do, but you know there's--once you get at the business school on campus now you're in a total--you learn about, you know, consulting and you learn about investment banking and all the different disciplines in investment banking.  Now I'm, just the whole world has opened up to me in terms of what professional alternatives are, and so I, I kind of just did a little of this and a little of that and tried to play it out and see what I wanted to do, but I also had an obligation to go back to General Motors.
Story_ID: 620718
Speaker 1: But then Anita [Anita Blanchard] got--and I got engaged and she was like, "Oh, well you can go work, you can go back to work to Detroit [Michigan] if you want, I'm not coming to Detroit," and.
Speaker 2: Now she was in medical school?
Speaker 1: She was in medical school and she, she didn't graduate.  I graduated business school [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois] in '89 [1989] and she didn't graduate until 1990.
Speaker 2: So how did you handle--then what happened?  Did you--you didn't go?
Speaker 1: So I, so I, I wound up going into real estate and at LaSalle Partners [Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's at LaSalle Partners.  Now, who was head of LaSalle at the time?
Speaker 1: Bill Sanders [William D. Sanders] was the head of LaSalle when I got there and then he retired right after I started and Stuart Scott [Stuart L. Scott] became head of the firm.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's right, okay.  And what is LaSalle what are they, what, what appealed to you about that?
Speaker 1: Well, you know it was more of a finance and investment job and that's kind of what I was interested in.  I liked the people, it was a very professional, buttoned up place.  There was something interesting about real estate to me because it had sort of a lot of different facets to it.  You had sort of a physical aspects of it, the architecture and improvements and the aesthetic appeal of it, but you had to sort of market that and you had the investment side of it and the financing and capital markets and you had the whole operating side of it.  If it was a shopping center or office building and how it operated and what the costs and so we had a lot of different elements to it that I thought were interesting and could combine 'em and so because of that and the people and the fact that Anita wanted me to stay in Chicago [Illinois], I took, I took the job.
Story_ID: 620719
Speaker 1: So you took the job, now who are you meeting at this time, 'cause you don't--it's not like you know Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) except your friend, you know you're meeting--
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: --people out of school.
Speaker 2: So, I know, so when I was playing basketball at Columbus Academy [Gahanna, Ohio], I--Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] came to see Kevin Richardson and at our practice and Peter Carril [Pete Carril] told our coach that he liked me and he invited me to come and see them play Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] that, that night or the next night.  He gave me tickets.  I went to the game.  Craig Robinson was on the team and I met Craig that night when they played Ohio State.  When I got to business school Craig was there.  So that was kind of four year (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Craig was at the business school?
Speaker 2: Craig was at the University of Chicago [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: I don't think I knew that, okay, okay.  I don't think I knew that.
Speaker 2: So, so.
Speaker 1: Wow!  I don't think I knew that.
Speaker 2: So, so.
Speaker 1: I didn't know.
Speaker 2: And there were, there were a handful of kids that--from Chicago at the business school, Reggie Ponder [Reginald Ponder], Stephanie Neely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so they kind of knew their way around Chicago a little bit and introduced me to people.  Craig--Reggie Ponder went to Princeton so he kind of helped reinforce that connection with, with Craig, and then basketball I got on the whole basketball circuit and started playing pickup with Craig and that's how I met John Rogers [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) John Rogers.
Speaker 2: Playing basketball, I was just fresh out of business school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Playing basketball with, with John and that's how I met Arne [Arne Duncan].  I mean all those guys on the basketball court and then of course all the people that I met while at Jones Lang LaSalle [LaSalle Partners; Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated, Chicago, Illinois] and then of course Shrier [Kevin J. Shrier] was at Northwestern [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois] and there were people that were staying in Chicago from Northwestern and I met, met his friends and my wife [Anita Blanchard] was from here and she went to Northwestern so the network of people for me to get to know was kind of set in place because I had a lot of connections.
Speaker 1: So how are you finding Chicago at this point?  'Cause it's sort of, it's a different environment than one you've come from you know when you think about it because when I say that you're from, you know you're from Ohio, though still Midwest, you know in all Midwest places but this--had you been in as dynamic a black community before (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, when I came.
Speaker 1: Because that's what I'm I trying--
Speaker 2: So when I came to business school at the University of Chicago that was the first time that I had been around a group of African Americans who I had a real complete sort of connection with, that we, I had a lot in common with sort of academically, you know aspirations you know.  It was a, it was a really good feeling and so I was you know I, I liked it.  I liked the city, you know I was always like you know at Albion [Albion College, Albion, Michigan] I was the you know the best African American student, you know on the campus or I mean if there was a better one I don't what--I can't remember who it was, but you know I was the only black guy in every, in everything I did except for basketball, and you know this is, this was the first time like I wasn't the only black guy in a tough class, right (laughter).   So that was a, that was a good feeling but then I think, but the other, the advantage I had though I think was I was totally comfortable with the non-African American people.
Speaker 1: You were in both worlds.
Speaker 2: I was in both worlds.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was so comfortable and so for me to just kind of to go back and forth between the worlds and you know change, change the dialect if I had to and change the language or, or the cultural norms or whatever, I mean it was, it was easy for me because I had that Columbus Academy, Albion experience and that I had to because there were not a lot of other African Americans staying there.  So when I was here in Chicago, my roommate was Parisian, and he and I are still really good friends and he was a really smart guy, but you know I, I wasn't like, I didn't come to campus like scrambling around trying to find another African American to be a roommate with.  I was like, "Oh, you, where you from? Paris [France]?  Oh, that's interesting let's be roommates."
Story_ID: 620720
Speaker 1: I think my, you know that helped me and it helped me at, at Jones Lang LaSalle [LaSalle Partners; Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated, Chicago, Illinois].  I mean I, I knew exactly the expectations, the language, what was the norm.  There were you know--I knew how to make people comfortable even when I could see, you know you could tell, I could tell immediately if somebody was comfortable around African Americans or not and I think when you're not used to that as an African American sometimes you interpret it as racism, right, or bias when it's really just a discomfort. Now, not that the other doesn't exist, but there's a, there is a subtle difference between the two and being having the capacity to recognize it and then help people get over it kind of helps sort of build, it helps you and you know I think that was certainly the case when I joined Jones Lang LaSalle you know as sort of, there wasn't a whole lot of us and.
Speaker 2: Who else was there besides you?
Speaker 1: When I got there you know Jenny Clark [ph.] was there.  Do you know her?  She was there, in fact she was one of the first people interviewed with.  A guy named Markus Trice.  I don't know if you know Markus Trice, he lives in San Francisco [California] now, and he was there.  There were a couple of other people who were there at the time but they were in different cities and I didn't know them--Alan Braxton [Alan R. Braxton] was there and Herman Bulls [Herman E. Bulls].  Do you know Herman Bulls?  He lives in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], he was there at the time.  So there were five or six of us that, that made it there at the same time, and everybody came out--and Herman went to Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts], and Alan Braxton went to Wharton [Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and I went to the University of Chicago [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois], and you know they only hired people from the top four or five business schools and so you know it was some high, very capable African Americans at Jones Lang LaSalle.
Speaker 2: Now you were there how many years, Marty [HistoryMaker Martin Nesbitt]?
Speaker 1: So I was there seven years.
Speaker 2: Oh you were there seven--okay and you rose to vice president right?
Speaker 1: I was an equity vice president, so it was.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: So it was associate vice president and then you got ownership in the firm and equity vice president.  So I made it to the level of equity vice president and you know I was entrepreneurial.  I, I was kind of always figuring out--looking at different things and looking at things in unique ways and.
Speaker 2: And talk about that, what does that mean?
Speaker 1: Well, so when I was at Jones Lang LaSalle I was responsible for a portfolio of real estate that had an office in it, retail in it.  I was also responsible for all the company's parking assets and you know 'cause we had office buildings that had parking garages to 'em.  We owned some parking garages, we had shopping centers they had big parking components to it and they wanted somebody to kind of focus on those assets and so I was doing that and I was working with all the different parking managers and hiring 'em to you know do certain things (unclear), and I just kind of learned things and, and saw things in an unique way. And then we hit this real estate recession.
Speaker 2: That was the 19--?
Speaker 1: Early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ninety-one, '91 [1991], '92 [1992] something like that and the head of our division said, "Look, I want everybody to look at these assets, look at when we bought 'em and do a retrospect of and tell us, let's figure out what we did wrong so we can learn something from this downturn," and so I did this little study and I, I you know I'd done--oh man the parking assets held up a little bit better than some of the other assets in some unique ways and I started developing a certain--this whole thesis of why, why parking is different as a real estate class than other assets and then I wound up kind of writing a business plan around this thesis on parking.  Showed it to all my bosses at Jones Lang LaSalle and everybody liked it.  Said, "Let's go raise money and build this parking portfolio," but it was a tough time in real estate because there was just bad performance and it was difficult for firms like LaSalle to raise money from sort of the traditional institutional sources.  So we went to, to an untraditional for us, source which was the Pritzker family, a wealthy family and asked if they wanted to invest in the parking assets.
Story_ID: 620721
Speaker 1: And unbeknownst to me when we went to make this presentation, Penny Pritzker had been given my name by a headhunter as a potential candidate to fill a position that she needed to have filled in her real estate operations.  So, they treated this whole thing like, "Man, not only do we have a chance to look at this parking, investment opportunity, but we get to interview this guy and he doesn't even know it," (laughter), right.  So I go to this whole presentation and, and they like me.  She called me back and said, "Hey, you know I probably would never do this deal with LaSalle [LaSalle Partners; Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated, Chicago, Illinois] but you know what's at some point I might think about doing it with you."  I was like, "Here's ten reasons why you should do it with LaSalle.  Here's twenty reasons why you should do it with LaSalle," we, so we started the dialogue between us and over the course of--once I realized she was serious about not doing it with LaSalle no matter what I said, we started talking about this other thing and this other job she had and all this stuff, and finally I just switched and went over to the Pritzker Realty Group [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: So what was she saying that they were wanting to do because Pritzker just for context they owned the Hyatt.
Speaker 1: So the Pritzker family has a broad array of holdings, but the, highest profile is the Hyatt Hotels [Hyatt Hotels Corporation] and the Marmon Group of companies [Marmon Holdings, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] which is you know eighty, ninety different manufacturing companies around the world and then there were other holdings like Conwood [Conwood Sales Company LLC; American Snuff Company] and Royal Caribbean cruise lines [Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd.] and so forth that they have.  So you know a broad array of holdings and they had--Penny Pritzker was responsible for the family's non-hotel real estate.  So she had this function where she was doing office and industrial and retail investment and development, and she had a couple of retail projects that had gone sideways a little bit and she was looking for somebody to come in and sort of rescue 'em. So that's what she was interested in me for and I was like, "You know well that's interesting but this is really what I'm doing."  I read this business plan and, and she said, "Well you come and help me fix these problems and then we'll do this parking thing as partners."  So I went and I, I went over and fixed the, the couple of retail things and then we started off on the parking thing, went to her Uncle Jay [Jay Pritzker] and made a presentation on the business plan.  "This is the business, this is what I want to do," and I was hoping that he'd say, "Okay, well go buy one asset and show me how it works," but we had this long lunch meeting.  At the end of the lunch meeting he said, "You know what this sounds really hard and challenging and I'm really not sure about this," and Penny said, "Jay, you had your chance.  You were willing to work hard, you wanted to make something successful.  Marty [HistoryMaker Martin Nesbitt] wants his chance.  He's young, he's willing to work hard, he wants a chance to do it," and he said, "Okay, okay, let's throw $50 million at the idea and see how we like it."  So we walked away and I was off and running.  She said, "You heard him say 50 million, didn't you?"  I said, "Yeah."  She said, "Go to work," and I said--and I went off and the first person I called was Kevin Shrier [Kevin J. Shrier] and I hired Kevin Shrier to come and he was the first employee of the company.  We started it from scratch with $50 million.
Speaker 2: Marty, what year is this?
Speaker 1: That was 1990, let's see I was at LaSalle for seven years, so that's '96 [1996], so it was, this was '97 [1997] probably when I made the call to Shrier.  So '96 [1996] I started with Penny.  I got her problems started to get 'em fixed and then '97 [1997] I started the business [The Parking Spot, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 620722
Speaker 1: So this is amazing on several different levels, because the Pritzkers are known to be--they're a family so they're, they're known to be a very close family.  Not just in the black, I mean the white community, I mean all--I'm saying as much as in the white community.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: That they don't really, they're--you know they never, I won't say never, but outsiders within the family.
Speaker 2: I think it--I was, I think--no, I think it was very significant.  I think The Parking Spot [Chicago, Illinois] may be one, if not the only, one of the only companies that wasn't the brainchild or acquisition of a Pritzker.  Now, Penny [Penny Pritzker] and I've been close collaborators on this and she's been very involved, but I wrote the business plan, I made the pitch to Jay [Jay Pritzker] and he made the commitment to us, to us, so it wasn't a unique, dynamic for the family.
Speaker 1: But what did she like about you?  I mean this is, I mean I, this is what I'm saying not--'cause in that family also the, the boys ran it and I think Jay was the main, I (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Penny was a business--a leader in it too.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean she was, she had earned her, her, her seat at the board table, the board room table.  I just--
Speaker 1: And I said a lot wasn't known about the family until all the re- controversy you know with the, but it was very.
Speaker 2: Very, quiet.
Speaker 1: It was very quiet.
Speaker 2: Well, let me see I--look, I think Penny did her due diligence.  I think she asked people about me.  You know I think it was--I think in a lot of ways it was a lot of the same characteristics that I talked about earlier even as a child and as a student which was I was a nice guy but I wasn't soft.  I was--had some good leadership, characteristics, some good leadership traits.  I was always helpful to people. I always tried to work hard.  I always tried to put others' interests or was always willing to put others' interests ahead of my own.  I was just always conscious about building sort of the equity to the point where you get to the moment where you ask for somebody--to get to the moment where you ask somebody for $50 million and they give it to you.  You know there's a lot of work that goes into getting to that moment, right?  A lot of work from a time when you're very young.  I mean a lot of sort of okay, what kind of, what kind of ethics do you have?  What kind of work ethic do you have?  What kind of commitment are you willing to provide?  How do you demonstrate to people that your interests are subordinate to theirs?  You know it was all very conscious of the fact that all this was very important and I think Jay and Penny both have a keen eye for picking up on that, I mean after all, this--Jay didn't invest in this business idea.  He invested--and Penny--neither of them invested in the business idea, they invested in me, and it was a long process, it was six months of Penny and I talking back and forth and getting to know each other and then it was a year that I actually was there working for her on other projects, and you know I think it's--
Speaker 1: So let me ask.
Speaker 2: But, but I also think from a historical stand- I mean I think it was a very significant moment where an African American entrepreneur walks in and, and, and gets you know partnership with an investor, a source of capital that, that is willing to commit $50 million to something that they're gonna work on.
Speaker 1: No, that's a very--I'm just saying it's quite unusual, not to say it wasn't you know, but it's quite, it's quite unusual.  I even would say even today it's quite unusual.  Now people got you know there were venture funds, you know funding things, but this, this is a little different.
Story_ID: 620723
Speaker 1: So you were on the fast track at LaSalle [LaSalle Partners; Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated, Chicago, Illinois].  Was that the perception sort of (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, no I don't necessarily think, but LaSalle was very competitive and it was, there were a lot of really smart people and you know, I'm, I'm confident that I would've--
Speaker 1: Were you--?
Speaker 2: --had a great future there and they wanted me to stay.
Speaker 1: Okay, were you the first black equity partner?
Speaker 2: No, Markus Trice I think was the first.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's a little older, he was the, he was the first and there were, oh and there was another guy, Hugh Williams was there and he was very successful so there were a very--there were a lot of very capable African Americans there.  You know, I have, I may have been a little more tilted to being entrepreneurial than some of the others.  Now, I think back, I think most of the others have gone off and done entrepreneurial things and like Alan Braxton [Alan R. Braxton], Herman Bulls [Herman E. Bulls], Hugh Williams, they've all very successfully ventured out on entrepreneurial efforts, entrepreneurial initiatives, so, so there were a lot of very capable people there and so (simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 620724
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But Marty [HistoryMaker Martin Nesbitt] what also strikes me is that you've been a--very quiet about it too 'cause I mean that's why I'm trying to say like when I, when you were here it had to be like 19, 2000 maybe '2 [2002] or '3 [2003] or some maybe '4 [2004], and I, you know what I mean I'm just saying that you were, you said I have this, you know we're doing this business [The Parking Spot, Chicago, Illinois] you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: There was--
Speaker 2: Well you know look, I.
Speaker 1: I mean I--
Speaker 2: The other thing I learned from, from.
Speaker 1: (Directs speech off camera) Don't talk, don't talk.
Speaker 2: Jack MacMullan--well, you know we were so.  We were--
Speaker 1: And MacMullan, he retired about, oh, he retired in '91 [1991] right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right, that's different, that's like--
Speaker 2: But he was, so when we--all of a sudden we were--so we were at twenty-five as juniors, we had everybody coming back.  We rattled off ten or twelve victories right, and all of a sudden we were ranked as the number one team in the state, right.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he came in with the newspaper and he threw it on the ground and he kicked it--this is, that these people have never seen us play.  So he--already instilled in us, I gotta be about form over substance and so I, I have no interest in sort of the, the optics of, of things.  I've had sincere interest in sort of the substantive you know it's, it's real.  It's substance and so I never wanted to get ahead of ourselves in terms of PR [public relations] and talking about what we were doing.  I said we have a lot to prove as a business.  There are hurdles, there are challenges.  We don't really know if this is gonna work, even once we got to ten, eleven, twelve locations, there were still things to prove, hurdles to clear and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so talk about the concept 'cause I've got other things to get to--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but talk about the concept, what was the concept that you proposed?
Speaker 2: So, what I noticed about the parking business that I liked was few dynamics.  One, it's not the primary demand generator in the real estate world.  So you, nobody goes to park for the sake of parking, right?  They go because they gotta go to work, they gotta go shopping or they gotta go on a trip, travel somewhere.  And that's a unique position to be in because if demand for those--the demand for those products, office demand, travel demand, retail, consumer demand--if those things fall, the burden is on those primary demand generators to generate interest and activity so office owners lower their rents.  They offer free rent, they offer TI's [ph.], shopping centers do sales and promotions.  Airlines and hotels, and rental car companies lower their prices and offer discounts to induce people to travel.  Whereas I'm parking provider, there's nothing I can do with my rates to induce somebody to take a trip to Hawaii.  There, there's something the airlines can do, there's nothing I can do and so parking rates don't tend to go down, and, and that's, that's, that was attractive to me.  The other interesting thing is when a new demand generator is built, a lot of times it takes out parking supplies.  So not only do you get a shot up in demand, but you get a reduction in supply at the same time, and so that made the asset class more intriguing to me and then there was really no strong national brand.  You know everybody just muted as a commodity type service and nobody thought about thinking about parking as being a service that can be branded and marketed and therefore equity built up in that brand, and so those were the fundamental concepts behind how I thought I could build a business in this industry.  The other thing was that there was no real use of technology because owners tend to own one or two assets and couldn't justify an investment in technology and then managers had such thin margins that they couldn't justify such an investment in technology to make the business run more efficiently.  So I thought if I owned a big portfolio I could justify an investment in technology that might give me a competitive advantage, make it cheaper for me to run the assets, and so that was the concept behind why we thought we'd build a business and, and so many people got turned onto the idea of investing in parking while I was at LaSalle [LaSalle Partners; Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated, Chicago, Illinois] because we were shopping it around, and a lot of other players started getting in the business and so when I went with the Pritzkers I decided that while everybody was in this frenzy over urban parking and that kind of stuff I would zag while they were zigging and go and focus only on airport parking 'cause I thought it would be a while before they focused and that I'd have time to aggregate assets.
Story_ID: 620725
Speaker 1: What was the plan then you were gonna do one, I mean how?  What was your first property and what did you move to and?
Speaker 2: So the first asset we bought was a property in Houston, Texas.  It was an existing asset that was--
Speaker 1: At the airport?
Speaker 2: At the airport that we converted into The Parking Spot, and we had originally, we had a different brand that was much more boring (laughter) and professional and we bought a few assets and then we decided to hire a marketing guy and one of the first things he did was to fly all over the country and take pictures of every shuttle bus at every airport he could get to, and he made a big, giant collage, like a twenty foot collage and put all the pictures on it and called it a Sea of Sameness and it just looked like a big old blob of you know nothing, and he unveiled the spotted shuttle bus, and he said, "You know look this shuttle and this whole sea of sameness people are gonna remember 'cause it's so different," and we rebranded the four or five assets we had at the time.
Speaker 1: And that was when, what year?
Speaker 2: That was probably, god he was probably came in '99 [1999] or 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and then what other thing--so you're still though--this is of the Pritzkers though?  It's at this (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's of the Pritzkers you know.
Speaker 1: So you're still working at Pritzker [Pritzker Realty Group, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, no I am the--.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: No, I don't I mean we--I am the CEO of The Parking Spot, PRG Parking Management [PRG Parking Management LLC] which is owned by me, the rest of the management team and the Pritzker family.  I'm the president and CEO, Penny Pritzker is on the board of directors and so we report to our board.  We have Penny and Kevin Forman [ph.] and two outside directors on our board and we run the company like any company is run.
Speaker 1: And so you--
Speaker 2: Now, but, but we grew to that I mean so we started out where I started the company and I was in the same office at the same time with Penny and I was doing some things and starting The Parking Spot then I brought Shrier [Kevin J. Shrier] and we started aggregating more assets and then we kind of got to the point where we didn't have--there wasn't enough room on the same floor as Penny so we moved down to another floor and then we moved out, took our whole--we became fully autonomous, moved out and.
Speaker 1: And what year is this?
Speaker 2: Well, we let's see, five, six years so probably 2004.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We, we became--so we--in 2001 or so we became fully autonomous where our function was completely separate and different from the Pritzkers.  All we shared was office space and then in 2004, we moved out completely and we're independent.
Speaker 1: So when, when did you become profitable?
Speaker 2: I think we became profitable like January of 2000, something like that.
Speaker 1: (Pause) That's pretty good (laughter), okay no comment (laughter), that's--
Speaker 2: I mean 2000, maybe it was 2000.
Speaker 1: Wow! So what are your annual receipts now?
Speaker 2: So, man I hate to say this on camera but--
Speaker 1: Okay, but still--
Speaker 2: But we probably have about $150 million in revenue.
Speaker 1: No idea, I had no idea.
Story_ID: 620726
Speaker 1: So what do you see, well I mean I--what (unclear) what do you see is to your next thing I mean because.
Speaker 2: So, so I mean look, here's the vision.
Speaker 1: What is--yeah, what is the?
Speaker 2: Here's the vision.  So--the, the simply stated the vision for The Parking Spot [Chicago, Illinois] is to become that fourth item on every travel itinerary.  So people have their airline ticket, they have their hotel, they have their rental car, we wanna be that I'm parking my car here when I leave my home city.  So we wanna become that fourth item on the travel itinerary, and so in order to do that we have to have a footprint that covers the country in a meaningful way and we are today up to the point where we're covering a third of all U.S. enplanements.  We're now at JFK [John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, New York], at LaGuardia [LaGuardia Airport, New York, New York], at Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], at Newark [New Jersey]; we're in Orlando [Florida] and Atlanta [Georgia] and Dallas [Texas] and Houston [Texas] and Phoenix [Arizona] and St. Louis [Missouri] and Kansas City [Kansas] and Denver [Colorado], San Francisco [California], L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  So, we're, we're building that footprint.  We're at a third of all enplanements which is significant, and then that just puts us in a position to be able to reach our clients in a unique way, aggregate them in a unique way and do things in this business that can't be done in the travel business now because most everything in the travel business is destination city oriented, right?  People go somewhere and go to hotels.  So like the Hyatt's [Hyatt Hotels Corporation] marketing and distribution strategy is all built around people's destination.  Our strategy is different and so we, we market to travelers but we're concerned about where they're leaving from because that's when they use us, when they go to their home airport at their home city.  So we can--there's a unique way to start aggregating customers that I think we can leverage once we get to the footprint that we need.
Story_ID: 620727
Speaker 1: What things have you learned along the way though because to hear the story you conceived of it and it sort of was perfectly executed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well first I'll say one, it wasn't perfectly executed.  You know you just make mistakes and things happen you know.  One thing I didn't, I had no idea that 9/11 [September 11, 2001] was gonna come and that was a devastating moment and one where I thought we were totally out of business, so no, it hasn't been flawlessly executed and there's certainly mistakes have been made and there've been challenges associated with you know other things that were happening in the family and their constraints as to how they could invest in dealing with that and you know ebbs and flows in the travel business.  So just a lot of, a lot of challenges, but, but I think you know some of the truths, some of the, the values that I learned through you know Crestview [Crestview Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio], academy [Columbus Academy, Gahanna, Ohio] from Bo Dixon, and Jack MacMullan and from Mike Turner my coach at Albion [Albion College, Albion, Michigan] and Larry Steinhauer, my money banking teacher.  Some values--I mean they, they've kind of been important and held true, I mean you could, you gotta hard--work hard.  You can't, you're not gonna always be right, and you're not gonna be the smartest guy in the room and how do I, how do I lead, how do I lead people who might be more talented than me?  Or maybe more talented than me in a certain discipline.  How do I do that, how do I build equity with those I'm--who've invested in me?  How do I manage them and their expectations?  How do I demonstrate that we're, we're doing the right things?  How do I collaborate?  How do I work as a team player?  All of those things I found to be very important and that, that at the end of the day you know it's your ability to lead people may be the most important thing and sort of building in a business, building a business.  So how do I get people, how do I inspire people to wanna work for me?  And how do I make it interesting and fun for them?  Because there've been a lot of competitors and a lot of other sophisticated investors who've tried to do what we're doing and have failed and, and it's largely the same business and so you know, what things do you do differently, I think is how you put your people together and how you get 'em to work as a team and be creative and innovative and dedicated.  That's what ultimately makes the difference (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So how large is the organization [The Parking Spot, Chicago, Illinois], how many people?
Speaker 2: We have two thousand employees.
Speaker 1: Oh god that's amazing.  I'm, okay I'm blown away (laughter).  I shouldn't be saying that, but I'm--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 620728
Speaker 1: Okay now what I also find interesting and I wanna go to some of your personal relationships.  So Craig Robinson, now this is what's interesting about him is that he started out in finance and now he--then he like--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --gave it all up you know and said he wanted to be a coach.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know and at the time I think there was some like, people in the community were like, what coach?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So then through Craig you met you know Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] and that, that--you know he's--is a state senator.  So you're really, what--I wanna know timing on this?  So you're playing basketball?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know that was all early '90s [1990s]. Listen it's all meshed together, I can't.
Speaker 1: You can't remember?
Speaker 2: I can't, I can't pull out specific dates, but I can tell you this.
Speaker 1: And you became personal--so--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we became personal friends, you know Anita [Nesbitt's wife, Anita Blanchard]--first of all.
Speaker 1: Anita and Michelle.
Speaker 2: Anita and Michelle are--become acquainted and friends independent of knowing that I had played basketball with Barack, and you know my relationship with Barack or President Obama I should say since we're--
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm sorry, yes, President Obama, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: My relationship with President Obama was a personal relationship, and, and I was always blown away during the campaign when people say, "Oh, well he's you know, he's arrogant," and I'm like really?  Because I knew him for a long time before I even knew he had a law degree or that he went to Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  He was in a lot of the ways you know kind of below the radar doing his thing, and you know not much interested in trying to impress anybody.  So through Anita and Michelle and Craig.
Speaker 1: Well you're young families together.
Speaker 2: And young families and Anita delivered Sasha [Sasha Obama] and Malia [Malia Obama] and so our kids were sort of growing up at the same time, we just became close friends, and the other thing was interestingly, both President Obama and Michelle Obama had a close relationship with [HistoryMaker] Valerie Jarrett that began early in the '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: Because they were young lawyers.
Speaker 2: Because they were young lawyers, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean but, I mean they were, right.
Speaker 2: And Anita who spent four years at medical school at the University of Chicago [University of Chicago School of Medicine; Pritzker School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois], her biggest advocate and mentor was Dr. Bowman [HistoryMaker Dr. James Bowman] and he loved Anita.  She was a good student, he liked her personality.  They had a great very, very strong relationship and once she began practicing he insisted that his wife [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman] and his daughter become Anita's patients.  So you know there was this interesting convergence and then also Dr. Eric Whitaker was in medical school at the University of Chicago at the same time Anita was, and so he went off to get a master's in public policy from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and that's where he met President Obama.  So Dr. Whitaker was, is godparent to some of our children and they, they didn't know at the time that--of course nobody knew that there were all these connections and so it all just kind of converged together over time as our kids started to grow and become friends (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you know what I--but you know what I also think this points to Marty [HistoryMaker Martin Nesbitt], is the emergent young professional group coming out of good schools into the professional workforce, a world I don't think is still not much--you know because people are young you know.  You're out meeting people, you're working on your career.  You've got your sights on what people say.  They're people that you're looking to you know to be at that sort of next level.
Story_ID: 620729
Speaker 1: It's in Chicago [Illinois] which is a vibrant community, black community.  Though you're living in Hyde Park, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that is you know a mixed community.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Your kids go to Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Lab School.
Speaker 1: Right okay.  So this, so how, what are you--so you're playing basketball.  You know you--your, your pickup basketball, John [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.] loves three--the--and--
Speaker 2: Three on three.  I used to sneak outta work at LaSalle Partners [Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated, Chicago, Illinois] to go play basketball with John at ten in the morning.  It's a quick game of three on three, get--sneak back to work, grab a sandwich and eat at my desk.  So yeah that really helped to--
Speaker 1: And you would play, wouldn't you play over at, what was that?
Speaker 2: The athletic club at Illinois Center (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: I think it's called Lakeshore Athletic Club [Lakeshore Sport and Fitness Illinois Center, Chicago, Illinois] now.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.  And so who is--because seeing the you know we're working on the show with John and you know looking at the pictures and it's Arne [Arne Duncan] you know and I mean everyone's sort of like a--you know, Arne's on the team, Craig [Craig Robinson] is on the team.  I don't see you on the three on three.
Speaker 2: Nah so they play on these travel three on three teams.  I never played with them on those teams.  I used to sneak and play three on three in the mornings with John, just kind of during the weekday mornings and then I would--I played on a lot of five on five leagues with John and Arne and you know all the suspects, Kuby [Eric Kuby] and this whole crew of John's basketball buddies.  So I always played with those and Arne lived in Hyde Park, so I'd give Arne a ride home after games and so forth, but I didn't play with them.  They played in the Hoop It Up three on three.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the hoop the hoop right, that's where he has all the takes.
Speaker 2: Right, so but they--so that was another.
Speaker 1: Well that became a big deal, he, he.
Speaker 2: It became a very big deal and those guys were, I mean they had their team and they were very good I mean, so I, you know I was like, "You guys are gonna win it all man," so it.  And they had their whole Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] crew and all the, they were very good, very good, but I built a lot of friendships through that network of guys, just, I mean there's just so many people that I've met in Chicago through basketball, both African American and non-African American.
Story_ID: 620730
Speaker 1: And then, now are you really more involved in the business community and not the political community, right?  You--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean look I really wasn't very politically active except for being engaged with President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].
Speaker 1: Um-hm, and his campaign?
Speaker 2: And his campaign.
Speaker 1: So what, what campaign did you get active in?
Speaker 2: The, the--
Speaker 1: Was it the state--were you active at all in the state (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nah.
Speaker 1: --or was it more the senatorial?
Speaker 2: No, well I was involved in the race against [HistoryMaker] Bobby Rush.
Speaker 1: Against Bobby Rush?
Speaker 2: The congressional race, that was when I first became engaged and then I was involved in the senatorial campaign and then.
Speaker 1: So what are you learning at this point, 'cause you're you know, you're business all the way so, so what are you learning when you, you know you're getting involved with that in that way, 'cause I remember supporting him, yeah (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, all of us.
Speaker 2: The only reason why I was engaged at that level was because he was my friend, and so--then you know I had no political agenda, I just wanted to--
Speaker 1: Be supportive?
Speaker 2: Be supportive and that's how I got engaged, so it didn't really matter what he was gonna do.  I was gonna help him no matter what he did.
Speaker 1: Now do you--the night, the night that he won for the U.S. Senate.  I remember, you know I actually, I think I got outta bed and came down and I remember standing next to Michelle [Michelle Obama] and I remember her saying you know, "We're gonna be in a different league. It's a whole different league."
Speaker 2: After the Senate race?
Speaker 1: After the Senate race.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm trying to think back on that night.
Speaker 1: There were cameras all over the place.
Speaker 2: This is at the Hyatt wasn't it?
Speaker 1: It was at the Hyatt, there were cameras all over literally.
Speaker 2: Yeah, look I think it was a, it was an interesting moment for him, but you know he had the capacity, I mean nobody thought he was in over his head (laughter) you know, especially at that point.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: We were all pretty confident that he was gonna do all right.
Story_ID: 620731
Speaker 1: And so there's that story where--I don't know if I read it or something, but you know there were people you know, you know, I think you were in Cambridge [Massachusetts] and--oh, it was around the time of the--he was--
Speaker 2: Oh, his speech?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes I think that story's been often you know told.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But why don't you tell that story?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we got to Boston [Massachusetts] at ten or eleven o'clock that night before his speech and he [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] called me and said you know, "If you wanna see how my world has changed, why don't you meet me in the lobby at 7:30 in the morning, and you know we got a van and we can all pile in and we can hang out, you can just kind of roll with us."  So Anita [Nesbitt's wife, Anita Blanchard] and I met him, got in the van, we went to you know he had a breakfast, the speech and a lunch, rally and an afternoon rally and after that last rally I think we were in downtown Boston.  We were walking down the street and this crowd started to build behind us and I said to him, I said, "Man, you know you're like a rock star."  And he looked at me and said you know, "If you think it's bad today, wait until tomorrow."  And I said, "What do you mean?"  He said, "My speech is pretty good."  And I said, "Oh, okay," (laughter) so, that moment was the only time the whole day that he had mentioned the speech.  So it just wasn't, this thing wasn't weighing on him, he didn't, it didn't seem like he was feeling any pressure from it.  He just said, "My speech is pretty good," and it was a good speech.
Speaker 1: So what, you were there when he gave the speech, right?  What did you think?  Did you?
Speaker 2: Well there was a--first heard of it--maybe it was the first minute or so I was just nervous as his friend.  I was god look at all these people.  There was millions of people watching, I hope he doesn't screw it up.  That's what I was thinking right, 'cause this was all, this was all about my personal relationship with him and watching him on a micro level kind of work his way through this process.  It was as interesting a moment for me on that level as it was for him.  I, I mean I wasn't thinking about him in the context of the masses of millions of people, I was thinking about him in the context of our friendship and our family's relationship.  So when I was standing there at the beginning of his speech I was looking around at the cameras and I'm like good god, don't screw it up--right, I was thinking that.  And then there was a moment in the speech and I bet if you went back and you looked at it you'll see it where he just kind of hit a groove and it was at that moment that I forgot--I stopped thinking about him as my friend and I started listening to what he was saying as a, as a politician and I remember, I, I can--if you, if you, if you and I watched the tape together, I could tell you the exact instant where I thought man, he hit the groove and, and I--from there on I was thinking about him as a, I was listening to him as a, as a Democrat and not as his friend and I was incredibly moved and impressed and you know I had already thought the sky was the limit for him, but that confirmed it.
Story_ID: 620732
Speaker 1: So when in the whole thinking about the presidency were you supportive, not supportive--I mean did you, was it like the sky's the limit, go for it? Or was it?
Speaker 2: No, I mean look we had some, we had a lot of conversations about it you know really early on and I, when he, when he won the primary in the state, in the Senate race.
Speaker 1: In the Senate--U.S. Senate race.
Speaker 2: I thought he could be president.  I never verbalized it, but (unclear) I thought he could be president.  Now my wife [Anita Blanchard], I will say, teased him all the time about being president, long before any of this.  Every year on his birthday she would give him some gag gift that depicted him as president and she, she teased him all the time.  I don't know whether he still has all those gifts, but like she took, she took up some placemats that had the picture of every president and then after Bush [President George Walker Bush] she taped his picture.  She did playing cards where she rigged 'em up to be his picture and you know she gave him movies and depicted him as president and all that stuff. And he never said anything, but she always teased him, "You're gonna be president, you're gonna be president."  He never said anything about it but he never, I mean I don't he was even thinking about it.  I think he was thinking about, man, how can I win this next Senate race.  Can I win this congressional race? He was not thinking about being president and she would, but she would tease him, but I thought very early on.  So I said to him in all of our conversations, I said, "I think you can win."  I always thought he could win.
Speaker 1: It's, it's an amazing story 'cause when you think about it though it's the money.  You--I mean the money.
Speaker 2: Well, here's, but here's the (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what people don't realize is the money started here, right?
Speaker 2: But here's the other thing though and maybe this is one of the reasons why I was optimistic.  My experience has been, because a lot of African Americans were like, "There's no way you're gonna win," but my experience was and we've talked about this.  Interesting I didn't know we'd get to this point in conversation, but my life experience was that white people liked me.  That they accepted me as a leader, you know, they respected where I was from.  They had patience with my growth.  I had a lot of positive experience with non-African Americans and so it was not a far fetched notion for me to say, you, he can be president.  I, I thought he could be president.  Now there were a lot of African Americans around us who thought and said, "There's no way."  But I, my life experience, and, and I, if you look at our life experiences it's interesting they parallel in a lot of ways.  Both from split families, both went to private schools, both played basketball as--you know, just went on.  Both married women from the South Side of Chicago [Illinois], all, there are a lot of parallels in life so I think we had, we shared a perspective on the world as a dynamic that I think was fairly unique as African American men our age, and so it never dawned me on talk, I never talked to him, I never said that it's impossible.  I always thought well, yeah why not?  So I think that was, I, I just think that's interesting you know and I hadn't planned on getting to this point in the conversation.  So that may have been part of how I sort of just thought it was all possible and jumped right on the bandwagon when he, when he first mentioned it to me.
Story_ID: 620733
Speaker 1: But, but also I think the money was important, I think some, some very wealthy, credible people jumped on board in the [U.S.] Senate campaign, and I think that all started in the Senate race, and you know he recognized the importance of having the right kind of financial wherewithal to market yourself and or campaign and he had kind of had the capacity to really break it down in a way the business people could understand.  You know he told me when we first had the first conversation about the Senate race said, "I, if I raise two million [dollars] I have a 20 percent chance to win, if I raise three million I have a 30 percent chance to win, if I raise five million I have a 50 percent chance to win.  If I raise ten million, I guarantee you victory."  I said, "Really?"  He said, "Yeah."  So he--and then that was an easy way to communicate that to people and he knew that, like I knew from my experience, he knew and the numbers and polling supported it, if people knew his story they would vote for him, and if he had the money to tell his story, people would vote for him.
Speaker 2: But he first had to get out of Chicago [Illinois] and what do you think was critical to what happened in Chicago that propelled on the national stage because, the, I mean the campaign, the campaign goes down in history.  I mean even just from the Internet perspective; it goes down in history.  You know but what were the--what do you see as the key, key posts along the way with that?
Speaker 1: Well look I think--and it's, it's funny because it's interesting to me how sort of the perspectives get revised.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: But at the end of the day we had a really, really good candidate (laughter).
Speaker 2: You had a--right that's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right?  We had, we didn't, we weren't, there was no smoke and mirrors right.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: This is what my, this is my point oh I was making about my company [The Parking Spot, Chicago, Illinois] and my--this is form, this is substance over form so we were sitting here with a really smart guy, who's incredibly articulate, who had a unique perspective and a unique life experience.  That was the product and so once the fly wheel got going and, and you know people started to figure out who he was and hear his story and hear him speak, it was just a matter of time.  The question in my mind and the question I raised early in the campaign and a lot of people shared this perspective is to me whether he won the primary or not, the Democratic primary was a question of physics.  Would the viral Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] dynamic have time before Super Tuesday to overtake the eighteen years of brand building that the Clinton name had?  It wasn't a question of if it could, it was a question of was there time for that virus to spread and it was close right, because at Super Tuesday we were like neck and neck but what happened after that was the viral Obama dynamic kept spreading and we rattled off a series of, of primary victories after which was--kind of locked up the nomination.  So it's, it was never a question of if he could do it, it was you know was there enough time to do it and time to get the nomination?  And it turned out it just barely was enough time.

Speaker 1: Then there was Iowa, I mean Iowa.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Iowa.
Speaker 1: Iowa was what all the naysayers, I mean all, the black people I mean they were--it was possible at that point.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well listen we went to, we went to Iowa and we were at some fairgrounds in some small county.  I'm not quite sure where it was but he was giving a sort of stump speech and there were maybe a couple of hundred people in this little hall and I was standing next to this guy who was like 6'4".  He must've been in his early seventies.  He had a flannel shirt on and you know overalls and he was clearly a farmer, and I was dressed much like I am right now and these photographers just started gathering around us because there was such an interesting contrast.  It was a 6'4" white farmer standing next to a, you know, African American clearly a city slicker, right (laughter) and they were just taking pictures all during this stump speech and then afterwards the writer from The Philadelphia--the photographer from The Philadelphia Inquirer came up to me, came up to both of us and said, "Look, there's a chance that your photo's gonna be in the paper.  I just wanna get some information," and he started asking me where I was from and so I told him I was a business guy from Chicago [Illinois], da, da, da.  And then he asked the guy next to me and the guy, he goes, he gave him his name and his age and he said, "So what do you do?"  And he said, "Young man, I'm the Obama organizer in these parts."  And I got on the bus and I went up to President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], Barack at the time and I said, "You're gonna win," (laughter).  "You are going to win."  And I told him the story and, and you know it was true, so.  But I had because of my own life experience had, just had great confidence that the number of people that were--get behind him because of his story and because he was the real deal would far out number those who would base their decision on who to vote for somebody, whether to vote for somebody or not based on color.
Story_ID: 620735
Speaker 1: So tell me what were life changing moments for you on the, you know the camp- because you became part of the campaign trail, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah you know well that moment in Iowa was obviously pretty important.  You know seeing all the kids looking up to him and wanting to touch him and that kind of stuff was--they were, they were, you know, powerful.  But heck you know I had to stop listening to his speech man I'd get all worked up and watery eyes and I'm like, "I'm staying in the back, I'm not coming out there to hear you talk today," (laughter), 'cause it was so inspirational just to see you know the American people kind of rally behind you know what he stood for and what he still stands for.  So there was just a whole, a whole series of powerful moments, but the most mind- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What about the race that--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh well.
Speaker 1: Okay the race speech, what about the race speech (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So.
Speaker 1: What about the race speech 'cause I can't let that go because--
Speaker 2: So, look you know there's this endless loop of Reverend Wright [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr.] playing everywhere, Internet, TV wherever you can turn on the radio and I was supposed to have gone on this trip to Indiana I think it was with the president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] and Eric Whitaker and [HistoryMaker] Valerie Jarrett and I couldn't go because Anita [Anita Blanchard] was expecting and we were about to have a child and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Number five, right?
Speaker 2: Number five and so I didn't go but I called them right around dinner time and the president answered the phone.  He said, "Yep, there's an empty seat right here at the table where your place was supposed to be.  We miss you."  And I said, "Yeah man, I'm just you know, getting tired of watching this Reverend Wright stuff," but I, I said, "I gotta tell you, I think this Reverend Wright thing could be a blessing in disguise," and he started laughing and he told Valerie and Eric, he said, "Marty [HistoryMaker Martin Nesbitt] said Reverend Wright's a blessing in disguise," and they all started laughing.  They're like you gotta be crazy but--
Speaker 1: Crazy?
Speaker 2: It was, but so it was a pretty funny moment, and then said, "No, no I think, here's my point."  I said, "You're on this you know in this race for the candidacy and a hurdle has been put up in your path that only you can clear, so you're in a race with an obstacle that only you have the opportunity to clear.  The other candidates can't clear this hurdle.  They can't approach the subject of race, they can't talk about it, they can't have a speech about it.  In a way you clear this hurdle, you are the winner," and I said, "This is really--I, I, you know this is really about are you who the American people hope that you are and this is a moment for them to find out.  This is the last confirmation, right?"  And he had all--I think had already made a decision because I think Valerie was influential in these discussions, but I, I think that he had already decided that had to do a speech and he said, "Yeah, I guess I just gotta write the speech."  And I had no conversations with him, I mean I knew him and I knew the difference between my experience and his experience and what we talked about earlier about serving the white community and the African American community and my, my faith in the--so that there were enough good folks out there that they would support him.  I knew I couldn't write the speech, right?  He--not that I would've, my, my point is I knew that he was the only person who had the capacity to write the speech because he was there.  He grew up in the living room with white people, his [maternal] grandmother [Madelyn Dunham] was white, so he was the only guy who could credibly make this speech about race to the American people.
Speaker 1: And they would understand.
Speaker 2: And they would understand and they would believe him, he had the equity, although I could've, I knew what to say, right?  I knew what the message--I could never have given that speech.
Speaker 1: But you couldn't of have talked about the gram- the white grandmother afraid when she, a black kid walks down the street.  You couldn't of said that.
Speaker 2: I couldn't say, "My grandmother was white."
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: "My mother was white, oh, I know, my mother was white," so he was the only person who could give that speech and you know Hillary [Hillary Rodham Clinton] could've given a speech on women, but she couldn't give that speech.  And so the only person who could give the speech gave the speech, and it was written as well as it could possibly be written, and it was like a, a jazz composition.  It was simple, it was eloquent, it was, it was complex in its simplicity.  It was just great, great.  So that was a powerful. That was a very powerful moment for me.
Story_ID: 620736
Speaker 1: The other really, really powerful moment was on the--at the convention when Hillary [Hillary Rodham Clinton] sort of graciously, you know, cast the yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is out in Denver [2008 Democratic National Convention, Denver, Colorado].  This is in Denver.
Speaker 1: Cast the deciding vote. 'Cause we didn't really know what was going on when these other states started passing and deferring to the State of New York and so when she cast the deciding vote that gave him the nomination that was another very, very powerful moment.  It was like man, he's gonna be (laughter), you know he's gonna be--you know that moment that he's really gonna run for president here, he's gonna be the nominee.  So, second powerful moment, third very powerful moment was when he actually won election night and having been so close to it and kind of micro watching it like watching a flower grow was kind of the whole process for us.  The difference between what I felt before they declared him the victor to after was just miniscule, I didn't--there--I think for a lot of American people that moment was a (exhales) you know and I just remember talking to him shortly after and looking at him and saying, "Well, man you're president."  And he said, "Yep, man looks like we probably gotta like gather everybody up and start getting on these buses and get to the rally."  I said, "Yeah we gotta start getting all these people and moving."  You know it was like (laughter)--it wasn't like you know confetti and da, da.  It was like, all right, let's go, let's roll.  So, it was a very interesting feeling, but then getting out there and seeing those I don't know millions of people was inspiring and then getting emails from people who actually experienced it a different way right?  Because I've experienced it kind of like watching sausage get made and I got a really phenomenal email from a friend of mine who is a lawyer and he had worked all day, and you know he was all conscious of what was happening and it was six or seven o'clock at night.  He got home and he had a seventeen year old teenager was laying on the couch watching TV and his daughter was listening to music or something and he just looked around and he thought about the moment--an African American lawyer, and said, "Hold it, this is one of the biggest historical moments for African Americans in the history of this nation and my kids are not gonna spend it laying on the couch watching TV and listening to an iPod.  Get your rear ends up, we are going downtown," and so he got, he just at that moment gathered up his family, they got in the car and they came downtown. And he told the story of waiting in line to get into Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois] and how friendly everybody was and just sharing stories and being nice and cordial and he's just like this really awesome experience and he went on in great detail like the lawyer that he is and a really, really good writer and I--after the next day after the election I was reading this email out loud to everybody at President Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] house, we were all sitting at the dinner table and we had all experienced it from so close.  I said well there--here's an account of what it was like for people and I read this email.  I looked up after I read it and like everybody was in tears (laughter), because none of us had really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You were close.
Speaker 1: We had gotten so close to it that we missed that part of it you know.  What, what it meant for the average African American family and that kind of stuff so.
Speaker 2: Well the average American family (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) For the average American family, yeah.
Speaker 2: Sorry, it was--
Speaker 1: Nah it was, it was incredible.
Story_ID: 620737
Speaker 1: So that was kind of, you know, another big moment and then finally inauguration day and you know he had so graciously set up for us to be really close to the podium where he was speaking behind--I was sitting right behind Michelle [Michelle Obama], and we all gathered inside the Capitol [U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C.] to come out and the moment when I walked out and saw two million people.  I mean the, the magnitude of that moment when I thought about all the war and strife and power struggles in these countries all over the world and here we are in this nation with a celebration of the transfer of power where 2 million people, probably Democrats and Republicans gathered together to celebrate the inauguration of the first African American president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] this county history, in this country's history.  It was an out of body moment where here it is, the first minority to take the office of the presidency in this country and it is not a war you know, there are not snipers and you know warlords, it's a party, it's a celebration and everybody was happy and that was a powerful moment for me and a moment that I felt real- where I really got a grip on the magnitude of, of what this country is about and culturally what it stands for and the power of that culture.  When people can move on politically and change power in such a peaceful way even if it's the first minority in the country's history, it's a, it's a very powerful statement about what this country is and what the possibilities for us are in the future.  And so I'll never forget that moment and it was certainly a, you know an affirmation for me of sort of the power and the possibilities for a place like, like America.
Story_ID: 620738
Speaker 1: Was there ever--I mean that's, that's such a powerful thing though but was there ever any fear on your part at all during this?  I mean it's such a short period of time from the--you know if you look at the U.S. Senate race to, you know to the presidency, was there any sense of doubt because you espoused none of that you know, or was it just you were moving, moving and the, the--?
Speaker 2: You know look, look, I would say my biggest fault is that I'm an optimist, right?  And so.  And so I always felt that there was a path to victory, but I always thought there was a way he [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] could lose, but even when we were significantly behind in the polls I would always say, "Yeah but you know what? There is still a path to victory."  I, I will start bumming out when there's no path to victory, but as long as there's a path, however remote, I'm still a believer and that's just the way I operate.  So, you know, people got all worried and the people started, "We're gonna lose and we're falling behind."  I was like you know what there's still a path to victory and we're gonna pursue it and let's, let's just keep rolling.  So no, look and there were, you know, a few times when my wife [Anita Blanchard] was like, "You are just eternally, eternally optimistic.  You totally drank the Kool-Aid."  I'm like, "Hey this is the only way we can roll, there's a--you know, we get there from here.  Let's just keep, let's keep going," and he was, and he was even, he was better at that than, than anybody.  Just like, "Let's roll with the punches, we're gonna take our lumps, we're gonna keep doing battle, we're gonna keep moving forward.  It's all good.  I have faith in the American people.  I'll respect whatever decision they make, let's just go."  And so, that's what we did, we just marched, marched forward.  It was interesting.
Story_ID: 620739
Speaker 1: So how did you, how have you successfully, and I will say successfully, reconciled friend and position?  I mean you know because you've been a friend through it all, you've been a supporter.  You were--you helped financially, you know, sometimes those roles can get sort of murky but it doesn't appear you know on the outside that, that has happened?
Speaker 2: No, look I mean our, our friendship has always been based on this foundation of mutual respect.  I didn't help, I didn't--look, if he [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] was trying to be you know get the lead manager position at his job at some big Fortune 500 company, I'd of helped him.  Any, anything that I needed he would help me.  It was not--I wasn't look--the only thing I was looking out, looking for in this process was him to achieve his, his goals and to be in a position he wanted which was to be in a position to have the biggest impact he could on this country.  That's all I really wanted for him, and he knew that, and so it, it's just it's always just been about our personal relationship and, and, and one the reasons why I think we're all such good friends is like you know.
Speaker 1: And when you look at it too, there were no rules.  There were no rules for this game.  I mean there were no--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: This, it's not like this you know it's all from scratch really in many ways.  The whole thing.
Speaker 2: You know he was still gonna be my buddy whether he won or lost.  He was still my buddy.  Look when, when he lost to [HistoryMaker] Bobby Rush there was this party that was you know that was supposed to be the victory party. It turned into a concession speech and you know there were, was confetti on the floor and balloons and it was kind of a downer of a night and, shortly after he made his concession speech everybody was gone, right?  Michelle [Michelle Obama] had to get the kids [Sasha Obama and Malia Obama] ready for school, everybody was off, back to their lives, but I stayed.  And I stayed because he was my friend and, and I thought that he needed me at that moment and I think he realized at that moment that I wasn't helping him because I thought he could be a congressman.  I was only helping him because he was my friend.  The fact that he lost didn't change that and so you know we hopped in the car together and we drove around thanking people that were doing the Get Out the Vote and stayed together 'til midnight or so that night and you know he realized that I was doing it for the right reasons and I realized that he was pursuing what he was doing for the right reasons, and our friendship has been about that, like that, ever since.  You know I'm interested in his own personal growth and success, not what it can do for me, and he's interested in mine and not what it can do for him, so you know it's, it's a true friendship and nothing else.  And there've been things written and saying oh, this has been convenient and you guys got together 'cause it's mutually beneficial and they talk about that me and Valerie [HistoryMaker Valerie Jarrett] and Eric Whitaker, and I was like there could be nothing more ridiculous.  They were friendships that were built over time and they were based on shared values, experiences and perspectives that, that brought us together and anything that happens to any of us isn't gonna change that.
Speaker 1: That's right, well I don't--you know I think that people--I think a lot of that is very Chicago [Illinois] too you know and when you have to look at it Chicago is where you grew you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --professionally.
Story_ID: 620740
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you what do you hope of his presidency, you know what do you want to see at the, you know the end of the eight years, what do you--?
Speaker 2: Well I'd, I'd like to see a shift in sort of the, the partisanship that is I think the Achilles' heel of our democracy.  I mean we've got to figure out how to solve problems together and the voters have to start to hold the politicians in both parties accountable for solving problems.  Not just disagreeing with the other party, and so this has to become about not how do we regain power, but that none of these politicians in Washington [D.C.] have a chance to come back unless they start solving problems, Democrats and Republicans.  And so we know you have differences, we know you have differences in perspectives and different approaches to solving problems, but you know what? Compromise and get it done because there's, some of these problems have been hanging out there too long and they, they tend not to get addressed until there's a major crisis and we can't afford to wait for those moments and crises anymore.  We've got to start being proactive and working together, both parties, to solve these problems and I hope he can begin to sort of shift the company's, the country's perspectives on why we send these politicians to, to Washington.  Not to get power and not to come back and get reelected, but to solve problems and you know the notion that our healthcare problem hung out there for so long, thirty, seventy years, I mean it's been, it's crazy and so I, I hope that he can start to (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The healthcare which I think was major and the--and I'd say we were on the brink of a worldwide financial collapse, and you're in the financial business but I don't think anyone knew how bad it really was.
Speaker 2: No, it was really bad and they, you know, he saved us from a collapse and I think he's got us on the path to straighten out this healthcare and you know so healthcare didn't get fixed overnight, but he's got the mechanism in place that over time we can begin to make our healthcare system healthier.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So.
Story_ID: 620741
Speaker 1: Marty [HistoryMaker Martin Nesbitt], I wanna ask you a few more questions about family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because you, when you--look you came from, you know, a family structure and you, you know you and the Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] family are very close, you know it's family, is really at the center, that's and I wanna understand your concepts about you know family, the family that you and Anita [Anita Blanchard] have sort of built together and your five kids and, and that's a lot of kids you know and today (laughter)--
Speaker 2: That's a lot.
Speaker 1: --that's like thirteen (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's exactly it, it sure is.
Speaker 1: But what is your concept you know behind really family and the importance of family or what you want for your family?
Speaker 2: Well, you know I, you know I'll talk about what I--what originally attracted me to Anita which was, was her strong sense of family and her commitment to it and sort of how close knit her family was and to me that was very appealing and I don't know I think when we had our first [Alex A. Nesbitt].  So that, that was what drew me to her in the first place was just that family was a very high priority to her and they all seemed very loyal and committed to each other from my perspective and that was something that I really, really wanted, but then an interesting thing happened.  You know we had our first child and man, I just didn't know that I loved children so much you know what I mean?  I knew I wanted children but if I'd known that it was so much fun.  I mean I really liked--it just energized me, it was you know that I, I really enjoyed it and, and that sort of just kind of created a, a reaction and a dynamic that I think eventually evolved, us having such a big family but we, we really just get a kick out of it.  I mean it's fun, it gives you a sense of belonging to something and even our friends that are like our family you know we, we're really banned together and we have fun with each other and you know everybody gets appreciated for their unique abilities and talents and personalities and it's really fun to see the kids grow and interact and be mature and it's interesting how they re- you know you get exactly out of your kids what you, you give them and I think if you enjoy 'em and you love 'em and you then they give that back and they give it to other people and it's a really awesome dynamic to see that kind of growth and how they get, how you create these, these beings that sort of interact in the world in a, in a unique way.  That you know they can be tough and strong but compassionate and funny and likeable and that they know the difference between being nice and being weak, right?  That there's a difference and that they can be nice without being weak, and seeing that grow it's just very fulfilling for me. And so that you know, that's my perspective on family and when we call ourselves our--we've been dubbed by a friend Nesbitt Nation because there's so many of us but you know that, that's a rewarding feeling and it's--at the end of the day, it's what it's all about.
Story_ID: 620742
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I mean you say well of course, of course what life is all about is the most rewarding thing and of course it's the most fun I ever had is when I'm with my family and friends, you know it just doesn't get any better and it really makes me feel like yeah, this is, this is what it's all about so that's my sense of family which is like man whoever, whatever, whatever, when the good Lord sort of created this concept he absolutely got it right.  It's the best thing that, that we ever get the opportunity to do here and so you know it doesn't go much beyond that except for--what is family?  Family is everything, friends and family is what it's all about so and I think all of my close friends share that perspective.  I mean I know I can tell you that the president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] and first lady and Craig [Craig Robinson] and his wife, Anita [Nesbitt's wife, Anita Blanchard] and I and Eric Whitaker and Cheryl [Cheryl Whitaker] we all feel the same way about our kids.  And I know if my kid is with the president and first lady he's gonna get exactly what he gets from me, and I know that Craig and Kelly [Kelly McCrum Robinson] are the same way with their kids and I'm the same way with theirs.  So we all share those same values about, about family and friends.
Speaker 2: Which is the ultimate and when, that's what I think also was so refreshing that people saw that, that it was a strong, strong family.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know they saw that in the president and, and I think you know even in your description Anita and Michelle [Michelle Obama] have this, you know their, this similarity 'cause they are all about their kids and they're strong--they're professional women and strong in their own right.
Speaker 1: I mean when I told you that you know that our wives are both African American women from the South Side of Chicago [Illinois], I meant that on multiple levels and they share a lot of the same family values, commitment to family, education, very similar in a lot of ways.
Story_ID: 620743
Speaker 1: I have three questions left.  One is if you were choosing another career, if you were choosing a career now, not another career, what career--would you choose the same path?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I would.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would not change a thing, most, mostly because it, it all seemed so improbable that I, I you know.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: That you like, oh yeah I definitely (laughter) don't want to risk doing anything different or doing anything a different way.  People ask me, "Would you do it all over again if you could?"  I'd say, "No" because the probability that it will turn out the same way is like incredibly remote, so.
Speaker 1: How about your hopes and concerns about the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, I have a lot of concerns, you know, I have a concern well, well one, one of the hopes that I have, I hope that there continue to be, continues to be opportunities for African Americans to succeed, grow as I have and I think, I think those pathways out of poverty and urban neighborhoods are multiplying, but I also think that there's a, a permanent underclass that's being solidified and think it's more African Americans you know make it to middle income and upper middle income become more higher profile and get these leadership positions and that become more a part of sort of the mainstream American society that there becomes these two different classes of African Americans and, and that the permanent underclass that has no idea what the opportunities are or what the pathway is out of the community.  They live in cities with horrible education systems and don't even know you know what they're being deprived of from an educational standpoint.  They have no hope, no chance.  They may have hope and no chance of breaking out.  I'm, I'm concerned that that's just calcifying and that sort of underclasses is, is creating. I'm very worried about that.  We have to fix our educational system. We have to fix it.  To me it's the single most important thing about our future.  And then from a political side I mean I think we have to break this cycle of partisanship because it paralyzes us and you know we can't do nothing about some of these problems.  We gotta figure out how to come together.  We have to recognize that if we're gonna keep growing as a country because the competitors are on our heels.  You know that they the Chinese and Indian economies are growing and becoming more sophisticated and we gotta you know gear up to compete over the long term if we wanna to continue to be the world's leading economy.  So, I'm concerned you know that if we don't figure out how to break the logjam, re- re-engineer the political process in a way that Republicans and Democrats can disagree without getting in a--jammed up in a logjam and a stalemate and letting problems fester, we can figure out how to break that cycle we'll be okay, but we have to make a conscious effort to do it.  I think as voters and as participants in the process.
Story_ID: 620744
Speaker 1: And so you have a lot of hope in the American dream?
Speaker 2: I have a lot of hope because you know as I said you know that moment when I looked out over the mob on the day of the inauguration. It told me what this country is about.  I think President Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] election was like a milestone.  You know if you think about a prairie with a mountain off in the distance, you can begin walking towards that mountain, but because there were no markers in the prairie, no trees, no stones, you don't, can't sense the progress you're making towards that mountain.  That mountain can be miles away, miles, and miles away and you can't, you really can't gauge how far it is away, but as soon as you put a tree on the landscape something that you recognize that you can identify that you know how big it is how what its size is compared to you, you then get a sense of how far the mountain is away, and I really think his election represented that tree in the landscape because now all of a sudden we can say, we know that we're still going somewhere in this country.  We're on a path to somewhere.  I mean his election didn't just happen, right?  We came to that moment because we traveled this path from emancipation all the way through the Civil Rights Movement to the day of his election, and that milestone told everybody in this country that we're on a, we're--this county is still on a path somewhere and our culture, what the American society is all about is built on progress and so I have that, that faith and that process was reaffirmed to me that moment as I looked out on the mob, and so I think we're headed somewhere and I think we're beginning to recognize some of the problems in our system and we'll fix 'em.  So as I am always, I am optimistic that there is a path to victory and we'll find it.
Story_ID: 620745
Speaker 1: Your legacy, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: You know at the end of the day I've always said this.  I mean you think about, you think about the things that you do and what you work really hard at and then you kind of boil it down to what's really important and at the end of the day I just want people to say you know what, he was a really good guy.  What else is there?  I mean and he was a good dad, he was a good husband and he was a good friend and I think he was a really good guy.  To me there is no higher compliment and, and the nice thing about striving for that goal is anybody can reach for it.  You know anybody can be a good dad, anybody can be a good husband, and anybody can be a good friend.  You just have to want to be it, and so to me reaching that level and getting labeled that way by my friends and family and the people who knew me is the ultimate and so if, if there was consensus when I passed that I was a really good guy, I'd be more than satisfied.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's it.  Thank you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
