Speaker 2: Okay, this is me and my brother up in the corner with the yellow shirt on, and we talking about black history weekly mainly down on the Five Points and we talked about our first millionaire.  He had the hotel there, and he would let us all go down to his hotel and get real comfortable and after we get real comfortable in, in his hotel he would call, they'd call the police on us and have us arrested, but we didn't have no other place to go to have fun, so we would continue to go back to our first millionaire, and then his name was Mr. Thomas Bean (ph.) go back to his hotel.  And the walls in this hotel was so thin you could be in the room with somebody else and if your companion was in the next room they could hear everything you was saying, but that was our only place to go, so we really appreciated the Bean's Hotel.

Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  The man with the gray sweater vest and the red tie that's Mr., I'm sorry what did you say his name is?
Speaker 2: With the red tie?

Speaker 1: My mother [Curlie Hill Jordan] she was a very kind, humble person and my father [Miles Jordan] he had the attitude like I'm the man of the house, so whatever she would say it would be all right with him.  And she was a real good manager and a good provider.  She could sew and she had a big garden, and she would peddle.  She would take this food out of the garden and take it up in town and sell it and that way we could get something different to eat.  We could get some fresh meats and food and stuff.  We didn't have to eat the vegetables that she grew up on the farm all the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  How did she and your father meet?
Speaker 1: Well, they met because my grandmother [Rose Anna Hill] had died and my mother was trying to get away from raising all of her little sisters and brothers, but she fell, she jumped out the wash pot into the deep skillet.  She started having these children of her own where she couldn't get away from 'em and she really got tied down when she married my father.

Speaker 2: He was a real hard working man.  He just thought working was all.  If he could work, he would do that.  And it wasn't too much work for a black man to do way back in those days, so he finally got on the WPA [Works Progress Administration] and that's some kind of job you get working for the government.  You could get some money for working for the WPA and he helped to get the other kind of food that my mother [Curlie Hill Jordan] could not grow in the garden.

Speaker 1: Well, what, what, what were the other sights?
Speaker 2: Oh, they had beautiful gardens down there and everybody had a farm and they had cert, certain patterns that they would, how they would take care of a farm.  We had something what we called chopping cotton and if we would get too close to chopping cotton and cut up the cotton we'd get in big trouble for that, but it's an art to it.  You only chop so far with the hoe and then you skip spaces so that you won't cut the stalks down.
Story_ID: 56322
Speaker 1: So, did you have to work on a farm when you were a little girl?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had to work on the farm and at the time we was born pretty wealthy, but my mother's baby sister and my father's baby sister had a fight and my father's baby sister came out to help her mother fight and they had a little girl and she came out to help her mother fight, so she got cut up in the fight.  So, after she got cut up in the fight, then they gonna send my daddy's baby sister to prison for cutting up this little girl.  So, my daddy [Miles Hill] had to mortgage everything thing we had, this beautiful home and land and we had cattle and everything.  Mortgaged it and they mortgaged it $1,000 and they had to pay $100 a month, and a $1,000 was a lot of money back in those days, so he mortgaged it to keep his sister from going to prison and they let us pay back all that money, let us pay it back $100 a month 'till the last two payments and then they would not accept the last two payments and they came out and took everything that we had.  I can hear my daddy bending over crying right now when he, they would take our cows out and the cultivators and everything.  He was like crying, but he was grown.  He was bent over.  I was a little bitty girl, but I can see him and I could hear him crying right now and that's why we got to--back down real poor again.
Speaker 1: That's pretty sad, that's sad, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: So, so he lost everything?
Speaker 2: We lost everything and our money too.
Speaker 1: Now, did the sister stay out of jail?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she stayed out, they kept her out of jail.
Speaker 1: Do, do you know what the fight was about?
Speaker 2: I heard it was about one of those men down there, but at my age you didn't ask too many questions when you was a little kid about stuff like that, but you couldn't help but hear what the people were saying.
Story_ID: 56323
Speaker 1: Okay, well, well what, what other kinds of things did you see when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I started working in the gardens, flower gardens, and in the field too when I was real young and when I would see a plane pass, airplane, we didn't see many airplanes way back in those days, and I would just get back and I would just stare at that plane and I would just say to myself one of these days I'mma leave here.  So, I stayed out there and worked and we going to school and when I finished the twelfth grade it was a man from Denver [Colorado] came down and said anybody that didn't have the money to go to college he would take us with him, and he worked for the NYA at the time, National Youth Administration, and he asked who all wanted to go.  I threw up my hand I wanted to go, and he took us to Seattle, Washington, and I worked at Boeing Aircraft Company.  I was a tank scaler, and I learned fast and I learned real well.  Then he took us to Tacoma, Washington, and I worked on the ships as a ships scaler, and I done real well with that and I said well I wanna do something worthwhile with my life and I knew, I knew an education was important to a certain extent, so I went back home and started to school. I went to Velvatex College [Velvatex College of Beauty Culture, Little Rock, Arkansas] for cos, cosmetology and then came on out to Denver.  I had a brother in Denver and done worked in cafes and things for a little of nothing--(unclear)--, but I was determined that I was gonna get my cosmetology license, so whatever they would put on me on the jobs and everything I would work and was saving up my money to go to beauty school and I'm glad I did.

Speaker 2: Yeah, I studied hard and I was very humble and the other kids a lot of parents would let their kids fight us, but my parents didn't allow the fourteen children to fight each other, so coming from school the kids would beat us up and so one day I decided that this can't go on I got to fight back.  And one girl she was a bully.  She would run us home one day and I knew I couldn't whip this girl, but I was gonna--I said now I'm gonna scratch her with my fingernail and I scratched her up so bad and her face was bleeding and my uncle was the principal of the school and he knew this girl would run me home every day, but when he got ready to punish us he beat me just as hard he did the girl that would start the fight every day, but I didn't give up.  I was determined I was gonna finish school.

We would got to Sunday school, we'd go to 11 o'clock service, we'd go to 3 o'clock service, we'd go to the YPWW [Young People Willing Workers], that's the young people, and then we'd have to go in service at night and so I said if I ever grow up and have any kids I'll never make them stay in church all day long, and my little legs wouldn't reach the floor and my feet would just be dangling and I was miserable in church.  So, I decided right then and there I couldn't talk about it to nobody, but I said if I ever had any children I will never make 'em stay in church all day.  They'll have to go some service, but they won't have to stay all day.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have anything special to do in the church?
Speaker 2: Not when I was real small I didn't, but very soon.  My daddy organized a choir and we had to sing, and we could sing too.  Sometimes we'd be singing so good the old people would turn them benches over, turning, they be so happy they'd turn 'em over.

Speaker 2: I thought that I could better my condition if I would leave, because down in Arkansas and my daddy was on the WPA [Works Progress Administration] we needed clothing and the people in the city they had this material to give us to make school clothes out of and I caught the truck and I went to Hope, Arkansas, that's where Clinton [President William "Bill" Jefferson Clinton] was born at, and they had told us to come down there and they would give us this material to make us some clothes, and when I got there knocked on the door downstairs she came to the window upstairs and just threw the new material out the window.  Didn't put it in no paper sack, didn't wrap it up or nothing.  I had to get on that truck and go home with this material in my hand, and that, that really hurt me, but I was determined whatever it take to finish school I was gonna do it.

Speaker 1: Now what were race relations like in Nashville, Arkansas?
Speaker 2: They was distant.  We didn't--if--in other words if we'd be walking the town and a man had a dog and riding in the car with him in the front seat and if he wanted to let us ride he would put the dog up in the front seat and we'd have to get in the back seat and ride, but we was glad to get the ride.
Speaker 1: Okay, so sometimes white people would give you rides?
Speaker 2: Some, yes, they would give us rides sometimes.
Speaker 1: So, what else do you remember about race relations?
Speaker 2: Let me see what else. Well, my nephew went to a lady's house one night.  They broke into her barn, and he went and told the, told 'em about somebody breaking in your barn.  Then he was gonna come to see us.  I guess we lived about 10 miles.  He was gonna walk to see us that Sunday and when he started walking to see us we could hear the people screaming and hollering Nigga this and Nigga that.  And my nephew never did get up to our house where we could see him and they must have gave him the money to go to Stockton, California, but I never did get to see my nephew no more.  I don't know whether they beat him up or what.  The next thing we heard about him he was dead, and at that time we didn't have the money for his body to come back.  So, right now I just had to go to Bakersfield, California, and they ask and say what happened to Elijah, what happened to Elijah?  I'll say well I really don't know what happened to me, and that hurts me right today that I don't know how they punished him or nothing, but he would have been much better off had he not went and told the white lady that somebody was breaking in her barn.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's kind of a mystery to you?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it was terrible as far as I was concerned.  I guess I always did hurt probably more than the other kids.  If they hurt, they didn't talk about it.
Story_ID: 56332
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were pretty much determined to leave there?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had it in my mind.  I was gonna leave there.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you aspire to do when you finally left?  Did you have an occupation picked out that you wanted to pursue?
Speaker 2: Yes, I wanted to be a hairdresser and when I came out of here it wasn't no better.  I went to school and went to right here in Denver [Colorado] and went--you had to take the State Board of Cosmetology all over when you come out here.  And the lady failed me on shampooing.  Anybody could give a shampoo.  She failed me on that and then I had to go back to school all over again to get my license, but I was determined that I was gonna get 'em and I kept on 'til did get them.
Speaker 1: Now, when did you finally come to Denver?
Speaker 2: I can't remember the dates, but it was just shortly after I finished the twelfth grade, and I finished the twelfth grade down there in 1943 and then as soon as I could get away from down there and come on out here I did.
Speaker 1: You already told us that you left with a WPA [Works Progress Administration] pro, project, I mean--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, I left from that when I was young.  I don't--
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: --know--I went on and, and worked at these government places for a while and then I went back home to go to school and then I came back out here.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this might be the mid '40's [1940s] when you're here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, early '40's [1940s], early.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I remember taking a brush-up course right here in Denver Colorado in 1948.
Speaker 1: Now, did, did you have any relatives here or did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a brother here.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you came out here to join your brother.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right, and so how many times did you have to take the cosmetology test?
Speaker 2: I took it twice.  I had to do something.  I done forgot what I had to do, but I had to do some kind of like crooked.  It wasn't on the level.  They, they was prejudice too, the State Board was here.
Story_ID: 56333
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you live in Five Points when you, when you moved here?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, could you tell us what Five Points was like when you got here and, and how did you feel about it?  I mean, what, what--
Speaker 2: I felt good about it.  You know here it was--(unclear)--at the time entertainment.  I got to see all the old timers like Nat King Cole and T-Bone Walker.  I got to see them free.  All we had to do was go in the place and buy some pop and got to see Lionel Hampton.  He lived here and I just got to see all the old timers free.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was that exciting?
Speaker 2: I beg your pardon.
Speaker 1: Was that exciting?
Speaker 2: Oh that was real exciting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my daughter [Sondra Campbell] just went on a cruise about three years ago and she got on this cruise in California and she told 'em that she was from the Five Points and when she told 'em she was from the Five Points they was so glad, they was saying that's where we got our start from the Five Points, so she didn't have to spend another penny 'cause the guys on the cruise they took her with them and was glad to hear her say that she was from the Five Points, and I got those pictures right now 'cause some of 'em is dead now like Cab Calloway and stuff like that.  They're dead now, but I still got all their pictures.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to really meet some of them and talk to them?
Speaker 2: I have, I have met a lot of 'em, the musician.
Speaker 1: Okay, now tell us about some of your meetings with some of these musicians?
Speaker 2: Oh well, I never was the kind to drink nothing heavy.  I would just drink pop and I never did try, attempt, I never did try to go out to party with them, but I would be real happy to be able to tell the truth to say that I seen Nat King Cole and T-Bone, Bone Walker, Muddy Waters.  It was a thrill to me, and I still see Gatemouth Brown every [Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown] once in a while.
Story_ID: 56334
Speaker 1: Now, did you fix the hair of any of the women that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I used to fix Chuck's, Chuck Berry's hair when he would come to Denver [Colorado].  And I fixed Gatemouth Brown's [Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown] hair.  I've, I fixed Bubba Knight's [HM] hair and his uncle; work on all of them.
Speaker 1: Now these are the men right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they would come to the Charlene's House of Beauty?
Speaker 2: House of Beauty and Bubba Knight he didn't want nobody to know he was in there, 'cause he would be getting a little color around his edges.  He didn't want nobody to know when he was coming to Charlene's House of Beauty.  He wanted to get in there and get out.
Story_ID: 56335
Speaker 1: Who else--were, were there any--were any of the women clients of yours?
Speaker 2: I don't remember doing the women.  I remember the women being in Denver.  I remember Dinah Washington came here, and she got in a quarrel with a man and this man put all of her shoes and all of clothes in a bathtub and put boiling hot water on 'em and her shoes look like little doll shoes when they took them out of that boiling hot water.  And I remember Leo Green, singing about Release Me And Let Me Go.  I remember Etta James, I think Etta James is coming, she's coming to Denver real soon, if she's not already here.
Story_ID: 56336
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did you start Charlene's House of Beauty?  Now this is a business enterprise that's, that's kind of this pr, pr pretty fashion--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right, I just took a chance and I, I always kind of believed in myself.  I took a chance and went and put in for a small business loan and another young guy he helped me fill out the paper and I got this loan and then after I got this loan he soon died, but I guess I was pretty good with my manage, managing.  I paid them off, paid 'em off with good credit.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was your shop located?
Speaker 2: 2820 Welton.
Speaker 1: And that's right at the Five Points, right?
Speaker 2: Right in the middle of the Five Points.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my name's up over the door in big letters you can't miss me, big yellow letters, yellow and black.
Speaker 1: How long have you been in business now?
Speaker 2: Oh, I been in business at least fifty-six year.
Speaker 1: Okay, have you trained many other beauticians?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, 'cause in the white school they didn't then.  I don't think they allow now to have heat in those school, little old stoves and they could learn, they could fix white hair and Spanish hair, but our hair is extremely curly comparison theirs, so they would come to me and I would teach 'em how to really get on down and get our hair looking pretty.  I've taught so many here how to do our hair.

She is the head of the sorority that don't nothing--at first did nothing belong to it but black beauty people at the beauty suppliers and hairdressers; I met her.  And right now our sorority keeps the Bethune Cookman College [Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida] open.  She died and it's like a museum now.  Everything is set up just like she left it, and I put on a function every year and the money that we clear we sends it to the Bethune Cookman College and keep it open.

Story_ID: 56339
Speaker 1: All right, were you a member of any other black business associations?
Speaker 2: I'm one of the finals of the Black Business Association in the Five Points Business Association and we would put on fashion shoes there and hair shows and I keep clothes at my house so if any of the little children is not able to buy clothes and they really want to be in the fashion show I have stuff that I can make 'em look pretty and feel proud, where they can be in the fashion show.  And men come up you know like thirty-five years old and they say do you remember me, and I said no I don't.  He said well you let me be in your fashion show, and he said that's one of the reasons I can hold my head up high.  They'd come out on the stage angry with their hand down beside of 'em and I would keep talking to 'em and make 'em feel good about himself.  See everybody think they can model, but they don't know until somebody give 'em a chance, so I've been giving 'em a chance to model forty-five years and just had a big one here lately.
Story_ID: 56340
Speaker 1: Okay, what other kinds of businesses are in Five Points that are members of the association?
Speaker 2: Well, our president is the barber right across the street from us and they have the motorcycle club there and then they have a religious place right down the street from me and they call it the Brother Jeff.  He, he tries to elevate the consciousness of people, let 'em know that they are somebody and they can do something and they have a couple of good fry, people that fry the chicken real well right in the Five Points.  And they have a lady there that's got a beautiful dress shop and just barbers from Lubbock, Texas, and all around.  They come to the Five Points.  They doing well.  I say Five Points have been good to me because I saved up the money to pay for these four places.  I don't owe nobody a penny on 'em.  There right there called Jordan's Corner.  You pass right by it now you can see it.
Story_ID: 56341
Speaker 1: Okay, now you have, you believe in planning and setting goals right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, and I got one little goal and if you use this little goal you can really get what you want.  The name of it is if you can count to four you can do the things that you want to do and have the things you wanna have, but the first thing you have to do number one is you have to have a purpose.  You have to know what your goal is.  Then, after you, that's like planting a seed, then you have to have faith and you have to believe that you can reach this goal, that's number two.  And the number three oh that's the hard one to get through with because the number three is some of your relatives or whatever will be saying you can't reach that goal, but that's like keeping the weeds out.  But, you've got to keep on continuing to--and know that you can reach this goal regardless to who's out there trying to stop you and sometimes you have to just get real frank with the people and tell 'em that yes you can reach your goal.  You don't let your mother stop you, your grandfather stop you, your grandmother, or none other mothers out there that's trying to stop you from reaching your goal.  Just know that you can reach this goal and act like you have already reached it, and then it will come to pass.  So, if you can count to four, number one is planting the seed, number two is cultivating the seed, watering it with the sunshine of faith.  You gotta believe in it.  You got to have faith in it.  And number three is keeping the negative things out, and number four is just know you'll reach this goal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you can count to four, anybody can use that goal and get over.
Story_ID: 56342
Speaker 1: Now, did, did you have a specific technique that you used with black hair?  What was your technique?
Speaker 2: Well, I, the main technique is you don't get, get that iron too hot and you pay attention to what you doing 'cause you don't want to burn nobody real bad.  Whatever you do to 'em you want them to come back, so you will have to be very, very careful with that hot iron right, going right down to a person's scalp.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I still do it now, some of 'em.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a philosophy about how you treat customers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you treat everybody like you wish to be treated, and I believe in helping 'em like I said with the little kids they didn't have clothes to wear to the fashion shoe and I wanted to make some kind of provision for them to have it and I, I kind of believe you reap what you sow.  If you treat everybody right, you'll get it back one way or the other.
Story_ID: 56343
Speaker 1: At least, at least by fooling with this hair I got to do some of the things that I wanted to do.  I was able to buy a brand new Cadillac.  I had it customized and paid cash for it, and I drove it off the floor and people know me by the lady 'cause that was before Mary Kay got popular and they say oh you're the lady who brought the pink Cadillac to--town, so
Speaker 2: Your Cadillac was pink too right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I got to dress like I wanted to dress, 'cause when I was down in that kitchen that cloth coming out that white woman's window I couldn't dress like I wanted to look.  I have been able to dress like I wanted to just doing the hair.
Story_ID: 56344
Speaker 1: Okay, let's, let's walk through happens if I'm a customer and I come into your shop, we'll what, what's the first thing that happens?
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing that happen I'll offer you a seat and then I listen to what you have to say and if we not on one accord then I'll try to turn you around and get you to thinking like I think and then I will cape you up and take you onto the shampoo bowl, scrub your head, put you under the dryer, and I'll check with you periodically to see if the dryer is too hot.  As long as you are comfortable, then I am too.  Then, I get them hot irons ready.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now how do you decide what style to use?
Speaker 2: Well, I just been doing it so long I could look at the people and when they come in there with some kind of off the wall story, then I know they a look foolish, I just tell 'em different.  Tell 'em what I think would look better on them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you blow dry their hair?
Speaker 2: Some of 'em I do, and then some I just go on and put 'em under the dryer so I can be working on somebody else instead of taking up my time with a blow dryer.  But, I have a blow dryer and everything there.
Story_ID: 56345
Speaker 1: Do you hear, do you hear good stories in the shop where people tell you good stories?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we talk and tell some and hear some good stories.
Speaker 1: Can you remember any of those stories?
Speaker 2: Well, one little girl, the lady was real strict on this little girl and she was pretty.  And she got and got with the wrong crowed and got to using the dope and begging her mama for dope, and they caught up with her, but they, she was a minor, so they let her go to California to stay with her relatives and her grandmother just got back from her graduation.  She had finished the twelfth grade, so I was glad to hear that 'cause I was very fond of the little girl.
Speaker 1: Are there are any other big stories, I mean, I mean are there any big stories that happened in your fifty-six years of business on Five Points.
Speaker 2: I think, I don't think they talk the big stories to me like they do to some of the other shops 'cause I, I think they know I'm pretty religious.  I'm not no religious fanatic, but it's just some things I don't go along with.  I had one lady to come in there and she was, to work, and she had one man she was gonna work on his head and he was smoking weed and she had three others waiting.  I don't tolerate stuff like that, so I don't get to get in on what they call the fun; I call it foolishness.
Story_ID: 56346
Speaker 1: Okay, now when people work for you how--now do you have other people working for you?
Speaker 2: Not anymore.  I used to, not anymore.
Speaker 1: And when you used to have people working for you, how did you, how did you pay them?
Speaker 2: Well, some of 'em if they was making pretty good money and wanted to pay me booth rent I would accept the booth rent, but if they didn't make enough money to pay me booth rent then they worked on percentage.  So, if they didn't make nothing they didn't owe me nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so all in all you're pretty successful in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd say Five Points have been good to me.
Speaker 1: Did you have any teachings when you came to--did, I mean, pe, people that you could ask about business procedures and management techniques and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, I borrowed the small business loan I sure asked a lot of questions about that before I borrowed that money, and they was very helpful, you know, telling me the right step to taking, wrong step to take.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 56347
Speaker 1: Have, have you ever had an occasion to rescue somebody's head basically?
Speaker 2: Re--
Speaker 1: Yeah, rescue their hairstyle and help their looks--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah I've had a lot of that.
Speaker 1: Can you--
Speaker 2: And then a lady just asked me she was trying to trick me.  She had a chemical on her hair, and she wanted me to put another chemical on there and if I would have put the other chemical on her present hair it would have came out and then I would have been ready for a lawsuit, but I just thought real fast and told her no I can't put another chemical on top of the way that you have.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: You know I'm, I'm just wondering like with do you have any stories of situations where, you know, something went wrong like with someone's hair that you did, you know, and you didn't, you know not the cas, some case where it did go wrong like someone's hair turned maybe you were putting color on it and it turned green or whatever or, you know.
Speaker 2: I've had that experience.  One lady I put some chemicals on, on her hair and she had another one and her hair just came out, came out bald, but she was a pretty, pretty nice.  She didn't try to sue me.  She knew she was wrong for asking me to do it.  You have to take those different tests on their hair to make sure you know what you're doing if you got anybody that you kind of leery of.
Story_ID: 56348
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Now, now you know you were part of the Cosmetology Association [Colorado Hair Dressers and Cosmetologists Association], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: What things that--can you talk about 'cause that association when did it get formed?
Speaker 2: Oh, right away around like '47' [1947].
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Okay, so that's about the time you were getting started right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Okay, so can you talk about how that association came together and how it changed over the years and, you know, what, what was good about and what wasn't good about it?
Speaker 2: Well, we went around and we gathered up people and asked 'em if they wanted to join the association, and they did they want and did want to and we got us a president, secretary, treasury and we'd constantly ask others to come in and then we'd put on a hairstyle shows and we'd give people like chances to get in the show that had never been in shows before and we would, we have gone--(unclear)--and we've travelled to different states to the convention and thing, but all those real faithful die-hards they already gone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Julieanna Richardson: Okay, but now that's what I was wondering what was the name of the association that you formed and, and why do you think the association was important to have at the time?
Speaker 1: Well, I thought, well I thought it was a good thing to have it to kind of keep up with what's going on.  Now like I said the name of ours was Kappa Omega Chi Chapter and then we've had the Denver Cosmetology Guild and a lot of 'em belong to it, and we had the Beauty Culturists League, and they all would--you could learn something from either one of 'em if you really was interested and wanna learn.  You'd let the person get up there and perform and tell their story.  You could always gain something that would help you in life.
Speaker 2: Julieanna Richardson: But, this wa, this was important in many ways because black women the, you know, besides Madam C.J. Walker and maybe a few other people there wasn't a lot of attention paid to black women's hair, right, and technique?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Julieanna Richardson: --so what were some of the things that people shared or that you learned at these meetings?
Speaker 1: I learned about the chemicals that they would put on the hair, about giving the test before you go because you could put it on some people's hair and if you didn't give that skin test, that hair test, the hair would just come right on off.  So, we learned to give the test before we would start putting those hard chemicals on the people's hair.
Story_ID: 56349
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: And now did you ever hear of Rose Morgan [HM] and the House of Beauty?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Okay--
Speaker 2: Joe Lewis' wife.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Can you talk about her and what--
Speaker 2: I don't remember much about her.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember she was married to Joe Lewis at one time.  I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: But, you both had House of Beauties (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, but she was in one city and that was one state and I was in another.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: That's right.
Speaker 2: Did you ever meet Mabel Little from Tulsa, Oklahoma?
Speaker 1: No, I don't remember meeting her and I went to school with some kids, but I'm sure it's different in the years, you know.
Story_ID: 56350
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: You know did you--are there any other things with your, you know, the business and all of that--like when you got your Cadillac, your pink Cadillac can you talk about how you felt that day that you got it?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew I felt good because I had reached one of my goals.  I had set my goal to get it, and when I reach a goal, a worthwhile goal, I feel good about it.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Ah, now when you--were there any times in your business that things got really bad or you weren't sure how you were gonna make it?
Speaker 2: I don't believe so.  I believe I always had the confidence that I was gonna come out one way or the other.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Were there any people that you had work with you who weren't particularly honest or you know or did wrong, you know, bad things or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one lady worked for me.  They would be selling a little weed in there, but I finally got them out and I thought that was really wrong to come in my place of business and be selling dope, but we got it handled very nicely where it didn't get out to the public real bad.
Story_ID: 56351
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Now when you like you start doing hair in the 1940s, ma'am, but how did things, how things have they changed like in the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s, 1980s with what people are looking to have happen in their hair length.  Like, can you say in the '40's [1940s] these were the types of styles and then in the '50's [1950s] this was in and then in the '60's [1960s] people are doing af, you know, I mean can you just talk about that?
Speaker 2: Well, back in the '40's [1940s] the press and curls was in the, was the style.  Then, about ten years later on the permanent, the relaxers was the style.  Now, they got the cold curls they say it's the style now and going into braiding.  I have definitely seen a change to a certain extent, but nothing beats that press and curl.  If you wanna keep some hair on your head, leave it to pressing and curling.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: And why do you think the press and curl is the best way.  Is it like the least harsh on the hair?
Speaker 2: The least harsh on the hair.
Story_ID: 56352
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: And do you think--what--have you ever done white hair and, and is there, what is the difference you think between black hair and white hair?
Speaker 2: Well, our hair is extremely curly and most of their hair is extremely straight.  So, we have to take the curl out of hair and we have to put a curl in the white folks' hair.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Now, when the '60's [1960s] came along and people were use, you know, doing afros, did you move into that or where you or, you know, were beautician doing that?  Where you okay--
Speaker 2: You know we done quite a few.  I didn't encourage 'em, but right now if anybody come in and ask me for something if I agree to do it then I'll do my best.
Story_ID: 56353
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: And, let me see, what about wigs.  Did you ever get, you know, did you ever sell wigs and?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I took up wig styling and I got my diploma on it and I was pretty good because I went to school to learn how to fix the--I took extra classes to learn how to style those wigs.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Now, what's different about styling wigs and styling, you know hair, I mean regular hair?
Speaker 2: It's a whole lot of difference in styling our hair.  It's just kind of unexplainable, but it's altogether different.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Did you ever come across ma'am when you were, you know, purchasing wigs there was a ma, there was man out of New York who was selling named Dole (ph.) Hudgins (ph.).  I forget his company, but he would sell mail order wigs.
Speaker 2: I don't know about him.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Okay, okay.  Well, where would you get your wigs from?
Speaker 2: Well, I would get mine from right downtown Denver [Colorado].
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: And why would you tell women to wear wigs or would you ever suggest that or would the women come in saying they wanted to have wigs?
Speaker 2: I would just suggest that they wear wigs because as the women get older they hair kind of start coming out and I would suggest that they get, get a wig and gone and be happy.

Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: And ma'am what would be done to make hair healthier, you know like, you know if someone comes and their hair is really damaged, what do you, what would you suggest or what do you think helps make hair healthy?
Speaker 2: I don't know of anything.  After our hair, if the roots is dead in our hair I don't know of anything would go down in the scalp and bring it out and I don't encourage it, I don't discourage it, and I don't encourage it.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Okay--
Speaker 2: 'Cause they see a lot of stuff on TV, you know, and some said work on their head and some say it don't, but whatever they say I don't be in that in case I don't 'em buying up expensive stuff and then it don't work on our hair.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: And what makes the roots dead?
Speaker 2: It's a way, the lack of what you eat and the calcium and stuff like that and vitamins.  You don't be eating proper and some of it is hereditary.  Most of it is hereditary, people get it from their parents. Julieanna Richardson: So, what are the signs when someone's hair, roots or hair is dead, what's the sign?
Speaker 1: The signs of it is if they paying close attention to their hair they'll notice that their hair is getting thinner, receding.  And in most cases, I don't encourage 'em to spend a lot of money to try to get back.  I've seen people with their hair, they have surgery and they put those roots in there, but after our roots is dead it's very difficult to get 'em to come back.  No need to spending all that money for surgery.

Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: But, it's, okay I see.  Now, let's go back to Denver [Colorado] and what you like about the city and what, what you've seen change about it because you came here and set up business before even the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Well, when I first came to Denver do you know anything about the streets here?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: But you can talk about them as if we know.
Speaker 2: All right when I first came to Denver it's a street called Downing Street and it's just about two or three blocks from Welton.  The black people couldn't pass Downing.  They couldn't buy no property on Downing.  Then later on after we lived here, well it's a street called York Street.  They finally started to letting black people buy property on York, and we sure couldn't go out in the Aurora [Colorado] and everything, but now the black people is buying across Aurora, and the white people is coming back down there where we live.
Story_ID: 56356
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: So, do you, you think that changes that you've seen, do you think they've been positive?
Speaker 2: Well, I think they have been negative for the black people.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Talk about that some more ma'am?
Speaker 2: Well, the black people had good businesses down on the Five Points and now we have another man that used to be further out.  He's moved back down there and he's white and he got a business it's not even standing room in there and he sells his food real cheap and he treats you real nice.  Look like I see the Five Points kind of dwindling away.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: So that makes you sad that the black community that you knew that was strong and vibrant is disappearing?
Speaker 2: It's disappearing.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Right.
Speaker 2: We had even last year we had the largest June Nineteenth [Juneteenth] Celebration in the whole world, and this year they split up.  They moved some it near downtown and up where I live at they didn't have any hardly blacks up in there and that made me feel real sad and the people didn't like 'cause I would just speak up the truth.  We had a big meeting with our councilwoman and the--(unclear)--'cause when we first started out, it was a love affair.  It was an affair that people would come down and hug and kiss and greet and meet and bring their children and have cheap food and some of 'em would sell the booths for twenty five dollars for the three or four days and now they asking 500 dollars for the booth, and I just stood up in the meeting and told 'em I said well I have seen the good and bad and the people that are like me I could have done, but there are so many others could not pay no 500 dollars for no booth.  Then, they make 'em close up in the evening at six and then if it come rain they lose all their money that they'd bought of meat, and I told 'em that I was hurt because to see the people that are sweating blood and tears stay down there now they can't, you know, have a booth and can't sell their food cheap 'cause if you, by you pay 500 dollars for a booth you really got to be hustling to make the 500 dollars let alone make some profit.

Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: So do you--Juneteenth, you know, I see that it's celebrated quite a bit here, you know, and it's not like it is where we are in Chicago, but I'm just wondering how long have you remembered it being celebrated?
Speaker 2: I'm one of the founders of it.  We've been celebrating 36 years.  I'm the only woman founder that's in the Five Points Business Association.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Now, that's--okay so talk about how, why, why you started the Juneteenth Celebration and what its purpose is?
Speaker 2: On the purpose, was for us to meet and greet and love each other.  It was a love affair.  Now it's a commercial affair.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: But, what is the meaning for people, you know, who are looking at this, ma'am, who were maybe young and don't know what Juneteenth is, what even the meaning is.  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it is some literature on it.  A man came in and explained to when the black man was freed, but I don't remember too much about it, but I know they got it down, you know.
Story_ID: 56358
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Now, how was it being the only wo, you know, female business owner in, in Five Points and dealing with all the men?  Did you find--
Speaker 2: I was the only woman that belonged to the association, the Five Points Business Association.  It was other women here had businesses, but they didn't belong to the Five Points Business Association.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Now, what was, what would make someone be able to join the association or not?  Why, why were the others not members?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's from way back like we always beat each other up, you know.  We always be divided.  We had a black man to come here, Dr. Daddy-O, and when he came here thirty-eight years ago it was a lot of black businesses, then he wanted to run the Five Point Business Association and he couldn't run it, so he said well I just know what I'll do I'll divide and conquer and that's a common thing.  So, he started to having the Juneteenth in another little community here called Montbello.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Now, who was Dr--I've heard Dr. Daddy-O's name, you know, mentioned already during our trip.  Who was he really?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  He was just a black man from Texas came out here, and he had a lot of good business, qualities about him.  Where he made one big, big mistake he done a lot of credit and then the people didn't want to pay him and our people would always be going to him wanting him to, will you run this for me, will you run this for me and when the time come to pay they wouldn't pay him, so he couldn't stay in business on credit and so he, he sold his radio station, just sold it.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Oh, he had a radio station.  That's what, that's what, okay that's what, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Now, so did you advertise on his radio station?
Speaker 2: I don't think I ever did.  I didn't have nothing again--we was good friends.  He had a club and I'm not that interested in club, but I just believe in cooperating and he called it the VIP Club and I joined it and then if I would get people to go to it.  And he had a nightclub too if I would get people to go out to a nightclub and they said well I came out here on account of Charlene Jordan, and he wouldn't charge 'em to go in.  You know you get a few benefits by belonging to his club.

Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Now, ma'am you've had, you, you've loved Den, Denver in many ways even though you see it's not, you know, your, your--(unclear)--Five Points though the way it is, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Do you think--now what, what about, what do you think about the black community or what hopes or concerns do you have?
Speaker 2: Well, I really don't have no hopes now.  It seem like this last Juneteenth just took everything out of me to see the black people split up and it's their day, you know.
Story_ID: 56360
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: Do you--what about, you know, young people out there who are looking to go into business, looking to go in the cosmetology business what would you, what suggestions would you have for them?
Speaker 2: Well, I always did try be a role model for the younger people.  I always wore my white uniforms and jackets and so some of these kids, you know, they look like they going to--(unclear)--hairdressers and things and I really think that's bad.  I think they should try to look professional if they really want to make the money.
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson: And what about people going into business.  What advice do you have for them?
Speaker 2: Well, if you don't wanna work I wouldn't advise 'em to go into it.  You don't want to take the bitters with t sweets I wouldn't advise you to go into it.

And I have co-signed for some of the men to get suits and stuff that came out here in with one suit, maybe it burned up in the front and they all paid me.  I'm just, I'm just everybody's mother, just steady reaching out helping people.
