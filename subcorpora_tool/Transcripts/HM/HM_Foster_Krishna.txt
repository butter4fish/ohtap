Speaker 1: All right, now before we go into depth, there are five light-weight so called "People Magazine"-ish type questions we always ask and they only require a short answer.  They're sort of a warm up.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I like greens.  Like sauteed or a salad or kale or collard greens.
Speaker 1: Now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I'm more of a blue person than anything, I'd say.  Sea blue, blue-green.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I like so many.  I'd say spring would be my top, spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: My best vacation was a summer in Aspen, Colorado, was my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No.  Let me make one up.  I don't know.  What do I say?  Maybe Herbie can come in here and say what I say?  Is it locked?  He needs to come in.  Should we pause?
Speaker 1: (BRIEF PAUSE)
Speaker 2: All right.  We're being joined by Herbie Pech who is observing.  But did you think of a phrase or saying?
Speaker 1: No.
Story_ID: 30993
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Frances Smith Foster, F-R-A-N-C-E-S S-M-I-T-H F-O-S-T-E-R.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Dayton, Ohio and it's February 8th, but I couldn't tell you the years, '40 something.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: My most vivid histories of my family in North Carolina.  This is my grandfather's father's family.
Speaker 1: This is your mother's grandfather?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side.  My mother's grandfather.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: I don't know his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was a sharecropper in North Carolina.  He and his wife had thirteen kids and the, my--I couldn't tell you either where my grandfather [Quentin Theodore Smith] was in that family but it was a large family.  Then there was an accident and mix-up where my great-grandfather went to stop a confrontation between two people.  It was in front of the church and shots were fired and he was shot.  He didn't die right away but he didn't heal from the wound 'cause they thought they got the bullet out but they really didn't.  And so he died from an infection from the bullet lodged in his chest.  And this caused of course the family business, sharecropping to fall apart cause you don't have a man anymore.  The children were a little on the young side.  And so, I remember this story because our family has always been very sensitive about living within our means and not going into debt because they lost everything in that generation.  A woman with thirteen kids just transplanted with nothing, nowhere to go.  And so this is an important part of my family history on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did they stay in North Carolina or did they--?
Speaker 2: Oh no, they headed up north.  They settled in Dayton [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: At least my grandfather did.  I don't--the core--there are people who stayed in North Carolina.  But my grandfather and I think at least a brother made their way up to Dayton, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And about what time would this be?  What time period would this be cause your mother was born in the '40s [1940s] so--
Speaker 2: This would have to be the mid-'20s [1920s], mid to late '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: 1920s?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--and your great-grandmother moved to Dayton in the--?
Speaker 2: I don't know that.  I don't know where my great-grandmother moved, if she went--he was older.  He was old enough to live on his own--
Speaker 1: Your grandfather.
Speaker 2: --by the time--my grandfather.  By the time he went up North he was old enough to go by himself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the grandfather moved to Dayton, okay.  And okay, now what--so what did he do in Dayton?
Speaker 2: He did all kinds of things.  He, one thing he did was sold coal.  People were still fueling their homes with coal so he started his own business.  He got the money for a truck and he had coal in the truck and he'd run around and deliver it to--and sell it.  It's like instead of the milk man, the coal men.
Speaker 1: There were all kinds of men in those days a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --vegetable, a bread man and a--
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: --dry cleaning man.
Speaker 2: So he did a number of odd jobs like that and in the military.  So he went off, he was a World War II vet.  After that service, he eventually settled into bus driving and became one of the first black bus drivers in Dayton, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Quentin Theodore Smith.
Story_ID: 30994
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay.  So now what about your [maternal] grandmother [Mabel Smith]? Was she from Dayton [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was actually Appalachian and then they made it to Dayton eventually so they met when she was in Dayton.  And so she was there by her twenties.  And she did hair, she was a beautician and when my grandfather [Quentin Theodore Smith] married her he said, "No wife of mine is going to work outside of this house."  And she said, "Oh really?"  So he had to build a house or build a salon attached to the house and so that's where she worked.  So she didn't work outside the house but she got what she wanted and she usually did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you remember where they lived in Dayton?
Speaker 2: I don't know the parts of town.  It's--I know the street.  It's Emerson.  You might be familiar with it.
Speaker 1: I'm from Dayton.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Emerson [Avenue] and oh goodness, what's that main thorough--Gettysburg [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Gettysburg, okay.
Speaker 2: Not so far from Moses, the runner, Edwin [Corley] Moses [1955-, Olympic medalist in 1976 and 1984], a few blocks from his home.
Speaker 1: Really?  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Small world.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother is Mabel Smith and I don't know her middle name.
Story_ID: 30995
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did your mother [Frances Smith Foster] say about growing up in Dayton [Ohio]?  Or did she grow up there?
Speaker 2: She grew up in Dayton.  She said it was good.  It was mostly segregated but that's just the way things were.  And she enjoyed her childhood.  She was the oldest of five kids and so with that came you know little bit of taking care of the little ones.  And she enjoyed baking and she was always studious, it was just a thing.  It was--nobody paid it in any mind.  She just liked school and did well in school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'll ask you a Dayton question here.  Did she go to Roosevelt, Dunbar, Ross high school?  Which one?
Speaker 2: Most of my family is Dunbar [High School, Dayton, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Dunbar, okay.
Speaker 2: So I imagine it was Dunbar but I can't confirm that.
Speaker 1: So that was the traditional black high school in Dayton then, huh?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she did well in school.  Now I take it she went on to college, right?
Speaker 2: She went on to college at about sixteen or seventeen so she finished her high school quickly and went on--was ready for college and her father said you aren't going anywhere.  But he convinced her--him to let her go to Miami [Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she was a young college student at Miami University [Oxford, Ohio].
Speaker 1: That's there in Oxford, Ohio right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, because a lot of people when you say Miami, you're talking about Miami University in Florida.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So we have to qualify it even though Miami University in Oxford is older.  We have to say Miami of Ohio usually for people to understand what we're talking about.
Speaker 2: So she went there.  She had scholarship offers at other campuses but they were further from home so this is what she was allowed to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now she's--she went on to earn a masters and a Ph.D., I believe?  Is that true or--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  She ended up earning a Ph.D., only because her job required it.  So, even though she's very scholarly, one of the tops in her profession now, when she took the Ph.D. for independent study, it wasn't for that.  It was for job security.  The hiring was changing and to be--she was doing part-time work and that was, I don't know what was happening with the budget.  But she thought it prudent to become a full-time faculty and that required the Ph.D., so she took it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She's an author now.  What--give us an example of what she does, she's a writer.  She's involved in African American literature.
Speaker 2: Mom is an author.  She specializes in American literature.  She specializes predominantly in women who were writing during this--times of slavery so antebellum women's writings.  And I think everyone she's studied closely is African American, Frances Harper [1825-1911], Phillis Wheatley [1753-1784] were two of her big contributions is collecting writings by and about them.  Lots of people think Phyllis Wheatley but she found some more and Frances Harper was really her first big professional contribution.  Currently she has, is still focusing on the same literature but she's focusing more on relationships and couples.  So she wants to understand from the source what was happening in slavery as far as romantic relationships.  And so these are her more recent publications.
Speaker 1: So what's the name of latest book?
Speaker 2: The latest one is "Love and Marriage in Antebellum America" or is it "Antebellum Black America" [sic, "'Til Death or Distance do us Part: Love and Marriage in African America", published in 2009].
Story_ID: 30996
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm going to ask you about your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Warren Reed Foster, W-A-R-R-E-N R-E-E-D F-O-S-T-E-R.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Cincinnati, O--yeah, Cincinnati, Ohio and in the 1940s.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's October 20--22nd.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now what can you tell us about his side?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Well we have a very vivid family story about education during slavery.  I don't know how many greats in front of this person's name or her name but I have a slave ancestor who wanted to read and this was illegal.  And so she learned to read illegally.  And when she was caught reading they cut off her thumbs.  And so we've had for a long time a strong value of education and a bit of stubbornness to go along with that to do what we feel needs to be done.  And so, you know, that's a legacy of mine is that slave ancestor.  Further up, his grandparents were property owners and he's living in his--in the property his grandmother owned.  It was a huge, huge place.  And I don't know what their business was though.  I couldn't tell you.  But they were fairly comfortable for the times.
Speaker 1: And now where was the place, in Cincinnati or on the outskirts or--?
Speaker 2: It's in Cincinnati near the--it's right off Fleischmann Gardens near the University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio] is the property.  And it was burned in the fire and it was reconstructed into a duplex.  And my father and my aunt bought the property or the new houses on the property.  They already owned the property.
Speaker 1: So this was, Fleishmann Gardens was a housing, a building itself or housing complex?
Speaker 2: No, Fleischmann, the butter people [Fleischmann's, ConAgra Foods], the margarine people had their home, they had the family home and then a spreading semi-public garden and so some portion of that is still maintained and upkeep and open to the public.  It's kind of a landmark in that part of Cincinnati.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the original land was owned by your father's family you're saying or--?
Speaker 2: It was right next to it.
Speaker 1: Right next to it, okay.
Speaker 2: Right next to that property.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So the land is still there and--?
Speaker 2: The land is still family land and that was a huge family fight is to keep the lab after--keep the land after the fire, the fight with the city government [Cincinnati, Ohio] 'cause they wanted--when we didn't have money to rebuild the property and there was a tug-o-war between our family and the city as to who was going to get this land.  And so it took years, you know, of deliberation but we were able to secure the land and keep it in the family.
Story_ID: 30997
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now your father [Warren Reed Foster], now where did--did he go to high school in Cincinnati [Ohio] and grow up in Cincinnati, too?
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, what was he interested in doing when he was young?
Speaker 2: He was interested in--he was a tough guy.  You know he was just kind of tough in negotiating and trying to--very street smart.  My father is very street smart.  And he was just all up in that culture, that's what he was interested in is surviving and not in a desperate way but trying to get one up.  You know, trying to--peoples' psyche is something he was very interested in.  He always sat by the door so he'd know when to run kind of thing.  'Til this day he still sits--he knows where the exit is so he can run.  He loved to dance you know, he loved to have parties in his mommy's, in his mother's basement.  And you know throw parties and dance, dance, dance, dance.  He loved to have fun.  But he also was very good with the books, not as efficient as my mother [Frances Smith Foster] but he liked learning new things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did he finish high school in Cincinnati and go to college?
Speaker 2: He did.  My parents met at Miami University [Oxford, Ohio] and he took a bit longer because he had to work.  So he took eight years to take his bachelor's because he would work and then go to back to school.  And he'd only pay tuition when he had it.  But he did graduate from Miami.
Speaker 1: Now was he older than your mother?
Speaker 2: By a couple of years, three or four years.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So okay, so there weren't--now I know from being from that area that there weren't that many black folks at Miami in way back, in those, I guess when they would have been there in the '60s [1960s] or late '50s [1950s] early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Late '50s [1950s] 'cause by the '60s [1960s] my mom had moved to Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they probably were pretty, had to have decent grades to get in you know to, you know sticking, Miami has a high academic standard.  So well it probably took eight--was he living in Oxford when he was going to--?
Speaker 2: When he had money to live in Oxford, he'd live in Oxford and then he'd go work in Cincinnati and then go back to school when he could afford it.
Story_ID: 30998
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: There's a story about the proposal.  I don't know about how they met.
Speaker 1: Well that's (unclear).
Speaker 2: My dad [Warren Reed Foster] all of a sudden had the desire to get married and have children.  This was just something--he's very energetic and focused.  And so he did the same thing when he decided to marry.  And so he had a list of prospects and when the first one said no, then he asked my mother [Frances Smith Foster].  And he let her know, "Well, she won't do it, will you?"  And she said, "Well fine, I'm going to think about it." Then, you know.  I'm not going to, she said I'm not going to marry this guy.  What is this?  And then eventually she decided to do it.  I don't know what made her do it but she said yes.  So it's really unromantic, really just like matter of fact, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well do you think they were in love when they got married?
Speaker 2: I think of the 'Fiddler on the Roof.'  "Do I love you?", that thing.  So I don't know, I guess so.  I guess so but I'm not them--
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Now did they start a life together in Cincinnati [Ohio] or Dayton [Ohio] or--?
Speaker 2: No, they very quickly went out to San Diego.  He was military so they went out to Point Loma [a community of San Diego, California] I believe is where they were living initially which is southern San Diego.
Speaker 1: Now is this the [United States] Air Force he got in or what?
Speaker 2: He was navy.
Speaker 1: Navy, okay.  So did he join the navy right after he graduated from Miami or how did he--?
Speaker 2: That's a blur to me.  I don't know how quickly--no cause he--well yeah he did, he went to Nam [Vietnam], so he went to Vietnam in the [United States] Navy but I don't know if he went immediately after.  When he would go back and work he would often work at the GM [General Motors] factory where his father worked in Cincinnati.  So it's possible he spent time there before he joined the military.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's a kind of hazy part what--?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, but they went out to, they moved out to California.  Now this is now what about 19--?
Speaker 2: They came to California in about '68 [1968], '67 [1967], '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I forgot one important thing for my oral history is he studied chemistry.  But it was applied chemistry.  He got a bachelor of arts and I think the degree might have said paper technology.  So he had similar drive as I did.  That's just the way it worked out.  And paper technology--my mother also wanted to be the next Betty Crocker [corporate icon in baking products] so she wanted to be an applied chemist was her gut.  And then she had a professor who was grading her unethically and she just didn't want to fight that.  I mean she would hand in excellent work and the grade would always be lower. And my recollection is that the professor even said, "You're never going to get an A out of me."  And so she just turned her head and picked a new profession.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's when she started, she turned to literature?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  So even though I'm the first chemist, both of my parents had tendencies toward chemistry.  One has a degree in an applied form of chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now when you think of their talents and their dispositions and their political views and their looks and their habits, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I would say I'm a bit more like my mother but in some situations I'm very much like my father.  So I'm kind of a mutt between the two of them, really, really blended.  I look more like my father.  That's clear 'cause I look more like him.
Story_ID: 30999
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I do.  I have one biological brother, Warren Quentin Foster.
Speaker 1: Now are you, now where do you stand?  Are you the oldest or are you in the middle or--?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you have one brother named Quentin Foster?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And any sisters?
Speaker 2: I have a non-biological sister but I was so young when she moved in, what's it matter, right?  So she is older than me.  I was two.  She was sixteen when she came to our house [ca. 1972].  And she came because she wanted to live and work in the U.S. [United States] She came on a student visa and--
Speaker 1: From where?
Speaker 2: She was born and raised in Mexico.  And her name used to be Rosa Maria Ramirez.  Now she's Lisa Rhodes.  But she came and lived and worked with us through my entire childhood.  She married and left the house when I was about ten.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you know if that doesn't make a sister I don't know what does.  You know it wasn't, she wasn't, I didn't--it wasn't a nanny situation at all.  She lived with us and she was our sister.
Story_ID: 31000
Speaker 1: Okay.  No your father [Quentin Reed Foster] at some point he worked for IBM--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --I guess.  So tell us about that.  What did he do for IBM?
Speaker 2: He was a sales person.  He sold computers when they were about the size of this room.  And he--that's it.  I mean it comes from his craftiness, his street smarts.  It's very natural for him to be into sales because he's good at convincing people to do things.  And so that's how he ended up after an M.B.A. from USC [University of Southern California].
Story_ID: 31001
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now do you have an earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: The one that jumps into my head was, it has to be traumatic to be the first thing on your mind.  I was four, my brother was two.  We were playing in the front yard when people had those big cement bird baths and he was climbing on the bird bath and it fell and hit his eye.  He ended up with twenty stitches right above his eye.  And so that was quite traumatic as remembering that accident.  That's my clearest youngest memory is four [ca. 1974].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you move a lot when you were young or did you live in the same neighborhood--?
Speaker 2: Not so much.  We moved to San Diego [California] from Los Angeles [California] when I was one.  I don't remember that.  And I stayed in that home until I was about ten.  My mom did a sabbatical for a year.  We want to Atlanta [Georgia], we came back and we had a new home in the same city.  So I had two childhood homes really that I fully remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we have to pause here and mark a chapter and then we'll--
Story_ID: 31002
Speaker 1: All right, now we always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Beach.  I'm beach, 100 percent beach.  And even I come up here I feel like a transplant because I'm a beach culture kind of person.  So the salt air, the beach air is a vivid smell, the waves.  My mom [Frances Smith Foster] says even in utero the waves would calm me down.  They're kicking and she'd go to the beach and I'd just relax because I am, I'm very outdoors.  I love the outdoors.  I prefer to exercise outdoors.  I prefer to be outdoors and I think that comes from my early [child]hood memories of the beach.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you live in a--what was the name of neighborhood that you lived in?  In San Diego, was there a name for your neighborhood or part of town or what was--?
Speaker 2: It was the city of La Mesa, La Mesa, California was part of San Diego County.  And I don't have any neighborhood names beyond that, just the city name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well what were you interested in growing up?  Now you already said you liked to be outdoors and you liked the beach and so what would you do with your time, your free time when you were little?
Speaker 2: I had lots of free time and a big imagination.  So I remember building forts, collecting bugs, lots of playing with dolls.  I liked building things.  I'd love on Saturday mornings to pull out all the chairs and blankets and sheets and build a fort.  That was one of my highlights of Saturday morning is to just make a big mess.  And then a huge project was a fort on the hillside that was just this kind of community property.  And me and the other kids in the neighborhood all got together and talked about what this fort was going to look like some day and would take little cups and scoop--I mean it got a pretty big size.  I mean we could sit there comfortably inside our little dig out--dug out.
Speaker 1: Was it like a sand fort or something or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just a sand fort.  Bike riding.  I remember one thing I enjoyed is just hours.  You come home with the lights, street lights come on.  So you go out by yourself or with my brother [Quentin Foster] or with some friends, just ride bikes, look at bugs, just kick the dirt, nothing.  We did hours of nothing.  And I find that very different than today.  I know my kids' life is too structured and I work hard to get the unstructured part in there.  I did do I remember Saturday swim lessons, few music lessons here and there.  Picked up clarinet in fifth grade, piano younger than that but it never took.  I just took some piano lessons.  I couldn't tell you--I actually think I was older.  I think I was maybe twelve, I might have studied a bit, but mostly just looking at bugs, nothing, riding bikes.
Story_ID: 31003
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were you in Girl Scouts [of the USA] or anything like that?
Speaker 2: I did one Bluebirds' meeting [a program for little] and that's it.  So no I didn't do girl scouts.  I did some activities with my church [United Church of Christ, La Mesa, California].  By the time we were teenagers we would go down and we were taking care of an orphanage in Ensenada [California].  So we would build--I wasn't involved in the construction but we'd mainly go and play with the children is something we did on a regular basis.  And of course bring them food and clothes.  And I enjoyed plays, school plays.  My first one was "The King and I".  I had one line.  "Do you like us?"  And I practiced and practiced.  Those were the little princesses.  And I would always get intimidated, whether it was an elementary school audience or a church audience, lots of performances in front of the church, plays, singing, that kind of stuff.  And I would always get so excited about it and sometimes I'd do it right and sometimes I didn't but this is--this made an impression is all the performing as a child.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's the prelude to getting to know you I think the "Do You Like Us?" song.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now was--now what was the name of your church?  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: United Church of Christ, La Mesa [California].
Speaker 1: Now was church really important growing up?
Speaker 2: Church was an important but casual thing.  You know it was never like I'm better than you, or this is the only way to worship.  It was like this is the way we worship.  It was always open and inclusive.  It was an integrated church meaning that we integrated it so it was--we didn't start going 'til I was about six and asked questions about life and death and God and all those things that you need to answer as a parent and you either choose to do it with or without religion.  Someone said, get this child to a church.  So we went with some of my mother's [Frances Smith Foster] colleagues from work to a place that accommodated our lifestyle which was open and inclusive, very non-judgmental but very, very serious you know about improving yourself, your spiritual journey and also looking out for those around you, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So had high moral ideals in the church and a sense of activism 'cause here you all are being involved with trying to do something to improve the community.
Speaker 2: Lots of outreach activities in my family church.  So, church camp, it included a church camp so we'd go up for every year and then even during the family camp.  And, I don't know, it was fun.  It was always fun.  It was never like a drudgery or a burden and very empowering.  It was almost like a lecture.  Our sermons were very--not dictating but interpreting and for the modern world.  This might have happened to you this week.  This is what the scripture says about our life today.  So that's the type of congregation I grew up in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Not a lot of fear stuff and that--?
Speaker 2: Not a lot of fear.
Speaker 1: You know hell and brimstone?
Speaker 2: No.  Not even close.
Story_ID: 31004
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now when did you first start thinking about or can you remember a time when you first started thinking about becoming a scientist or did you at that age?
Speaker 2: I can look back and see traits where, you know, this fits me and my characteristics but I didn't commit myself to science at an early age.  I can't say that at all.  I enjoyed, like my mother [Frances Smith Foster] I enjoyed baking.  I think I left that out and remember at like ten I was making lemon meringue pies with perky meringue and everything right.  I would work on making that just right.  So I had tendencies towards wet lab  chemistry [a laboratory working with matter] and chemistry and curiosity.  You ask for phrases earlier.  One of my childhood phrases is why?  Why?  I always wanted to know why and so much so where I was in a kitchen at the Montessori school where they involved children in doing different types of activities.  And the teacher very much wanted the children in the kitchen but when I would ask too many questions, she kicked me out and I was traumatized because I was too into it.  I was too into the why and how and can I help you and, you know, I was a busy little child that way.  And I went home crying to my mom, "I got kicked out of the kitchen."  But this was quite scientific in that I believe it's all about observation, the power of observation and interpretation is what science is to me.  I teach my students, as I've matured as a teacher I add more students that--add more assignments that reflect my values as a scientist.  It's not that there is a basic skill set that you learn.  Everyone has to learn the rules.  This--these are tools that we use to solve problems but the ultimate is really solving problems and understanding that every one of us has a spark of genius.  Everyone has the potential for genius.  It's about being ready, being prepared and being creative, putting yourself in it.  And these are things that I expressed as a child as far as creativity and drive and also very good at following the rules.  You know I would always get a check plus for good behavior.  I was very good at listening and following the rules.  And no I didn't know I would end up as a scientist, but I can see that this is the profession for me.  My first formal commitment to science didn't come until it was time to select a college.  So that's when I picked engineering, mathematics, science.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well I don't want to get you there yet.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But so, now okay well, did you--were you the type of kid that watched the nature programs on television and when Walt Disney would have this nature segment or you know programs on public television and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I remember the Jacques Cousteau [Jacques-Yves Cousteau].  You know who didn't watch Jacques Cousteau at that age.  And '[The] Electric Company' [PBS, 1971-1977] and '1-2-3 Contact' [sic, '3-2-1 Contact,' PBS, 1980-1988].  That's the name of it.  That was--that show just sucked me right in.  I was about ten years old at the time and I would watch it religiously.  It was a science show and that was very exciting to me, again another early indicator that I enjoyed that show.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah that's, I remember that show now.  I mean I didn't, I don't think I ever watched it but I remember just seeing it listed you know.  I didn't know what kind of show it was but it's a science one.
Story_ID: 31005
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And back to the outdoors things, part of this Montessori school is called the Discovery School that I went to only in the summers.  But we would go to the tide pools weekly and I really enjoyed those outings, going to the tide pools, learning about the different animals that lived there, how they react, you know if you tried to touch them, just watching, watching, watching, watching, never boring just doing next to nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, non-beach dwellers probably want to know what are tide pools?
Speaker 2: Tide pools are places where wild life--marine life live.  But the tide from the ocean comes in and out.  So under high tide it's covered with water and you can't get there easily.  Low tide, you can walk right up to it and the animals live in shallow water and you can visit them.
Speaker 1: So these are animals like what, crabs and--?
Speaker 2: Mussels and sea anemones and crabs are some of the big ones, few tiny little fish.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were in camp you know several summers where this Discover camp when you--where they actually study the creatures or--?
Speaker 2: No.  It was a Montessori School and one of the outings was a beach outing once a week.  Right, so it was--they--another thing I did there is I drew an elephant.  So I don't know what I was drawing.  They don't stop you from just being creative.  So my elephant didn't have a nose.  Well it had a nose, no trunk and then they ended up publishing it in the San Diego Zoo because it was so cute and different.  Only a child could do this cause it's just wrong not to put a trunk on it, right?  But they didn't stop you from things like that so they just let kids be kids is kind of the philosophy of this school.  Give them experiences and let the kids be kids.  And this was a day camp I went to in addition to once, one or two weeks a summer I'd go to a sleep-away camp.  But this was a day camp I'd go to while my parents worked.
Story_ID: 31006
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now well, now where did you start elementary school?  What was the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Maryland Avenue Elementary [School, La Mesa, California].
Speaker 1: Maryland Avenue?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is in San Diego, right?
Speaker 2: La Mesa, yeah.
Speaker 1: La Mesa, okay.  So I know you liked school so I'm not going to ask that question.  But were you the teacher's pet in school?
Speaker 2: If I liked the teacher.  So years later the teacher had--would like me.  I wouldn't go around you know waiting for approval.  I didn't do that.  But I enjoyed their approval and I enjoyed pleasing the teacher and playing with my friends.  One signature moment was second grade.  I did not have a good teacher for second grade.  And the--they had math workbooks for us to do.  So my friend and I finished our math workbooks about December.  School lets out in May or June and the teacher didn't let us have any more math books.  She said that's it.  That's enough for you, you're done.  And so we just sat there for the rest of the year.  And don't you know as a physical chemist I do the most math intensive chemistry possible and my friend is now a high school calculus teacher, math teacher.  So both of--so it's very different than my other experience.  My summer camp [with Montessori School], the day camp would let the kids go as far as they want, do what they want.  You know I had a good enough school with good and bad teachers for elementary and some of them really put the brakes on kids' talents such as my second grade teacher.  But I had a lot of good experiences too.  So Mrs. Echols is somebody who was my second grade teacher and I think she must have bonded partly over me with my mother [Frances Smith Foster] and then with my brother [Quentin Foster] who took a little longer getting adjusted to school as many active boys do.  But they would have lunch twenty years later is how close that instructor was to our family.  So it ran the gamut.  It really ran the gamut and I had some excellent teachers.  I still have in my house books that the teacher would bind for us in third grade.  Ms. Jenkins would take anything we wrote 'cause, you know, writing is so important at that age and let us write stories and I have an archive of like six books about 'Patty the Purple Elephant.'  Again, just let the kid do what they want.  No right and wrong and that was actually I think a psychological development for me cause Patty was different than her friends.  I went to an integrated elementary school also so Patty was the purple one and everyone else was gray.  And Patty was like what do I do?  I'm purple.  And it was an accident.  She got purple because she held her breath too long.  And so this purple elephant realizes that it's okay to be with people different than yourself or elephants different and your friends will still love you even if you look different than them and it's okay.  And she was proud to be purple.  So here I am a, what, eight or nine year old deciding it was okay to be African American, but struggling as many people do when you are in a situation where--that's integrated with difference.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean did--so were you generally treated fairly in school?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I don't remember any name calling.  Actually the only problems I had was in fifth grade if you want to--I don't know if I'm cutting the timeline.  But in fifth grade I went to an all black school when my parents--when my mother took a sabbatical in Atlanta [Georgia].  And that's the only harmful experience I had in elementary where they decided to stop talking to the California girl for like three, four days.  All the little girls I hung out with just outcast me and I was traumatized.
Speaker 1: Now why did they do that?
Speaker 2: Because they're little girls, I don't know.  They decided to pick on the new one.
Speaker 1: There's a lot of dialogue these days about what little girl culture, young women and how they treat each other and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: I'll never know.  I never know.  But no, that's only one experience and it wasn't in the integrated environment.  I can't think of anything where I was treated poorly.
Story_ID: 31007
Speaker 1: I know my mother [Frances Smith Foster] fought--I know my mother did a lot behind the scenes with the teachers when it came to testing for the gifted and talented programs, that's when she really ramped it up and I was fully aware of that because that was sixth grade.  I had tested earlier and they had kind of ignored my test scores.  I wasn't--it was a set aside class.  It was, there's different programs.  There's different classrooms for the gifted and talented kids and I wasn't part of those and my mom was like, what are you guys doing?  What are you thinking?  What are the numbers?  So she had these conferences and got me in those programs.  So there were barriers behind the scenes, but me as a little girl, no big deal.  No problems.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So face to face contact was all right but behind the scenes there was some racism being acted out (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Oh absolutely.  The next major fight was eighth grade where you have to take pre-algebra in order to graduate high school with calculus.  So you have to be on the right track for math in order to get high school calculus.  And that was a case where I tested second highest in the class and they decided not to put me into the pre-algebra program so all Hell broke loose with that one, right?  And I got my pre-algebra.  "Mommy, why am I switching math classes?"  Here I am in junior high and I didn't know you know what she had to do to make that happen.  So there were fights.  There was discrimination.
Speaker 2: Do you think that had your mother not been educated as well as she was that that probably could have--you probably could have fallen by the wayside and not been allowed to--?
Speaker 1: Oh no absolutely.  I owe her so much in being aware of how the system works and preserving my spot in it.  Because little, you know, you never know.  People are good at recreating themselves and overcoming barriers.  But I had fewer to deal with because she fought when it was time to fight.
Story_ID: 31008
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now so you went to fifth grade in Atlanta, Georgia.  And how did you like that as compared to Cal [California]--I mean can you compare it to, well other than a bad experience with the social experience.  I mean, was it--did you feel exhilarated being around that many black people at one time or did you--or what was the--?
Speaker 2: This is a precursor to what happened later.  So I'll save later for later.  In high school I had to do, being black, 101 right?  I had to do this.  My mom [Frances Smith Foster] did all types of stuff but we can talk about that later.  And I cannot remember what happened in those fifth grade years.  I thought it was interesting and exciting but I didn't--I wasn't life changing.  It was interesting and exciting and comforting.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Despite the--?
Speaker 2: Despite the little one-week confrontation of exclusion, exiled from the group.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was also an interesting time so I don't know what it's normally like because it was during the child murders [1979-1981] in Atlanta.  So for the first couple of weeks we go, I was enjoying the forest and playing in the forest.  And then all of a sudden the broadcast came out that you know someone was going around killing little black kids.  So we didn't do that anymore.  And we had more structured time, more than when I was a young child, come in when the lights come home in San Diego.  My Atlanta year was a lock down period for the children where we were allowed to play but in the sight of adults and with other children and there was real restrictions.  So I don't think I had the full childhood experience in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Now that was a big media, lot of media attention on Atlanta child murders in the '80s [1980s], I guess in the mid-80s [1980s], yeah.
Speaker 2: About '85.
Speaker 1: Yeah, about 1980s.
Speaker 2: No, earlier than that, '82 [1982], early 80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: It lasted for some years (unclear) as I recall.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So you were there during the year when you couldn't get outside to--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 31009
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you come back to San Diego [California] right?  And so now are there any particular teachers in grade school that you know kind of stand out other than--well the one that you talked about that was a friend of your brother's too you know that helped your brother.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Is that the only one you really--?
Speaker 2: In grade school, no.  Mr. Lampey was the one year I was in the gifted and talented program and that was an amazing experience.  They had a non-traditional classroom with grades four through six and so my younger brother [Quentin Foster] was in the same program but next door.  They didn't want the siblings in the same room.  But we would get to go as far as we wanted.  We'd do things like draw your hand which is a powerful exercise for a young brain.  Draw your hand, right?  And we had a whole week of studying at Balboa Park which has the zoo and museums so we'd do taxonomy at the zoo with our charts.  We'd have to, you know classify the animals--not taxonomy, that's the wrong science.  But we'd have to classify the animals and describe them and do this project at the zoo.  We did art at the art history museum and they got funding in another project where we spent the whole week at the mall.  We were studying things like economics and marketing and you know, world is a classroom type of philosophy and that really opened my mind.  And it was co-taught by Ed Lampey and Doris Jollet (ph).  And so they kept separate classrooms but they planned the curriculum together and it was an amazing curriculum, it was an amazing experience.  So in grade school, that last year in grade school was phenomenal and then also I just love the way Mrs. Jenkins had us do those books.  That made an impression on me.  I mean I still have them.
Story_ID: 31010
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the name of that one?
Speaker 2: La Mesa Junior High [La Mesa, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell us about that?
Speaker 2: La Mesa Junior High is a junior high for one thing so it's a traumatic time in any person's life.  I mean with my name, I was no holds barred, Krishna.
Speaker 1: Now well let me just freeze here and I should have asked you in the first, in the beginning and I guess I'm just--I've heard so many different names.  I'm not--and I'm usually sensitive to asking a question about names in the beginning.  Is there a story behind the name Krishna?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So my, they were deciding--I was born January 7, 1970 so basically that's the '60s [1960s].  You know my parents were very much part of the '60s [1960s].  So they were at the LA Museum of Modern Art [unknown, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, founded 1961] and they were just doing their '60s [1960s] look-at-the-art type of thing and they saw a picture of Lord Krishna and they asked the curator about it.  And the curator described Krishna as a mischievous lover, kind of this little imp but loved and beloved and he was blue.  The thing is one of the personality traits it was--Krishna is always depicted as a blue god and because of this that is to depict the darker skin type.  So the black god is what they picked up on when they picked the name Krishna.  And to add to that story and how international my life is, when my mother [Frances Smith Foster] was looking for childcare, she was running around answering ads in the newspaper.  She went to a woman's door, she said "Sorry, I have no room in a homecare situation."  And she said, "Okay Krishna, let's go."  Dali opened the door and said, "Excuse me?  What's that child's name?"  'Cause she's Hindu and her personal god is Lord Krishna.  I have a picture that she took off her altar one day and gave it to us.  But, it got me my first babysitter, my name did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We'll pause here again for another chapter change.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 31011
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, La Mesa Junior High School [La Mesa, California].  So junior high school and so did they tease you about your name at all?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely, especially, I think his name was Chris Dunn.  He was always calling me, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna [Hare Krishna, or the International Society of Krishna Consciousness, was a religious movement stemming from Hinduism] and it was horrible.  And then the body changes you know you're walking around with this awkward little body and it's like ughh (makes sound).  And it's awful.  It's an awful time.  People call you names and it was just awful.  But I ended up being 'Most Outstanding Eighth Grade Girl' so I kept my academics up and I took an early interest in running.  My father [Warren Reed Foster] was doing marathons at the time and so you know I really took to the mile run during P.E. [physical education], was it.  And then we had a little tract meet, myself and Yvette Marzullo.  We had a--we were the winners of all the different events.  And she ended up in high school selecting sprints, I took distance.  She took her sprints all the way to national level in college.  Well that's jumping ahead.  But my distance didn't take me nearly that far.  So anyway, I picked up running.  I did well in math.  That's when I took the pre-algebra class.  I enjoyed art.  I really enjoyed the art classes.  I always looked forward to them and I still have a few of those pieces too.
Speaker 1: Now what phase of art do you like the most or what method of art expression do you like the most?
Speaker 2: I--the most creative things were, I remember the drawings.  Doing the drawings was something that made an impression.  And the clay was just funny you know just cute little--I have a little king.  It's like a--has no legs.  I think I was reading "[The] Hobbit" [author, J.R.R. Tolkien, 1937] at the time or something at home so it's just this little brown head with a crown and big eyes, no legs, just feet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And big ears.  Anyway, but I really remember laboring over this little parchment, not parchment, it was kind of a handmade paper type of thing. And I wrote the words to Cyndi Lauper's 'Time After Time' [1984] and I burned the edges and I just thought that was the finest piece of art ever.
Story_ID: 31012
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now high school, now you go to like a charter school right?  This is a--
Speaker 2: No, this is still public.  I am a product of the public school system.
Speaker 1: All right, I don't know where we got this from but this is Helix High School [La Mesa, California]?
Speaker 2: Helix High School is now a charter so they switched.
Speaker 1: Oh it's now a--okay.
Speaker 2: They switched.
Speaker 1: Those days it was a--
Speaker 2: When I attended it was just a public school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was the school population like?  What's the break down?  Were there very many African Americans?
Speaker 2: School was pretty much like all my schooling until college where it was pretty much you know few African Americans, mostly Caucasian and then a few others, you know, San Diego [California] since I don't--San Diego has little pockets I think of people of color but not at my school.  We had the Lemon Grove [San Diego County, California] kids who was a--that was a more color rich neighborhood and then we had the La Mesa Proper kids which was more Caucasian.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, well how did you do in high school?  Now did you achieve honors in high school because I know you--?
Speaker 2: I had all kinds of honors in high school.  I think I graduated with a 4.26.  They were just implementing the 5 point system for AP classes [advanced placement].  I remember not taking all the AP classes cause they had one instructor who I really enjoyed and she said please take my AP history.  And I didn't because I wanted time for track.  I was really into track and cross-country and I just didn't want to put in extra time to my studies.  I did the AP math you know, I did the whole calculus sequence and I did that route.  But--so I took my studies seriously but I was--one of the most impressionable things about my high school is just high school track.  And the way I do my profession, the way I do chemistry, the way I do everything is so influenced by the values I developed during those experiences, especially the cross country experience.
Speaker 1: Explain.  What--?
Speaker 2: Well for one thing the scoring is a collective.  I--the scoring is not one individual will make the team win or not.  It's a group and you get the top three or I forget, the two few individuals, their times are collected and then the lowest time wins out of that group.  So everybody has to do well.  You need your teammate to do well.  It's not an individual sport even though you're running by yourself.  You're sitting there, come on Mindy, let's go, right.  So you're running with other people.  So it's individual and collective and science is the exact same way.  So you have to have individual excellence.  You have to do your best.  You have to meet targets, milestones in an efficient manner, but at the same time you have to depend on everyone else doing the same in order for you to get it done properly.  So--and just the discipline, the discipline-side putting in the miles after miles after miles.  I have shin splints.  I don't want to do this today, you know.  I have a headache.  I don't want to do this today.  But you don't.  You just run.  You just do it.  There's no excuses you just do it.  And in fact, that's a phrase.  So in high school we had the "Just Do It," Nike slogan [in 1988. Nike, Inc. is an American producer of sports equipment].  Where the discipline between--behind participation in that sport, the individual responsibility, I'm big on individual responsibility.  It always surprises me when people don't stand up and do what they said they would do.  I'm always shocked, like how could you not?  You promised, right?  So--and then also the winning is fun.  Pushing yourself, you're pushing your own limits.  So you know you have your personal best.  You're running for your personal best.  Doesn't matter what anyone else is doing, you're trying to do the best you can, the best you've ever done, you're trying to do it that day.  What can I do to do this better the next time?  And so all of those lessons are just so valuable and that's when I really got into it is in high school cross country and track where the--if I didn't do that I wouldn't be the same person I am today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it kept me out of trouble too because even though we're under age, we're close to Tijuana [Mexico] where the drinking laws are more liberal and then there's parties.  But I was never a heavy teenage drinker.  I don't think I drank at all really because I knew I had to get up and run the next day.  I wasn't going to do anything to compromise my performance and so I've always--that is something that derails people, right?  I could have been derailed if I had partied harder, but because I valued my running, I didn't.
Story_ID: 31013
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have a favorite subject in high school?
Speaker 2: It's not chemistry.  Wrong answer, but I really enjoyed my English class.  And I think because it's more of the project, it was a project based class where it was an AP English and we did things like okay, you're going to give a report on Madam Bovary but you're going to dress up as Madam Bovary and give the report.  We're going to design a utopia.  You do the energy.  You do the water.  You do the living conditions or whatever, right, so teamwork designing the utopia.  So all this project based learning is something that I really got into.  I enjoyed chemistry.  Ms. Larabee was my high school chemistry teacher and she was good in that she kept us entertained.  You know she would pull students up and demonstrate a covalent bond or an ionic bond.  And she was jumping around and kept it exciting.  So I found it entertaining, but no I didn't know that I would be a chemist in high school.  I just thought that's cute, that's fun.  But English was really my thing.
Story_ID: 31014
Speaker 1: Okay, did you--so did you have any or a dream aspiration in high school, when I grow up I'm going to be--when I go to college I'm going to go for this?  I'm going to be a writer or--?
Speaker 2: I think that's where I take after my father [Warren Reed Foster] is trying to figure out you know that kind of like finagling and saying what can I do to make this happen?  How do I make the best--how do I get mine out of this?  Not so much--the words aren't coming out the way I want them, but what's the--here's the path that's illuminated.  You know, this is the one that is set out for you.  What's the side road, right?  I'm always looking for the side road.  So at that point I knew that in order to choose what I wanted to do next, I'd have to do well academically.  But I was thinking about what's going on around me.  I did notice in high school that the further I got in my math and science curriculum, the more and more isolated I was not only as a woman, but also a person of color.  And I took to that.  I'm like, what's going on here?  There's not--I had no problem doing these problems.  The assignments are not the problem.  Something is going on here where if I choose to take these disciplines, instead of the others, maybe that's the side road.  Maybe something good will come out of this because there's a selection that's happening here.  I don't know if part of it is administrative, part of it is cultural, part of it is what.  But everyone has fallen by the wayside in math and science.  I'm like, this doesn't make any sense to me.  I think I'll take that side road.  So it's more of the rebellion side of things.  It was not necessarily that I felt I was necessarily gifted.  I was competent, but I didn't feel a calling.  But it was high school, especially the end when I was deciding colleges where I really took to the idea that something's going on with STEM [Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how did you choose the college that you attended?
Speaker 2: That was the first major decision I made in my life.  My parents made a point of saying, "Baby, you can go where you want."  Fortunately, they were able to make that a reality.  But they had me choose college and I think it was probably a very good parenting thing to do because in your parents' house you live under your parents' rules.  When you leave the house, you live--you need to know that this is your choice, right?  This is your choice cause you're making all your choices out of your parents' house.  So anyway, before that happened they said you tell me where you want to go. We'll help you think it through.  We'll help you put out the applications but you decide.  So I had looked at the UCs [University of California] and the California girl, of course you look at the UCs.  And with the family insight I had chosen UC Davis [University of California, Davis] as my top California school and that's because it had a stronger friendliness for the undergraduate culture than other campuses.  It was a start-up campus, it was fairly new at the time [established within the University of California system in 1959].  They also had huge extracurricular activities.  So I knew with my devotion to athletics in high school that I didn't want it to take over my life in college.  But it was so much a part of my life I didn't want not to run.  You know I couldn't see myself not running, not competing but I didn't want to have to sacrifice my studies or make a choice between performing for a team and performing in the classroom.  So I actively chose not to develop in that area.  I looked at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] I think is the only campus I looked at outside of the UC system and that's because it's a historically black university [HBCU].  And this goes back to something I didn't say much about this "Black 101" in my high school years.
Story_ID: 31015
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: So just a little refresher there.  Okay, your body starts changing in junior high, that's one thing.  But then you start dating in high school and so you become hyper-sensitive about your appearance in high school.  This is pretty universal especially in California where I learned going to the East Coast there's a lot of fashion--hierarchy based on fashion, clothes.  But your appearance, your physical, your body was very much an issue in this beach culture.  So my legs were getting bigger and my lips were wider than other people this--that already been that way and I didn't look like a white girl and so I had some insecurities with that.  And so my parents immediately when they noticed these insecurities and, and more so than that, I was doing well academically.  So I had so many reasons not to fit in because so many of the Lemon Grove [California] kids who were more people of color were not college bound.  I ran distance instead of sprints.  So I was like, I'm a freak.  I'm an absolute outcast you know, and I don't know where I belong.  So quickly my mother joined Jack and Jills which is an African American middle class social club service.  I don't know what they call it but it is a social club in practice and so I was able to see that oh, okay there are African Americans who come from middle and middle-upper class homes.  You know there's--my socioeconomic status does not alienate me from being African American.  My parents', not mine.  But, so they did that and then also through high school my mother said no matter what you do on--you have to be home at midnight on Friday.  On Saturday you need to tell me where you're going.  But you must get up and go to church.  But now you have an option.  So now I'm doing "Black 101."  I could go to the AME church [African Methodist Episcopal Church] across town and I could go there, either their Sunday school or their worship or I could go to my family church.  So, but she gave us that option of just letting us explore where we want, be with who we want, develop and learn again what it is to be African American in a--African in America, what it's like to do that.  So every teenager does some soul searching but I had it hard.  I had it really bad.  And my parents did some intervention to make it so that I had some stability.  But then Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] came along and Spelman is a historically black school for women is--well it served for me an opportunity to continue my development, to focus on myself with my gender and my ethnicity in this country and deal with it and sort it out and not let it be a hindrance for my professional life.  I see grown women who are still trying to grow up as far as identifying themselves as a relevant and meaningful subgroup in this country.  I have no apologies, you know, for my ancestry.  I'm very proud of my heritage.  And I was able to explore that in--at Spelman inside the classroom and outside the classroom.  Now, when I was selecting colleges I didn't know any of this.  I just walked on the campus and it felt good.  It felt like I could just exhale, right?  Where--it was summer.  We were--we didn't make it to that campus until the summer but I immediately felt a sense of calm and so that's where I studied and got--that's how I chose the campus.  There was a perk, right?  I had an interest in science technology.   They had a scholarship for science technology.  But it was not the definitive factor.  I didn't take it out of a sense of duty.  I took it because it was available.  So it was a full-ride, four years, housing, tuition, everything.  Summer employment at my NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]--I went to Jet Propulsion Laboratories [Pasadena, California].  So it was a good package and it was attractive, but it wasn't a major criteria in my decision making.
Story_ID: 31016
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were, from what I remember, I can't see it because I don't have my glasses.  But you were a Packard Scholar, is that it?
Speaker 2: I was a Packard for graduate school [at University of Colorado at Boulder, 1992-1998].
Speaker 1: For graduate school okay.  I couldn't see (unclear), but okay, but you got a full scholarship to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] which is a good thing.  So now, was Johnnetta Cole the president?
Speaker 2: Johnnetta Cole was inaugurated when I was there.  The same-she had served for one year but her inauguration was the year that I entered in '88 [1988].
Speaker 1: Okay, for the sake of those watching this film, it is part of a family of schools in the same geographical location in Atlanta, African American schools, Morris Brown [College], Atlanta U [Atlanta University], Morehouse [College]--
Speaker 2: And Clark.
Speaker 1: Clark, right.
Speaker 2: And at first there were Clark and Atlanta University.  Now it's Clark-Atlanta University--Clark College-Atlanta University I think was the distinction.  Now it's Clark-Atlanta University.
Speaker 1: They merged right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was the atmosphere there like when you were in school?
Speaker 2: The atmosphere was charged by a sense of identity.  You know Queen Latifah [Dana Owens] was the great female rapper at the time with you know, "Who You Callin' a B?" [song] Right?  It's just like women standing up for themselves who wore the African hat.  And then we had a huge identify with African culture.  I submerged myself in that.  I chose not to join this--the traditional Greek sorority system for practical--I'm very practical in so many of my decisions.  But here you have a woman's college and two major sororities.  I don't think so.  I wasn't going to go through that mess.  So I still wanted that sense of belonging, that special organization and so I became a member of Ossett, the African sisterhood.  Kemet was the brother organization at Morehouse [College]'s campus and we'd have some joint activities.  But Ossett was a little blip in the early '90s, [1990s], late '80s [1980s].  And it doesn't exist today but it was good for me and the intention is good.  And I hope that it's still happening in some shape or form somewhere.  But what it did for me was it allowed me to, in joining that community, that sisterhood, study my African heritage.  So we studied ancient Kemet.  We did a lot of readings about the origins of things.  "The Book of the Dead" has the same stories in the Bible and the Koran, right?  So there's things that African people have put in place long ago and just to realizing that that was African was huge for me.  And, of course, everyone says the kings and queens of Africa, we studied that too.  But the contribution, the Dogon people in science with their astronomy and their ability to understand you know years before other peoples were understanding what's going on with the stars and calendars created by the Dogon people.  I was learning all of this on the side in college.  In addition, in the classroom we were studying Toni Morrison's "The Bluest Eye" [1970] and Zora Neale Hurston [author, "Their Eyes Were Watching God"] and readings by African American women.  Our instructors, I took calculus, linear algebra and differential equations from African American women.  So there's no sense of insecurity as far as I shouldn't be doing this.  People would come studying us.  By the time we were graduating there would be focus groups, why are you--I think it's 30 percent of the population at Spelman today studies STEM [Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics] majors.  And it's because I think that, well the Spelman woman wants to achieve.  There's a certain sense of--there's a high bar there.  And so going for what is tough is not a problem.  We're tough in that way.  And then on top of that, there's a security.  By studying these disciplines at Spelman you're not marginalized.  I was in the honor's dorm in the wing with people on the same scholarship as myself.  So I was cohorted with other women from all over parts, other parts of the country, all of them high achieving in high school and all of them from very different walks of life.  But what we had in common is, you know, a calculus class, and our chemistry class and our English class.  And, you know, when I got tired of studying I'd say LaTanya up at 2:00 a.m., studying some more.  And I was like, well she can do it, I can too.  So there's that kind of teamwork again right, where you're pushing each other towards excellence and there's a kind of magic for the class of '92 [1992].  I go back to Spelman now and something happened with that particular class that my girlfriends are now, of course, M.D.s, other Ph.D.s in engineering and mathematics, you know, serving at the National Science Foundation [NSF].  Our reunions are phenomenal but it was a phenomenal experience in just supporting each other in our interests both inside and outside the classroom.
Story_ID: 31017
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was there much interaction in terms of classes taken at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or--?
Speaker 2: When I studied chemistry they did not have a major, an ACS, American Chemical Society accredited program in Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  So to make sure we had the--those certified classes we took our upper division at Morehouse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was you know one of a handful of women in a class of men by the time I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now a lot of the scientists we've interviewed in this sponsored program of the National Science Foundation [NSF] have a history of studying under Dr. [Henry C.] McBay at Morehouse and you there's a building there that Nabrit McBay [sic, Nabrit-Mapp-McBay Science Building], a building--with Dr. [J.K.] Haynes, Dr. [John] Hall and some of the other people.  Who were some of your teachers there that you remember?
Speaker 2: McBay was legendary and I went to seminars by McBay but I never did take his class.  It was in conflict with advanced physical chemistry by Dr. Storey.  So Dr. Story is who I took all my physical chemistry from.  Troy Story is his name.  I don't think he's as legendary as McBay.  Everyone knows McBay.  And that's the one faculty that I remember most of all is just Troy Story.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, so did you become--when did you become a chemistry major?  Did you--is that from the beginning or--?
Speaker 2: I think I finally declared about my junior year.  So the space shuttle [Space Shuttle Columbia] was going up at the same time I was starting school and so like everyone, I wanted to be an astronaut.  And so I was studying aerospace engineering--aeronautical engineering was my first major.  But then the practical side of Krishna comes in and I said, "You mean I can get a degree in four years or this dual degree in six years?  I think I'll take the four year package."  So with the degree we had, I would study for four years at Spelman and I'd get a second bachelor's [degree] at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] or some partnering campus.  And I said a B.S. [degree] is a B.S., why do I need two of them?  So I decided to get out of engineering.  Also, I had another earmark discrimination moment during my engineering training.  I was taking a class at Morehouse and there was this professor who was notorious for marking women students low, especially if he wanted to get to know them better and then expecting them to come to his office.  And so that was a very uncomfortable situation and the reason I don't know, one of the many reasons I left engineering.  But with chemistry, it was a practical decision.  I really liked physics more than chemistry.  But I could see all the things you could do as an employee in chemistry.  I could visualize all the things a chemist would contribute to society more so than physics.  Who would have thought?  You know I now know physicists have a significant role.  There's many jobs that they can do fine more than just teach.  But I also liked mathematics.  I really thought about being a math major 'cause I really liked how clean it was.  That's what I like about physical chemistry is it's so clean.  And some--you know, there's places for absolute creativity and imagination, but the results are quantitative.  Very quantitative, very measured and it's an absolute and I like that about my science.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I've heard that before, too, from people who have said, that are into science.  They like the, you know the exactness of it.
Story_ID: 31018
Speaker 1: All right, so what else about Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]?  Now when you were--I mean about Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] when you were there, did anything significant happen on campus or--?
Speaker 2: Oh sure.
Speaker 1: Anything that you remember that--?
Speaker 2: Well we were under the leadership of Johnnetta Cole, which you know I would wish for anybody.  She's an amazing leader and really took the institution--one of the first things she was able to do was secure a $20 million endowment from the Cosby Family, Bill [William Henry "Bill" Cosby, African American actor] and--oh I forget his wife, oh Camille.
Speaker 1: Camille.
Speaker 2: Of course, that's who my daughter's named after so I should remember.  So Bill and Camille Cosby gave a $20 million endowment and that was unheard of from African American universities at the time, to have a gift of that substance was just something that wasn't happening at these private schools or state schools for that matter.  And so I was actually a banner girl for the Morehouse Marching Band at the time.  So I'm sitting there, there's a picture of me looking at Bill Cosby while he's making this announcement while I'm supposed to be out there dancing.  But anyway yes, so the Cosbys giving the money was a big deal.  Another thing was kind of funny.  I was graduating.  I'm handing in my application to the Packard Scholars Program which help support me in graduate school.  At the same time the riots were making their way, the assembly, the peace movement at the time I joined it.  So there was a march for Rodney King protesting the verdict in the Rodney King trial [1991].  And so I handed in my application and then I quickly went over and joined the march which then turned into a riot and then I had to safely find myself back to campus.  So this all happened while I was in college which was a big deal.  Nelson Mandela [anti-apartheid activist in South Africa, served as president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999] was released from prison when I was in college [1990].
Speaker 1: Did he visit Spelman?
Speaker 2: He didn't visit Spelman.  I saw him in Los Angeles [California] actually during my college years [1988-1992].
Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to pause here again.
Story_ID: 31019
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is there anything else about Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] before we graduate you?
Speaker 2: Oh I just can't leave Spelman without mentioning Etta Falconer was my advisor.  And she is a--she was a professor of mathematics at Spellman College and also the advisor for the Women in Science and Engineering Program which was sponsored by NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].  She directed that program while I was in it.  She is a phenomenal woman, a southern belle, soft spoken, very gentle but very strong at the same time.  And she had my file.  She read my portfolio.  She knew my tendencies before she met me.  When she sent me down--sat me down for freshman advising, she said, "Honey, I need you to work hard and play hard."  I was like, "Okay.  What kind of advisor tells you to play hard?"  But she was concerned about my balance, right, which is a continuous struggle.  And I think I have it in a, it's in a decent shape, my work life balance you know started with that phrase, work hard and play hard.  And I think I'm capable of more than just being a professional, being content, living a good life because of those words she gave to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's valuable.
Story_ID: 31020
Speaker 1: So now you're a Packard Scholar, graduate school and you go to University of Colorado at Boulder [Boulder, Colorado], which is a beautiful place.  I've been there.  Just describe the--well how did you end up choosing that school?
Speaker 2: Well Boulder is beautiful.  It's nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and, I was very concerned about the cold.  It's my first time living in somewhere with snow.  I had visited the snow and--with my parents' families but I've never lived in snow and so I was very concerned.  And what they don't have is cloudy days.  It will snow real hard and then it stops and the sun comes right back out.  So more than three hundred days a year it's sunny.  And so I said okay, well I got beach sun, you know, I can deal with sun.  I can take a little snow.  I can do this.  So I was concerned about Boulder for those reasons.  But when I committed to graduate school I decided that, you know, I'm multi-dimensional.  I didn't want to do science that was just stuck in a laboratory.  I didn't want to do science just for science sake.  I was very--I'm an activist in some way with the--with my activities in Ossett [an African American interest group at Spelman College].  You know I was very active in social issues.  And so to tether myself to a lab bench without being able to make an impact to society is something I didn't want any part of, so I chose atmospheric science for that reason.  The ozone hole was at its peak when I was getting ready to pick a school in '92 [1992], right?  The science really started in '88 [1988], it takes anything a few years to really warm up.  And everyone was hot and bothered about the ozone hole and so I wanted to be part of that science.  So that restricted my campuses and I was so committed to that course of study that I didn't care where it was.  Boulder is beautiful but, you know, my boyfriend wasn't living there, my family doesn't live there.  It's like why am I going to go to Boulder.  But it was either there or University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].  Irvine [University of California, Irvine] hadn't really come up in the ranks at that time.  I could have gone--there was some work at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  So there was a few campuses where I knew I could really do it and do it right.  And Boulder was unique in that I did a high school--a college senior project.  I did an oral presentation on a work by the woman who ended up being my advisor, [Margaret] "Maggie" Tolbert.  So I was, I had that familiarity with a person at Boulder through studying her work.  They--it's not just a single campus but I opened up the brochure for that campus and I was sensitive to gender and race issues at that time.  And I saw so many women I said, this has to be okay.  If they can hire and retain this many women faculty, then they have some degree of inclusion there where this might be an environment where I could thrive.  And so those are two factors.  The type of science absolutely restricted my choices a lot and then in addition to that, the diversity of the faculty attracted me to that campus.
Story_ID: 31021
Speaker 1: Okay.  So from what I see here, [Margaret] "Maggie" Tolbert and Professor Steven M. George were your advisors?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So here's someone who you cited in high school and they're your advisor in college now.
Speaker 2: Well I misspoke, it was my college.  So it's a project I did in college.
Speaker 1: College, okay.
Speaker 2: Which I'm first introduced to Maggie, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So, well what was she like to work with?
Speaker 2: She was bright, fast--I've never seen somebody, someone talk so quickly in my life.  I think I talk faster.  I was coming from the South, right to her lab, so I was talking a lot slower.  But then I go right into the Tolbert Lab and I talk faster because of her.  But she was so smart, the way she organized ideas and just saw every little imperfection in anything you were trying to present was amazing.  I loved watching her work.  She was hands off when it came to management.  The project I was doing was actually in the George Lab so I spent more of my day-to-day, the data acquisition was with George.  But when it came time to do what we do is analyze the data, discuss the data, it was always a pleasure working with her, very driven.  I thought that, I still wonder if--I'm not caffeinated now.  At one point I thought every woman faculty had to be totally caffeinated in order to do their job 'cause she usually was.  And everyone else I knew was and they were just like, just motorin'.  So--
Speaker 1: So did they drink a lot of coffee or what?  What was--?
Speaker 2: Well I don't know what her caffeine of choice was but I never totally got into it.  I'm just noticing the fact that I have none right now.  But yeah, she was high energy and bright and a pleasure to work with.
Story_ID: 31022
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what--now you arrived [at University of Colorado at Boulder] in 1992.  So what did you begin to work on in terms--or you know as a thesis?
Speaker 2: My thesis for my dissertation work was on the same problem I had gone there to study, which is stratospheric ozone depletion.  But I did it from a surface scientist perspective.  So what was happening in the field at the time is that they were understanding that reactions on clouds, which don't happen often or frequently in the stratosphere but when they did happen, reactions on these clouds was completely changing the rates and the types of chemicals that were happening.  The chemistry was impacted by these clouds.  And so my work fell into that area.  If this is an interaction with interfaces, then why don't we use tools from the semiconductor industry to explore what's happening on a molecular level?  So that's what I did.  I was doing surface science which is huge in semiconductor.  I think after this project my [graduate advisor]--Steve George actually went back to that type of surface science in his research, but we were able to see, use things like laser induced thermo desorption and high vacuum technology to slow down reactions and get an indicator about the changes on a molecular level.  Rather than just looking at the reactants and the products, we're able to understand the mechanisms, what kind of intermediates were happening.  What happened in between your starting material and your finishing material?  How did it happen?  So of course this is appealing for me.  I'm always looking for why things happen.  And so that is the same type of science I do 'til this day, but I started it in my dissertation work where the problem our--what we were doing is looking at the uptake of hydrogen halides on ice films.  And this system is representative of the chemistry associated with taking chlorine from a passive form into an active form.  Once it's active it can destroy ozone.  So we're looking at how you know this hydrogen halides react on the surfaces.  What kind of changes happen there?  How deep do they go into a film of ice and recording those changes is what I did for my dissertation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now is there a layman's explanation for this?
Speaker 2: Oh I thought that was the layman's explanation.  Yikes!  Yikes!  Okay, what can I do?  What can I do?  Let me just start over and try again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you have a chlorine--you have a chemical that is very aggressive at destroying other chemicals.  These chemicals, the classic chemicals are called free radicals so these are like the Pac-Men, right?  Anything in its way is going to be eaten up by this Pac-Man.  So the radical chemistry is very intense and you want to find everything that supports the formation of these Pac-Men, the radicals.  So there are several steps in order to find exactly how the Pac-Men are formed and so my work was associated with one of those steps.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now your work took you to the Arctic I believe, right?
Speaker 2: My post-doctor years.
Speaker 1: Post-doctorate okay but not before?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Now there's a--and that was--well maybe I'm getting ahead.  I'll just wait 'til we get there.  But alright, so, this is--so this is what you worked on and this was the theme, this formed the theme of your dissertation?
Speaker 2: So the dissertation work I did was, it's very straightforward when you look back at it.  But when you have a surface you have a gas.  The gas goes onto the surface and you can write a whole dissertation on that.  So understanding at a molecular level the changes that occurred when the gas goes onto the surface, that's all I did.  I designed new apparatus in order to do this, in order to get the pressure and temperature conditions just right so we could study it under these conditions, under stratospheric conditions.  I switched gases.  I said okay if it works this way for gas number one, does it work the same way or differently for gas number two?  They're similar but they are different so can we do a comparison between hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide?  So my dissertation work was foundational in getting me started in learning how to think through problems, helped me decide what types of problems to select, which is critical the way science is changing.  Taxpayers are very sensitive as to where their money goes and they want to know what it's for.  So that initial decision going into chemistry and then atmospheric chemistry was good for me in that all along I've been sensitive as to what is science for.  So I can help select the right types of research questions that are not only personally interesting but interesting to a larger audience as well.
Story_ID: 31023
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the apparatus you developed, was it some sort of spectrometer, in that correct?
Speaker 2: In my professional life here at Cal State LA [California State University, Los Angeles] and in my post-doc, I started doing development of that type of instrumentation.  What I developed first in graduate school is dealing with this reality, we have--we're working with techniques that are best applied to low vacuum conditions.  So we're sitting here at one atmosphere and I'm dealing with an atmosphere that's a billion times less than that.  So this is a vacuum.  This is a serious vacuum.  So I want to go up a million times less and that's a big deal.  If everything is built to be a billion times less you have to develop special devices so that your sample can be a thousand times higher in pressure than your analytical techniques.  So I had casings.  I had copper tubing that I would cool down and I'd have to play around with, well how do I stop the water from condensing on it?  We'll flow some air past it.  And so it took me a while to develop this apparatus but that's a start.  That's one of the first things I designed you know which is some paper and some "How To" books and my imagination.  And then I continued to design.  I continue till this day to make contributions to analytical chemistry, which is the art of measuring.  How do we measure things that are difficult to measure?  I'm a physical chemist but any good physical chemist can't not dabble in analytical because it's required for our primary work.
Story_ID: 31024
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So now are we ready for post-doctorate studies?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, so well tell us how you wound up going to the arctic?
Speaker 2: Well every time--well it started, I want to take a--I'm going to take the liberty to go a few steps back.  Somewhere in the middle of graduate school [at University of Colorado at Boulder] I decided that, I had to decide whether to go on.  Can I speak for a minute on other things that happened in grad school?  When I started grad school I wasn't excellent from the beginning.  My first semester I ended up on probation.  I think that's in part because I just had come from a community where I was completely immersed and had a strong sense of belonging to all of a sudden being a chocolate chip and wondering what I was doing there, right?  So even though I grew up in an integrated environment, I was a little disoriented getting back into the graduate school and back into mainstream society.  So, you know, I ended up finding, looking for ways to ground myself and I ended up auditioning and joining an African dance group.  So I danced my way through grad school, where I danced and performed West African dance primarily.  We dabbled in South African, did a little North, but this was just a menagerie of just random people who had some affiliation with University Colorado.  This included secretaries, alumni, graduate students, undergraduates, hard core dance majors.  We just all got together and we all had, you know, baseline capabilities and a love for performing and that's how I made it through grad school is I found a way to ground myself.
Speaker 1: So right there in Boulder, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  And so graduate school is meant to be a tugging kind of experience.  It's meant to transform you into a independent investigator.  So at another point of intensity after passing my comprehensive exams, this is a place where many people bow out of graduate school.  And I had second thoughts.  I think it's because up to the comprehensive exams, up to advancement and candidacy, you're doing what you used to do.  You're learning what the professor wants and you're responding to that.  After that, you're apprenticed to be your own independent principal investigator.  No one's telling you what to do, you just have to write a dissertation, research and write.  And this is no man's land.  And so like so many students, you know, I had to figure out what I wanted to do with this degree.  If I was going to finish it in the first place and then what was I going to do with it.  So at that moment I decided that I wanted to promote inclusion in chemistry, that this was worth it.  I didn't know exactly what I would end up doing but promoting inclusion of all peoples in the chemical sciences is something that this license would allow me to do.  If I earned a Ph.D., I would be allowed to contribute to that.  I didn't know how, but that's what made me finish the program.  And then I also said, well, I want to work with people who are developmental.  I want to work with people who are new at the sciences and not necessarily where the ball is already rolling.  And so with that realization it helped me select my post-doc where I was able to select a science where the techniques I was using were high-maintenance, very high-maintenance, requiring two, three full-time trained people to keep up a high vacuum system and make it work efficiently, fixing laser power sources.  You can't take an eighteen year old and tell them to do that, right?  You need some training first.
Story_ID: 31025
Speaker 1: And so when I decided I wanted to work with people at the beginning of their careers [for postdoctoral mentors], I found Barbara [J.] Finlayson-Pitts.  She saw my poster presentation on one of her trips to Colorado [University of Colorado at Boulder] and I don't know if she took an interest in me or--but I made it clear to my advisor that I had an interest in her because she was new to the University of California system.  She had spent I think twenty years in the California State system which has the highest degree as masters.  So the system I teach in, the system she trained in, had the highest degree at master's which meant you're working with the new ones, right?  And so in order to make that transition, I would have to learn how to deal with meaningful problems with less technology.  And it was only eighteen intense months and part of that I was away at the arctic, but I learned what I needed to do in order to do this job.  And when I selected the post-doc, that's what I was looking for.  So I got out of it what I selected it for.  And also still, I think you're always trying to figure out where do I fit in this world if you're doing something that's different than the masses.  Every now and then you say, where do I fit?  And so I enjoyed just how feminine Barbara was.  You know you never saw her at a conference without skirt and heels, never.  And this is not normal for women scientists.  This is not--this is--and so I was attracted to her feminine nature and I was attracted to her experience.  And she was another high-energy supportive type person and so that was an amazing eighteen months working in her laboratory.
Story_ID: 31026
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Arctic I guess, we have to say something about that.
Speaker 2: Well again this is one of the things I had no intentions of doing.  I didn't even want to go to Boulder [University of Colorado at Boulder] because it's cold, right?  I am paranoid about the cold.  So how do I end up in the Arctic?  She sat me down one day in her office.  It was towards the end of the day.  I think she probably knew earlier but she waited to the end of the day to say have a seat.  I have a post-doc with field training and arctic experience who just turned down my position.  I have a project.  I need somebody right now to do this project.  You're trained on the instrumentation but you have no field experience.  But you have the characteristics that would make you successful in this working environment.  Would you be willing to change your project and go to the Arctic?  "See you tomorrow.  Let me think about this."  I ran home.  I talked to my husband [Kwasi Connor].  I told him about my opportunities.  I thought about it and then I decided absolutely that this is something I want to do.  I have a few months to figure out how to deal with the cold, but I want this new experience.  I'm attracted to new things.  So I wanted this experience and I'm so glad I said yes because the working environment is very different than the standard laboratory.  Your laboratory is absolutely in the middle of nowhere.  And to plan an experiment we just are completing a move and the movers even--I was frustrated by the amount of chaos in the moving situation.  But the movers was like, this is the most organized packing I've seen so far.  Because of my work in the arctic, you have to plan exactly what you're going to do for the next seven, eight weeks before you get there and have all the materials, all the supplies.  In case of emergency, an airplane comes in once a week to deliver food and transport people, but that's it.  Once a week, so you'd better not make a mistake.  And the experiment was on an instrument that was from industry, it was from Battelle[Memorial Institute, science and engineering technology developers, Columbus, Ohio].  And that instrument time is much more expensive than a standard academic instrument.  And so it's a very expensive experiment.  So again you don't want to screw up.  So the intensity of it made me really refine some of the ways that I do things.  Some of the way that I--I was more casual about just accepting data and seeing where it comes, where it falls eventually.  Now I'm very much into looking and thinking, looking and thinking like simultaneously.  In the middle of an experiment I will change course because I see something.  I see another question that needs to be answered and I learned that through my experience in the Arctic.  In fact there's one experiment that was very meaningful that made it into my second science magazine article which was from work on the arctic.  I'll tell you the back story for that one.  It was not planned.  You know you sit here, carefully plan down south, everything is down south of Alert, Canada [the northernmost permanently inhabited location in the world].  So down south you plan what you're going to do.  You do exactly what you planned to do, right?  If you're a technician, but not if you're a scientist, if you're a scientist, you're trying to answer some questions.  So we had the opportunity, a group of--there were scientists and technicians.  A cluster of scientists got together and decided, we got to answer this question and this is how we're going to do it, which was a diversion from the main project.  It's a harsh working environment.  We started with no sunlight.  It plays tricks with your head.  You could see from the culture where we had a combination of military and scientists, only seventy-five people total living up there at any given time.  But of the seventy-five, most everyone was in the bar when--before the sun came out.  Afterwards people would go wherever they wanted in the evening.  But the concentration in the bar, the amount of drinking in the bar was intense towards the end of that long, dark winter.  So people are not quite right, right?  So you feel very strongly, you get very emotional in situations like this.  So the technician was very emotional about his need to do exactly what he was told to do.  "No, I have this high stakes experiment and I don't want any diversions.  I don't care about what if.  I don't care about your imagination.  I don't care about your academic goals.  I was told to do this job and you're not going to do--you're not going to stop me from doing that, you know."  And I'm sitting here 5 foot two [5'2"].  This is a big man too I'm working with.  I'm sitting here with my little body saying, "Got to do it. You got to do it."  You know just talking and figure it out.  Okay, you have four hours to do this experiment.  So four hours I was out there working and working and working and it was one of those most beautiful datasets we put together from the whole campaign.  But I had to fight to make that happen.  It's not that he was wrong.  It's not that I was right.  It's just we had a real conflict and had to find some way to resolve it, so I'm glad I fought that battle.
Story_ID: 31027
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was it dark the entire time you were there?
Speaker 2: No.  Our experiment was designed to see what's the impact of sunlight and so we needed to study the background but the actual chemistry we were interested in observing did not happen until sunlight.  So we were interested to see again why things happen.  Everyone knows what happens when the sun comes up, but how did the precursor for the Pac-Man get there?  How did it get there?  And so that's what we're studying in the dark is looking for the fluctuations of these gases in the dark in order to see, well, now we know why ozone is depleted at surface level at sunrise.
Speaker 1: So these are gases that are manufactured by human beings?
Speaker 2: Actually that's the interesting thing about this problem is no.  These are naturally occurring gases.  So one of the things any southern California person [Foster is from Southern California] is sensitive to is air pollution.  And one of the reasons we have such bad air pollution is because we're addicted to cars, but that's not it.  It's our geography and there are some natural things, natural physical barriers.  And now as we learned in this project just living next to the ocean causes things to happen in the atmosphere that don't happen in other places.  So the chemistry there is actually naturally occurring.  Naturally if you just have sea salt whether that's in snow or in particles suspended in air or on the frozen water itself, all this has the ability to form the precursors for the radicals, what I'm calling the Pac-man.  Just because you have salt water, this can happen.  So no, it's naturally occurring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're going to pause here, do a chapter mark again.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 31028
Speaker 1: Let's go back and maybe recap in a more technical way what you were doing [in the Arctic during Foster's postdoctoral studies].
Speaker 2: Sure.  So there's been a long term observation or this research happened in the--in 2000 it was published.  But since the--the type of chemistry we had that involved halogens, depleting ozone in the stratosphere, there's nothing about the way that that was happening that prevented it happening at lower altitudes.  So here at surface level you have plenty of ozone.  We have a background concentration of ozone of forty parts per billion [40 ppb] and it's very important for controlling the oxidizing behavior of our atmosphere.  So the fate of chemicals is controlled by oxidants.  And ozone is depleted just like it was in the stratosphere.  It's depleted by halogens in the polar spring.  And so the halogens of interest are different hydrogen or halogen [correct, halogen] containing molecules so molecular chlorine, molecular bromine, bromochloride are all precursors for free radicals that go on to form ozone destruction.  The free radicals are trapped in the halogen compounds until the sun comes up.  So we want to understand what's happening in the polar dark to see the development of these precursors.  What about that environment is causing the precursors for radical formation to form?  So we went up in the polar--this was called Alert 2000 which is a photochemistry and kinetics study.  We wanted to understand the photochemistry on ice and snow.  It was a campaign with investigators from all over the world and about thirty of us, I think, brought together and committed our--to go in the dead of night you know absolute darkness to the Arctic so that we could see the impact of sunlight.  If you don't have something, that's how you see the impact of it.  So we're studying what's happening in the polar dark and then we can look at changes in sunrise and have a before and after picture which helps us better understand ozone depletion at surface level.  Now even though this chemistry was studied in the arctic because it's a great place to do it, the Sun does it for you.  If it's--the sunlight is a reactant.  If there's no sunlight then you can do your chemistry in a natural environment.  This same chemistry though is transferrable to lower altitudes or lower latitudes.  So any marine environment then can have the formation of bromine, molecular bromine [Br2], molecular chlorine [Cl2], bromochloride [BrCl].  All of these can form anywhere in the world but we had to go to the top of the world in order to study it.  And our technique was developmentally--you asked me earlier about developing techniques in graduate school.  Well I didn't develop this one but for a few years before this project happened [Chester] "Chet" Spicer [Battelle Memorial Institute] and Barbara Finlayson-Pitts [Foster's postdoctoral advisor at University of California, Irvine] were playing with taking a commercial instrument which is designed for a different industry, pharmaceuticals, in fact, apply it to atmospheric chemistry, cutting off the front end, just lopping it off and looking at mixtures of gases rather than affluent from a high performance liquid chromatography.  LC [Liquid Chromotaography] mass spec is the technique that they modified to look for changes in the atmosphere.  So with this technique we're able to see one particle in a trillion particles.  That's a thousand billions, right?  So we're able to get that kind of sensitivity.  Sensitivity is good, but do you know what you're looking at?  So the same experiment we were doing had four distinct measures of a given compound.  So we were using isotopes.  So bromine for example comes in two flavors.  Seventy nine is its atomic mass or eighty-one.  And to make Br2 [molecular bromine] you can have seventy nine-seventy nine [79/79] or seventy nine-eighty one [79/81] or eighty one-eighty one [81/81] [Foster is referring to the combination of atomic mass for each of the two bromine atoms].  Any combination will do.  But that then gives you three different signatures if you're able to measure, okay I have bromine and I'm going to look at this fragment.  So using MS2 technology [in mass spectrometry, a halogen atom such as bromine or chlorine forms multiple "peaks" in the reading], we're able to get along with our sensitivity the selectivity to tell you, I know what I'm talking about.  So that's what we did for our science and it was a big deal.  There had been a lot of speculating on the ability to--on why this was happening, where the precursors for the free radicals were coming.  There was a lot of speculation, a lot of good science, but no one actually sat there and measured it.  So we did that for the first time and it was a great impact on the scientific community to be able to have that science completed.
Story_ID: 31029
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're up there for a total of how long?
Speaker 2: I stayed for seven weeks.  I stayed for seven--I think originally it was six and then we decided to extend it.  So I committed to six and they kept me for seven.  I would have stayed for twelve, fourteen because I was just into it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your early dread of going was kind of overcome by the excitement of what you were doing?
Speaker 2: It was overcome by talking to Susan Solomon who actually proposed the mechanism for polar stratospheric ozone completion [winner of the 1999 National Medal of Science].  I had ran into her during my Boulder days.  She actually critiqued my first poster.  I ran into her at a conference.  I said Susan, what have I done?  How am I going to stay alive?, cause she's petite also.  And so she's like, here's what you do.  She wrote down some names about where to get the right boots, told me about the right parka, the right gloves and I was set.  So I was comforted about the snow by talking to somebody who lived in more extreme conditions time and time again.  She did this several times going to the Antarctic where I was only trying to go to the arctic.  So to talk to a survivor made me feel better about going up there and I was more than prepared as far as clothing.
Speaker 1: Was there ever a time you were actually--had a little trepidation while you were there about--?
Speaker 2: I am fearless in a way and I'm cautious, I plan.  But in other ways I'm absolutely fearless.  And so there were very dangerous situations where--what were we doing?  When we first landed there was a storm that came in.  There was a storm so bad that they said if you go outside you will have permanent frostbite forever.  You know this is it.  If you have your skin exposed this could happen to you.  So on that day you know I covered up real good and I walked to the gym.  I left--I went outside.  I mean I don't know.  I don't know why I do what I do.  Brilliantly stupid, I don't know.  But then another day we were running an experiment and you have to make a decision every evening, are you going to stay in the lab or are you going to go back to base?  We have better facilities, back up generators, all of this.  We were running an experiment and we didn't want to leave so we decided to camp out at the base.  A storm came in.  I mean I have photographs of the weather just changing within twenty minutes from perfectly sunny to a vicious storm.  And we're sitting there.  No one could get us.  I mean we couldn't get back to the base ourselves.  If the power went out we would have been in a bad way.  A couple of hours without power and you're just dead, you know.  But we stayed up there and did the experiment and I didn't even think twice about it.
Story_ID: 31030
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a--now what is the practical application of your study?  I mean if that's a, you know--people ask that.  That's even one of the questions--
Speaker 2: The practical application of my physical chemistry--I do some other things that are really not practical they're just a lot of fun.  But my physical chemistry is practical in that it helps us understand the quality of the air we breathe and on different levels.  You have both short term inconveniences like photochemical smog and this creates ozone which irritates the respiratory system, okay.  So we want to understand all things that can contribute to ozone formation and the work I did in the Arctic was part of that question is very practical.  And then also now I'm interested in more long term effects.  So air pollution that is responsible for facilitating carcinogenic and mutanogenic activity.  So, I don't know, you talk to college students, I want to fight cancer.  I'm fighting cancer too but as a physical chemist, right, 'cause I'm helping to understand the changes in carcinogenic and mutanogenic species when they are--as particles age they adhere to particles suspended in air.  They don't have to stay in air.  If they're the right size they can get into our bodies.  And so I study the, I study particle aging.
Story_ID: 31031
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how long was it after you came back that you took the job here at California State University [Los Angeles]?
Speaker 2: The chair at the time laughs because he said this is the most difficult contract negotiations they had.  I was making contract negotiations while I was in the Arctic.  So it was a lot of fun because I'd get a memo right, and then everyone has one email access.  There's one place where you can check your email.  You have to wait in line.  So maybe every two to three days you can get access to the outside world.  Phone time is restricted.  I forget our allowance but it was minimal.  I didn't want to call work besides the hours weren't right.  I'd call home during my phone allowance.  So there's no communications, minimal communications.  So I would have to make a decision and I would just sit on it.  I would have to--I'd have time to think and talk.  Another thing about the type of work we were doing was in order to accommodate everyone's schedule, we had to stop at 4:30 [p.m.] in the afternoon.  So you don't stop working, you can do things outside of the laboratory such as analyze data, plan new experiments.  So we would work into the night when it was necessary but we would leave the physical lab at 4:30 [p.m.] in the afternoon which gives you what, a very extended dinner time.  So we had these long conversations.  You know some nights we'd study, some nights we'd just sit there and talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.  So during these conversations I got to imagine what my perfect job would look like and with the contract discussion topic, how important is this to me?  What do I need in this start up package, my initial salary?  What do I need in this contract to make me successful in the long run?  And so I had a lot of time to think about it and including geez, well do I want to go down this path anyway?  Because I was in a position where I could have worked at a Ph.D.-granting institution.  And if you look at--if you want to--if your idea of success is just defined by someone else's, by the professionals, then that's certainly the way to go.  Why would you work at a master's-granting when you could have done Ph.D.?  But I told you personally I wanted to go that route long time ago but I had to step off that cliff.  I had to say there's no turning back.  It happens my own mother [Frances Smith Foster] made the switch from masters-granting to Ph.D., but it's rare.  It's rare and especially rare in science is to turn that ship around and go back.  And so I had to think clearly and I was able to because I was doing contract negotiations whether I was going to take a job at a non-Ph.D.-granting institution.  So it was good.  When it was time to take the job I was confident that this is my job.
Story_ID: 31032
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well what attracted you to California State University, Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: That one's easy.  I sat down with my post-doc advisor [at University of California, Irvine, Barbara Finlayson-Pitts] and I gave her this impossible list of requirements for my job.  I was actually--this is public record so I won't say where.  But I was in contract negotiations with another institute, a Ph.D. granting institution and I was seriously thinking about taking that job.  But it wasn't quite the right fit.  So I sat down.  My post-doc advisor Barbara, was getting ready to go to a Department of Energy meeting so she was busy that day.  But I guess the desperation of my voice, she's like, okay let's go get a cup of tea or whatever.  So we sat down and I told her about this impossible dilemma, whether or not to take this other job and what I really wanted from a job.  I said I really like southern California.  I'd really like to come back and work in southern California because I was married at the time.  I am still married but my husband [Kwasi Connor] at the time was interested in the music industry.  And his father was working here as a professional in the music industry.  So for family reasons it was difficult to think about leaving southern California cause that was just starting up.  He was just able to build that relationship, start that career path when we moved to Irvine [where Foster was a postdoctoral fellow at University of California, Irvine].  And then I said I want to work in  a place where--cause I had all types of experiences where my gender and ethnicity were an issue and not an issue and I wanted to be at a place where that was an asset.  Where I could walk into a room and I could be as confident as I feel and not feel like I'm always fighting just to be who I am.  I can be myself.  I can do my job and I don't have to defend my differences.  So I was looking for an environment where that was possible.  I had already decided years ago that I wanted to work with students who were at the early stages of their development so undergraduates had to be part of my life.  And so with these three requirements--oh, there was a fourth.  I also said I teach better when students are there to learn.  When they're not there to ask for your stamp of approval, but when they're really fighting to learn something, when they want something out of it.  I don't want their lives all planned out for them.  You know I don't want silver spoon kids, I want fighters.  And so she [Barbara Finlayson-Pitts] said well you're going to have to get a job at Cal State LA [California State University, Los Angeles], maybe Fullerton [California State University, Fullerton] in order to sustain your research.  Because coming off that experience in the arctic, I couldn't give up my research either.  So I had--it was impossible.  It was impossible and improbable right, that I would get this job but it happened.  It happened and I'm glad it did.  And I think most people around me are glad that it did.  But she basically narrowed my job search to two campuses.  And so I didn't have much choice.
Story_ID: 31033
Speaker 1: Now Cal State Los Angeles [California State University Los Angeles] is a research, public research institution I've read.  That means what as a--opposed to another kind of school?
Speaker 2: Well it is--let me talk about the CSU [California State University] system is a comprehensive institution.  I don't know about the--I don't know where the research side--I can tell you what research at Cal State means to me and how that it could be institutionalized in some advertisement of the campus.  But it's a comprehensive university that's designed to educate the masses.  The entry-level four-year degree for all peoples of California is in the master plan what the system is designed to do.  Let's leave the real science, let's leave the fancy stuff, the refining for the UC, University of California.  California State University is four-year degrees for the people and so there--in this department, the department of chemistry and biochemistry, Lloyd Ferguson [interviewed by The HistoryMakers archive, 2011], [Anthony] "Tony" Andreoli, there are a couple of heavy hitters, twenty, thirty years ago, who decided in order to serve my students for the purpose of education, we must have active research on this campus.  We must involve students in research because it's that project-based education that is so formative.  There's nothing you can do in a general chem [chemistry] classroom that is going to make someone commit 100 percent to science.  I had my first research experience early on.  And anyone who's really concerned about education understands that there's a lot of just ugly stuff you have to go through as far as learning the fundamentals, developing yourself to get the tools to do chemistry.  The sooner you can actually do chemistry which takes some time, the more likely you are to be a chemical professional.  And so they established a culture of undergraduate research.  They had early funding from the National Science Foundation [NSF], the National Institutes of Health [NIH] for student development.  The most successful and sustainable program has been programs funded by the national institute of health for the minority opportunities in research.  There's a variety of programs, but this created a culture where we are a research institution in this department and the Department of Biology and in some labs in psychology.  There's a strong history of research and not just kiddy research, this is the real thing.  You know, we publish articles all the time.  We got one accepted yesterday.  Not as fast as people that have a staff that's more experienced and more trained, but still we take our time and we put out good stuff.  And so the campus culture at Cal State LA, and Cal State Fullerton really has been pushed by the MBRS [Minority Biomedical Research Support] program is the biggest of the minority opportunity to research suite of programs.  But the whole--it fits.  It fits with me.  You know it fits with what I want to do and it's possible here and not everywhere because it really takes an institution to support research and to make it accessible for undergrad populations.
Story_ID: 31034
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you got here [California State University, Los Angeles, CSULA], Dr. [Lloyd Noel] Ferguson [African American chemist] had retired right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Think he retired in '86 [1986], you came in 2000.  Was Dr. Brown here, Dr. Costello Brown [professor of chemistry]?
Speaker 2: Dr. Costello Brown was here, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: All right. And did you get a chance to work with him before he retired?
Speaker 2: He had the office down the hall and one thing I guess it's my Daddy's [Warren Reed Foster] side again going back to you know trying to figure out how to make things work.  How do we get through this?  What do we do?  You know when you come to this job you have three of them.  You have, of course, the classroom you're instructing.  You're also trying to start up a laboratory, probably for the very first time and that involves working with people who have their own lives to deal with and you're trying to train them in research.  And then finally there's the service aspect or institutional building, all the committee work.  And so you have three jobs, it's a handful.  And so knowing how to get by, knowing how to do things efficiently, I aligned myself with different mentors and Costello Brown was one of those people where I would refer to him about personnel issues and about, you know, how do I--how should I behave in the RTP [retention, tenure, promotion] process?  For example, retention, tenure, promotion.  How do I make choices that are going to make me secure my tenure in this position?  I would talk to Costello a lot about those, but Carlos Gutierrez [professor of chemistry at CSULA] is my mentor, continues to be my mentor for student development.  He is known nationally for his contributions to training, research training and creating opportunities in research for students, particularly students of color.  So I go to him when it comes to all things about running the laboratory.  Such and such has happened to so and so.  How do I deal with it?  Here's what you do, dah, dah-dah, dah-dah.  And then as far as education in the classroom, most of us were taught with one traditional form of chock talk lectures, right?  But there's different ways to skin a cat.  There's different ways to share information.  If you're really interested in making sure that people from different learning styles, different backgrounds are learning, you have to try.  I mean we're experimentalists in the laboratory.  How are you not going to experiment in the classroom?  So in order to find different ways to be an effective communicator/educator, I would refer to [Donald] "Don" Paulson [professor emeritus of chemistry].  All of us are on the same floor, you know different offices, different mentors and from all of these people I have learned and continue to learn on how to conduct myself as a faculty member.
Story_ID: 31035
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now what are some of the, I guess the highlights of--you've been here now eleven years I guess?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Well what have been some of the highlights of your tenure here on campus?
Speaker 2: So many.  I would say one of the biggest highlights was my first publication with student co-authors.  That was a big highlight.  It was kind of serendipity.  I am not the fastest publisher in the world.  You can ask anybody, including my students.  I'll sit on data for a long time before it goes anywhere.
Speaker 1: Now is this the one in 2004?
Speaker 2: This is 2004.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is McDowell is the first author, Monica McDowell and this is to a--"Journal on Chromatography."  I forget if they were doing an A and a B at that point, but it's "Journal of Chromatography."
Speaker 1: And what's the publication about ["Detection of hypophosphite, phosphite, and orthophosphate in natural geothermal water by ion chromatography," other authors include Michelle Ivey, Mary Lee, Verena Firpo, Tina Salmassi and Crist Khachikian]?
Speaker 2: The publication is about--it was funny cause it was never my intent.  The publication is about methods for looking for reduced phosphorus oxyanions in aqueous solutions and these aqueous solutions can be managed in a way so they can look like geothermal waters is the one we were trying to mimic.  So these are all synthesized solutions where I have to tell you about the background of this--let me tell you about the science first.  This technique [ion chromatography] can be applied to look for reduced phosphorous oxyanions including phosphyte and phosphate is a fully oxidized form, hypophosphite.  These are potential explanations.  Each of these compounds can help us understand how life started.  So we know that phosphorus is used in every cell in our body.  It's used for releasing energy [such as in ATP].  The ATP [adenosine tri-phosphate] process utilizes phosphorus in its oxidized form.  That's how we do it, but there are microorganisms that utilized reduced phosphorus for that same purpose.  And you say well why would an organism have a capability for metabolizing something that doesn't exist?   So that was the impetus for this question.  You say well maybe it does exist.  Maybe it does exist.  Let's go looking for it.  Let's look for it here because this is where we found reduced forms of a similar compound, arsenic.  So we were up at Mammoth Lakes [California] and this was happening in the background.  At the time of my first publication we were just saying, can we do it?  There are basic questions when we entered this project like, can you even get the standards?  Can you even get something that you can control to do something that could be measured or quantitative?  Are they even available?  And so we looked in the catalog and we saw yes, these salts are available.  And so we were able to do our experiment.  And then we're just trying to make the experiment work.  And again like so many things in my life, we didn't try to do that particular experiment.  My friend walked into the lab, just a colleague at the time.  I didn't know her at the time.  And she said, "I hear you studied the redox cycle of nitrogen."  And I was like, "Oh really?"  I guess if you want to look at it that way, you can.  I was still looking for oxidants in the condensed space like I did in my post-doc years so I was still doing that.  And one interpretation could be redox chemistry of nitrates. So I said okay, "Yeah, yeah I do, yeah, sure."  And she said, "Well I just did a post-doc studying the redox cycle of arsenic."  And I'm a not chemist.  She's a microbiologist.  She says, "But the periodic table tells me that phosphorus should have similar behavior.  Do you know anything about that?"  I said, "No."  And so that's how we got involved with the study.  I was busy doing something else, something I was familiar with and she came up with this very innovative idea and I said I'll play along.  And so the first publication was not intended to be studied--to be published.  It was intended to help with my RTP [retention, tenure, promotion] process and get me presenting at professional meetings.  Here I had the opportunity to present at a meeting in San Diego.  You know I had and continue to have young children and so it's difficult to get physically to professional meetings.  So I said San Diego [California], I can do that one.  What am I going to present?  Oh I'll present this.  And it turns out that my oral presentation was then written up as a proceedings.  Oops, the proceedings is peer-reviewed.  So that was my first publication.  I got sucked into it.  I did not intend to go down this route.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We'll pause here a second.  Wow.
Story_ID: 31036
Speaker 1: Okay.  We were saying off camera that a lot of people don't foresee where their career is going to go and you were saying something about flexibility.
Speaker 2: I was saying that the same people who are fluctuating as far as maybe I'll do this, maybe I'll do that, that can take you nowhere or it can take you to success in science as a possible outcome of that characteristic in that you need to be flexible.  If you're doing real science, it's a very creative process.  You're testing hypotheses but you don't know the outcome and you have to follow your nose.  So you have to be a flexible person to be a successful scientist.  And so I think that's maybe as you record biographies, why you're finding oh yeah I stumbled into science.  I stumbled into this publication.
Speaker 1: Or flowed into it.  But they were prepared though.  They all sort of prepared for the next (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh always prepared, always prepared, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So now did this publication [2004, "Detection of hypophosphite, phosphite, and orthophosphate in natural geothermal water by ion chromatography,"] lead to more of the same area or did you stay in this area for a long time?
Speaker 2: We're still going.  Where are we, 2011?  So we're seven years into it.  We had the big one ["Detection of Geothermal Phosphite Using High Performance Liquid Chromatography," Environmental Science Technology].  Our first author was Herbie Pech where we did--we found it right, so in 2004 we had the methods but it wasn't until 2009, 2010, '10 [2010]?
Speaker 1: It was '09 [2009].
Speaker 2: 2009 where we actually sealed it.  We had all kinds of inkling.  And we wouldn't have stuck with the project that long if we hadn't had indicators that it was working.  But to verify something is difficult in science and something that is that novel, right?  I think this is the beginning of something big.  The last--the publication I just got accepted is called "Elucidating the Redox Cycle of Phosphorus."  So we really have now an insight, few years into it about, well first of all this compound does exist.  We took our time in verifying it.  We had three--so back to my Arctic days, right, independent measures of verification.  We had three independent measures that this compound exists.  Now we have again, little tickles, little, suggestions that there are other compounds out there as well, but it's not documented and we haven't published it because we're waiting 'til, you know--I'll sign that.  We're waiting 'til it's good information.  I will put my name beside this conclusion.  So we're very patient with that.  But the work we're doing with reduced phosphorus is of interest to people in all disciplines, agriculture, the biogenesis population, astrochemists, right?  It's amazing how many people have been answering these questions and now the ability to measure these compounds can help them answer the questions.  So this is just the beginning.
Story_ID: 31037
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you were promoted in 2006 to associate professor?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And let's see.  And you've also like--your work with high school students, prepping high school students out here?
Speaker 2: Well again with my interests of helping students at the early stages, I participated in accepting students from high school, so Project SEED [Support for the Educationally and Economically Disadvantaged, a summer research internship program for high school students] by the ACS [American Chemical Society].  We'll place students in laboratories.  So I'm a host laboratory on a regular basis for Project Seed students.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now 2007, you won the distinguished women award from the California State University Los Angeles, from this school.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And what was--was that for a particular thing you did or was it--?
Speaker 2: That's one of the things where you look back and you say wow, are they talking about me?  So I guess somebody decided it was time to nominate me for this award and they get up there and describe my bio.  I'm like, really?  Did I do that?  But they had a lot to say and it was a real honor and I was in good company.  I mean you look at the other women who were on it.  So this came out of the idea that there are a lot of unsung heroes on this campus and everywhere.  But why does it have to be like that?  We can be inspirational to each other by sharing our successes publicly and being acknowledged for our successes as we continued you know to fight the fight, to do our work.  It doesn't have to be a culminating experience that mid-career it's okay to pause and say, you're doing all right.  So that's what this award was put together actually for not just mid-career but for women at all stages.  And I'm a proud recipient of the distinguished women's award.
Story_ID: 31038
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where do you see--can you prognosticate I guess where your research might go?  Or do you have a, like a vision for where it's going to go or how is it going to be used in the future?  I mean what it's going to, how it's going to impact people?
Speaker 2: I have a flexible vision.  There are things I definitely want to do with my research.  I want to make my methods for the reduced phosphorus widely applied.  And I don't want them to stay a little niche area of science and research for research's sake.  I want people to use it.  I want to use it and continue to make developments that can help other professionals answer the unanswered questions by developing analytical techniques and applying them myself.  Now I'm very curious about geothermal sources of reduced phosphorus and I have some more ideas about things we can do to give us that absolute certainty that some of these other reduced phosphorus compounds exist.  And I want to see if that was just a fluke.  So imagine it in one location very well.  Where else is it?  Where else is it?  I mean and how does this impact the world we think we understand?  I'd say my biggest contributions, my biggest desire right now is to make progress on this, these--the chemistry of the carcinogenic-immunogenic compounds.  And I am very excited about that.  I can't wait 'til I stop doing everything else and get back to my desk and my new office and write this paper that I'm sitting on because I really think it's somewhat revolutionary in helping us understand the aging of a particulate matter and how this impacts the carcinogenic-immunogenic products--properties of these particles.
Story_ID: 31039
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now are you a member of the NOBCChE?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: National Organization [for the Professional Advancement of] Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And is the age or range of the members, is it getting younger or is it getting older?
Speaker 2: I haven't been to a national meeting in some time.  What I'd say is that the age of the leadership is pretty consistently late fifties, fifties and sixties, that's it.  I don't see any forty-year-olds.  You know it's our turn to get up there and start taking leadership positions in NOBCChE so I work for the organization in that way.  In that those that are well established are taking those roles and doing them well.  There's a lot of outreach, necessary work to high school and even elementary school sciences through the--their students through the organization but I don't know what the future will be because I don't see where the next generation of leaders is being primed.  But then I'm not--I haven't been at a national meeting in a while.  I'm not a highly active member.  I attend, I don't attend.  So I hope--so I can't answer with certainty, but from my observations I'm a bit concerned.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what are the other professional organizations you're a member of?
Speaker 2: I'm a member of the American Chemical Society [ACS] and right now most of my work is at this institution [California State University, Los Angeles].  I'm not--with professional societies, that's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Have you had an opportunity to work abroad or--?
Speaker 2: I've gone abroad for fun, but no I've only worked domestic.  And Alert is in Canada so I did during my post-doc, I spent seven weeks working in Canada.
Story_ID: 31040
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  Do you want to cut off my right toe or my left one?  I mean I'm a whole package so I can't say that every experience that I've had makes me who I am.  And I continue to grow.  I continue to develop as a person and a scientist.  But I wouldn't take back anything, any decision that I've made along my journey.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now here at the school, like what percentage of your time is devoted to teaching and what percentage is research?
Speaker 2: It varies.  If you want to look at the academic year, I would say that about 40 percent of my time is devoted to research and 60 percent is teaching.  And that varies depending on where we are with mid-terms and finals.  But I'd say on average it's about sixty-forty [60-40], except any--about a 100 and--40 percent if I want to include the committee work too.  I've really gotten involved in institutional building so let me go back and think in a 100 percent framework, more like--yeah still 40, 40 and then 20 percent institution and 40 percent teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Does that feel about right to you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, you--I always feel like I'm dragging my heels in the lab.  I'm looking for--right now I need more reassigned time.  I need more time to do my research.  I'm teaching more than I used to and I really need to work on getting the support I need to spend more time in the lab.
Story_ID: 31041
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what today would you say are the milestones in what you've done so far?
Speaker 2: Well, we talked about the 2004 publication ["Detection of hypophosphite, phosphite, and orthophosphate in natural geothermal water by ion chromatography"] .  It's nice, it's easy to think about the most recently.  I'm very excited about the paper we're working on right now.  It's unpublished so I can't talk too much about it.  But I have given some poster presentations, oral presentations on this work.  And I really think it's going to help us think differently about the role of water on particles.  So when you have a wet particle and you're performing a reaction, that's significant.  It sounds trivial.  Is it wet?  Is it dry?  Who cares?  But it makes a big difference in the chemistry that we're studying and I'm really excited to get that work finished and out.  And this is a milestone for me in that so much of my work as an independent professional has been in the world of measurement.  Can I develop any technique to measure this species?  So it's been a long time since I've done real, physical chemistry.  You know since my graduate years I haven't really done--and since my post-doc, I haven't done just plain kinetics which is my specialty, interface, kinetics at interfaces is what I do and it's nice to get back home.  I feel like I'm coming back home and--because I have so much experience in that area, I can make major contributions so I'm excited.  That's a milestone is just looking at that dataset as a complete package and saying ah, you know here it is.  Let's talk about some of the things in between.  It's always nice, with graduating my first student with an honor's thesis, an undergraduate with an honor's thesis.  Mary Lee [graduated from CSULA in 2004] now has had a Ph.D. from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for about a year in biological sciences.  But she was the first undergraduate in my lab.  She was the first one to do an honor's thesis for her honors in a major with her bachelor's.  And watching her grow up professionally has been a real joy, watching all of my students just light up.  You take a student from the classroom who is just curious about research and to watch them flip, just watch it flip.  It doesn't happen all the time but it certainly happened with Herbie [Pech, observer for the interview].  It happened with Ivy Gonzalez who is another student that I've had.  And it happens so infrequently you treasure that.  You watch somebody go from a random student studying science to a scientist and each one of those switches is a milestone in my career cause I love it so much.  I love what I do. I love the way you can see the world when you approach it scientifically.  And to see that happen every few years is a treat.
Story_ID: 31042
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm going to ask this question and though it seems trite.  I think I heard you answered it about fifteen times on Oakland [NSF ScienceMakers Public Program in the Bay Area, March 2011].  People say, what advice would you give young people today that want to be scientists?
Speaker 2: Well I would say don't pigeon hole yourself.  Don't forget who you are because true science is about creativity.  And creativity is an expression of self.  And so you have to be disciplined.  You have to know the rules.  You have to study hard, reserve time for that.  But at the same time you know don't tie yourself to a lab bench.  You need to live a little bit in order to do--that's the best way to make--have the potential to make significant contributions.  You can work sixteen hour days for the rest of your life and there are times in your life you will.  But live some life in between there or else you're going to be just like the person sitting next to you.  You're not going to be able to have that inspiration in order to make that next giant leap in science and so live a little.  At the same time there's no excuse for slouching.  I'm losing my word that I want there.  But you have to have the fundamentals.
Speaker 1: Or sloth, I guess.
Speaker 2: Slothing.  You have to have the fundamentals.  You can't just get by in your calculus class.  You have to know your calculus.  You can't just get by in your writing.  Your writing has to be stellar.  You're trying to communicate complex ideas when you're talking about chemistry.  Your audience doesn't have the benefit of your expertise and you have to communicate this.  You have to communicate this on so many levels that you have to know how to write, you know, blindfolded.  So writing and mathematics are things that any student can do.  Make sure you have that skill set just in case you might need it later because students who do have problems, it's not that they didn't have scientific curiosity, it's because they cannot--they don't have the fundamentals to develop the skills they need to be a scientist.  It's just taking too long.  They're ignited, they want to do it, but they're so damaged by their prerequisites or lack thereof that it makes it difficult for them to be a scientist.  So, you know, live a little.  Do some math.  Do some chem--some writing.  And then scientific projects, which can go anywhere from just having a good conversation, you know, like the one we've just had, thinking deeply about connections, why and how things happen.  I spoke earlier about my changes as an instructor has become incredibly important for me for students to realize that science isn't done by a bunch of geniuses working in a think camp somewhere.  Science is done by people listening and watching and observing the world around them very carefully and then thinking about what they see very creatively.  All of the great advancements in science have been done that way.  Someone is very in-tune with what's going on around them and they put a little bit of themselves in it too.  Well what about this, you know. [Albert] Einstein did not come up with the concept of a photon by himself.  [Max] Planck had to do the work on that theory to take those photon--to take the, that relationship and say it's a particle.  It's not a wave, it's a particle.  You know you think about people are undisputed geniuses like Einstein.  He just tweaked someone else's idea again and again and again and then he ran with some of his own.  But it's not like science is created by people who are any different than any one of us.  Every one of us has a spark of genius and I want them to see that if you watch carefully, if you know what you're doing, if you study hard, you might have something worth sharing.
Story_ID: 31043
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well what do you--what is your ultimate, I guess, dream for your own career?  I mean where do you see yourself you know say ten years from now?
Speaker 2: Ten years from now what's next?  I want my research program to be sustainable and still very much alive and productive.  I want that to be retained in my life ten years from now.  But I also want to grow in my ability to impact students, students period but with special emphasis on students who are underrepresented in the sciences.  I want to impact them and just tell them what I know about how this is the best life for many of us.  This is a powerful profession.  You get paid for this--this is work.  I'm at work, right?  I love my science and I don't want people to rule that out.  I just want them to think about it carefully and decide if they fit in it and not let someone else decide if they're going to be a scientist.  But consider this carefully and don't make mistakes in your grade school days, in your high school days that will prevent you from taking this option for your professional life because it's the only fix for a lot of us.  We were having this conversation the other day and we said I refuse the title "normal."  I'm not normal.  Please don't call me normal, right?  I would hate to be normal.  But I am me and I am a scientist and it's a--I can't picture myself in another profession.
Story_ID: 31044
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: One of my major concerns for the African American community is that they don't have the same opportunity that I had to know themselves and define themselves.  You know, I talked about the formative years of my college experiences [at Spelman College 1988-1992] but beyond that my mother [Frances Smith Foster] spent part of her appointments in African American studies, so I was surrounded by a sense of belonging.  I was surrounded by a sense of history and I'm afraid that there's a real probability that people can get sucked up of African American heritage into the wrong path, into the media version about what it is to be African American.  And that they don't have enough time sharing stories about their own personal history.  Let's go back further and talk about shared African heritage, about their roots.  When I talk to black people in Suriname--in Netherlands, I went on a trip to Netherlands.  And there was people who said, "Oh, I'm not Netherlands.  I'm from Suriname."  This is my home, right?  And they knew their roots.  I think one of the reasons why black people from the Caribbean are professionally--if they have the opportunities, if they can get out of poverty which many of them live, they have the opportunities to be professionals, they thrive in that area because there's a stronger sense of self in a Caribbean culture than there is in an African American culture.  So my biggest concern is that we will lose ourselves and stop defining ourselves and just try to blend without roots and that's not appropriate.  That's not--that's a loss.  That's a real loss is to forget where you came from, absolutely forget where you came from is on more levels than that.  Not just about self-explanation and history but also about the communities from whence you came from.  You know, my great-grandfather was a share cropper.  So how can I look sideways at a working class person?  What is that?  What is that?  Where is that coming from?  And that happens.  That happens all the time where people will marginalize.  They will separate themselves from their community and this is a real problem is the separation between subgroups within the African American community.  It's a scary thing is to forget where you came from, who you are and have a shared responsibility for empowering not just your subgroup of the American culture but others, you know.  I think America is really in a dangerous place because people are so concerned about themselves.  There's not enough community action these days and sense of responsibility for anyone other than themselves.  And so African Americans, part of the American community are victims to this, but I think we're more sensitive to failure as a community by drawing in and dealing with isolation because we're bombarded by media that's telling us we're not capable of doing anything besides rapping and fighting, oh in sports.  Sports is okay, right?  Sports is just fine.  But if we don't define ourselves and think about the collective, we are in real trouble.
Story_ID: 31045
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell me something about your family.  You mentioned getting married before you went to the Arctic [2000].  But I don't know exactly when it happened.  How did you meet your husband and how many children do you have?  Who are they?
Speaker 2: I married Kwasi Malik Connor in '97 [1997].  Is that right?
Speaker 1: Can you spell his name for us?
Speaker 2: K-W-A-S-I M-A-L-I-K Connor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And also as a child of the '70s [1970s], that's Malcolm X Malik.  That's who he's named after is Malcolm X, is the Malik.  And then Kwasi is, he is an American-born African American but his mother [Rosa Kincaid] has, had an interest in African cultures so Kwasi is the Ashanti name for a male born on Sunday.  So he has an African American name as his name so that's the naming story.  But I married him in '97 [1997].  We met in college [while Foster was at Spelman College, 1988-1992].  He was a business major, I was chemistry.  We had a friend, a couple of friends in common.  One was my college roommate.  And so friends of friends you know, we dated.  I was not interested in marrying him at all, you know.  He was my friend.  I dated other people.  I went out with my friend.  And so eventually, being the analytical person I am, I made a list of the men I was dating.  I made a list of the characteristics I thought were necessary for a long term relationship.  I picked the highest score.  So I married my friend.
Speaker 1: Now in this respect you seem to be a lot like your father [Warren Reed Foster] who had a list and went down the list.
Speaker 2: I know.  I know.  I did the same thing he did.
Speaker 1: So this is--so once again this is Fiddler on the Roof [The song, "Do I love you?"].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  No, no love was part of it.  I loved him.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And we have two kids.  Camilla is seven and Julian is two for a little longer.  On Tuesday he'll be three.
Speaker 1: And his name is Julian.  Now was there any attempt to--?
Speaker 2: Oh everything has meaning here.
Speaker 1: Does the Julian relate to Percy Julian by any chance?
Speaker 2: Percy Julian [African American chemist] and Julian Bond [social activist].  So I was more intrigued by the work of activist Julian Bond and I also thought it was a powerful name so I was just getting into like Julian, Julian as an actor, as a singer, artist.  Julian, come on this name.  And then, but I was also inspired by Julian Bond and Percy Julian.
Speaker 1: And what about your daughter's name?
Speaker 2: My daughter is, I was very concerned about giving her an African name so how did I end up with Camilla?  I said, "Well, my heritage is African American and women who have been significant in my life are my mother-in-law so Rosa Kincaid.  I took the A from her name because that makes it unique.  My daughter is not my mother-in-law.  And Camille, Camille Cosby.  So Camilla comes from Rosa and Camille Cosby.  And then I was also intrigued by the idea her initials spell CRC [Chemical Rubber Company] which is the publisher of the handbook for Chemistry and Physical Constants so she is Camilla Rose Connor, CRC.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, we have to pause here again.
Story_ID: 31046
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything I have not asked you that we need to address before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: All right.  That's what everybody says.   But the last question is similar to the question about milestones and legacy.  But ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as somebody who contributed and somebody who cared.  And I don't have a necessary order but I think it's important to do both.  By contributed I mean contributed scientifically--that I left my stamp on the scientific community.  I talked about where I'd like to be in ten years.  I want to see people use these things.  I want to see the science develop and I want to be part of the development.  I want other people to run with it too.  I want my science to scream from the mountaintops.  I don't want it to be just a little thing you do.  I want it to make an impact and this is something where I want to contribute in that way.   Contribute slash care [Contribute/care] is my other interest which is contributing to the next generation, contributing to the development of scientists, contributing to the mechanisms.  How do we teach students effectively, especially students of color?  Why are they not retained in the sciences?  How do we build the pipeline and how do we shoot them all the way through to Ph.D. and professional success?  I'm very interested in developing in that area and I'm actively doing that now.  Part of my time [on the faculty of California State University, Los Angeles], part of that 20 percent I talked about for institution is with the minority opportunity research programs where I'm working and I spend hours weekly discussing how can we do this better?  What can we do to prepare students of color for the Ph.D., and so--and make them successful, you know?  That's one of our latest conversations.  Okay, they're getting there but not always getting through.  Now what do we do to make sure they are retained and earn the Ph.D.?  And this is important to me because you know there's just one of me.  I don't know maybe twenty, thirty years as a professional left.  I have plenty of time, but I can't do this forever and so I want to make sure that I contribute to the training also.
Speaker 1: All right, well thank you.  Best wishes for everything you try to do.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
