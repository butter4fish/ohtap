Story_ID: 55860
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're gonna start with you when you were born.  I'd like to first ask you about your parents, your parents.  I wanna ask you first of all your father his name is Eugene Baron Jackson and I want you to tell me about what you know about his family and his background?
Speaker 2: Okay, I don't know too much about that.  I was such a little guy when he died.  I was only about eight and I only know what they told me, you know, about him.  He ran a tailor shop and it was in the white neighborhood of Charleston, South Carolina, and he was a tailor, but he was a perfectionist.  And they tell me he was very open and helpful to all the people in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your mother, her name?
Speaker 2: Laura, Laura Jackson.  Laura Rivers Jackson.  She came from James Island, South Carolina, which is an island off the coast of Charleston, and her father was a minister and she was more of a home work, homemaker, kind of taking care of things and working to keep the neighborhood, you know, active with things for the young people.
Story_ID: 55861
Speaker 1: And what are some of your earliest memories of growing up, sir?
Speaker 2: Well, when I used to go out a lot.  I used to love to walk down by the, the water area and that's how I picked up a little goat followed me home once, and he came and I just couldn't get rid of him; I loved him.  And my bro, oldest brother was kind of mean.  He threw him off the banister and broke his little legs, but he still hung in there and I remember so much, the, the comradery of the people in Charleston [South Carolina].  And I used to go up to a church when I was a little guy, seven or eight years old, up the street they called it the Sanctified and Holy Church. And everybody would start singing, clapping, and then you'd start speaking in the unknown tongues.  And my parents [Eugene Baron Jackson and Laura Rivers Jackson] let me go, but then the church broke up because the minister was a little mixed up with one of the sisters who was married to one of the other guys, so the church broke up, but it was very interesting.
Story_ID: 55862
Speaker 1: And my mom [Laura Rivers Jackson] died when I was, I guess, going on eight.  And she had then was hard to treat it, consumption they call it, but--and my dad [Eugene Baron Jackson] died just six months later.  So, before I was nine o'clock, I mean, nine years old I had no parents at all.  And my sister who was then in charge of the Will of my father and she had just turned 21.  She had finished the New England Conservatory of Music [Boston, Massachusetts], first black there, but my father provided so well that she married some guy and they were travelling all over, she and both of my sisters, living big.  And I finally went up to Washington [D.C., District of Columbia] where one of the sisters lived, and I started working--it was the president situation was pretty rough in Washington at the time and I could only get a job working in the Union Station cleaning the latrines in the morning early and then I would go to school, come out, and I'd be a bus boy.  Even then I was just about, I guess, 12, 13, 14, paying 5 dollars a week at a room and I never knew my father had left us so well off.  He left a house for everybody and money, but my older sister, you know, she squandered that pretty fast.
Story_ID: 55863
Speaker 1: I'm wanna go back and ask you about that, I mean, your family was very, I mean it really middle class or upper middle class?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: You even had servants, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And, and I want to, I mean I want you to tell me who your siblings are and their, you know, from the oldest to the youngest.  Can you give me that order?
Speaker 2: You mean my children?
Speaker 1: No, your, your, your sisters and--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah okay.
Speaker 1: --from the--
Speaker 2: I had an older sister, Esyelee (ph.), who finished at New England Conservatory of Music [Boston, Massachusetts], and behind her was the other sister, Alice.  She was teaching in Washington, D.C.  Then an older brother, Eugene, who was, I guess, seven, eight years older than me, and then my brother, Leroy, who was next to me.  He was two years older than me.
Speaker 1: And so you are the youngest?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're the youngest?
Speaker 2: I'm the youngest of five.
Speaker 1: So when, when your parents passed away in such short time span, do you remember how that felt to you and what happened, I mean, because there was a period of even, you know, maybe eight years before you end up going to Washington [D.C., District of Columbia] and I'm wondering who took over at that point on?
Speaker 2: My sister, my older sister [Esyelee Jackson], he left it in the Will that she should be the person who would carry it out.  So, she took over and while she, you know, she was just travelling all over.  She lived it up.  She never really took advantage of the fact that her education at the New England Conservatory of Music.
Speaker 1: But, at the time you had no knowledge of that?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no, no
Speaker 1: And you didn't have any, but I'm saying at that period, you know, from like eight--so your sister, Esyelee, comes back and she takes care of the household is that what happens?
Speaker 2: She was responsible really financially, but as far as taking responsibility she wasn't really around.  You know, we had other aunts and uncles who would come in, but her thing was travelling, you know, kind of living it up.
Speaker 1: That's, okay.
Speaker 2: But, she had a lot at her disposal because the way the Will is everything was left to her.
Story_ID: 55864
Speaker 1: And I wanna ask you when you found out (I'm sort of getting ahead of myself), but when did you find out that your sister [Esyelee Jackson] had, you know, had squandered a lot of the resources of the family?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess it was after I came to Washington [D.C., District of Columbia] and I started, you know, working, and then little by little people would come and tell me, you know, that I was supposed to be very well off and this, that, the other, and I never could, never could pin my older sister down about it, you know.  She was always on the move and travelling and little it up, and then when I went back to Washington--no I was in Washington, but when I finished school, high school, I came up to her and by this time I'd gathered all this information and I guess she heard I was coming to New York [New York City, New York] to confront her and she disappeared.  I couldn't find her, and I wasn't but, I guess, 14, 15, and my oldest brother [Eugene Jackson] was quite a guy.  He was always, I guess, in trouble or drunk or whatever, and I, he, he was, I don't know what he must have been--I know he drank a lot.  I don't know if he was on drugs or what, but he found out I was coming to New York and I rented a room, five dollars a week, and he made it a point to come around.  And I remember well how he came and I'd just gotten paid and he beat me up and he took my money and then I went up to Harlem Hospital (I remember well), and my face was kind of bloody and going, but that was about the last time I saw him.  I never saw him anymore.  I don't know where he disappeared, but they said he was, you know, always around drinking or whatever.  Now, my brother next to me [Leroy Jackson] was a great athlete, and my sister really, really loved him.  She sent him up to prep school, one of the finest prep schools in the world, Troy Conference Academy [now Green Mountain College in Poultney, Vermont].  Their tuition was ungodly.  And I asked her about me going up there and she said we couldn't afford it, but that, you know, he was carrying the ball so she had him up there and then when we finally discovered she said all the money was gone.  I said, "What do you mean all the money's gone?"  "There is no money for you to go off to prep school and whatever and we just don't, you know, have any money."  Then, she disappeared, and I didn't see her, I guess, for, I guess 6 or 7 months.  But, I was washing dishes at a restaurant and that's the way I, you know, was able to carry on and keep on going to school.  But, I've stuck with it as far as going to school is concerned.
Speaker 1: And your sister, Alice, what, what did she do?  Did she--
Speaker 2: She was teaching school in Washington, D.C., and prior to that she and her husband and my oldest sister and her husband they were travelling all over everywhere, but she was teaching and, and doing very well.
Speaker 1: So, you were, you were really sort of left on your own?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 55865
Speaker 1: Now, when--I wanna ask you during that did you feel--were you like a typical maybe nine-year-old and not really understanding the implications of your parents' death.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, but you stayed, you stayed in, in, in Charleston, South Carolina until you were 12 or 13?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 13.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and during that time I'm just wondering what type of child were you?  Were you, you know, were you an introvert?  Were you, you know, 'cause remember this is the same child who went to look at the Pentecostal church, you know, went exploring and was very curious.  And I'm just wondering what you were as a young person and what you sort of dreamed of being?
Speaker 2: Well, like as you go way back there it was, I guess, a lot of living as an introvert, staying, keeping things within you.  And I was-- 'cause with my parents [Eugene Baron Jackson and Laura Rivers Jackson] dying so close together and everything, you get kind of devastated because, you know, both of your parents going and then your older sister [Esyelee Jackson] was guardian of everything, you know, her not being around you.  I remember older relatives, people from the island, my mother's sisters and all from James Island [South Carolina] around.  They kind of, they, they gave me a lot of comfort and so I, as you said, as you're introverted, but you got to grow up fast, I guess.  You learn fast and you, you still--I found myself not being depressed, but always that hope for tomorrow.  So, I think that's how I happen to make it.  I always believed that tomorrow when I wake up it's gonna be a different day and opportunities are going to come and I always knew that you have to work for what you got.  But, I, but I, I felt that I could and it was very fortunately, I mean, very blessed, so blessed.
Speaker 1: So do you think that's something that just came from inside of you as opposed to someone who, you know, who influenced you that better days were coming and, you know, always look for tomorrow?  You think that was something that just was part of you?
Speaker 2: I think it was more or less a part of me, and then I used to get around with different places, you know, little home for children and mix with the children there and, you know, come out of it saying "Hey, but I'm blessed 'cause I'm not staying in a home.  I have the freedom of being out here," and I think when you talk about motivation I hear people talk about it now, but I motivated myself.  If you sit back I always used to think of another slogan I live by:  "If you think you're beaten, you are.  If you think you dare not, you don't.  If you'd like to win and think that you can, it's almost a cinch that you won't.  Think that you can and you will.  It's all in your state of mind." ['Thinking' by Walter Wintle] And I remember carrying that feeling within me that I could do it, and been blessed.  You know when you're blessed with your health and, and you go out and keep working I just thought that God had chosen me as one of his people.
Story_ID: 55866
Speaker 1: Now, what elementary school did you go to, sir?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Wait a minute now.
Speaker 1: In Charleston [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Avery, Avery Elementary School [Avery Normal Institute].  It was a private school and even, you know, as we started sixth, seventh, eighth, it was hard to get in, not so hard because it was very expensive, but my mother [Laura Rivers Jackson] and father [Eugene Baron Jackson] made sure we were all in private schools.  Never went to at that time public schools.
Story_ID: 55867
Speaker 1: And what was the occasion for you moving to Washington D.C.?  Was there--were you going to stay with [his sister] Alice at the time?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and can you talk about that because you were sort of jumping over things, you know, you were there, but then next thing you're working for, you know, and you're out on your own, but can you explain what happened when you got to Washington?
Speaker 2: Well, when I came to Washington the idea was that I was gonna live with her and go to school, etc., but when I got there she had married a guy named Henry Cornish (ph.), and he was very hostile about her having me there.  And it went along for awhile and then I told her and she didn't, she didn't, you know, object to it.  I said I'm gonna go out and get my own room and, you know, earn my own way, and she said well maybe that's what you better do and that's the truth, that's how I just went on out.
Speaker 1: And so you were 13 and you decide to, you know, go out, you find a place, it's how much a month?  It's five dollars?
Speaker 2: Five dollars a week.
Speaker 1: A week okay.  And so you how are you making your living then?
Speaker 2: In the morning cleaning the latrines at the railroad station.  In the afternoon, after school being a busboy at a restaurant and made good tips, you know, things like that 'cause I hustled, really hustle.
Speaker 1: And you didn't have any, any, any problem making this transition 'cause you had been a privileged child and to then go and be really on your own?
Speaker 2: Well, you see that's why I felt I was so blessed because it was many a time I would sit and say, "Oh my goodness, you know, I gotta do this, gotta do that" and you had to really divorce yourself from the privilege living that we had in Charleston [South Carolina].  You know, we had maids, we had chauffeur, we had everything and, and it was time to face reality.  And I used to sit by myself and say, "You know, we gotta face it all that good stuff you were talking about it just isn't anymore. " And so who were you--so you were basically on your own--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, your brother, no, I mean just own your own?
Speaker 1: No, yeah because my sister [Esylee Jackson] took my brother [Leroy Jackson] who was a favorite next to me and sent him off away to private school, but she never, you know, offered to send me.
Story_ID: 55868
Speaker 1: And during--now what school--you were, you were going to wasn't Wau, Dunbar?  What school did you attend in Washington [D.C., District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School.  I played football, basketball.
Speaker 1: So, you were a good student though you were able to keep up your grades?
Speaker 2: Oh very good.  Was very lucky.  I, I guess I was so devoted outside of going out and maybe playing with the football team afterward, it meant right after that getting down and studying for the next day 'cause I was determined that I was going to finish school.
Speaker 1: And what, what, where do you think you got that determination from?  That's what I'm just and who's advising?  Do you have any adult who's influencing you at school or any other place or church?  Is there anyone else that's influencing you during this period?
Speaker 2: Well, I used to spend a lot of time at, at the church, you know, and they had all kind of programs going on there.  So, a lot of people once they found out who you were and what you were trying to do they would encourage you and I found many ways of incentives to keep me going rather than sit and, and sink, and it was wonderful because I found people who encouraged me, who, it made, made it worthwhile.
Speaker 1: And did you have like from a sport--did you gravitate naturally towards sports?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and which, which ones?  Football, baseball.
Speaker 2: Well, football, basketball, baseball, played all of them and you'd move from one to the other as the season moved and it was a beautiful thing to take up all of your lax time and outside of work and just playing the sports.  It was, you know, a full day.
Speaker 1: And did anyone adopt you during that time period, any offer of adopt.  I'm just, no.
Speaker 2: I guess, you know up at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] and going there a lot of the guys who were in charge there would kind of take you over and school you and work with you because when they found out really about me with no parents and they decided, I guess they all kind of took me in and I got some wonderful advice, you know, on how to do it and be sure you get enough rest or you're not gonna be able to do these things you're doing.
Story_ID: 55869
Speaker 1: Now, you--it's time for you to graduate from high school is there, was your thought that you would go immediately on to college?
Speaker 2: I had hoped, you know, when I was finishing [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School that I would, you know, by this time, wait a minute, I had started as a little guy--well, another thing I was doing when I came to Washington [D.C., District of Columbia] I would go up to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and they adopted me as the mascot.  That was the beginning of my relationship with Howard, and I would go out and lead the team on the field and on the basketball court and all, and the coach knew what I was trying to do and they kind of all, all the players adopted me and, you know, I always felt that I would have to head up to Howard University some way, shape, or form.  And coming out of Dunbar High School, you know, my marks was such that I could get into Howard, so they helped arrange a scholarship so I could at least go.
Speaker 1: And so what were you thoughts when you went?  What did you want to, what did you want to major in?  What did you want to do?
Speaker 2: In, in going to Howard I, I was trying to look at so many things, the overall perspective 'cause I, I always felt that so many of the black people coming up were not taking advantage, you know, of the opportunities.  Of course, they required a lot of them the education and it meant going to the University and, and, and extending yourself out and of course people help you.  So, I felt that, you know, with a little help we could do a lot of things.
Speaker 1: Now you--Howard was a different place also at that time.  You said that the university was different at that point in time.  Do you remember that?  In the book ['The House that Jack Built'] you, you talk about being, you know, it wasn't matured yet.  You--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in going up and meeting the people, you know, you got so when you're around the University you, you became more interested in the idea "I gotta attend this, I gotta make it, I gotta get good marks because I wanna go to Howard" and it, it became a thing with me and I think going up there at such a young age was a blessing because I got indoctrinated into the things around the University and it got into you "I've got to make, I've got to come here."
Story_ID: 55870
Speaker 1: Did they ever, I mean, Esyelee [Jackson's oldest sister], is she still alive?
Speaker 2: I know that she was living in New York [New York City, New York], and then she joined her son and he, she moved to Virginia and not too long ago or well maybe about two or three years.  I never heard any more about her (laughter).
Speaker 1: Your parents [Eugene Baron Jackson and Laura Rivers Jackson] they would have been rolling in their grave I think.
Speaker 2: But you know you come around and just like with Alice it never felt really welcome or warm and you say why go through that.  Let 'em, you know, let 'em go because you know what they say truly blessed.  That's what I felt I've been so blessed, oh.
Speaker 1: God had a different path for you that's all, that's right.
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 55871
Speaker 1: So, now when did you become interested in broadcasting?  When, when did that interest start?
Speaker 2: Oh, I mean even--I'm trying to think now about the actual beginning of it because those days they didn't have any blacks on the air or anything else, but I always had this ambition.  I would get a mic and make believe that I was on the air and do it, and consistently because I didn't have any recording equipment or anything, but I would say "hello everybody" and go into this kind of thing about the sports and, and, and it was, it got so, it became easy for me.  And when I first went, you know, in to talk about it, you know, Sam Lacey, who was sports editor of the [Baltimore] Afro-American, he got me into Griffith Stadium [Washington, D.C.] and when they--I was, well, just started with the teams, but the black teams [Negro League Baseball] was when they would draw the money, Josh Gibson and all the others, Homestead Grays, and they, they wouldn't, they had no black ball players on the white team, but whenever the black players played they would pack 'em in, Satchel Paige and everybody else.  And I did--Sam would let me do the announcing, work with him introducing the players and the things right up in the booth because they only had one place.  They had to let us go up in there, and the teams were bringing in so much money for Clark Griffith who owned Washington franchise that it became, you know, synonymous.  And then Sam said to me, "Why don't you try working with me.  I'll give you some columns and maybe you'd like to write the sports for the "Afro-American" newspaper."  He was sports editor.  And I said, "Yeah I'd like that" and that got me into the writing of sports.  I would go and interview people, you know, write it.  I would cover the high school games and, and as it developed the, the coordination of, you know, what I was doing speaking and writing it turned out to be a blessing.
Story_ID: 55872
Speaker 1: And those were times when, you know, they would rent, they probably had, they had black days when they would rent out the [baseball] stadium, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: For, for the teams [Negro League Baseball].
Speaker 2: Well, and that's when they made the big money.  The regular team, which was in the American League, the Washington Senators, they would draw 3, 4,000, but when the blacks came in 32,000 and Satchel Paige and, you know, the, the blacks, the people, really turned out.  And the whites turned out too for these black games and that's when it started going all around the country and I was anxious to, you know, broadcast the games and I ran around--A guy named C.C. Coley he was, he had barbecue places, about eight or ten (he was a black guy), and I spoke to him about if I got a thing going would he sponsor it.  He said, You know I will," and, and that's why when I went into this WINX at 8th and I [Streets] and talk to them about it [in 1939].  You know and the guy calls everybody in and said "Can you imagine this 'N-----' talking about going on this radio."  The Washington Post owned that station too by the way.  And "none will ever go on this radio station."  He, he called his people in.  So, I went to wholesaler who buys time and nobody questioned him because he's bringing the station so much money as to what they were gonna put on.  And I got Coley to give him the money and we got all set to go on the air.  They didn't know what was going on.  We sat outside the car.  I had Dr. [Mary McLeod] Bethune out there.  I had Dr. Charles Drew out there and, and, and when the time came we just went and went on the air and it took off so big that four days later Annapolis [Maryland] was calling me, Baltimore [Maryland] was calling wanting me to do the same kind of show there.  So, there I am now and it started picking up.  I said, "What is this?"  I would do a wake-up show in Washington [D.C.], go to Annapolis because those were the days you couldn't pipe in like, you know, in Washington and talk to Annapolis.  Go into Annapolis for two hours, go to Baltimore and do a little sports summary, and come back to Washington and do a four-three, so it, it was feast or famine.  I was doing four radio shows a day and finishing about 12, 1 o'clock at night.  But, it was inspirational.  I felt good doing it.
Story_ID: 55873
Speaker 1: Now, with that whole, I mean cause what you're describing is your, how you even got on the air in the first place and he had said something not so complimentary.  He said "these nig-" what did he say "these--you'll never be on the air.  They'll never be any-"
Speaker 2: "Never be any-" they used the N word and this "never in this radio station" and of course once we got, you know, he was pushed aside because it meant so much money coming into the station that, you know, we just went on doing it.
Speaker 1: But, Mr. Jackson how did you even know to do that?  And I the only reason I say that is that you went around--first you find your sponsor, okay, and then you go around and you say okay well I can't get in through the door the right way I'm gonna go and get a wholesaler--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and then, you know, go in that way.  And wasn't there an advertising agency that was involved?
Speaker 2: Cal Ehrlich and Merrick and they were terrific and somehow the guys who ran it, you know, they kind of took to me and then they introduced me to some big sponsors.  The National Brewing Company was one of the biggest beer companies in the, in the country, and they would tell them that I would work for them outside of the radio if they would sponsor me.  In other words, if National Beer would spend money with me maybe once a week, I would go to a club and take entertainment there and only if the club would see nothing that night, but the National Beer.  And little by little it caught on that way and Tip Top Bread was another one.  Althea Gibson, I got to know her because she was in addition to, you know, she was at her peak with the tennis, Tip Top Bread wanted Althea and me to make appearances at different big supermarkets, and we would offer this bread.  We'd sell out a brand so fast, but, I mean, that's the kind of thing.  But you know, it's something that I've always done.  I never felt the idea of being a prima donna where you go on the air and go home.  I always felt you have to be involved with the sponsor, with the station, and the people, and it has worked out tremendously.  I just didn't think you could divorce the three.  The three elements go together, and it helps to make a success.
Story_ID: 55874
Speaker 1: Right.  Now did you--now that show though what was the name of the show 'cause that was the other thing is that they didn't even catch onto the name of the show.  You know, they, you, you named it 'The Bronze Review.'
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and you said that they were so, they knew nothing about the black communities--
Speaker 2: Nothing.
Speaker 1: --so they didn't even know that that was referring to black people.
Speaker 2: That's right and it's just amazing how, how everything, you know, just took off.  It was a lot of hard work, but it was wonderful.  You just work like heck and you were thrilled to do it because you could see the light at the end of the tunnel and especially when it got so, when you know when you're bringing a lot of money into a radio stations and around it gave me a chance to bring children in from the schools, the little black children, who somehow were ignored.  Washington [D.C.] was a prejudice town, very bad, but little by little you could feel it, you know, kind of breaking down.  Howard University [in Washington, D.C.] was such a big asset and, you know, everything just had to really push its way because they were determined for a long, long time, you know.  You couldn't go downtown to eat, you couldn't go downtown to a theater, and it, but little by little, you know, we worked hard to break it down.
Story_ID: 55875
Speaker 1: Now, you had also, I wanna go back a little bit, but you had also been, you had already gotten married right at that point and, and, but you had already been married and not divor, well divorced--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you, and had a daughter--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that you were the sole caretaker and I just wanted you to talk about that.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, well when, yeah I got married [to Claudia Parrat in 1933] we had, I had a little girl [Jane Jackson] and she wanted not to really be a part of this thing.  She wanted, guess, socializing and she said "You know you want Jane, take her" and I did and everybody couldn't understand how this guy goes around and had his little girl.  I took her everywhere I went and you know she fell right in and, and we kind of went through life together going along like that.
Speaker 1: But, see that was pretty amazing too for that period of time.  You hear about, you know, husbands taking care of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --today, but that even seems to be a new thing and you were, you were, this is back in what 1936 I think--
Speaker 2: Yeah
Speaker 1: --36, 37 and you, you became a single parent.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you took her to games and--
Speaker 2: I took her to games.  I took her to everything and she, and she was so wonderful.  Jane just fell right into everything and everybody, you know, knew that she was gonna be there with me so it was a thing I had to do in a game, you know, she would be with me and then somebody would come and keep her and take her before the game was over and then I'd go back and get her.
Story_ID: 55876
Speaker 1: And then you, you married bef, actually before you started with WINX.  You married a second time [in 1938].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I wanted you to talk about how that came about.
Speaker 2: Well, I found out that, you know, cause people were saying, "You know you're raising this child by yourself?" "Yeah," and it, it was a great, great experience and I think in going and doing you, you're so involved with so many things that you finally, you know, you get involved with people like that and I think that's how, you know, I really got involved.  And then she was saying that, you know, she would help me out with Jane whenever and going and doing and I think that's how that built into the, you know, the marriage.
Speaker 1: Okay, and her name was?  Your second wife was Julia?
Speaker 2: Yeah Julia.
Speaker 1: Julia Hawkins.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay
Story_ID: 55877
Speaker 1: And so you're, you're working, you know so you are, you're a husband, you're a newlywed, I mean you're a newlywed [to Julia Hawkins] and a father and you're working for the [Baltimore] Afro-American and you actually also are involved in the--(unclear)--announcer and, but you know I'm also curious about your first show, you know, was aired that showed that, you know, you started it when it went on at 11:15, 11--it was a 15 minute show.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  How did you end of deciding that it was gonna be Mary, Mary, Mary McLeod Bethune, sorry.
Speaker 2: Mary McLeod Bethune.
Speaker 1: McLeod Bethune.  How did you, how did you make that decision that that was the person that you were going to use for your first show?
Speaker 2: Well, I figured for that first show it had to be great, so I had to find somebody who was so big in the black community, and at that time, you know, she was such a doll.  The president [President Franklin Roosevelt] had appointed her like a consultant, and I used to be up there because I raised money to pay for the National Council of Negro Women, the building from the games.  I would get them to give a percentage of the profits to her and it's amazing I used to sit in her office and she would call the President of the United States.  She was such an elegant woman.  "Mr. President" and they would go into this big thing about "I would try to do it" and then with Ms. Bethune she would call me.  "She said you wanna make the rounds today?   I'm going to pick up Mrs. [Eleanor] Roosevelt and we will take you with us if you'd like to and you know she--(unclear)--."  I said, "I'd love it."  And I would go with her and Mrs. Roosevelt, Ms. Bethune, the very poor areas, you know, of Washington [D.C.] and otherwise.  But, they always had protection for the First Lady and all and everything, but the two women together they may not have been beautiful one way, but they were beautiful spiritually.  And I always class that as a great, great, you know, background experience.  And like you said how did I decide.  I didn't think anything would be bigger than putting Dr. Bethune on the air.  And then Dr. Charles Drew had just, you know, come through with the blood plasma and saving [blood banks].  It was a very unfortunate thing.  You know he died because he had an automobile accident and they wouldn't give him blood plasma in the whole, in the hospital.  So, I mean, that was really the opening.  Then from then on everybody was coming to me to be on the show, and I mean everybody 'cause the audience was just unbelievable.
Speaker 1: And it didn't--she didn't really--did she take much talking into to do it?  She, no, she was happy to do it?
Speaker 2: Oh yes she was happy.
Speaker 1: Did she adopt you sort of as--she saw something in you sir then?
Speaker 2: It was just wonderful because she made me know that the door to the National Council of Negro Women was always open for me.  Come up anytime, let's talk, and let's do.  And then she would come to me when she was trying to make certain inroads because she had gotten to be such a big person that there was so much jealousy, you know, around her, but she never saw that.  She was just in to doing things, and she wanted to see black women achieve a status that they had never been respected for, and she said "We're gonna do Hal, we gonna do it;" and she did.  Tireless, never stop going.  I don't know where that lady got her energy.
Story_ID: 55878
Speaker 1: So, now you, once you do your first whatever broadcast, I mean what do you call it air cas, radio cast--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --once you first do that things start taking off.  They really, you know, people are excited the--I can't remember the gentleman's name who was the general manager, but he can't really do anything because you're bringing on.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you learn any lessons during those early years about how to service clients because you're writing copy, you're doing everything, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you learn anything during those early years that was important, you know, for when you, for going forward that stood you well, any lessons about how to operate as--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and at one point they weren't anxious, the manager wasn't, but the people at the station were anxious.  The show was so big and, you know, other than the show we were doing WINX was just, you know, the Washington Post station, news, news, news, and so we gave all of the producers and all a chance to really be a part of something 'cause I welcomed then.  And they'd come to me with ideas and people we could put on the air and I think a lot of black people in the community of status or whatever was contacting and wanted to be on the air with us.  So, it really built, it, it built to a gigantic thing and especially with Annapolis [Maryland] involved.  There was a big beach down there that black people owned, Carr's Beach, Sparrow's Beach, [owned by sisters Elizabeth Carr Smith and Florence Carr Sparrow] the very wealthy black people and then going into Baltimore [Maryland] I used to--Morgan College [now Morgan State University] was there, so we were reaching in for another area there and it's unbelievable how everything was spread and we got so we had such a backup of interest and artists and then musicians wanted to come on and be a part of what we were doing and I was, you know, I was really thrilled that they too wanted to be a part of this show.
Story_ID: 55879
Speaker 1: Now, talk about how you got started as a, a basketball team owner.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, you know I love sports so much and having played football, basketball, and baseball I, Sam and I, Sam Lacey--there was a place in Washington [D.C.], nothing.  Blacks were not allowed to play in what was then the N.B.A. [National Basketball Association].  No black players.  Okay, so I had always followed these, some of the guys played in New York on independent teams, and it was during the war [World War II] and they work at Grumman, Grumman Aircraft [Corporation], so they were exempt from the Service and I said to Sam, "You know what maybe we can put some kind of team" and Wa, Washington didn't have a team in what was then the N.B.A.  So, I went to this beautiful arena, Uline, Mike Uline's arena [now the Washington Coliseum], and well he knew I was a sports writer.  He didn't want me to knock it, he didn't really care, but I said, "How is it you don't let black people, you know, come here."  "Oh, they're welcome, you come on in bring some people."  But, then I would look up I'd be the only one there with my people.  So, I asked him about playing basketball in his arena.  Oh, no he couldn't have that, but it was an ice arena.  They had hockey and all.  Now, I said, "Well Washington don't have any team.  I'm gonna put a team in Washington."  "Where you gonna play?"  I wrote to a guy named Joe Turner.  He used to have a big arena [Turner's Arena] for wrestling and everything and I showed him, Sam and I, showed him how he could block it out and play basketball.  And he said, "Oh yeah, so yeah, we said we'd do it."  I brought the C.I.A.A. [Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association] there afterward, the--(unclear)--the col, black colleges they had no place and I'd bring them there for their tournament and everything.  But, anyway I showed him how he could do it.  Ahmet Ertegun, the, you know, was there with the Turkish embassy.  He was in Washington and he would be there every Sunday with me.  We played every Sunday afternoon and we played all of the teams that were in, what was then the NBA.  We beat up everybody.  It was unbelievable and packed 'em in.  So, then the word got around so that-- in Chicago [Illinois] where they have the World's Championship, Frank Forbes who was one of the big men in Chicago went to the mayor and he said "You know they have a team in Washington, they got a team now it's not in the NBA, but we ought to invite them out here for the World's Championship Professional Basketball Tournament."  It was something and they called me and they asked me because we had a record of like, I think we only lost two games out of like 80, 82 games.  So, this guy Forbes said "Man you gotta do it."  So, I went out, he took me to the mayor and the mayor says you know, "You think this team can compete."  I said "Yeah."  He said well we'll invite 'em out to the tournament [in 1943].  So, we got on the train.  Mike Uline, no, the guy who owned in Washington all the, don't forget now all the theaters was segregated, and this guy owned oh about twelve black theaters and I made a deal with him.  I said, "If you let me advertise on the screen about the teams and the games I'll put your name on the jerseys" and he said, "Great."  He was a very, very good guy.  And I said you got a deal, fine.
Story_ID: 55880
Speaker 1: So, we got on the train [in 1943] and, you know, we went out to Chicago [Illinois] took two days, three days going and we got out there and it was so much hoopla, etc.  They had us going in the first game, and it was unbelievable, 20,000 people, the biggest crowd in basketball history.  And we, oh Lord what was her name, anyway now they're with United, but it was the same place before.  I was telling Michael Jordan, you know, he said oh I know about the team.  He got the whole works 'cause they moved out, you know the Chicago team.  There at a new place now called--
Speaker 2: Called the Stadium.
Speaker 1: Huh.
Speaker 2: It was the Chicago Stadium?
Speaker 1: That's where we played.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But, now they're playing at the United aren't they?
Speaker 2: United.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: United Center.
Speaker 1: Right, so anyway we got there and we won four straight, and the final game, it was amazing.  These guys came to me--(unclear)--he said "I wanna talk to you."  I said, "What's wrong, I mean, we were just getting-"(unclear)--.   "You gotta lose this game" and I said, "lose what game.  This is for the championship.  What do you mean lose?"  Oh, he opened up a big bag.  I've never seen so much money in my life.  He said, "We're prepared to take care of you and the team, but you gotta lose this game."  I said, "I can't control these players."  I said, "Even I wanted to they don't, you know, do that."  He said, "Well I'm gone talk to the players," and he had these big guys with him, [Charles] "Tarzan" Cooper was my big guy, Johnny Isaacs, Zack Clayton and all of 'em, and they all shook their head, "Man we don't throw no game."  And by the way, they had a black element in Chicago, Sonny, oh I can't think of his name, but we had the black gangsters there too and they came around and we were telling them what was happening.  "Don't worry about it."  He said, "We'll get, we'll get you out of here right after the game."  They used to drive in there with cars, you know, I Chicago Stadium.  The minute we won that game by about three points, the minute the game was over everybody went down, got in the cars, vroom, right out.  They took us up to Wisconsin.  I said, "What is this?"  Well that was just to get us away from these other people and stayed up there about three days, and I couldn't believe it.  Then we came back to New York and had the big celebration.  And the president at the time, President [Franklin] Roosevelt, had us all down to the White House for dinner and awards.  Grantland Rice said he wanted us to play the All-Stars, Long Island All-Stars Clare B for President Roosevelt's fund, you know, infantile paralysis.  We said "Fine."  You know where they put us Uline Arena (laughter), so life just shows you what's what.  They packed them in; it was great.  But, the next year they decided they were gonna put a team in Washington and this guy, Mike Uline, was gonna put it in there.  I knew it was, you know, our luck had run out as far.  I didn't need any more of no professional basketball team.  And the guy who used to come up and play against my team from the Norfolk Naval Training Station was Red Auerbach, the famous Red Auerbach, and when Mike said I need a coach or something I took Red over there and that's how Red got in to professional sports, I mean professional basketball.  He went over and worked with them.
Story_ID: 55881
Speaker 1: Could you just talk a little bit about that and then we'll go on.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in putting this team together [the Washington Bears] it wasn't, you know, it wasn't that easy, but Sam [Lacey] and I said, Sam with the "Afro" [the Baltimore Afro-American] he said he could he could give it the publicity, but we had to really go out and talk to the guys.  Now, Grumman Aircraft was where a lot of them work and they would be--I would go up and talk to 'em about playing on the weekends on the Sundays.  They'd say yeah, but they couldn't mess with the Grumman schedule 'cause that's how they were being, you know, out of the Army, out of the Service.  And so I went up and Bob Douglas, the Rems had had part Renaissance.  They played at the place called Renaissance Casino, but they weren't doing much.  They had done it the day before, so I went up and I got a guy named John Isaacs who was unbelievable and a guy named Zack Clayton and what I did also was go to Philadelphia.  [Charles] "Tarzan" Cooper who was unbelievable and then Tarzan was the coach and the leader, but I also had a little guy in, everybody loved, you know, the comedy of the things, 'cause sometimes we'd beat a team up so badly that to hold the fans there they would go and do all this, you know, fancy stuff through the legs and everywhere else, like the [Harlem] Globetrotters is doing now, but there were no Globetrotters then, so we had such a variety of ball players, Sidat-Singh, Wilmeth Sidat-Singh.  Sidat Singh was up at Syracuse [University in New York], and he was an All-American.  He came down and told me that he wanted to play with this team.  I said, "You really do?"  He said, "I know John and the guys."  So, I said "sure" and he came.  He was a great ball player.  But, later he was in the Service too.  He had to go in the Service and, but he was killed flying over, where is it, Lake Huron or something.  The plane crashed and I had Joe Louis who was very close to me out to his mother's where we had this big salute to Wilmeth Sidat-Singh, great player.
Speaker 1: What was his ethnic origin, I mean, Wilmeth, was that--the name doesn't sound African American and I wan, I kept wanting to ask, I mean, as I was reading in the book I didn't unders--
Speaker 2: Well, the thing is his mother had remarried and the doctor's name was Sidat-Singh that she remarried with and, and she gave Wilmeth the name, you know, said they changed his name to what the husband's was.
Speaker 1: Was he East Indian or something?
Speaker 2: Huh.
Speaker 1: Was, was the husband, the new husband's name, was he East Indian?
Speaker 2: Indian.
Speaker 1: He was okay--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --okay, 'cause I didn't, okay.
Speaker 2: No, no he was Indian.
Speaker 1: But he was black.  He was, okay--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.
Story_ID: 55882
Speaker 1: You got out though, I mean, you had this terrific success with this team [the Washington Bears], but why really one did you want out of it?
Speaker 2: I wanted out of it because you could see coming on the horizon it would never had continued on the high basis.  It would be like what the [Harlem] Globetrotters would.  It couldn't do anything else because we needed a city.  We had Washington [D.C.], the capitol.  Now, the next year after we won that world's championship [in 1943] the guy, Mike Uline, decided he was going to take the Washington franchise and we would have been out of it.  So, we went out in a blaze of glory rather than try to get another location because they wouldn't have given it to us.
Speaker 1: Okay, and it was around this time also that people start, the white teams were starting to recruit, you know, black--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but really more baseball at that time, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, 'cause weren't you instrumental or did you play a role with Satchel Paige getting, no--you talked a lot about Bill Veeck and you, Veeck, Veeck, Veeck.  It is Veeck.
Speaker 2: Bill Veeck, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, Bill Veeck and the Cleveland Indians and you ta, and will you talk about him because you have positive things to say about him.
Speaker 2: He was such a wonderful guy.  He used to call me, in fact he would come into Washington and we were still doing things at Griffith Stadium with the baseball, and Bill Veeck he was, he was really a go-getter.  He brought in several black ball players.  What was the first?  The first black guy in the American League [Larry Doby]?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Was it Larry Doby?
Speaker 2: Satchel Paige.
Speaker 1: No, he brought in Satchel afterward.
Story_ID: 55883
Speaker 1: Yeah, they wanted me to come to a couple of the ball games and record a broadcast so that they would evaluate that they were ready.  Some of the people there said they weren't ready to hire a black in the sports yet, so I came in and I would sit in the stand and do a recording of the deal and Jacob Ruppert was all excited.  The Yankees were ready and all.  Anyway, they came through the sponsor, the beer company, and then the last minute the Yankees said, "No, no we're not ready for a black announcer, but [Roy] Campanella who had been injured in an automobile accident we will use him as the token black and he can do interviews between doubleheaders," so that was their sacrifice, and that that was what they were doing.  Then, the [Brooklyn] Dodgers just before they moved spoke to me about ('cause by then the word had got out I was play-by-play) and they were interested with me going with, what's the guys name?  It's there, their number one announcer.  Anyway, he came and I did, I sat with him during the games and did some play-by-play and they called back and then they sent me this wire confirming that they wanted me to go to training camp with the Dodgers.  That September [1958] the Dodgers moved out to California.  So, I said look, I, I don't, let's forget about this.  But, that's how near you can come.  I can't think of the guy's name.
Speaker 2: Well, we'll remember it.  I don't know, but I didn't find it in the place in the book that you were talking about though.  But, now the other thing is--but that was really your dream to be a sports announcer.  If you ever that was it.
Speaker 1: That was it.
Speaker 2: That was it.
Story_ID: 55884
Speaker 1: Now, what do you think makes a good sports announcer?  You know, I mean what do you think, you know--who did you admire in that whole area and why did you go in--why, why was that your thing 'cause it's all live or?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, because it's the feeling you're into it and especially from a live thing.  I know with Mel Allen, who was with the Yankees, he used to always come to the, when we played the Homestead Grays games and he would always say, you know, "Come on up and I want to give you some insight on things" and, and it, it, you know, that was it.  I loved it.  And I loved doing all the sports, football, basketball, baseball, everything and, but I, I finally said "Oh no this ain't gonna be.  They ain't gonna let no blacks in here."
Speaker 1: The other person you said who also was influential besides Sam Lacey was Wendell Smith of the Pittsburg Courier.  Was he as influential, you know, or help in that whole--
Speaker 2: Wendell Smith.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Wendell Smith was with the Pittsburg Courier--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and Wendell was another one who was very, you know, influential in trying to get black players into the league and both of those guys were both terrific.
Speaker 1: Now, after you said it's not gonna be, this is not gonna happen, was that when you were contacted by Richard Eaton?  Was it--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, and see they all would see a chance, you know, with your popularity they could build 'cause he had no station.  I made up--he got this thing WOOK and I made up things, look to WOOK as your guide and nook and Silver Spring, Maryland and I used to have to up there to broadcast and they had one little room that you could work in.  That's all they had in Silver Spring, and I had to go out there and he didn't want, you know, mix with the people 'cause it really a prejudice town, but I got friendly with everybody.  I used to have little black and white kids with the Harold, Hal Jackson Good Deed Club, and we would take these kids around to different hospitals and different things, so he couldn't understand who I got along so well in Silver Spring, although several times I was stopped coming from Silver Spring back into Washington [D.C.] through Rock Creek Park.  "You know what are you doing here this time of night ain't no blacks supposed to be in this park this time a night."  I said, "What I'm coming from work," but I would get stopped right and left.  They did not want you in Rock.  Washington was a rough place and, but you know Richard Eaton came in and I got him started with a thing and then he, you know, he was looking for cheap labor and I tried to, I did organize the union and he wasn't gonna have that, so I said, "Well okay I'll go somewhere else" and then I found this bankrupt station WBCC in Bethesda, Maryland.  I renamed it WUST, U Street, which was the principal street in Washington for black people.  I put this broadcast down in the Republic Theater.  My guy owned it.  Now don't forget he owned the theater and I would broadcast from the lobby and I gave the race results, which of course was the numbers.  And my folks would tune in.  "Coming up in a minute first race of Tanforan, Tanforan, California [Tanforan Racetrack in San Bruno, California].  I got it coming up."  That means go get your pencil and your paper, so (laughter), get your pencil and your paper 'cause the numbers coming up.  But, anyway in six months we were number one, you know, and they couldn't handle that that well.  Then I had to go back to New York [New York City, New York] to work.
Story_ID: 55885
Speaker 1: But, I wanna ask first of all, you know, there are a couple of things you did I thought when you were at WOOK that I was, it's sort of like and I thought that's really sort of a brilliant move and that was that you, when you, you were making--how much was he paying you, Richard Eaton?  It was like, it was--how much it was a week?  How much?
Speaker 2: It was nothing really.
Speaker 1: No, it was fifty dollars a week.
Speaker 2: Fifty dollars a week.
Speaker 1: Right, plus expenses.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you got, you got a cut from the advertising?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well yeah, if I, when I would bring advertising that was my only hope 'cause he wasn't go pay no money.  And he was a funny guy.  He wore tennis shoes and spats.  This guy would come and, oh he was a character, but what an oddity I'm telling you.  Now, let me see what you're gonna do and get--
Speaker 1: He also wanted you only to play race music, that was the thing.
Speaker 2: Only, that's it.  And people would want to come in, Peggy Lee, Dave Barber, all the people they wanted, they didn't care about black, white, or green.  And from Silver Spring [Maryland] on I found a place on Connecticut and K, Connecticut Avenue.  They didn't even want blacks to shop up there then, and I was able to get this studio up there and I said "Richard I got a place you can move down."  What, I said "Yeah and it's in your budget now as cheap as you are.  We gonna put the station down at Connecticut and K," and we did.  And of course everybody didn't know where it was coming from.  They thought, I guess, it was still out there, but here we had this thing and I remember very well about the fourth or fifth broadcast he was too cheap to put in an air-conditioner, so he had a fan and that's how we kept cool.  Take your coat off with the fan and I like a fool reached up there to get and the fan, where's the thing it's still here, split my finger wide open.  And he don't go, don't go nowhere to get it fixed I'll bring a doctor in.  He didn't want me to leave the radio.  So, they came in and sewed up my finger.  I said oh Lord I got some experience with these people.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you were a one man band there really.
Speaker 2: That's all.
Speaker 1: You were a salesman on air.  And how long were you--you were on--you st--you signed on at what time and signed off at what time?
Speaker 2: Oh, good morning, go in a 5:30 and then would take off about 10, so that's so I could go out and sell time and then come back in and then would use it to, you now, to go off the air.  I would sign on and sign off.  It was a daytime station, oh (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, but what was brilliant though I thought now you, your contracts that you signed with your clients what, what about those 'cause you had, you had, you had some leverage against them because of the type of contracts you signed.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Remember, you said, you signed personal contracts, so if you left explain that.
Speaker 2: You mean with the sponsors?
Speaker 1: With the sponsors.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I signed personal and whenever I would leave they'd go with me.  That was (laughter) and then, oh yeah, oh my goodness what experiences.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I thought that was so, I mean I, anyway I thought that was unique.
Story_ID: 55886
Speaker 1: So you, first you were at WOOK, W-O-O-K [in Silver Spring, Maryland], then you went with WSID.
Speaker 2: In Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Baltimore.  That was him, that was still--was that, was that--it was Richard Eaton, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then Morris Blum he's the one who, who--
Speaker 2: WANN.
Speaker 1: WANN.
Speaker 2: Morris, a good guy and then I brought Hoppy [Adams] in there.  Hoppy was driving a cab.  He was crippled, and I told him I said, "Look you ought to be announcing and I'm gonna take you in and train you" and then I told Morris.  Morris said well, I said, "Well, you know, if you want me," and I had all the sponsors I said "I wanna train Hoppy and give him a job," and it worked out terrifically.  I got his picture in there, but Hoppy was terrific.  It turned out he ended up owning the station.
Speaker 1: Now, you also as part of this whole thing, you know, you're, you're selling sponsors, you're working like around the clock and you also have time or make time to be involved in the community.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And so if you can talk about some of your activities that, you know, the things that you got involved with?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all we always had what we called a "good deed club," and we would get different young people from, you know, the schools to work and try to show them about helping others.  I had tutors who worked with some of the children who had a little difficulty in school and get permission from the parents that they could stay after school and get tutored, and it was such a big thrill.  And then of course it would be collections of toys and clothing at Christmas time.  Now, I remember I guess one time we took care of close to 110 families, you know, with toys and clothing, and we would collect them.  And I would broadcast, you know, from a location.  People drive by and bring toys, clothing, and food, and there was so much community involvement and wasn't just "I'm gonna do this 'cause I'm gonna get this."  You got in the community and it was love of the people, and I think that's what made it great 'cause the people when you needed the support they were there.  All you had to do was say, "Look I need you.  I gotta do so and so and do a big opening," and the people really worked wonderfully, and I've always been that kind of person.  You gotta be involved.  You can't be--I used to tell guys that high-falutin up here if you're not gonna mix with the little people.  You know just don't talk on the radio and go on about your business, be in the community, set up programs for the community, you know.  Washington YMCA I started with, Harlem YMCA.  You get, the YWCA and you get and develop these young people as they go.
Story_ID: 55887
Speaker 1: Now, how was your wife [Julia Hawkins] taking all of this while, while you were busy, you know, running, I mean really, not--(unclear)--that all fell on Debi.  You were no, I mean you had no time.  I'm just saying the schedule was--
Speaker 2: Yeah it was rough.  I had to almost make appointments in order to, you know, to go and do and find things.  So, I said the best thing to do is, you know, get her involved with the charities, and she really got interested in it and was doing it.
Speaker 1: And you--what was about--you, you felt you had would really hit your, your step--, I mean, you know, what you were meant to be, do, even though it was in sports announcing.  Here you are you really elevated in the community, you got to know people, people, you know, you're important to the community, you're doing good, all those things happened at one time and I'm just wondering what did one, one, was there anyone that you were looking at and saying I wanna be like this person or were you really charting territory out here?
Speaker 2: I don't know because I know there were a lot of people that I admired as they, you know, were doing and while I may not have wanted to be exactly like them, you know, I knew that I wanted to try.  I remember Paul Robeson sitting with me and saying "You're an amazing guy."  I said, "What are you talking about?  You are an amazing guy."  I'm the number one person fan of yours and, but I mean people like that who, you know, you never really thought.  Lena Horne was another one that always expressed her appreciation.  I said, "But Lena, you know, you come. If I need somebody to do something, you come, you help me with benefits."  She said, "No it just something you have indoctrinated into the people."  But, you know, I think it all goes back to feeling blessed, you know, after my parents [Eugene Baron Jackson and Laura Rivers Jackson] died.  I, I think of all of the good things that happened to me, so many good things happened.  You know, I worked hard, but at the same time it had to some luck.  See I never got in my head and to this day where it's me, me, me, me, me.  I can work with people.  I can do things for people.  I can accept, but I have never ever felt that I was this great supreme individual, and I have tried to tell other guys that I have brought into the radio thing and on the air not to assume, you know, that you're that great and the world owes you a living because you don't.  And that's why I've seen so many come up and fade because it's "me, me, me" and, but I really always wanted them to look at it like we're all a package.  You share what you have.  And sometimes, you know, the guys get the big head and I've watched them go, fade, and do, but they say but your longevity because we get that back with it; nice to be important, but it's important to be nice, you know.  Always think of where you came from.  I always remember that even today.
Story_ID: 55888
Speaker 1: Now, before we leave Richard Eaton you had, 'cause you said I organized, you organized the union against some, but can you describe that a little bit more in detail?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I brought the union and he couldn't understand that.  He said, "Look I'll make a deal I will pay you, I will work a deal and make sure you, but don't worry about the others."  It was always this thing.  I see "You got four other people now working.  We're 24 hours.  You got people going out.  You, you got to pay 'em money."  "Oh no, I'm not go-" I said, "Well okay," so I organized the union and brought AFTRA [American Federation of Radio and Television Artists].  First time AFTRA had ever been to a black station and I got the guys in and they had to pay 'em a union wage, and that's why I'm, you know, we split up them.  I went to WBCC and made it into, and, and became number one in six months.  But, he never would--he was just a close guy with a dollar.  He just didn't want it.  And the way I had him was I was never at his mercy because while these guys, some of 'em were willing to come in the sponsorship, get all the note at a theater somewhere.  See, I thought you better get out and get that money, get tied up with the people who spend the money and that's why I insisted that I would be a salesman as well as an air personality, and that's what you, you know, don't ever get to the point, and even today I make sure that the people who spend money with us are satisfied and spend some time with 'em and get their idea about how they want to move their product.  And it's, it, it doesn't do any different.  It's just like it was then.  You got to give them that extra attention.
Story_ID: 55889
Speaker 1: Now, also in the spring of 1949 you were contacted by Cal Ehrlich and Merrick again, but this was about a TV pro, a TV program.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I couldn't believed.
Speaker 1: So, can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they said "You know we've got some pretty big sponsors and they wanna talk to you, but I wanted to ask you were you interested in television."  I said, "Television you're kidding."  Said, "Yeah we got these sponsors and [W]TTG, that's the station, the DuMont Television Network is interested in taking the show if you do it.  They're not interested in black personality all the way, but they will take you."  [W]TTG in Washington and in New York.  It was all the DuMont Television Network.  And I said, "But we had to get a gimmick, and the gimmick was we would do it from the Howard Theatre [Washington, D.C.] live.  And once we got there, I mean, you know, I can't believe Peggy Lee, you know, black, white, everybody wanted to be on that show and-- Ella Fitzgerald.  I'm just naming, but it was once a week on Mondays and everybody would go home.  There were that many sets out there, but everybody was home looking at that set, looking at the TV show.  And we did it right from the stage.  I got the pictures.  I did all the commercials and it really worked out nice and then I was called to go back to New York again with Nathan Strauss.  He was working with President [Franklin] Roosevelt and in Washington [D.C.], and he came over and told me he'd like for me to-"how'd you like to go to my station in New York."  I said what.  He said "WMCA I own it, Nathan Strauss."  I said, "Really."  He said, "Yeah and I think you'd be such an asset.  I've been looking and looking for a personality, not a black personality, but and we're not going to be doing no hoopla or whatever."  But, see the thing is I wanted to do heavy rhythm and blues.  You could feel it coming through.  In New York [New York City, New York], you had Willie Bryant on the little station ['Uptown Jubilee' on CBS-TV], you had Bill Cook on a little station ['Stairway to Stardom' on WATV] , and it was just coming through, Alan Freed was coming into New York and Strauss says "I don't want you labeled as a black."  I said what I'm--he said "Hal, Ella Fitzgerald, Mantovani."  He named all this pop stuff.  He said "And your name in that signal."  Oh the signal was- "you'll get the people."  I said, "Yeah, but you need, it's getting hot now, rhythm and blues."  Anyway, he wouldn't let me do it.
Story_ID: 55890
Speaker 1: Was the TV pro, the TV program ['The House that Jack Built'], I mean did you find that it took you, you were very ease, you were able to transition very easily 'cause a lot of radio people not, not necessarily can tran, transition onto TV?
Speaker 2: I know and I ran into a lot of situations with other people who didn't, but I found that I could work it well.  And even though it was remote, it wasn't sitting in the studio doing something I had to go down to do the commercials.  Emerson Radio and Television and you know, and, and it came--you had to do everything, but I think I'm, I was lucky because I tried to relate where people said, "What about the camera?"  I always made sure the camera angles were working as well and did I have a director?  I had somebody they set up that worked with me on it.  They were telling me about always play to the camera no matter what else you're doing.
Story_ID: 55891
Speaker 1: And how many shows did you produce totally?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: How many shows did you produce?
Speaker 2: Oh my God it was on for what year and a half and that's when, you know, I really went back to New York [New York City, New York] and then here I am again I was on WLIB from 3 to 7.  That was at 30th Street, then I'd go up to WMCA which was on, where was it across from Birdland [jazz club], 53rd, and then Morris [Levy] came to me who owned Birdland and he said "Man I want you to work the Birdland Show."  I said "What?"  That's 12 midnight to 6 o'clock in the morning.  Now, I'm on three radio stations every day in New York City.  And you know who used to pull all my records, [Aristoletis] "Telly" Savalas.  Telly and I worked together for two years.  He is so funny.  He didn't want to do nothing.  I said "Telly, you know," and then when they came after him, Hollywood to go out, he said, "Come on Hal" and go.  I said, "You lazy Telly."  You ain't gonna get me out in California and leave me, but he was a wonderful, wonderful guy.  So, here I was on these three radio stations every day and it all worked out very well because, now don't forget I was doing different music on each station.  Birdland was jazz, pop music was the [W]MCA, and the other was rhythm and blues, too much.
Speaker 1: So, what were your, what was your schedule like?
Speaker 2: What, three--
Speaker 1: During, yeah during those, those, those years.  Tell, tell us what--
Speaker 2: Yeah three to seven on WLIB.
Speaker 1: Three to seven in the afternoon?
Speaker 2: Yeah and then with, with 8 to 10 was WMCA, and ABC.  I was on ABC network from 12 midnight to 6, and we worked from the gorgeous studio and people would come in.  Stage Deli would bring all the food and the single was so big, you know we were 53 stations and WABC was so big.  Frank Sinatra used to go down to [Paul] "Skinny" D'Amato's [The 500 Club] in Atlantic City [New Jersey] and you'd be listening down and drive up and coming and going there with you.  All the big names, Milton Berle, just naming, everybody came by the studio and Stage Deli furnished the food, but they would love to go on there and we'd chat and play different music.  Charlie Parker.  The experience with some of them jazz people.  I remember Charlie going--he did the first set and Morris really worked him.  He did four or five sets a night at Birdland, but the jazz people it was the only outlet they could make money.  So, Charlie said "Okay after the first I'mma go for a little walk I'll be back."  The next night he comes in "Hi Hal."  "Charlie, what happened?"  "What do you mean I went for a walk."  I said, "You never came back."  They're weird people.
Story_ID: 55892
Speaker 1: Who were some of your favorite artists and some ones that you thought were, you know, were weird?  Who were your favorite ones?
Speaker 2: Oh God.  Well you know Sarah [Vaughan] was my baby and the guy who married her [George Treadwell].  She used to have buck teeth and bad.  He fixed her up so gorgeous and you also had The Drifters.  And, oh my God don't talk.  [John Birks] "Dizzy" Gillespie was one of my favorites and wait a minute, but [Charlie] Parker, Parker was ooh.  And then [William Clarence] Eckstine, you know, Eckstine worked Birdland [New York City, New York], Billy Eckstine and he had everybody, you know, all the women just falling all over everywhere.  He was singing in the big band.  He had his own big band and he had a lot of big stars in the band.  And then he would just work with the vocals, but gosh everybody.
Speaker 1: Well, [Edward Kennedy] "Duke" Ellington, what about him?  You had occasion to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well Duke, you know, he worked in Birdland and then I hosted several shows with Duke, one at Carnegie Hall [New York City, New York].  He called me in and asked me would I host the show.  He had Ivie Anderson with him.  Who else?  Albert Edward George Windsor Hibbler, Al Hibbler.  I loved Al.  And he worked with Duke and we worked concerts everything.  Ellington was a class guy.  [William James] "Count" Basie was too.  And I worked with Count a lot.  He would come to Birdland with concerts.  See what Morris [Levy] did while the people with Birdland they would put concerts on at Carnegie Hall with the same people and while the people, a lot of people didn't want to go down to Birdland they would go and see the artists at Carnegie Hall.
Speaker 1: So, he had a relationship at both places then.  He was able--'cause for black people to do Carnegie Hall was a big thing.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: So, he was working 'em like slaves at Birdland.
Speaker 2: That's right.  You know who was--I, I was shocked, but she used to always call and then tell me when she is gonna come by, Dorothy Kilgallen, the great, great, great lady and I was telling her I wanted to put this show in Carnegie Hall, Rock and Roll Carnegie Hall.  He said, she said "I'll, I'll work on it, I'll get it."  And she me Carnegie Hall for the first Rock and Roll show.  They were looking for riots, and everything was smooth and wonderful.  It was packed to the doors.  But--
Speaker 1: She also said that she had been looking, you know, had been checking you out for some time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was surprised when she said it.  I said "What?"  She said, "Oh yeah I've been checking you out Jackson."  "But--do you watch my television show?" ['What's My Line?']  I said, "Of course I do, you know she-" wow what experiences.
Story_ID: 55893
Speaker 1: Now, the other thing your wife [Julia Hawkins] came--so you first came, you got recruited, you had already been in New York [New York City, New York] the first time, right and that was with--wait a minute, but you, you moved to New York to go with WLIB, then you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --moved back to Washington [D.C.] and did, did the whole thing with WSUT [sic, WUST].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, and then, but you got recruited back and that's when Nathan Strauss said look this is major here, we've got a major statement--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --you're gonna be, you know, a general market person, you're not just gonna be--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Now you're talking, yeah.
Speaker 1: --race music.  And you wife moves up to, you know, to be part of things also.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: You're living in Harlem [New York City, New York] and, and you know what I thought, I thought it was just--I think around that time, oh you were living, let's see--
Speaker 2: I think--
Speaker 1: You talk about the whole thing, but that was earlier, that's earlier when you were first in New York with Ron Brown [United States Secretary of Commerce Ronald Harmon Brown] and you know you were--(simultaneous)--hotel--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  Ron used to run the errands for me and take my tapes out to Long Island [New York] where the--(unclear)--a lot of the tapes had to go on out there and Ron--his dad, Bill Brown, ran the Hotel Theresa and Ron was the little guy who loved to be around the studio and you know we talk about it later 'cause it was something going on.  He invited me to come to the White House 'cause you know he and the president [President Bill Clinton] was so very close, but it's amazing how you, you know mix and find people like that.  And everybody was at the Hotel Theresa, you know, Joe Louis, everybody.  Everybody stayed there.
Speaker 1: It was a real gathering spot.  It was for entertainers.  Didn't they stay there when they came to Harlem or was it just the Hotel Theresa?
Speaker 2: Yeah, everybody stayed there.
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--okay.
Speaker 2: That was the place.  Even [Fidel] Castro stayed there [in 1960].  Castro came in and stayed at the Hotel Theresa and had chicken bones all over the room, crazy.
Story_ID: 55894
Speaker 1: Around that time when you were at WLIB, we're going back a few years, but when you were there you also did some important live broad-- remotes and one was the funeral of Bill "Bojangles" [Robinson] [in 1949].
Speaker 2: Bojangles funeral.  I had met Bill and been with him on a few shows because at the Lafayette Theatre [Harlem, New York] and, you know, before the Apollo [Theater] was really as big as it was.  I used to come over and do some shows, but at the funeral of Bill Robinson it was, I guess it was--I was surprised everybody thought it was the first time anybody really spent so much time broadcasting and taking from the funeral, but everybody was there, Pearl Bailey, just name 'em.  And I had another experience in addition to the one with Bill Robinson when Haile Selassie came in and he asked me would I go with him up to President [Franklin] Roosevelt's grave, and we did a radio show on the way up there.  But, he was the "Lion of Judah."  That was a great experience, great.
Speaker 1: You said he was a very imposing, small man, but very imposing man.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah he was a small guy, but ooh good.
Story_ID: 55895
Speaker 1: We just recently interviewed [HM] Rose Morgan and, you know, you had stated in your book how she really, you introduced a wife and she sort of introduced you around Harlem [New York City, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know Rose was ooh she was the person, you know, in Harlem not only socially, but every, all the women had to go up there to get their hair done and she and-- was it Joe Louis she was [married to], yeah and, and, but, but she was a character.  I mean, a real wonderful person.  She got involved in everything and if she said "You gonna go up to the hospital tomorrow," said "Yeah I'm gonna be up at 6 o'clock, 7'clock.  I'll be there."  She was always there.  Rose Morgan, she was history, history in Harlem.
Story_ID: 55896
Speaker 1: Now, I just--now the other, the other story I found fascinating and can't let you not tell it and that's about you and the relationship as a sponsor between you and, and Parks Sausage.
Speaker 2: Henry Parks was a guy that I've always admired, handsome, wealthy man from Baltimore, Maryland, and he had this thing called Parks Sausage.  And he said, "You know what do you think of if we can come into New York?"  I said, "Yeah, I'll tell you what you can do.  I think we can put, put the thing at the location at the grocery stores and everywhere else."  We'd have little ladies out there with the sausage.  Let people sample them, then I'd put the mic up there and let them talk about how they love this Parks Sausage.  And he and I got this thing together where we would, a commercial on the radio, and some people said "Oh no they, they'll turn away from that," but it was a kind of commercial that I don't know if you hated, liked it, what, but everybody was drawn to it.  "More Parks Sausages mom" this little kid would say, but he turned out.  He took New York [New York City, New York] by storm, and he didn't want to go on anywhere unless I was doing it.  I had to do all the things for him.  But, he was a class guy, Henry Parks.
Story_ID: 55897
Speaker 1: Now, you-so you're, you're really, you're getting involved in New York [New York City, New York] , you know, you are, you actually are very produ, you're doing these three shows and how long does that last that you do the three shows?
Speaker 2: Oh Lord, was it two years, three years, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then what happens at that point?  Are you, do you let--let's see--'cause you also, but this is what I'm trying--you also then started at--you were hosting a Sunday morning children's show called Hal, Uncle Hal's Kids Show [sic, Uncle Hal's Kiddie Show].
Speaker 2: Oh my Lord, Hal, "The Kiddies Pal."  I was, in addition to the three shows, I was doing this tele first every Sunday morning, you're right.  Leslie Uggams got started there, Hines, the two brothers, little guys, and "Uncle Hal, The Kiddies Pal."  That's what that--I forgot about that, oh yeah.  That was a great big wonderful television show.
Story_ID: 55898
Speaker 1: So, okay (laughter), but I can't, you know what they say Tom Joyner is the hardest working man of radio.  You, he has nothing on you, but anyway let's go on you gonna do TV, okay, I mean, but really.  But, so in 1955 you decided to return to WLIB.  What are the circumstances behind that?  I mean not ret, no, you had, no not, yes you had been at WLIB before and the, right.
Speaker 2: Well, I think was that when Percy [Sutton] came in?
Speaker 1: No, that wasn't.  This is 1955.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, [Harry] Novik wanted me and wanted to make the right deal that I cut, you know, bring the sponsors to him.
Speaker 1: Because you were getting, wait a minute, were you getting--you had a deal--they paid you 300 dollars a week, which is a much bigger than the 50 dollars a week.
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter).
Speaker 1: But, you didn't get as much of a cut of the advertising revenue, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they had their own ad sales department, though you worked.  What you brought in you got also some?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I also got a percentage of the, you know, advertising.  And when I went back to LIB who, who Harry Novik I think was owning it then and that's when Percy [Sutton] was then [Manhattan] Borough President, and he was saying you're always working for everybody else you need to work for yourself.  Novik had to get out of Harlem 'cause he had mistreated the black people so much, but I said, "Look I'll get some people together make a deal.  He would, he said I can't ever sell my station to an employee."  I said, "You know, far be it from me," but he would sell it to Percy 'cause he was the Borough President.  Percy didn't have any money, so I got enough things for him to do it and he was gonna make a deal with Percy.  So, we got him to meet him.
Story_ID: 55899
Speaker 1: And I had taken four busloads of people down to Washington [D.C.].  Nobody believed in FM.  I believed in it.  I knew FM was gonna be big, and I took--they were giving it away.  Down--that's how Howard University [Washington, D.C.] got its station.  [Howard University President] Mordecai Johnson, I was working as always with Howard University with everything and the lady, you know, who owned the "Washington Post", I can't think of her name now [Katharine Graham], anyway she said, I spoke to her about it, she said, "I don't want no FM, but I'll give it to you if you wanna give it to somebody, but I need the tax write-off from it."  So, I went to Mordecai Johnson and I told him, I said, "Listen this is your chance to get a radio station for the university.  I'll take you up and introduce for you and if you give her the tax write-off she's gonna give you the radio station, WTOP."  So, he said, "Really?"  I took him up, they worked a deal out.  She got the tax write-off and Howard University got the station.  That's when we named it WHUR [December 6, 1971].  That's how they got that station.  But, Mordecai was always a, you know, terrific president and I was just thrilled to do it for Howard.
Story_ID: 55900
Speaker 1: And you also during that time you got very involved in the Civil Rights Movement, right?  It's around the same time, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, and radio was very important, but people don't realize played extremely important--
Speaker 2: Very important part, getting people together, letting other people know what you're working on in the community groups or you know the religious groups.  It kept it going.  And one person I loved to death, [United States Representative] Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.].  I was in Washington when he was, you know, in Congress and they didn't allow any blacks to get in the restaurants, but he was a congressman, so it didn't bother him.  And Adam would love to pull up in his car, pick me up, and we'd go to these restaurants and oh he was sharp.  But, the thing that I feel bad about he never got the credit he deserved in Congress.  He passed more bills.  He got more things done while he was head of the education and labor committee.  Adam Powell was just unbelievable.  But, as you said there was a tie there with the community with the groups and one thing Adam was always there, always.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite Adam Clayton Powell story?
Speaker 2: Oh Lord, where was I.  I think, I don't know, I was always around with him with Hazel, you know, when (laughter)--he would always want me to go with him to sit and watch Hazel and then I'd leave, you know, going, but [Powell's second wife and musician] Hazel Scott-- and I looked I said, "Man you gone, huh."  "Well, I like her a little bit," but then I found out and his wife [Isabel Washington] accused me of making it easy for him to get there.  I said, "No Mrs. Powell, no, no."  "Yes, it is you are the one because you are always with him when he would go down to hear Hazel play or be around."  I said, "Lord have mercy.  I'm getting credit for this."

Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, also can you talk about the, you know, meeting Malcolm X and also Cassius Clay, Muhammad Ali.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know it's amazing I was--we always used to eat lunch at a place called "22 West" on 135th Street, and Malcolm and I, you know, would talk and do and talk the Muslim theory, and he was saying "Yeah brother Hal you gotta learn more and more about it."  He said, "I got a guy coming in town.  He wants to be a Muslim.  He's a fighter.  He's got a bus.  He drives his bus from Covington, Kentucky."  I said really.  He said, "Yeah his name is Cassius Clay."  So, I said--he said I haven't met him yet, but he wants to meet me 'cause he want to be a Muslim.  Let's all have lunch and dinner.  And I love (laughter)--Cassius Clay was the funniest thing you ever saw.  He was always be, you know, but very respectful of Malcolm.  And he said, "I really want to be a Muslim and I wanna know if you would take me in and, you know, school me" and I said "Cassius this is the man for you.  You need to really be around."  I was still writing sports and all, but he took to Malcolm and he, you know, followed through to be a good Muslim.  And, well Ma, Malcolm when we were--Harlem Hospital was being built, and I was with the people trying to get jobs.  Oh boy it was hard.  They didn't want to hire any blacks, not in the building of Harlem Hospital.  So, we decided this next week we were gonna lay down in front of the bulldozers, you know, to get attention.  And, and I said, "Malcolm we're going out in front of the bulldozers."  He said, "you are," he said "Yeah," he said, "Well I'll be across the street at the church looking at you.  I don't believe in nonviolence."  He said, "But if they make a move on you, on the, they'll be five you laying out there for the bulldozers to stop them from getting Harlem Hospital I will take care of this."  I said, "Oh my God."  Anyway, they didn't and they started hiring and doing more from there.  But, Malcolm was such a great guy, and Betty Shabazz, his wife, she and I are very close.  She was one of the original people that came in with WLIB and so forth.  And I was with him, was it the evening before.  He said he felt trouble and that he'd been warned that they said they were gonna get him.  And he said "I don't know who or what or where," but that's when they set the fire to his house and I called Betty and I said, "Betty it's on the news about, you know, the house."  She says, "It's burning, burning down terrible I got the children and I'm gonna get 'em out of here," but they had set the house on fire and things were really bad, but Betty was a good, very good woman.  And it's too bad the way she died too, you know, his grandchild [Malcolm Latif Shabazz set fire to Betty Shabazz's apartment in 1997].  But, Malcolm, now you felt when you're around him there's just an aura.
Story_ID: 55902
Speaker 1: When they called me in with that payola crap and all he [Malcolm X] was there and they had rallies and everything telling [Harry] Novik, but Novik saw a chance of getting rid of me to get some cheap labor (Jack Walker or somebody who agreed to work cheap), so he had the district attorney call me in with Alan Freed, you know, all of them they were making millions or whatever, to investigate payola.  I said, "I never took a dime to play a record in my life.  I made my money legitimately.  I don't understand what you're saying."  So, the district attorney called and Novik said well I wanna suspend him until he clears it up.  He was just trying to get somebody in cheap to work in my place.  I had all the sponsors.  They were all lined up and sold out.  So, he brought this guy, Jack Walker, in and that's when they had all the rallies, you know, Reverend [David] Licorice, "No Hal Jackson, no LIB, turn your radios off."  And I had to fight that thing pretty bad, and for awhile, you know, I had my family to take care of and one of the guys came to me and said "Look, you know, I don't know if you wanna do it I own a couple of buildings and I have a crew, but I'll give you a job if you'd like to help clean the buildings and so."  I said, "Sure, everything while I'm fighting this case."  Anyway, it finally ended up they didn't want to give me a trial.  Freed pleaded guilty, [Peter] Tripp, all those people, and Tommy Smalls I was sorry to see him lose, "Doctor Jive," but they had all this proof.  I wasn't interested in taking no money to play no records.  So, anyway when it finally got to trial I walked in there and the district attorney says "I just wanted to let you know I'm dropping the case against you and we're dismissing it."  I said, "No, no, no you ain't gonna dismiss it.  I've lost all my income, my money for all this time.  I'm gonna sue the city."  So, he made a big thing.  He said, "You gonna do what?"  I said, "I'm gonna sue the city.  You called me in on something, you accused me."  "You can't sue the city."  We, you check, ask your lawyer, you can't sue.  Anyway, that broke away and I said to myself "How in the heck did I get into this," but this was it I guess when you're up there and you're big they all do little things to try to chop you down.
Story_ID: 55903
Speaker 1: Another guy named Peter Tripp.  Now remember they, you know, and then Alan [Freed] had this dance show in New York [New York City, New York] and that's where Jocko [DJ Douglas "Jocko" Henderson], I brought Jocko to New York and I got Jocko in with this dance theater and I told [Frank] Schiffman at the Apollo [Theater] "I got a guy if you bring him in here he's gonna pack the Apollo.  He has never been to New York," and I got Morris [S.] Novik who owned another station to put Jocko on, and Jocko was terrific.  He had the dance theater, "eee-tiddlee-yock, this is the Jock back on the scene with the record machine, time right now 5:15."  He was great.  He was in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and he was, you know, he didn't come to New York, he'd send the tape up to New York.  He was making so much money.  But, he was doing it--but see Jock had told me that when these people would come to him they knew he could break records and I mean thousands of records they would sell.  He went by this place where all the millionaires, I forgot the name of the stores in Philly and all.  They have these houses.  Jock got a house there and they were paying for it.  Jock would get one company (laughter) "What do you wanna do, oh you wanna pay for the, the concrete to be paved, okay," so and so, and he would put, he'd say, when I looked Jock had this fabulous house.  Jock died [in 2000], but he was something big.
Story_ID: 55904
Speaker 1: Now, describe the whole payola, I mean, what was actually--do you--was it the record companies that the government started investigating and then they turned on the DJs.  How did it even hap, I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, it, you know, you kept hearing, you know, little mumblings about "there gonna be a big break in payola" and I said, "What are you talking about?"  He--well, we got names, somebody was telling me that this lawyer said, "We got names and people and the story is gonna break in two days."  And when I woke up the next morning it was all over television from, but I got insulted they didn't put me on the front page of the paper like everybody else.  Anyway, they said, you know, it was so big the black guys were little guys.  Alan Freed they had, you know, thousands and thousands--I had no idea record companies were paying that kind of money to people 'cause they would buy time on my station.  But, see they'd give Freed and the others the cash and work from there.  But, it was huge.  It was jobs going, people going, and exposure and it, it, ooh it was a mess.
Speaker 1: So now Alan Freed just real quickly he--describe how you first met him and what, you know, in the term ["rock and roll"] that he's known for also how--
Speaker 2: Well, he--Alan was in Cleveland [Ohio] and he was on tape in WNJR, and he came in after, you know, playing the tapes for like a couple of months.  He put on a show in the Newark Armory and he had 14,000 people.  Never been in New York, but the people came to see him.  And from then on Morris grabbed him, Morris Levy, who owned Birdland, and signed him up and from there on in he would go into the Paramount [Theatre in Times Square, New York City] and other places.  They wouldn't let a black disc jockey rent it.  They would not under no circum--I tried to rent it a few, but Morris could get it and he put Alan in there and in the meantime Jocko [DJ Douglas "Jocko" Henderson] came up.  He got the, the dance show as well.  And, but what's his name, Dick Clark, Dick was making sure that Freed didn't get too big.  But, Dick Clark had everything.  The congressman called him in and asked him to testify.  "Don't you do that anymore he told 'em, and give me an autograph for my kids."  This was what happened with Dick Clark.  Dick Clark was a bigger payola guy than anybody, but he got to the congressman and they loved him.  So, but anyway it finished Alan off.  That's what they wanted to do and Dick wanted him out of it.  He was too much competition.  But, the thing that I loved about Alan Freed--now I was on WMCA when he first came and oh Lord here I am playing all this Sweet Ella [Ella Fitzgerald], Mantovani, Peggy Lee, and Alan Freed was getting down with it, "hatidi, di ta di" I said "Oh Lord" see there and they wouldn't let me play nothing.  Told me that that would, I could not play rhythm and blues.  So, all the people that knew me knew I had to go to MJR who, I mean [W]LIB, signal was weak in Harlem [New York City, New York] and you couldn't even hear it in Harlem.  You could hear out in Brooklyn [New York City, New York] somewhere, so I said you know, what, what, what am I gonna do with this station? Nothing he said.  So anyway it ended up with Alan taking all of this, but you could feel New York was ready for it.  The black guys on the air were on little stations, so when he came on WINS, boom, it just took off.  But the thing I like about him, up to that time black performers could not really get a break in the big shows downtown.  He brought out [HM] Dionne Warwick, he, you know, all of the people that really, he really gave 'em an awful lot of breaks and got them started, you know, in the big time 'cause Dionne couldn't get nothing before then.
Story_ID: 55905
Speaker 1: And then what happened with me.  Oh, Mrs. Rosenthal [Gladys Shelley]--I was up in a placed called Freedomland [Freedomland U.S.A. in the Bronx, New York] and that was where they'd have entertainment on the weekend.  And she came to me and said, "How would you like to go to Palisades [Palisades Amusement Park in Cliffside Park-Fort Lee, New Jersey] ?"  Well you knew bigotry, everything else was--.  I said "What?"  She says, "My husband [Irving Rosenthal] and I like to have you over there."  I said you said, "Cousin Brucie's [Bruce Morrow] there, and he don't want anybody else there.  But we own that park.  He don't own it."  So, I said, "Well let's see what goes on.  And see here's what we'll do."  They had my name all over television, radio.  They really, they really advertised, and I would, you know, go in there on Sundays and bring all these diff--everybody wanted to go on there. Mick Jagger came to me, you know, Rolling Stones, everybody to go at Palisades and be thousands, as much as eight to ten thousand people would be out there on a Sunday.  And I said, "Woo it really did," and I could take this stuff wherever I wanted to, the radio stations.
Story_ID: 55906
Speaker 1: Now I want to ask you just go back a little bit just to finish off the payola.  When that happened and you, you know, had to take a job, you know, cleaning buildings--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and driving a taxi to support your family, that was a down period and I keep thinking about, you know, the time that you know your sister [Esyelee Jackson] absconded with all that money, but you were too young to sort of realize, but that was even a difficult period, but here you've attained such prominence so, you're so visible, and you don't have--did you tr, you tried suing the government, right or you, you just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, no I tried suing them.
Speaker 1: Suing, but it didn't work?
Speaker 2: Didn't work.
Speaker 1: So, here you are, you, you know, they've hurt your name, you've been let go of charges, but all of the damage really has been done.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, what are--were--what happens 'cause sometimes at difficult times in our life, you know, we have to reach deep inside ourselves and I'm just wondering what that whole process was like?
Speaker 2: Well, it was so down that I didn't know where to go, but I had befriended Jocko [DJ Douglas "Jocko" Henderson] and all the others and they'd called me and say, "You wanna work in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?"  So, I said--he said no we spoke to the owner.  Jocko, Georgie Woods, they were something in Philadelphia.  And they said, "We want you down there.  Would you go down there" and I had to, you know, commute down there.  So, I said "Yeah I'll go" and by then things were kind of, you know, getting back on its feet.  Now, when I went down to Philadelphia they had Georgie and Jocko, the rhythm and a guy named [Ulysses] Kae Williams did the blues.  Said, "You know what I want?" he said, "we got an FM" (people didn't believe in FM), he said, "and I want you to do some classical music."  I said "What?"  [w]QXR, which is the New York Times station.  They owned WQXR.  We want to originate the four hours from Philly, but we think you are the one to do the classical music.  I ain't never done classical music, but anyway I started checking and reading and making the pronunciations of the classical [Johannes] Brahms and oh don't go with it, and I took that job.  And I would do the first four hours all classical music and it was on the QXR network, about 60 stations.  Here I am again and I would do that from 6 to 10 and at 10 I would slide over to the AM and do rhythm and blues.  So, 6 to 10 and then 10 to 2 I would do the rhythm and blues.  But, it, it was a great, great experience for me and QXR and everybody else was very happy with it.  But, it gave me, you know, the outlet to get back and by then with things cooling down in New York WWRL [Egmont] Sonderling called me and asked me would I come and set up a radio station, hire the people and so forth.  I said, "What? I don't want that responsibility.  No, no I need somebody like you to set it up."  So, he bought the station [in 1964] and then I brought the disc jockeys, you know, in there and then I was doing Palisades [Palisades Amusement Park in Cliffside Park-Fort Lee, New Jersey], oh, it never stop it just one thing brings on another.
Story_ID: 55907
Speaker 1: But doing Palisades [Palisades Amusement Park in Cliffside Park-Fort Lee, New Jersey] brought you back up?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Doing the Palisades, Palisades Amusement Park really got you back up--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that that's what really brought because page ads in the newspapers, oh, don't talk about it.  You're all over radio and television and he made them--oh and then at Palisades in New York you could see the big blow-ups as you look across and they always kept me all over that.  It was a real big experience, and then again we were, I was able, all the acts came to me.  They wanted to be seen with Palisades.
Speaker 1: So, who were some of the acts you featured there?
Speaker 2: Mick Jagger, the Rolling Stones.  Well naturally all of [HM] Berry Gordy's acts, the Supremes, Four Tops, [HM] Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, just name it.  And they were calling me, all the managers, about, you know, bringing the acts in.  [HM] Dionne Warwick, oh Lesley Gore, just name 'em.
Story_ID: 55908
Speaker 1: Now, did you-- with [HM] Berry Gordy.  Can you talk about how, how you first met him?
Speaker 2: Yep.  Berry Gordy used to write songs and he would come out to the radio station.  I was way out the transmitter and he would bring the records in, Jackie Wilson and other people that he wrote songs for.  And whatever the records were we'd play 'em and see, and one day he came to me he said, "You know you don't make no money on song writer.  He said you got to wait forever for your money and all that.  I'm going to my family, we have a foundation, and see if they'll lend me the money."  I said, "What are you gonna do Berry?  I'm gonna start my own record company [Motown Records]."  I said, "You're kidding."  He said, "No.  I got an idea and if they'll come up with the first money I'll get the rest.  I got three buildings in Detroit [Michigan], old beat up buildings."  He was gonna fix 'em up and leave it open 24 hours a day and anybody who had talent could come in and record and let him hear it and if they could go on his label.  Everybody, of course, you know, did it.  The Supremes and all of 'em and those who didn't work there worked in the office.  And it really, really took off.  And I used to go out once a week like, not, not a week, but once every three weeks, and he would have all the new recordings and he would say with his promotion people, "Listen to this and see if you like it, it's gonna be a hit boom, boom, boom."  And he was very organized.  This man--and the thing I like about it, everything was first class.  He had choreographers, you know, for the dancing of The Supremes and The Four Tops, the--it, it, it was just unbelievable, well you know how he developed.  So, anyway he once he called me and told me that Detroit had gotten him kind of bugged in.  He said, "I got to get out to California."  I said, "What?"  He said, "I got put some of these people on television and have some more exposure."  He says, "They're closing in on me" and when I looked he had gone out, he went out and bought, bought a whole studio and did everything and as you know they took off out there, Motown was there.  But, Berry was always there even you see from anniversary, 60th, he was right there.  And he was always supportive.  And the thing I like about him was-- anybody that had difficulties, you know, you could go to him and he took care of 'em.
Story_ID: 55909
Speaker 1: Now, just I wanna talk just real quickly about more of your work with the Civil Rights Movement before we go and talk about the Miss Black Tee, Teen America and also Talent Teens International.  But, with you a couple of things you, you became very involved with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], right, SC, S, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And also involved with working with [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], but you worked with the Selma [to] Montgomery [March in 1965].  I think you were saying that you had worked with, with that march.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, well the thing is I, I have always been involved, you know.  I'm telling you now about the commercial side of it, but no matter where I was working I always made it a point to be involved with the things that were going on in the community and around the country helping blacks to move out.  I never ever lost that touch, and in order to get these organizations going on promotions they had to have advertising, you know what I mean, exposure.  So, SCLC was, you now, basically one of the backbones and then as I told you with Dr. King how I created the thing to make his birthday a national holiday.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: About the holiday thing I told you?  Yeah, he had always--I used to meet with him at Harry's [Harry Belafonte] house.  He would stay down there and- Belafonte, Harry worked very hard with Dr. King, and Sidney [Poitier]  did too.  And I said to Martin one evening he would get out there on the limb and promise and we would have to go out and help him get the money because he just, you know, he was a preacher.  He didn't, he wasn't a fund raiser.  And we would get people to go behind and raise the money that he needed.  And when we were with the SCLC it was always [Ralph] Abernathy and, you know, his whole group, [HM Rev.] Wyatt Tee Walker and well [HM] Jesse [Jackson] was more like hanging on.  He wasn't really, he was just grabbing the publicity where he could.  It's a fact, it's true.  And, but Martin as I told you was into it and that's why when I was doing that benefit and he told me--I remember just before he left going down to Memphis [Tennessee] to work with the garbage men, the sanitation men and he said "Well brother Hal I don't know if I'll be back this way again."  "What are you talking about?"  "No it's a rough situation I'm in.  You gotta go right into it."  So, I said, "Martin we're going over here and raise this money this week" and we were sitting there going into Newark [New Jersey] and the little girl was sitting on the curb and she was crying, and he said, "You know I don't know why you're crying, you're black and your beautiful."  That was the first time I'd ever, ever heard it and from there, you know, we kept on talking about the black and beautiful thing with Martin.  And then, well you know he left for Memphis and as I told you I came up with this idea of raising this money this night.  We had 3,000 people in Newark, New Jersey, I'm still living in Harlem [New York City, New York] coming backward and forward, and he said anyway the little girl came up from the bathroom and said "Mr. Jackson Dr. King has been shot."  I said, "What, oh my goodness don't say anything about it just be quiet, let me know."  She came back later before night was over and said "Mr. Jackson Dr. King has died.  You told me not to say anything."  I said, "No."  So, I went on stage and I started telling the people "I have something to tell you, but I need your cooperation, your help.  You're here tonight to raise money for Dr. King.  As you know, the money's needed, but we have an unfortunate thing.  Dr. King has died."  And oh, oh the people.  I said, "That's what they want you to do.  They want you to go out here and raise a lot of cain, get locked up.  That isn't what Dr. King would want us to do.  I want you--I'm gonna go out ahead of you and I'm gonna take you to the buses and the subways, but we're gonna show these people out there, all those cops, that we love Dr. King and he's for nonviolence."
Story_ID: 55910
Speaker 1: We went out and now all of the other people cooperated, the parents and all, and got over and on the way back over the bridge coming over George Washington Bridge I said, I said "Gee you know it's great everybody have birthdays like George Washington, everybody else.  We need one for Dr. Martin Luther King.  He's just as important to us as George Washington," and the next morning I started on the air to ask people to send letters and signatures to make Dr. King's birthday a national holiday and starting at six in the morning.  Then I called Shirley Chisholm about 10 o'clock, and I says "If I bring these signatures to you to make Dr. King's birthday a national holiday will you and [HM] John Conyers introduce the bill?" and said we will.  So, then I started working on everybody.  The Soul Show, television, the other radio shows.  I had people going into the universities and colleges and just getting signatures.  Anyway, after about three months we had the six million signatures, four trucks, took it down, and--where I got, I got all those pictures in all, of Shirley going through the thing with John Conyers.  They introduced the bill to the committee, but they threw it out.  They weren't gonna have anyone with, you know, no birthday like that.  But, that was the beginning and of course we kept nipping at it, hipping at it, and finally fourteen years later when Stevie Wonder who had the visibility could go up there and do it.  But, Martin was terrific and, and you know you look at the other people, Wyatt Tee Walker, people like that who were in the background, but worked just as hard and was just as influential, Abernathy.  You know, you, you see the wonderful work the Civil Rights Movement was really on its way.  Many sacrifices that people made in order to keep it out there.
Speaker 2: And many people.
Speaker 1: Yep, many, many people.
Speaker 2: People--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It was no one-man dance.
Speaker 2: That you think of--now it's thought of as a one-man dance, but it was many people.
Speaker 1: Many, many people.
Story_ID: 55911
Speaker 1: Now, with, with--so really in the '60's [1960s] still you, you decide 'cause you, you've been doing promotion of, you know, you've been doing concerts and things like that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and then you decide that, well you actually host the Miss Black America Pageant.
Speaker 2: Miss Black America.  They had at Madison Square Garden--I was doing community relations for Madison Square Garden and the guy who was running it a real wonderful liberal guy.  I used to have an office up there and would bring everything we want.  And Joe Morris Anderson [sic. J. Morris Anderson] who had the Miss Black America, I said "You know maybe you can put this thing on a bigger basis than you are.  It's such a small thing.  Let me go to the head of the Garden and see if he will give you a date to put it in the Madison Square Garden."  I went up and talked to him, J. Morris Anderson.  I brought J. into talk to him and they talked about how they would round up the right people to support these girls that were coming in, Miss Black America, and we got it going and [HM] Berry Gordy called me and said, "Look Hal I heard about the Miss Black America thing you're hosting it."  I said, "Yeah J. Morris wants me to host the thing and it's gonna be in the Garden."  He said, "Well look three days ago I signed a group from Indiana and I think they're the great things I've ever seen.  You've never heard me act excited like this have you?"  I said, "No they must really be something."  He said, "I'm telling you the Jackson's I'm gonna if you give them one song I'll bring 'em in there, they'll come in on a bus and give 'em a chance to be on that show."  And so they came in on the bus, Michael [Jackson], everybody jumping around.  He, he, you know, he never keep still and he was a little thing running all over everywhere.  They were in the Felt Forum, that's another part of Madison Square Garden, and they came in there riding all night on the bus and sitting down there with pillows sleeping on the, in the Felt Forum 'cause he had to be there for rehearsal and everything else and finally they, we got 'em on the show.  It was the first appearance of the Jackson Five [August 1969], and they tore that show up.  It was really, really great.
Story_ID: 55912
Speaker 1: And everybody was saying--now I was going around in the schools telling these kids to stay in school and study and I said, "But we don't have anything like Miss Teenage America or you know why can't we, we have talent."  I said, "Oh Lord."  So anyway I started this thing as an incentive to keep these kids occupied, Miss Black Teenage America, and then I started having the little white girls were coming and complaining that they couldn't joint Miss Black Teenage America.  I said "Oh Lord."  And then the little black girls would being their white friends and said why we--so I said well what else can we do?  Well we renamed it Miss Talented Teen and in that area everybody could come in from around the country and around the world, but that's how, you know, it got started years and years and years.  And so many have come in and gone through it.
Story_ID: 55913
Speaker 1: Now you were saying that you know you changed then to 'Hal Jackson-' ['Hal Jackson's Talented Teens International'] 'cause people, little girls were bringing their friends and they're saying, you know, can't we be in, you know, be in it as well, so you changed it to Talent Teens International and that's back--you had your first what was Black, Miss Black Teen America in 1971.
Speaker 2: That was down in [Atlanta] Georgia.  It was on television from there and let me see who was the mayor then, you know, a heavy--(unclear)--.
Speaker 1: Black guy?
Speaker 2: Maynard Jackson.
Speaker 1: Maynard Jackson in 1971?  He was mayor in 1971?
Speaker 2: When was he mayor [1974-1982]?
Speaker 1: But you mean--wasn't he--no-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Mid '70's [1970s]
Speaker 1: Maybe, but maybe you to, do you--
Speaker 2: We got all the pictures with Maynard.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so Maynard was, he was the mayor, okay. [sic, Sam Massell was Mayor of Atlanta in 1971]
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Why did you choose Georgia, Atlanta, then?
Speaker 2: Bec, because we were trying to get television and it was a big problem trying to work it through New York [New York City, New York], and Maynard said I can get it if you come down here and do the show.  So, we did it from Atlanta.
Story_ID: 55914
Speaker 1: Now talk about some of the, the young people whose names we know now that came through and participated in that, you know in the, in the Teens International ['Hal Jackson's Talented Teens International']?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, ooh wow where do I start?  One of my little angels just passed away [Michelle Thomas].  She was in the series with Bill Cosby ['The Cosby Show'].  She was Malcolm's [Malcolm-Jamal Warner] girlfriend.  Bill Cosby's so called son.  Oh Lord, Deborah's got it.  We got all the pictures, sweet little thing.  But, she, she had cancer, but she was so good, big eyes, gorgeous.  She was my winner when I went--were did we do it in Virgin Islands [sic, Montego Bay, Jamaica in 1985] and she was the winner there.  That's when I brought in, oh Lord what's the singing group, you know, they all wanted to be on the show, so I brought them in there to kick it off.  I can't think of the name.  Buzzy Willard and all of them, Buzzy and all the gang.
Speaker 1: But you also had Jada Pinkett.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, God, Jada.
Speaker 1: L.L. Cool J you were saying was one of the talent.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was so much of the 'cause the talents all wanted to, you know, be on that show; it was such a big thing.
Speaker 1: So now, is the, is it still going on tour?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: The, the Teen Talent Tour.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, 31 years we celebrated last year.
Speaker 1: So now, where are you, are you, are, is it based out, are you doing it out of New York now?
Speaker 2: We're doing out of New York, but we still go.  We went down to the [U.S] Virgin Islands.  We took oh about three or four years ago.  We, I'm trying to think we right here we usually have something big at the supper club honoring the teenagers before and the scholarships because we give scholarships and giving scholarships right along.  You gotta do it.
Story_ID: 55915
Speaker 1: So, the other thing that happened in '71' [1971] was the whole start of this entity here, Inner City Broadcasting [Corporation], and can you talk about how that, that, that came about?
Speaker 2: Yeah well, I think I mentioned to you before [Harry] Novik was in trouble.  He had to get out of Harlem [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: Can I ask you a--did Novik ever apologize to you [for payola accusations]?
Speaker 2: Never, never, and when I, you know, I say I'm gonna sue you, you know, well that's when, you know, he was kind of shook up and he told Percy [Sutton] "I'll sell the station to you, but not Hal Jackson."  And he said, "I don't want any employee involved."  I said, "I'm no employee of yours" because when I was with him the last time I had my own sponsors, so I was an independent contractor.  I never, I wasn't working for him.  But, anyway when Percy was getting him down I think I told you I took four busloads of people to Washington [D.C.].  They were giving FMs out and I wanted to have a station, just public service, for the people of New York [New York City, New York], you know the FM.  And they granted it to us.  And we came back and the minute they go the license, Harry Novik made it commercial because he still had the name owning WLIB.  But, what he wanted to do, see FM was 24 hours, he was selling Percy the AM, which was a daytime station.  In other words, he was gonna wait to we go off at 5:30, 6:00 and take and he would have wiped us out in two or three weeks.  So, anyway I--Percy called me about 10:00 at night.  He said, "He didn't want to give me the option."  I said, "You don't want LIB unless you get the option for WLIB-FM" because he had already moved the station downtown and, you know, and was gonna go and wipe up out.  So anyway, he finally got him down with the option.  We had to have an option to buy the FM.  We didn't have all that money and he gave him the option and what we would do is (laughter) everybody got paid, but you didn't get paid 'til 3:00 Friday that's so, you know, we could get the money in the bank by Monday.  But, thank God no checks ever bounced.  And we (laughter)--it was just tough slanting, but we hung in there and Percy and a few other people just, you know, came along.  But, and then I would go out--I never thought I'd get this and go off and find other stations that we would get and out on the West Coast we had KGFJ [in Los Angeles, California] and we had an FM that I found and the minute it got up Percy sold it to Gene Autry.  Percy was always-- and you know still that way.  So, I don't know exactly--you know we bought and we sold San Antonio [Texas].  We got New York and then now going out [HM Charles] Charlie Warfield working on taking the station public, taking Inner City public, so we go in and we bought about eight or ten more stations now in Columbia, South Carolina.  We got KBLX San Francisco [California], you know, and around, so they're building back up.
Speaker 1: Now so if you go public then the whole theory is that you'll cash out then at that point?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I guess, yeah, more or less.
Story_ID: 55916
Speaker 1: Let's talk about this stage in your life.  How--wh, wh where are you? You're still on the air (laughter)?  Still doing what you love?
Speaker 2: Yeah, doing the thing with the Talented Teens ['Hal Jackson's Talented Teens International'] thing has gotten so now you mostly involved, you know, all during the week.  Debi [Deborah Bolling Jackson] does a lot of that and the recruiting and the people because I'm determined if we can give, you know, we give 40,000 dollars a year in scholarships.  And what has happened is I put up the money.  You know I give it 'cause I want to see these kids and the scholarship goes, and we're in the promotion itself don't do it.  I make sure of it.  And they're so happy.  You know, if you gonna send these kids to college and really do it don't be a talker, you know, be an actor.  Let's get out here and do it.  Don't promise if you're not gonna do it.  And you say "Where are you now," well that and I started this thing coming off the air, took myself off the air daily in order to just, you know, I had the Frankie Crocker and the others to keep it going, but I had to do this thing on Sunday ['Sunday Classics'] and what I did was I started this thing with, you know, oldies, new, everything, just found format.  And KISS copied the whole thing, made a whole station out of what I was doing on Sunday.  That's exactly what it is.  So, they did that and, but we're still doing it, you know, every Sunday eight hours.  I go on eight in the morning and get off at four in the afternoon, but it gives me during the week you can get out and still work with the organizations and, and encourage 'em.  And I don't know that's where I am now I guess.
Speaker 1: So, that KISS [WRKS-FM] was that under [HM] Barry Mayo?  He was the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right (laughter) that's right.
Speaker 2: Now they're bringing--
Speaker 1: Because you know what he said (laughter)--
Speaker 2: And the rating was so bad, this last rating for 'em they're bringing Barry back.
Speaker 1: You--they've announced that, oh they have.  He told me that in conf--, oh my God.
Speaker 2: They just brought him back two weeks ago.  Their ratings were real bad, but it was amazing when they would copy my format on Sunday they would, you know, they would listen to the show, go out and buy the records, get the, trying to keep up, but it worked, it worked because, you know, you saw what happened they jumped right up there.
Speaker 1: Well, running a station is, you know, as you've been part, part, you know, owner of this has it been different than, you know, it was when you were, you know, a DJ and, you know, operating within the confines of someone else of you?
Speaker 2: You find--I don't know Percy [Sutton] was chairman [of the Inner City Broadcast Corporation] then.  He passed it on to Pepe [HM Pierre Sutton] and 'cause I told him "I don't want to be chairman or nothing," so I'd say you're the group chairman, all right, so you are responsible for the station, okay, but I don't know, I, I don't know, I don't--maybe I'm not--I don't want to be an administrator.  I can't just sit behind a desk (laughter) you know what I mean.  I, I have to get out in the community, get with the people, and, and I can never stop that 'cause people keep calling on your too.  "Come on now I need you, I need you to come up talk to my group and help us to do this, that, the other."  And when I find people who want to help themselves, you can't turn 'em down, you know.  So, I guess that's the way I am.  I don't know where--
Story_ID: 55917
Speaker 1: Okay, several more questions.  I wanna ask, I wanna ask you what you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: What do I want what?
Speaker 1: Your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, God I don't know.  "He was a guy that never said no to anybody" or "he was always there," you know, "never above the little people.  Never unable to be talked to or asked."  In other words, never mister high-faluf, always be on the bottom of the ladder where people can get to you.  And then when you do things you feel you really contributing, and I think I could never change from that.  You know I couldn't.  You've got to just be a part of what's going on, and you learn more.  When people have the confidence in you that they can come and talk to you about things and problems and ideas you learn more.  You, you, I don't know, you're happy.
Story_ID: 55918
Speaker 1: Now, when you talked, you know earlier, and you said that when I asked you to describe yourself young you said I guess I was somewhat of an introvert, I lived inside, and I know sometimes DJ's have said that it's, it's a very solitary life in some respects.  You, for a lot of that you're talking into a microphone--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and I'm just wondering if you could sort of speak to that.  I mean as much as you were out and about you seem to have two sides.  You, you spent a lot of your time, you know, with you and that microphone and I'm just wondering if you could describe how that whole, how, how it felt or how it feels?
Speaker 2: Well, it just feels like whenever I see a mic I'm at home with a microphone.  You know what I mean?  I feel that I can no holds barred situation, just go ahead and talk.  I've never been in fear of a mic or afraid to take a mic to defend the situation.  And I always feel, you know, you don't even, don't even take time to recollect.  If you need to get it in, answer, go with it especially, you know, if you have nothing to hide.  I always feel I've nothing to hide.  I can take a mic at anytime no matter what the challenge is and go with it and, and if, if, if help is needed be there and at the same time don't back up, don't back up now.  If you gonna go out and help the situation and devote your time to it and if it gets a little rough for awhile don't run away, don't leave people.  I think the worse thing in the world is to get people out on a limb and leave 'em stranded.  I've seen it done so much and they lose hope.  They lose the belief in people and that's one thing I never, never wanted to do lead people on or lead them out on a limb.  Get out there with them and let 'em know that, you know, we're gonna try to win this thing together.
Story_ID: 55919
Speaker 1: Now, for as long as you've been in, in the industry and I, I would say the communications industry 'cause you were in radio and TV and also promotions--(unclear), when you look at the length of time which is really sixty years that you've been involved and you look at the strides and lack of strides that blacks have made what do you see as the future?  You know, are you happy with the progress of things, how they've progressed or do you--
Speaker 2: You mean the progress of people--
Speaker 1: Blacks.
Speaker 2: --in the broadcasting field or people period?
Speaker 1: No, blacks in, in the field.
Speaker 2: That's what I mean blacks in--I have seen more action and I've tried to encourage other people don't feel that that's out of your realm about owning a radio station.  They keep you thinking that, but when [HM] General [Colin] Powell's son [HM Michael Powell], he's over at the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] now, took over and I was talking to him and we were talking about, you know, how few blacks are in the control and since he has been there he has seen how many, you know, so few.  And I promised him that I was gonna go out and from time to time encourage people just lay a base, start working on things.  There is money out there for you to borrow.  There aren't gonna advertise "come and borrow the money your black you can get a radio station," but he is now working on some areas to encourage other people to own.  I love the idea of people owning, you know, radio stations or whatever and now with television and cable and so many other outlets.  And even if they, they don't own it immediately they can get the training, you know, take a job, take a job.  There are all kind of jobs out there and learn.
Story_ID: 55920
Speaker 1: And why has this, this industry been so important to you, the whole area of communications?  What do you see its value as?  How has it enhanced your life?
Speaker 2: Well, I see, I see it as I have seen what it has meant being a part of this and what exposure is.  What it has meant to be able to take a microphone and talk to a whole lot of people on a program, on a project or whatever.  The power, the power of it is unbelievable if it's handled right.  It can also be a detriment, but I think in order to, to keep moving in the direction of progress you have to keep opening doors for as many people as you can.  Hopefully, they'll come in and learn and work, but I do see, you know, I've used the mic for so many things that I really want to see other people come in too.
Story_ID: 55921
Speaker 1: And just one last question, with your parents [Eugene Baron Jackson and Laura Rivers Jackson] had they seen your success what do you think they would say?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Your parents.
Speaker 2: What about 'em?
Speaker 1: If they saw your success?  Do you think they were with you all this time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I keep thinking.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I always felt they were there, always felt they were there.  And I can go back and remember even now, you know, as a little boy I remember about my mother and about my father and being sitting outside of his tailor shop and cleaning area, cleaning establishment and I always feel they're there.  I feel it, you know.  It's not being, you now, over-dramatic or over-religious or anything, but I always feel my mom's there, my dad's leading me; I feel it and it works.
Speaker 1: Thank you sir.  We just need to do photos, thank you, thank you, thank you.

I hosted the show, and they worked with me at the club, Birdland, but this night they were at Carnegie Hall and it was terrific.  This takes us back to, I guess, about 19, oh back in the 1930s, 1935.

Speaker 1: Back in 1949 right opposite the stage door of the world famous Howard Theatre [in Washington, D.C.] was Hal Jackson's club.  It's called Hal's Sports Club, and believe me everybody used to stop by there to have a little soda or drink before going into the theater and after the theater.  It was the spot to be there.
Speaker 2: How did that club get started, Mr. Jackson again?
Speaker 1: The All Sports Club?
Speaker 2: How did it get started?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: How did it get started?
Speaker 1: How did it get started?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
