Speaker 1: Did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: No, I did not.  I knew my--I did know my mother's mother, Aunt Lillie, yeah.  She lived with us for a while.  So that was the only grandparent that I really knew.

Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is--that's a good one.  He's, I think he's 75 now.  So that would put it, let's see if I can do the Math, he's 75, 1928?
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: (laughs)  He's 75, yeah.  Both my parents are 75.

Speaker 2: He is retired now.  And they both live in Atlanta.  But he--he grew up in--he had kind of a strange, a strange childhood, I would say.  He grew up with his Dad and stepmother, but left home and actually there's a, kind of a story that he actually left home at 13.  And it was actually, he didn't leave home, was ousted from home at 13.  So he kind of raised himself.  And he went to, I think at 13 he went to live with his brother.  And he had it kind of rough coming up, you know.  But he--and he didn't have much education and all.  But he took care of us like, like all get out.  I mean he, he provided for us and gave us love and gave us some memories, you know, gave us a lot of memories.  So he, he's a great guy.

Speaker 2: It was, I think in 1940 he came to Chicago.  And my Mom came, I think in 1942, yeah.

Speaker 1: What's her birth date?
Speaker 2: She's 75 also, so yeah, '28, 28, okay, 1928.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Math.
Speaker 2: Right, hard for me to figure it earlier in terms of light.
Speaker 1: Now, did she have a chance to go to school in Forrester?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  She has a high school education--.  And she moved here in '42 [1942], and, yeah, high school education.
Speaker 1: Now, what is she like?  What does she do?
Speaker 2: Well, my--she has always been a housewife, you know.  My father always provided for us.  She was home with us.  She did hair, she did a little hair, you know, like a lot of mom's do.  But her passion is Music.  Her passion is, is still music to this day.  She tells me about when she was 4 years old, and she used to, you know, get on her grandmother's organ, you know, and--the kind you had to pump with your feet and all.  But she's always been into music.  And her sisters were into Music and her Mom was into music.  So--
Speaker 1: Does she play an instrument?
Speaker 2: She plays, she plays organ and keyboard.  She's a singer also, yeah.  I grew up watching her, you know, at least some of my finest memories is her in the kitchen just singing and cooking, yeah, just her voice, just ringing in the house.  That's always a, always a fond memory of that.
Speaker 1: Does she play church music?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's all she really--all she really loved is gospel music.  I mean she just loves gospel music.  And she sang in the choir for as long as I can remember.  And she sang solos and played.  And I remember when she, she used to play a little bit of keyboard.  I remember when she decided that I'm gonna play keyboard.  I want to take some lessons.  She started taking lessons and all.  And she started playing for the church.  She got really good.  And she--still to this day, she has her organ in the back.  And you drive by her house, and the walls are going --shaking from her playing the organ.
Speaker 1: Does she play in a church where there's a lot of, well, more than just the organ (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, right.  Yeah, she played at a church, Christ Temple Baptist Church in, in Markham.  And you're talking organ, bass drums, the whole works (unclear) fire, yeah, yeah.  She jammed.
Speaker 1: So music is a big part of (unclear) the family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, always, always.  And my brother, my older brother also, I mean I grew up with him directing choirs and, and he was always, you know, conducting the choirs and bringing the community together in that kind of way too.  So, but my whole family's always been into music.
Speaker 1: Does your father play an instrument?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father played--now his instrument, he played a little, a little bit of saxophone.  He played saxophone.  And he is the one that encouraged me to, when I was going to pick an instrument for school, and like 6th grade when you can finally get an instrument after playing theclarinet, I was gonna go play drums.  I was on my way out of the house, and he asked me, well, what instrument are you gonna sign up for?  I said, drums.  He said, why don't you play saxophone?  And I went, okay.  And I just went and played sax--and, and signed up for saxophone.  And boy am I glad I did (laughs).  That was the, that was the best call ever because it gave me that tonality and stuff that you would not--I would not have gotten with drums.
Story_ID: 13448
Speaker 1: Can you reflect on--did you grow up in Chicago or--
Speaker 2: Mainly in Markham.  We moved to Markham when I was like 5 or 6 years old, brand new development out there.
Speaker 1: So the suburbs just South (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Now, can you give us a sense of some of the, what the neighborhood was like and some of sights, sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, it--I remember a lot of mud cause it was a brand new development, I remember.  And I, I remember, I grew up in a, at a time when, I mean it was such a, it was still open field out there.  I remember people chasing rabbits to, for dinner (laughs) out there.  That's how, how undeveloped it was, you know.  But it quickly, I mean within like 3 or 4 years, the neighborhood built up and all.  But it, it was a great, it was a wonderful neighborhood.  It was a brand new black community.  And my first real example of really witnessing a community coming together.  And it was wonderful.  I mean I lived in a great neighborhood.  And my parents were always icons on the block.  I mean our house was always a stellar clean house.  And everybody in the block kind of patterned after it, you know.  And there were a lot of kids in my neighborhood, you know.  And I remember the first day I walked to school, my neighbor took me to school.  And I cried the whole time cause he took us through the muddiest route you could ever imagine to get to school, you know.  So I remember a lot of mud around in the area, like I said.  But it was a very nurturing community.  It was definitely one of those communities where the whole community raised you.  And you couldn't get away with anything.  And some of the sights and sounds, one of the sounds I remember in, as a teenager in my neighborhood, was just the sound of--and it inspired me too, the sound of a garage band.  You know, you could drive or ride your bike up and down the street and hear at least 3 or 4 garage bands on my way from my house to Charlie Walker's house, you know.  You could always hear a garage band playing.  And that, that was really something for me.  I used to just stop in front of them when I was a kid and just listen to some of the bands play.  And that was really inspiring and kind of led me to--you know, I had my first garage band when I was in like 7th and 6th grade.
Speaker 1: What kind of music did you play?
Speaker 2: In school or in the garage band?
Speaker 1: In the garage band.
Speaker 2: Oh, we were, we were playing--it's funny, I mean most bands played the stuff on the radio.  And that was definitely, you know, the trend.  You know, you pick up, and play the Top 10 or whatever like that.  I never--we would learn some, some things, but I would always take the guys and we would just start making up music.  You know, I, I always found it really hard to--actually, I found it boring to sit there and, you know, play an Aretha Franklin song.  You know, it's been done already.  I've heard it before.  So I was always--and it always got me in, not, not trouble, but as I kept having bands and you had to start gigging with these bands.  You know, you want to, you know, get out there and gig.  And people want you to play the Top 40.  And we'd always have to struggle and learn, you know, 4, 5, 6 top 40s.  And, but then we'd play our original stuff too, we'd play just tons and tons or original music.  So, you know, we played a lot of original music.  And that's where I really to being there, in that garage, in those garage band, just hearing music in my head and having musicians pick it up, and teaching them how to, how to play it.
Speaker 1: What were some of the types--what do the things look like (unclear)
Speaker 2: What do things look like?  You know, middle-income houses, going up everywhere, you know.  I always had a new hill to play on when you got a, in a new development, you know, playing on hills, plenty of hill games going on.  How did things look?  Very hard to put into words how things looked.  It was just, it was pleasant.  It was, I just grew up in a very pleasant place.  And, you know, you hear about, you know, people growing up in hard neighborhoods and stuff like that.  I didn't grow up in one.  I grew up in a neighborhood that had a lot of pride to it.  And just a lot of hardworking people.  And, as I said, just a lot of kids always moving to town, and I'm always making new friends and stuff.  And it was just a very, very nurturing community (unclear).
Speaker 1: This was pretty much an all black community--
Speaker 2: Yeah--right
Speaker 1: Harvey, Dixmoor, and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, right, all right next to each other.
Story_ID: 13449
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about school?  Where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: I went to grade school, the very first school I went to out there was Warren Palm.  And that was a real experience for me.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) P-A-L-
Speaker 2: P-A-L-M,  Warren Palm in Hazel Crest; walked to school every day, kicking rocks and cans and stuff just like Huckleberry Finn or whatever.  But I went to that school.  And, yeah, I remember they had some interesting teachers.  I remember we had this teacher, Mr. Hall, old guy, old, old, old guy.  And mean.  I remember, yeah, he was real disciplinarian kind of guy.  I remember he grabbed Donald Williams head one time and pulled his gum out of his mouth and stuck it in his hair.  And he never chewed gum in class again (laughs).
Speaker 1: (Unclear) rough--
Speaker 2: It was pretty rough, yeah.  And his favorite phrase was, I remember he used to come up and he'd get his hands on the other side of your head and-- I'll slap you jaws and make them ring like a dinner bell.  And that's the kind of character he had.  But also at Warren Palm, that's where I ran into, that's when I started my, into the band program there.  And I got introduced to Adeline Anderson who was a real influence.  I just fell in love with her.  She was just an awesome band director.  I fell in love with her.  I didn't know how great she was until I went into high school and started realizing that she had flooded the school system with all this, these great musicians and all.  But, and she started me into the band program there.  And I stayed in there all the way until I was in 7th grade--yeah, 7th grade.
Speaker 1: She was a teacher Warren Palm?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a teacher at Warren Palm, she was in the band program there? Right.
Speaker 1: So you had a decent program?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it had a very good, decent music program.  And she was responsible for it too.  And I mean I, I still--I just spoke with her like last week.  We're still in touch, and I mean she's--she changed, she influenced my life back then, and she's even changing my life today.  She's really influencing me to this very day.  She's 70 years old now, and just an amazing woman, amazing.
Speaker 1: Has she been out here?
Speaker 2: No, no.  That's next.  I've been out to her place a couple of times.  She's coming out here real soon, yeah.  And she's, that's my girl there.
Story_ID: 13450
Speaker 1: What kind of a little fellow were you?  What did you like to do and what were your interests, I mean other than--well, I know your interested in music.  But what kind of a kid were you?
Speaker 2: I was pretty, I was pretty quiet, pretty tamed.  And I thought too much when I was a kid.  I remember sitting in the window just thinking, you know, and just--while other kids were out playing, I was just sitting in the window just thinking about stuff, you know.  My mother had to make me go outside and play sometimes, you know.  I was pretty quiet.  I liked Art.  I loved to draw.  I used to like draw pictures of horses and stuff when I was little and sell them for a quarter, you know.  But I always loved to draw.  And that kept me, kept me busy.  I loved to put models together and stuff like that.  I always liked to do things that I could do by myself.  I was pretty much kind of a loner.  I had just a couple of friends.  I had, Charlie Walker and Harold Young were my friends.  And then made a couple of, you know, other, other social friends for sure.  But those were my primary friends I used to hang out with.  And I used to build model airplanes and stuff like that.  And I also--one of the things I loved to do and I was kind of taught to do at an early age was, I have very fond memories of is, I loved to, even today, I love to cook.  I love to cook.  And that's primarily because my Mom would often--she'd, she'd go some place, and she'd (unclear) and say, "I left the stuff in the kitchen for you to put together this cake".  And she'd leave me all the eggs and butter and this stuff and flour.  And it would be sitting there, all the right portions.  And she taught me how to go in there and blend it all together so she could come back and, and put it in the oven.  So at a very early age, I, I liked to cook.  I mean I would go in the kitchen and hook it up.  That's why I was always probably a little chubby when I was a kid.  I ate too much of it.  But, yeah, I always loved to do that.
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: I have two brothers and a sister.  Two, an older brother, older sister and a younger brother.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) their names?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, yeah.  There's Phillip, Darlene, myself and then Wayne is my younger brother.
Speaker 1: Did you like to read?
Speaker 2: Comic books (laughs).  I read comic books, me and Harold were especially into comic books and all.  I didn't--I never really got into reading.  And I, I, to this day, I wish I had.  I mean I wish I was a reader, with being the loner that I was, you'd think I would have of kind of gone there.  But I was never really pushed to read, you know.  And I think if my parents were, had more education or something like that, they would have definitely, you know, told me to go there.  But they, you know, they didn't really push us to read that much.  But I read enough.  I mean I'm not a bad reader today.
Speaker 1: Which were your favorite comics?
Speaker 2: Oh, I used to love Charlie Brown and then, of course, get into Spider Man and all the Marvel, Marvel Comics and stuff like that, yeah.  I think Charlie was really into--my friend, Charlie, was really into Marvel.  He had the biggest collection, spent a lot of time over his house.
Speaker 1: Did you have any heroes, musical heroes?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I would say Adeline Anderson was definitely one, one of them.  Jerry Ingleberg was another guy that embraced me when I was a kid.  I was in 8th grade, and I remember he brought me home.  He wanted to drive me home one day just to talk to my Mom.  And he went and asked her if she minded if I took--if he took me to a band rehearsal of his, out in one of these, one of these West suburbs.  And she said, oh, sure.  And I, I went to band rehearsal.  And I went down--I remember going down in this basement, you know, like about 20, just awesome musicians, jazz musicians.  This was a jazz band down there.  And I sat there with them.  And I, I played baritone sax.  So I sat there at, at the side of the baritone sax player and just watched him for 2 or 3 days.  And then I came to like about the fourth rehearsal and my--Jerry Ingleberg told me to bring my saxophone with me.  And I said, okay.  I brought it with me.  And I came there, and the baritone saxaphone was not there.  So he sat me in the chair there, and here I'm in 8th grade sitting there with all these seasoned, smoking musicians.  And I sat there and sweated bullets (laughs), I mean I'm trying to read these charts.  You know, the notes were just flying by.  And then, but that's what he thrust me into.  And, and I remember one time he also--I was going into my freshman year.  And over the summer, he took me and Charlie Walker and on his own time, just taught us like harmony and theory and arranging things.  And he--and we'd go to the school, and he'd just spend, you know, two hours there with us, you know, quite often just showing us all about arranging and writing and stuff like that.  And that was great.  I mean he just did it because he loved music.  And he loved seeing some, some young guys loving music like that.  So like I said, Adeline Anderson and Jerry Vineberg were big, big in my musical life.  Richard Campbell at Thornton High School, great choir director.  I just loved to sing.  And I was in a great, great program all throughout high school, had just really good music, you know, music education when I was in high school.  Then as I, one of the main persons that really altered my life and gave me so much input musically and taught me a lot of life lessons too was a guy named Charles Stephney who was a music producer here in Chicago that I got, I got forced on him by a woman named Kitty Haywood.
Story_ID: 13451
Speaker 1: what was your favorite kind of music?
Speaker 2: I liked a lot of stuff.  The same way I am today.  I liked a lot of music.  I was in, you know, the Concert band, Jazz band, and all that stuff.  And when it came to the radio, I just liked listening, listening to all sorts of stuff; a lot of jazz, loved, I mean, loved James Brown.  One of my biggest memories is like waking up in the morning and turning on the radio and hearing a new James Brown cut.  And me and my sister would sit there and just like freak out, you know, how, how tight this thing was.  But he was always amazing to me, the, the musicianship and the arrangements they did and all, and the feel of the music.  Big influence there, big, big influence.  And like when the Beatles came out, I just loved the Beatles too.  I mean just, their song writing to n-th degree, you know.  So I had a lot of influences, quite a bit of influences, pretty eclectic, even back then.
Speaker 1: Who were your favorite jazz musicians?
Speaker 2: I loved, you know, Cannonball Adderley , Stan Getz.  And group, you know, the white one, Buddy Rich, go wild on drums and, you know, Herbie Hancock and all those guys, you know, yeah.  You know, and Charlie Parker.  I used to listen to all those guys.
Speaker 1: So you've got a pretty good music collection?
Speaker 2: Yeah, not, not really crazy, but, yeah, got a few records.  I remember when I first started buying records, that was exciting.  I was going out and purchasing records and listening to them was, I remember that was a great moment in life, just getting that vinyl (laughs).
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a decent sound system?
Speaker 2: Oh, we always had a box at home.  My parents always had a nice, you know--in fact, in the neighborhood, that's another, as far as sounds, I mean I could, in going back to that, I remember Mr. Young across the street .  You could always hear his box bumping, you know, always hear his box bumping.  I used to love hearing that.  But my parents also had a nice, one of those, you know, cabinet boxes, with the turntable in it and everything.  So we always had good music.  My parents, all--especially my mom [Vergene Stewart], she just loved music.  She always made sure we had something good to listen to.
Story_ID: 13452
Speaker 1: I went to Thornton Township High School in Harvey, Illinois.
Speaker 2: Did you major in music basically in high school?
Speaker 1: I kind of did major in music, informally, but I majored in Music and had, had three great years of harmony and theory there, and you know, concert band, jazz band.  I was in choir.  I was in madrigals, which is 16-piece vocal group.  And we were awesome.  That was a lot of fun.  And, yes, so I was completely occupied with that and, and school plays.  And I was a drum major in the band, and, yeah, Music was a big part of my high school career, yeah.
Speaker 2: Did music get you involved in a lot of other school activities, in other sort of things (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, like, you know, when you're in the band, you're always, you know, engaged in all the basketball and football games and stuff like that.  And when you become drum major, you know, that's a, that's a biggie there for all the football games and stuff like that.  I remember standing on the end of the field, ready to go and do the half-time show, with this big white suit on and the--and the field is nothing but mud (laughs), and thinking about how humiliating, how humiliating it's gonna be to fall down in that mud in front of all those people.  I never fell, but I was definitely taking it easy that day.  Yeah, that was fun.
Speaker 2: Now, how'd you become a drum major instead of--cause you were playing the baritone sax--
Speaker 1: Yeah, playing baritone sax.  They all, they needed a drum major, and I thought, hey, that'll be interesting.  I had never done it before.  So I, you know--and the suit probably fit me or something like that (laughs), you know.  But, yeah, I just, it was just something that I wanted to do.  And the idea of leading the band, you know, I guess that was, it's always been in my blood.  So there I was, drum major.  It was fun.
Speaker 2: Did your band pattern itself after some of the black colleges like (unclear) or--
Speaker 1: No. No, I doubt if my band directors back then even knew of, of them, you know.  It was, it wasn't the most progressive marching band, which always kind of, you know, upset me.  I wanted us to do more, you know, cool stuff, you know.  But it was pretty straight ahead, you know, straight ahead marching band.
Speaker 2: Did you ever get a chance or opportunity to do something creative in front of the crowd?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, (laughs).  You had that big baton in your hand and that suit on, you got to, you know, you got to ham it up a little bit.  But like I said, when the field was muddy, I played it very, very safe.  Nothing could be more humiliating than falling down, and I would have heard about it for the rest of the year for sure.
Speaker 2: So were you involved in any other activities other than music activities?
Speaker 1: I tell you that was, music and theater were about my only other extra activities.  I, in my freshman year I played football.  I did play football.  But, and I could have been good.  I could have been contender.  You know, I could have been really, really good at it, but I just--the music was just consuming me, and I remember I had to make a choice whether it was gonna be football or whether it was gonna be music.  And I did the music thing, yeah.
Speaker 2: These guys (unclear) athletic on, the drum major--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah--yeah, definitely.
Speaker 2: Well, did you run for any class offices or things like that?
Speaker 1: No, I was never into that stuff.  I was, I, like said, the music consumed me so much.  And it was, that was my--I can't, I mean I wasn't like a student, student.  I mean I wasn't like you're just wild about school and study and stuff like that.  But the music is what kept me really interested in school and kept my grades up and all that.  That's where I got all of my self esteem cause I was kind of, you know, self conscious and shy in school.  I didn't have a lot of friends and stuff like that outside of the people that I, you know, worked with in class and stuff like that, and then in band and stuff like that.  So it was a real, it was an esteem booster for me.  And it made me feel like I was somebody in the school.  If I didn't have that, I probably would have been a really rotten student.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) Did you (unclear) think life as sort of a (unclear)?
Speaker 1: You have to be honest, right.  None of it ever really got me really excited, you know.  I, I got through it, got decent grades and everything.  But, I mean fortunately or unfortunately, or whatever, I mean the passion was anything that had to do with art, you know, that's what I pretty much excelled in and was interested in.  The other stuff, like I say, I got through, didn't flunk and didn't do anything.  I got, you know, decent grades, average grades, average and above grades, but not really passionate about, about any of those subjects, nah.
Speaker 2: What would be like the highlight (unclear), what years are we talking about?
Speaker 1: I graduated, I graduated in '71 [1971].  So, the highlights, I mean the highlights, it keeps going back to artsy-fartsy stuff, and then Music stuff.  But, you know, that's where the highlights were.  I mean the highlights were band competitions and going down state, playing with the Navy band, you know, with this guy who wouldn't take anything off of anybody, you know.  The highlights were being in madrigals and going to a senior citizens home and singing for some people and watching (unclear) and weep in front of you, you know.  Highlights were being in George M. Cohan on stage at school and hamming it up and having people actually laugh and respond to you, you know; going to solo contests.  And I remember I got a perfect seven.  I was the only one in the band to get a perfect seven.  And that made me feel so good because the, at the mock solo contest, I completely bombed.  I just froze up completely and stood there sweating bullets, and just, everything just left me, you know.  So I went home and practiced like crazy.  And then the next day, went to the competition and got a perfect seven so that was a, that was biggie for me back then.  It made me feel good about myself.

Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating from high school, did you know where you wanted to do (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew I needed further education.  And I knew I wanted to further it in Music.  I went to DePaul University for one year.  The main reason it ended up being one year is because I went there, and it was like, because of my high education in music and the harmony and theory and all, I went to DePaul for music.  And they had a fairly new music program.  If I had a thought about it, I would have researched a lot further and probably gone to Columbia [College, Chicago, Illinois].  But I went to DePaul, and I knew everything.  I mean I went there and just aced all the classes, even the ones that were outside of music, just aced it.  I was, did really well, and realized that, man, I really had a great high school education cause these kids were just learning the stuff that I had already learned in, in my high years.  So I went the one year of, of college.  And then I remember I was on Wabash [Avenue] going to school one day.  And I said, I've got to make a decision here.  Am I gonna three more years at this college or do I just get right in here and start, start this career?  And I pretty much said, yeah, you know, I'm gonna go out there and jump out there and see what it's like trying to survive in the music business.
Speaker 1: Well, what was your first step?
Speaker 2: Well, my first step was (laughs), not much of a step at all.  It was just getting odd jobs.  I mean, you know, I worked at Smokey Joe's Clothing Store over on, on Maxwell Street for a while and sold blue, yellow and pink rabbit coats to the brothers (laughs).  "That's looks good on you man.  That looks really good on you."  I did that for a while, all the while I'm having my, you know, garage bands and stuff like that.  I remember working at Smokey Joe's one time and I had a gig.  We had a gig to go to.  But I had to work.  You know, I needed to get off early and the only way I could get off was to--I, I, ashamed to say now, but I, I remember I passed out on the floor.  I figured if I pass out, they'll send me home.  So I passed out on the floor.  I'm laying there, time is going by.  It's like okay, is anybody ever gonna notice me down here?  And all of a sudden, I hear this voice saying, "This dude done fell out in the floor."  (laughs).  They finally came and got me up.  And I went out and split to the gig, you know.  And, and I did, I did odd jobs.  I just worked in a shoe store and stuff like that.  And right around that time is when Kitty Haywood, I mentioned earlier introduced me.  She, she was at one of my rehearsals.  She was in, she was standing in the driveway while we were in the garage.  And after rehearsal, she told me, you know, you would make a really great producer.  I said, ah, cool, what's that?  You know, and she's busy telling me what a producer does, but even better than that, she took me down to a studio after a couple of days.  She took me to a studio, and I sat there and watched a Richard Evans session.  It was down at Paul Serrano's studio.  And she told me to sit down, shut up, and don't say a word.  And I sat down there and watched Richard Evans with a--he had a rhythm section, he had strings, and he had horns and singers, all in the studio at the same time.  So I watched this guy put this track down.  I was like, I'm sitting there with my mouth hanging open, saying man, this is really cool.  So at the end of it, I realized, wait a minute.  He's doing the same thing that I do in the garage, you know, except you didn't have hub caps up on the wall (laughs), you know.  So that's when I kind of decided, hey, yeah, this is, this is what I want to do.  This is what I was cut out to do, all these years since sixth grade of putting these bands together, and, you know, having the rhythm sections and horns play this and that.  I hadn't, little did I know that was, I was prepping myself to become a producer.  So that's the day I decided I--that's what I wanted to do.  And that's when I began doing it.  And I guess I started when I was forced on Charles Stepney.  This is the producer I was telling you about.  And Charles at the time, he was doing a lot of work for Chess Records.  And he was responsible for, he was doing records, he had done records on Rotary Connection and Minnie Ripperton and a bunch of other folks and Joe Simon, I remember.  And, but he had, he started working with this band that was starting to pick up some momentum called Earth, Wind and Fire.  So as he was picking up momentum with that, and Earth, Wind and Fire was taking off, Tom Burrell from Burrell Advertising was out there on the streets, screaming, hey, that black people need dollars for advertising too.  We're buying your products.  You should be allowing us to advertise.  So he was starting to, to, you know, to sing that song out there.  And as he began to get his first client, which happened to end up being McDonald's, which wasn't a bad start, you know, he needed music done.  So he went to Charles Stepney.  So here's Charles Stepney really starting to take off in the record industry.  And now, this advertising thing was on him.  So Kitty Haywood was, started to try convince him that he needed help.  And she referred me to him and said, look, "There's this young guy I know that he's, he's I think a great producer and he can really help you handle this workload."  So she pushed him, pushed me on him for about, about 4 or 5 months, I believe.  And he just didn't want to be bothered at all.  But then he finally broke down and, and had me come down.  Well, I got my band together, and actually we were--I guess my mother needed her car in the garage so we were in her shop where she did hair.  So I got my band in there, and we all played around this little cassette machine, which I still have in there today.  And we played, played about 6 songs into this cassette machine, with this band just playing into this one machine.  So I took that cassette down to him.  And I went down in his basement where he was, he had his recording equipment.  He played the tape and listened to it all the way through, you know, fast-forwarded a few things, you know.  And he said, okay, thanks.  And I was like, o-k-a-y.  And I got up with my tail between my legs and left and went home, was like totally depressed.  After a while, I was, I remember I was laying in the bed and my Mom--the phone rang, and my Mom opened door.  She said, "There's some guy Charles Stutleg or Stefan or Stepney or somebody."  I said, "Stepney, yeah."  She said, he's on the phone.  I went and answered the phone, and that's when he told me that he wanted to use two of the songs that were on the cassette on the next Ramsey Lewis album he was about to produce.  And he wanted me to help him produce them.  So that's when I started working with Charles Stepney.  And I worked with him for about 3 years, and he just really showed me and taught me a lot.
Story_ID: 13454
Speaker 1: And I worked with him for about 3 years until I got a call one day that he had--I think he died in the studio.  He was a--he used to work, he worked too hard, and wasn't quite taking care of himself like he should, you know.  And, and that taught me a big lesson too cause I, you know, it was a big, big loss for, for his family and, of course, and all, and then just the whole music thing, period.  I mean he was, he was responsible for such great stuff.  I remember I was, I'm kind of rambling on here, but I remember walking into his basement one time, and he had like an 8-track machine.  And he used to lay down his drums like one drum at a time.  He'd take the bass drum and--you know laid the bass drums.  And then on another track, he'd lay down the snare drums (boom ta boom boom).  So he'd get these tracks going.  I came down in the basement one time and he had this, he was playing a synthesizer, lying on top of this groove.  And the synthesizer went  (imitating musical sound).  And he played the whole thing all the way through it.  And he finished it, and looked up, "Hey, man, how you doing?"  I said, "That's tight, Charles, that's tight, you know."  And little did--you know, it turned out to be my favorite tune in the whole world.  "That's the Way of the World", you know, but I just got to sit (unclear) and witness that, you know, that being born there.  But he, he was a huge influence, huge influence in my life and a big loss to music, period.
Speaker 2: Now, he produced Earth, Wind and Fire?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  He, he wrote, you know, 'Reasons'.  I think it was Reasons, a bunch of their hits he wrote and produced.  He would come up the tracks.  The guys would write lyrics and stuff for them and, yeah, he's, he's responsible, he's responsible for that Earth, Wind and Fire sound, that sound that they had.  A lot of that was Charles Stepney.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I know they, some of the bass (unclear) Phil Curran--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right--
Speaker 2: And (unclear) (mic problems)
Speaker 1: Yeah, Maurice White was, was the (unclear) bought that (unclear) to it.  They had a great sound back then.  That was another huge influence on me musically.  When you heard that, just all that band coming at you, like when bands were really happening.  That was a good time in music.
Speaker 2: How old was Charles Stepney?
Speaker 1: He was just forty--he was just forty-two, forty-three or something like that.  Not old at all.  And I mean that's, you know, when I witnessed that, that's when I--another decision I made back then was that I would not let this music business kill me.  You know, it's not worth it cause you can--you find yourself working to try to make it so much, you know.  And you just have to work and push and push.  And, you know, you can end up doing it until you, you know, you start moving out those things that are really important in life like your health and stuff like that.  And so that's one thing it taught me.  And that's why, to this very day, I'm, you know, I'm considered a health nut around here (laughs), (unclear) trying to get people to eat right and everything, you know.
Story_ID: 13455
Speaker 1: Now the early '70s [1970s] was, there was a lot of production going (unclear), the (unclear) brothers, (unclear) and Ramsey Lewis, Herbie Hancock--
Speaker 2: Herbie Hancock, right.
Speaker 1: And it took him out of what he had traditionally been, and (unclear).  And were you a part of that (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I mean I watched it coming.  You know, I watched the, I watched it all happening and really enjoyed it.  It's another big influence, you know.  I watched these jazz guys skip over genres and, you know, and blend over into the more, you know, the R&B, funk side.  And just to watch the whole funk thing come into play and how guys were responding to that.  I mean funk was a huge part of my, my upcoming, yeah, Sly Stone, and all of this good stuff, good music.
Speaker 1: So after the '70s [1970s], what did you do (unclear) (mic)
Speaker 2: After he, after he [ref. to Charles Stepney] passed, I went into a major depression (laughs) for a while.  And a woman that was working with Tom Burrell, her name is Anna Morris, gave me a call.  It was months later.  Burrell had started working with a new company that was--this was two guys that were just kind of fresh out of college who started Jingle Production Company.  So when Charles passed, they started with them.  These are--it was a white, two white guys.  And so they started working with them, but then they just didn't feel like it was, they were getting the music that they needed cause this was, you know, African American music.  And these guys weren't really well--that well versed in it.  So she recalled me working with Charles.  And so--I mean the reason they didn't come right to me is because I didn't have any sort of business set up.  I wasn't set up to do it at all.  You know, so they just went to somebody who was, you know, set up to do it.  But after working with them for a while, realized they weren't getting the music.  So at a certain point, I think it was Anna that said to them, now, it might prove to be a good move if you were to maybe hire this young black guy here who has, whose done music with Charles Stepney.  Now, if you hired him, it might help you to kind of maintain the business that we're trying to give you, you know.  So they were kind of forced into--and once again, I was forced on (laughs) someone by, you know, by someone, by Anna Morris.  And I went down in my tie and my suit to interview with him and, and got the job.  Got the job and started working with them.  And it was, it was interesting in that, here it is this young, African--well, I'll say black guy cause back then, it was just black, starting to work at this white jingle company.  I remember sitting, when I went to the very first session that I had, I got my script, and I was gonna take this session in.  And they insisted that I use the studio musicians that they had been using all along.  And I'm thinking, okay, well, they, they know, you know, best.  So I went in and went to produce the spot, and it just wasn't happening.  I mean it was like I could not get them--I remember telling the bass player, could you like hit the, the string with your thumb and make that, hit it a little harder.  And he was like, not a clue as to what I was talking about.  I remember telling the drummer, if you smack that snare drum a little harder and it needs a little more emphasis on the (unclear) you know.  And the session just, it didn't do anything.  And I, and I went back in the booth, and it was like, you know, I was (unclear) going, and I remember going back to Anna Morris.  And we just cut the session off.  I remember we were going back to the office, and I told one of the guys, I said,"Look, I've got some fellows from the 'hood that could come in here and knock this out and give them sound, give Burrell the sound they're looking for."  I mean there's, these are my guys that I've been, you know.  And he said, "well, have they ever been in the studio before?"  I said, "No, not that I know of.  But they know how to play, you know," (laughs).  Well, after a little convincing they allowed me to bring them to the studio.  So I remember the day they came into the studio, it was like, you know, here come my boys.  When we sat down and, I mean when we first, I remember Tony Brown, who was, I had on bass.  He got up the bass and started playing and the engineer went whoa; had to pull the, (unclear) down because it was just putting out, you know.  But we ended up getting this whole rhythm section together.  And the rhythm section was kicking.  It was like, the engineer had never experienced.  It was a whole new experience for him.  We got this rhythm section down.  And I remember on that session, we had strings come in too.  So we had the rhythm section down and then we had the strings come in.  And after the rhythm section, I remember the, the head violinist was--we had the chart, and he started playing the track.  And he started kind of playing against, trying to follow the charts.  He said, "Hold on, hold on, hold on."  And he just listened to the track.  And he said, after it was over, he said, "Who's that on bass?  I've never heard--what kind of technique is that he's using?"  It was like, well, this is the guys from the 'hood.  But nobody had ever heard that sound downtown before.  You know, so here I was.  I bought my, my boys down.  And these are, these are guys that are session musicians still today.  You know, they're still playing in sessions and stuff like that.  But that was the introduction of, of music into the, the jingle, where Charles first bought it in.  And then I, and I got known for continuing it, you know, and brought the certain sound into the jingle-world downtown and, and actually did very, very well with the company to the point where, you know, a good percentage of our demo roll ended up being all my material.  And I went by--it was May 18th, it must have been '77 [1977], I believe, I got called into my boss's office, and he fired me, said he needed a person with blinders on, and I was fired.
Speaker 1: So he needed a person with (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that--yeah, I don't know what that--
Speaker 1: So what did he mean by that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  (laughs)  I don't know, but I had other stuff going.  I mean I had my garage bands and stuff like, and, you know, but, you know, I was taking care of business and was taking care of business very well.
Story_ID: 13456
Speaker 1: It was just, you know, one of those things where, you know, he thought he had to let me.  But I, I--so he fired me there. I walked out of the office, the receptionist hands me a note and says, a couple of messages.  And one of them was, call Tom Burrell.  So I called Tom Burrell, and he told me that, look, you know, it's been a little--it had been a little funny around where I was working with this company.  It wasn't--things weren't quite settled.  So he said, "I know you've been having a little trouble over there and, you know, there's been a little problem.  But if you ever thought about going out on your own, starting your own business, I just want you to know, you've got my support.  You've got my word, you know.  We'll give you work."  And I'm like, I just got fired like 3 minutes ago, and he's calling me up telling me that, that I have his support.  So that's about all I needed.  And shortly after that I started up what I call, The Joy Art Music in '78 [1978], yeah.
Speaker 2: Where did you locate it?
Speaker 1: The first office was downtown--that's a really good question.  It was 166 East Superior, a little apartment there.  That was, that was the first place we opened up at, right.  Downtown, yeah.  It felt great too.  It was, it was a career move.  And I started with my, my older brother, Phillip, who had more of a business background.  We, I originally started the business with him.  And then worked with his ex-wife for a while, who managed--cause I was always like creative, and I wanted somebody to just handle the business.  You know, so he was there, then she came in and stepped in.  And then after that, years later, my wife stepped in.  And she's been taking it through ever since here.  The business is owned by my wife and I.  Yeah, Brenda.
Story_ID: 13457
Speaker 1: And where did you all meet?
Speaker 2: In high school.  She was fifteen, I was seventeen.  It was (unclear) it was this Harri--I shouldn't say a bunch of name.  A guy named Harrison showed me this picture of this girl.  He was really macking.  He was like, ah, she's tight.  And I looked over.  It was a horrible picture.  I was like, okay, if that's what you (unclear) want, whatever.  But then I saw her afterwards, and the picture just didn't do any justice.  And it was like, ooh, she's fine, you know.  And I remember I was walking past her one day, and I'd seen her picture, so I just said, "Hey, how you doing?"  And she went like, "Hi" and walking, and we walked.  And then we caught each other turning around looking at each other afterwards, you know.  And it was ha, ha, ha, I made her look, you know.  And she had on this nice, short little mini-skirt that looked nice too.  Anyway, after that I found out later that she was a singer, and we had planned for the Black Expo at school.  And they had, they got her, they wanted her to sing the National Black Anthem.  So they put my band together with her to come together to perform it while she sang it.  So, you know, we're standing there in the hallway, grilling each other.  She's like, I'm telling her, I'm just like, well, what have you done, you know?  What have you done?  She's like (laughs), and she tells me whatever she's done.  And she goes what have you done?  I tell her my little stuff, you know.  And so we kind of met each other on music, you know.  We met each other with music.  And I guess we fell in love, I suppose cause we were--I guess we fell in love.  And we've been together now for twenty-three--we've been married twenty-three years.  And we went steady like eleven years, which she has a lot to say about--
Story_ID: 13458
Speaker 1: I've had highlights like, I've worked with some really great celebrities, you know, over the years doing, through the commercial stuff and the, and the record thing, the record thing.  I remember that one of my biggest thrills was working with, with my boy I mentioned before, James Brown, finally got to work with James Brown in the studio.  I did, in fact, I did two, two spots with him.  And he was just such a pleasure to work with.  I mean he was just as humble and sweet as he could be, and ready to do whatever.  And I remember at one point he said, "And you do James Brown better than James Brown do James Brown." (laughs) 'cause I had the, you know, our fellows doing the track stuff.  And he came in.  But, yeah, that was a big thrill there.  And working with a lot of celebrities and I guess the nicest part about it is that you expect to run into some people that are just, you know, arrogant jerks.  But everybody I worked with is nice.  I only worked with one celebrity that, that hasn't been just a really beautiful person, you know.  And that's been a real blessing.  Other highlights, I mean, I guess the biggest highlight for me is to create like a piece of product or a song or a visual in a song or something like that, and then watch people, you know, be blessed by it, you know.  Or to uplift somebody or to inspire somebody with it.  That's the, that's the biggest thing--and I think that's why I do it.  I, that's why I call the company, which I named way before I even had the company, I was--I remember I was just doing like a track sheet for my four-track machine.  I said, hum, if I had company, what would I call it?  And I called it Joy Art Music.  And it's all about joy and the art of making music, you know.  It's kind of what it's, what's from.  And it's also like a meter for me, cause I always said if I, if I'm not enjoying myself, I know it's time to get out, you know.  But the joy that, that you can give to other people and the messages you can get through Art, period, and everything, that's the biggest joy.  When we do stuff with schools and students, or we get these students in this here or we go to their schools.  And we just, you know, do our number on them.  And to watch them, to watch their, their switch gets lit, you know, to inspire.  I mean those--any moment that we've inspired people, that's some of the greatest moments I've had in doing this.  And we've had quite a few of them.
Speaker 2: Now, could you--oh, what were the James Brown commercials(unclear) --
Speaker 1: McDonald's--I think both of them were McDonald's commercials, they were McDonald's commercials, yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know if you know about it, but a couple years ago, he did a broadcast (unclear) those umbrellas and (unclear) (unclear)
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And at the same he (unclear) people were standing in front of him (unclear)--
Speaker 1: (laughs)
Speaker 2: You know, I mean--
Speaker 1: It's great stuff.  I mean that's some wonderful stuff back there.  Yeah, we, we all went to a ceremony of theirs.  And it was so weird to see when they went back, and you see all your old work.  You know, and you see--I saw a lot of Charles Stepney's work, and then he went into, segwayed into the work that I'd done early on.  And it's really, you know, kind of chilling to sit there and watch the stuff, you know, big Afro's and (laughs), Bantu (unclear) use Afro Sheen and all those commercials.
Speaker 2: Now, were you involved in the (unclear) for that?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah.  We did a lot of those, yeah.  We did a lot of those, and we did--and then we did the first rap commercials around Care Free Curl, yeah.
Speaker 2: A Care Free rap?
Speaker 1: Yep, Care Free, Care Free, Care Free, Care Curl.  I said, yeah, I said, "I'm Randy Brown, toughest dude in town cause I'm super clean and I'm GQ'd down.  The ladies love my wavy hair, step back girls, there's enough to share, Care Free, Care Free," (laughs), crazy stuff.  Anyway, big hit, huge hit on the radio because nobody had heard a rap commercial before.  (Unclear) Another one that was a, that really stood out to me, and it was definitely a high point in the commercial place for me was, Anna Morris, once again from, from Burrell, she commissioned me to do this acappella song for Coca Cola.  It was called 'Street Song'.  And we, we recorded it, and they went and shot it in New York, in one of those New York, you know, apartment stoops there.  And just a huge spot.  I mean it was just 4--5, 5 guys singing a cappella on a stoop.  And it just resurged the a cappella music craze all across the country.  All of a sudden people were doing doo wop contests and stuff all over the place.  And it was just a huge, great spot.  And it--that was my first really big one.  You know, it was kind of a high point.
Speaker 2: Who were the artists?
Speaker 1: Well, it was me and the, me and the fellows.  (laughs)  Me and some of the guys, you know, that I, that I grew up singing with and stuff.  And then my cousin, and, you know, and we just got together and just, you know, real impromptu and just put this, took the script and started to singing.  You know, it goes, (singing) "Coke adds life to everything that makes it really nice, so nice,  Coke adds life and everybody wants a little (humming) Coke adds life", jiving around, the good foot on the table, and really getting down.  At the end, it was Coca-cola (--the big finish, yeah.  Simple spot, but everybody just loved it, you know.  That was fun.
Speaker 2: So do you write some of the--do the lyrics come from the agency?
Speaker 1: Well, usually the lyrics come from the agency.  And we take them and put music to them.  We hire musicians and singers and bring them in our studio.  We record the whole thing and give it to them on a tape to air.  Or, you know, they'll give it to us, they'll give us a picture and we'll post score that picture or, you know, and, and give them that final product.
Speaker 2: Do they usually keep the footage for the commercial after they get the music or before?
Speaker 1: Either way, it happens both ways, yeah.  A lot of times, if it's a music-driven thing, we'll do the music first.  They'll take that and shoot the visual to that music.  But then often, they'll give us a picture.  And then we'll come back and, what's called "post score".  And we'll put the music to that picture and do all the hits and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: So you use a picture or the scale or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's usually, yeah, it's like a videotape, a three-quarter inch videotape usually it's on.  And then we lock up to that for our SMPTE and put our time codes and all that stuff on it and lock up and score to that picture.

Speaker 1: Now, what's the toughest thing about what you do (unclear)?
Speaker 2: The toughest thing about this job is--the toughest thing about this job would be--maybe it's not that tough if I'm having a hard time thinking of it (laughs).
Speaker 1: It may just be a great job (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's--it has its up's and its kind of, kind of downs, but the downs, I can't even count them as downs.  It's just life.  I mean for me, I guess one reason it's so up for me right now, I mean for me to be at the point I'm at right now, it's just one big up, when I can look at the staff that I have and be--I mean I have people that have been with me for 12 years.  You know, a guy who works for me, Tony Bobolink, he's been with me for 12 years.  I've got people that have been here and enjoy working here.  And I've got a--I even, I'm at the point now where my sons--I have 21 year old son and a 16 year-old son, Leslie and Brandon, they work with me here now.  You know, so it's like a huge joy.  I mean it's definitely kind of business, you know.  Even the people that aren't direct blood family, it's more like family to us.  That's just the way me and Brenda feel about it.  And it's just, it's more joy than anything else.  If there was a hard part to it, I'd say it was just keeping up with everything that we are about doing because we're, we're not just about doing the commercial work.  That's just what, that was how we started.  But about 8 years ago, I got the call from above to hey, diversify.  I mean the Lord pretty much flat out said, hey, diversify if you want to stay in this, in this business.  And he just kind of let me know that I didn't put you in here just for this.  So we started getting into the television themes and stuff like that.  And the--I've always had a passion for visuals and stuff like that too.  Yet, I mean years ago, it was just something I couldn't afford to do, but I mean technology has made it where now I can even fulfill those visual desires.  And now the company is in a diversifying area.  We're, we're into film and video and stuff like that now.  We're working on, you know, on, on video concepts and programming and stuff like that.  So it's, there's no time to be down.  And like said, the hard part is just juggling everything, you know, with a, with a fairly small staff, we're doing some really big things.  And we--I mean everybody works really, really hard.  And we're constantly putting new challenge--I mean and we, we throw stuff on the table that none of us have ever done before.  And then we stop and we figure it out.  And, and my theory has always been to--I wanted a company that was in-house, where I could do everything in-house here.  And I'm stretching my staff like (laughs), like crazy.  Now, everybody wears these hats with, you know, about 4 or 5 brims on them.  And we're constantly doing, everybody's doing a little bit of everything.  And, but we're getting to a threshold now of success that, you know, we're gonna be able to bring on more people to, to help us out and to, to reach all those goals, you know, and to, to balance everything out.

Speaker 1: Can you give us sort of a run down of all the sort coppia of music, (unclear) log--can you talk about all (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, in the commercial area, we have 3 companies.  It's 'Lost Pineapple Music', 'Grind X' and then 'Fat Lip'.  Now, the Lost Pineapples are general market, pretty much covering, you know, just generally all the different genres of, of music for our general market clients.  The Grind X is--well, the thing, the tell line for Grind X is music for when your hair is on fire (laughs).  And it's like this extreme, Tommy (unclear) he'll set up, and he's, you know, guitarist extraordinaire and just the music--it's that over, that, what do you call it, the alternative extreme music.  It's just extreme sport, you know, all, all that kind of music.  It' just like (loud music sound).  It's loud and it's crazy.  And you hear a lot of that nowadays.  Now, to your Fat Lip music is my sons are in charge of that, and that's the hip hop advertising, you know.  And that's like, anything that's hip hop goes through Fat Lip.  And they're doing great work.  As young as they are, they're doing great work.  So that's the advertising aspect of us.  Then there's Coppia Sound Studio, which we're in now.  Then there is Coppia Records, which is the record division of us that we're just launching this year.  And we're developing artists that'll be coming out this year.  There is the Hit Tunes Publishing where all our song publishing goes through.  There is the Art of Making Music Foundation.  That's something that's very, very dear to us around here.  I guess, you know, from what you've heard of my background, you, you get the fact that I was nurtured.  I mean people cared about what I was doing.  And they saw what I was doing and therefore, shoved things in my face to say, clarify what it is I could possibly do.  And that's what the Art of Making Music is all about.  It's about, it's about stimulating dollars, first of all and resources for the--to fill in the gap where the education system is constantly striping music out of the, out of the programs and Art and Art.  What we're doing is standing in the, in the gap with that.  We're all about getting students that are gifted into music programs.  We're about empowering school programs that do have, have music programs to empower them to connect them to the outside world, which brings a whole new life to that, that school music program.  And we're about getting instruments in kids' hands, getting kids in, in--to get lessons, getting kids to realize how that stuff relates to the outside world and the, and to the field that we're in.  It's all about getting kids with professionals in this field.  That's what happened to me, you know.  I was put into a space with professionals, to sit along side of professional.  And one day, that I told you about, in the studio, my switch was flipped.  And it was like, okay, this is what I want to do.  It was simple as that.  And a lot of kids out there, and they, their switch--first of all, they don't realize they have a switch.  Their parents don't realize they have a switch.  And their teachers don't realize they have a switch.  And the switch never gets flipped, and they sit there and spend all their lives shorting out, things like jacking up cars and gangbanging and doing all that, only because they have no outlet.  You know, so we're all about just being an outlet, and being a helpmate to the school systems and giving kids an opportunity to see this beautiful business that we've had the pleasure of, of playing in all these years.
Speaker 1: Have you ever been Students on (unclear) on tour (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  And we have several different programs.  I mean one of--I went to Thornton [High] School.  One of my sister schools, which was Thorn Ridge, we just had out here and did a full-day program, one of our full-day programs with them.  They brought out the choir.  They brought out, I mean 18 members of their choir, I believe it was.  And then they brought their television and radio department out.  So when I heard this was who they were bringing out, I said, well, what can we do with them, you know.  And that's one thing we really specialize in, is coming up with programs that fit a certain situation, you know.  You can, you know--I always feel like every situation, you can creatively tailor-make it to make that situation, and to create a moment that will be a benefit.  So we put together a number where Trish Hill, who's head of our video department, she took on the television and Radio kids, brought them in here.  And the choir came in.  Nobody had any idea what they were gonna do that day.  But they came in, the students had to learn the song right here, and they were in a recording session all day long, realizing the grueling task of laying down vocals on this track that my son and I wrote.  It was called, 'Reaching for the Star', I think that's what we titled it.  And we spent the whole day out here.  We exhausted them.  We even had a working lunch (laughs), had to work right through lunch.  But we recorded them with the, the  television/  radio department shot the whole thing.  And we put it together in a whole full-length piece for the school that we went out and later presented and it just turned out great.  You know, hopefully, the people watching this will get a chance to look at that cause it's an amazing piece.  And it shows--I mean just to see the smiles on the kids' faces and to see them pushed, and lovin' it is, is--it's just great.  I mean everybody needs a push, and that's what I'd love to spend more and more time doing, is just pushing kids into, into what it is they, they're desiring to do.
Story_ID: 13461
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I would--that I would have done differently over the whole course.  Yeah, I would have studied the Word more.  And if, when I was a kid, I wished I knew about, I'm talking about the, the Bible, the Word of God, something like that.  I would have, I would have loved to have just gotten to know what I know now back then, you know, when I was a kid. My Christian walk has been a very important part of what I am, who I am, and what I'm doing today.  And just to bear down and realize how important it was early on, is something that, I mean--I would probably wouldn't be able to sit here right now (laughs) if I had, if I was on fire like I, you know, really could have been since, you know, whatever.  Well, that's one thing that I would have done differently.  I just would have just dug into that more.  I guess when my, when I was bringing up my kids who are great, wonderful kids now, I would have spent, I would have had a little better balance when they were infants.  Back then, I was really trying to push and make this thing work.  You know, it's a, it's very time consuming when you have your own business, especially in the music business, and you're trying to stay alive.  I would say this also, tomorrow--today is the 9th of April--8th, 8th, yeah, on the 10th is our 25th year anniversary, being in business.  So that's a biggie, to be in the music business for 25 years, especially here in Chicago is a, is a big deal, you know.  We're real happy about that.  So--I forgot what your question was, now (laughs).
Speaker 1: Something that you'd do differently.
Speaker 2: What would I do differently, yeah.  Wow, as I was saying, with my kids I would have spent more quality time with them as they were toddlers, you know.  I was so busy on business that I didn't spend as much time.  We spent, and they had nurturing grandparents, and they're around and my wife and all.  We were always, always there, but just, you know, I would be more focused on my, on my kids when they were a young age cause they grew up so fast.  They're 21 and 16 now.  And it seemed to happen overnight, you know.  So, but they're still kids.  They still like to give hugs and stuff like that so I feel like, you know, they've got a little kid in them.  But, let's see, what would I do differently other than that?  I can't think of too much.  It's--I can't say I've done everything right , that's for sure.  But that that I have done, I mean, by the grace of God, anything that I didn't do right is covered, you know, and that's like, you know, I guess that's why things are as good as they are today.  And I'm really looking forward to what the future brings.

Speaker 1: And I just want to make sure that (unclear)--Oprah Winfrey.
Speaker 2: Yeah, working with Oprah for about, going on 7 years now, which is a real blessing.  I mean to have--she's had music themes come and go, a year here, a year there.  But to have done her music and, and be able to turn it on and hear it now for 7 years, is a, is a real pleasure cause I just love what that woman does.  I mean she's changing the world.  She's doing in television what I long to do in music, and that is, redefine, redefine what it's there for, you know.  She was doing the, the other kind of T.V. there for a minute and then one day realized, okay, enough of this.  I'm changing it.  I'm gonna do it the way I feel like it needs to be done.  And with all the opposition and stuff she had, she did it, and she changed, changed television.  Music is the same, has the same effect.  And I don't like what's being done with it right now.  I think it's totally--it's, it's abusing earth (chuckle).  It's abusing children and, and it's just pretty foul in a lot of areas.  And I don't like it.  And you can't go back and change all that, but my thing is, hey, where is the space for the good stuff?  You know, record companies, where is the space for the good stuff?  Radio stations, where is the space for the good stuff, where people can at least have a choice, you know.
Speaker 1: And you're referring some of the themes--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, some of the--if you want to call them themes.  You know, it's some songs (unclear) straight from the pit, you know.  And it's, and it's making money.  The kids are tricked to like it.  Their, their senses are desensitized to like it.  And just because you put a bleep in something or knock out a word, okay, we're not stupid.  You know, what you just said, and it doesn't soften it at all.  All it does is make you want to go out and get the version where they actually say the word.  That's what it makes the kids want to do.  So, you know, like I say, you can't get rid of that stuff, and I'm gonna get up on a soap box and say it should go away.  But I will get up on a building and scream out, "hey, where is the space for the good stuff" so that people can have a choice, so a kid can say, wait a minute, this booty song over here, and then there's this other song that really makes me feel good.  I'm gonna listen to this 5 times more than I do this, you know, to give them a choice.  And radio ought to be responsible and the record companies ought to be responsible.  TV ought to be responsible, and there just should be, be more space or equal space given to the good stuff.

Speaker 1: Well, now, who are your favorite musicians?  Who are they?
Speaker 2: These days, from these days?  Well, first of all, the word "musician" (laughs), there are a lot of musicians out there.  Are you talking about Artists maybe that are out there making records today or--
Speaker 1: No, I guess musicians are artists.
Speaker 2: Okay, a lot of them really aren't, you know, musicians.  They're more artists, you know.  I mean like James Brown, I mean James Brown is not a singer.  He's an entertainer, you know.  So, yeah, some of the people that I really enjoy that are out there today, I, I love Sting.  I think he's just one of the greatest.  I love--I mean I like, I love a lot of the productions that are out there today and the sounds, (unclear) like with the theme.  People today?  You know, I don't really listen to a lot of stuff.  I'm in here so much working that I don't really get to hear lots of stuff.  But I mean, but I still love--one of my favorites is Donald Fagen from Steely Dan days now, just a great, just a great songwriter, kinda twisted, but a great songwriter.  I love--let' see what singer do I love?  A lot of great singers out there that sound great.  I mean Whitney [Houston] is like one of the greatest singers out there, you know, god bless her.  And I think the greatest singer--I'm going back here.  I think the greatest singer that, that's one of my favorite singers, is Chaka Khan.  That's somebody I never got to work with.  I always wanted to work with Chaka Khan.  With Chaka, let's do this.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) she has one of the purest voices (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, she is.  She's, phenomenal and I think--and should still be making records and stuff today, I mean.  Just a great, just (unclear).  But, you know, yeah, I listen to a lot of, some of the stuff that's out there today.  There's not a lot of stuff out there today that really sticks out and makes me say, wow, that's great stuff, you know.  And time will tell, you know.  The stuff comes and goes so quickly, I--very few of these people will be playing Vegas in 20 years (laughs) (unclear) not that they want to.  But, you know, the stuff, the real songs stick and stay for a long, long time, you know.  And we'll see.

Speaker 1: Now, you do work for Tom Joyner?
Speaker 2: Yes--right.  Yeah, I do, we do--I've been doing Tom's music for ever since he's been on the, on the ABC Satellite Network, ever since he started the Tom Joyner Morning Show.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) And you do the (unclear) ( inaudible)
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we do all the, all the music, yeah, on the inside, we do "Real Fathers, Real Men" stuff.  We do the "It's Your World Music".  We do the, what, "Christmas Every Tuesday" and stuff.  We do all those little themes and stuff like, plus, his "Oh, oh, oh".  I mean Tom called me when he, when he first--it's a funny story.  When we first started, I worked with Tom 10 years ago, from the date that he called me.  He said, "Butch!"  I said,"Yes, whose this? " He said, "It's Tom."  "Tom, who?"  "Tom Joyner. " I said, "Oh, hey, Tom, how you doing?"  I worked with him about 10 years prior to that, and he told me he was getting ready to start this new show.  And he wanted me to work with him on, on the music.  And so I'm like, wow.  And then he flew me and my wife and a bunch of other creators all, he flew us all to Jamaica.  And we sat down and pow-wowed about his show, you know, his, his--this new Tom Joyner Morning Show.  And I came home, and he told me, I need a theme song.  And one day, I was, I think I was cooking.  And, "Oh, oh, oh, it's the Tom Joyner Morning Show" came up.  And it stuck, you know.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) that show, your most recognized theme--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I love to go to the sky shows and they have that everybody says, (singing) "Oh, oh, oh, it's the Tom Joyner Morning Show".  To hear a bunch of people sing that, that's definitely a high point, yeah.  Yeah, it's cool.  And just to be associated with Tom, doing the type of stuff that he's doing with various--cause he, he--we talked, I mean we talked on the phone for like 2 hours one day before he started the show.  He's telling me all the stuff he was, you know, longing to do in radio.  And he's doing it, you know.  He's really doing it.  So to work with people like him and Oprah, you know, it's just, it's nothing but just great examples.  And I see them doing that in their fields, like what she did in TV, he's doing in radio.  And doggone-it, I'm gonna do it in music.
Story_ID: 13465
Speaker 1: Oh, business-wise, business-wise we have a lot of ventures that we're, and, and product that we're putting out.  One of the primary pieces of programming that we're putting together is called "Uncle Butchie's Live House".  And through Uncle Butchie's Live House, we're going to open the door to talent and film and creativity, all going on within this live house setting, debuting a lot of new artists through there and just a lot of creative concepts.  And through every day you go through, it's gonna be something sweet to watch, yeah.  That's, I'm really looking forward to that.
Speaker 2: So this is going to be an on-going program of (unclear)
Speaker 1: It's somewhat of a talent search, but it'll be selected people that can come into the house.  And it's mainly our, it's like, it's a creative, it's a creative platform.  It'll be filled with musicians of all sorts, creating music of all sorts, all kind of genres of music and debuting musicians and artists from, from all over, you know.  And mainly, it's a, it's a creative house, kind of a haven for the musician-singer kind of person, and the creative person.
Speaker 2: So it's like a club setting?
Speaker 1: It'll feel like a club at times.  It'll feel like a rehearsal studio at times.  It'll be like, it gets real up close and personal.  You'll be able to go into an artist's, you know, room and (unclear).  A lot of it's gonna be on Internet, a lot of Internet programming.  And then we think it's also gonna go into the regular television programming, yeah. So it's that and--see I'm just, there's a lot of, with the Art of Making Music Foundation, hoping to make a really great impact with that cause people are really interested in it.  And they see the importance of it and all.  And we're just moving forward and taking it out to the world.  This year, in 2003, for the company, we've spent all of 2002 just preparing for this year.  We kind incubated all last year, coming up with the material that it took to tell our story and so people could see who we are on DVD, you know.  And so we pulled--we spent all year doing a very high-end representation of who we are.  And this year, it's all about launching all of it.  So people are gonna see who we are, how long we've been around--the point about it that I love is, we've been around for twenty-five years now, going on twenty-five years.  But so much--people still don't know who we are.  And like you said, you had no idea who we are and what we did when you came here, you know.  So people don't know who we are.  Yes, we've got all this experience and background and, and I think just a fire that we're gonna go out and, go out and really make a lot of noise this year and, and change a lot of lives with, with the Art that we create, with the programming that we create and the songs and the, the visuals and the stories that we tell.  My goal for the future is just to, to create a body of work over a period of time that people will be able to say, okay, they changed something there.  You know, they, they changed the way people thought about themselves or they changed the way these people were thinking or that, you know.  The people that I work with here, they all see the vision.  They all see the possibilities.  They all know the, the impact that art and music and all this visual stuff can bring.  Well, that's what we're working on, just bringing it to the world this year and, and believing we're gonna make a big impact.  And one of the primary things that we're doing too, you know, to do all this, especially in this genre--in this field that we're in, is very expensive; very, very expensive.  So, we're, we're calling on the corporate world to--if they like what we're doing, if they see that we're changing lives and if they, you know, if they have a spirit in them that desires to change lives also, you know, send us the dollars.  We'll take care of the vision, you know.  And as you see what we do, I think, I think the corporate World--we're hoping that the corporate world really becomes responsible and helps us play God and heal the things that we're made to heal.

Speaker 1: What are your hopes for the African American community (unclear)?
Speaker 2: My hopes and concerns for the African American community--I would hope that they would, as every man would, I would hope they would return to God, first of all, to realize the importance that, how important we are as a people and as individuals to God.  I mean it's--that's where it all starts from.  And from there, we will know how to nurture and love and share with one another and to build one another up.  I see us tearing each other down.  I've been watching it for years, of us tearing ourselves down.  And it's insane.  It's insanity.  And what I see, humans on a whole doing, I mean man, as a whole, is pretty whacked out here or as it comes down to the African American community, I'd just like to see us know better, you know.  And we have--in our community we have heart.  We have a, we have--there's an earthiness, there's a realness about us.  There's a passion there that you see people like with the Oprah's and the, and the Tom Joyner's and other entrepreneurs who are out there, when they have the opportunity, they help, you know.  They, they mend and they, they bring people together.  And I would just hope as a whole, the African American community would look at these examples and realize that you can be not out there in the, in the public eye.  You can be just a guy in your neighborhood, working 9 to 5 and do exactly the same thing that--forget about even comparing, that you could sit in your neighborhood and make a difference, you know, that you can turn on your passion switch.  You can turn on your love switch, and you can effect your immediate family for starters.  It starts at home.  And the fact that you can go out and change your neighborhood and, and change the world.  It's, it sounds farfetched, it sounds like alien,kind of stuff, but that's where it starts, you know, one person at a time.  You know, when I was coming up in this, I remember I was driving along in a car with, with a guy.  And I, he asked me what I wanted to do with music and whatever.  And I said, "I want to change the world."  And he said, "You can't change the world."  And that's when I said, "I'm going to."  One person at a time, we can do it.  And as a, as an African--in the African American community, that's the one thing I just wish we could really, really get, is that, you know, we can change our lives; we can change the way we're perceived.  We can change the way we affect this world.  And we've made a, we've made a great impact.  We've made a great impact and I think we should be very proud to say, you know, when you look at the work that we have done and, and how we've impacted this world.  And I would just like to see us take it to the next level and begin to heal those things that are jacked up right now (laughs), to put in street terms.

Speaker 2: Thank you, thank you.
Speaker 1: --what do you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I, I'd like to think that I have effected people's lives with that that I do.  I want to do more, you know,  You know, I want people to remember me by, I'd just like to, I'd just like to go and have people say, hey, he inspired, you know.  He, he truly inspired, yeah.
Speaker 1: What do your parents think about your success (unclear)?
Speaker 2: They love it.  They just--my mom [Vergene Stewart]  always says, hurry up and get up there in the Grammy's while we can still know who you are when you get up there (laughs).
Speaker 1: She's raising the bar.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's raising the bar.  She's want, you know, (unclear) they, they're--they love--my parents always boast on, on their children.  Every time I talk to my mom on the phone, "None of my kids never been in jail, dah, dah, dah", you know.  So they're real proud of all of us, you know.  My, my younger brother works here with me, Wayne, and they just think--they love seeing us work together.  You know, they love seeing the, the family business go on.  They, they're excited for us, and they, they know the level we want to go to next.  So they're always praying for us, you know.  We've got, me and my wife's parents, you know, always praying for us so we can get that next level and, that they know we want to be at.  You know, so we always have their support, always.
Speaker 1: Does it ever bother you that most people don't know (unclear).  I mean when they see the commercial, they (unclear) and they don't know who (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, I mean, no, it doesn't really bug me.  I mean, enough people know.  And, you know, I get, you know, the big credit goes by on Oprah, but don't blink.  But it, it goes by, and no, it doesn't bug me at all.  It's, I mean just seeing the response from it, and seeing, and watching it last is enough for me.  You know, cause music can like come and go.  So to have something out there that last and that people latch on to and hold onto, that's, that's enough for me, you know.  And, you know, yeah, that's enough.
Speaker 1: One last question, it's a little bit different.  How would you like to remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  I guess I would like to be remembered as--okay, let me try to pretend like I'm not here (chuckle).  Okay, Butch isn't here.  How is he remembered?  I guess I'd say, I would love people to say that I was, you know, a loving person, yeah, that I was a loving person and that I just affected and changed--I'd like to be remembered for changing--oh, God, this is a toughie.  Is this gonna be edited out?  It's not edited at all.  Oh, this isn't good.  This isn't good.  I'm gonna come up with an answer here.  I'd like to be remembered as a person that, I guess I've said this already, it's almost like I really don't want to be remembered.  I would like to create enough stuff out there that people, after I'm long gone are still being affected by it.  Therefore, not much of a memory, just that very moment that they're still seeing that that I put out there--they're reminded of me.  So I'd rather not be a, like a memory, back in the past kind of thing, but I'd like to do something where people are constantly reminded of who I was by the, you know, the body of creativity that is out there effecting their lives even, you know, years and years (unclear).
