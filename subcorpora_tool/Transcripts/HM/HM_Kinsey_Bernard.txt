Story_ID: 9765
Speaker 1: I'd like to start with your father.  And if you would give his name, what business he's in, and talk about him, and what you know about his background.
Speaker 2: My dad's name is Ulysses B. Bradshaw Kinsey.  He's eighty-six years old, last month, was born in Fort White, Florida from a family of eleven siblings.  He is one of two that are alive.  My family--on my dad's side, one of the interesting things, the family really has good genes in terms of long life.  My aunt, my Aunt Helen, who had polio at three years old, just recently died two years ago at ninety-seven.  I have another aunt that's alive now, that she's ninety-seven or ninety-eight, and Dad's eighty-six and is doing well, so we've been blessed on a lot of levels.
Speaker 1: No, but I want to know about his, did he share anything, I mean what about that side of the family?  Do you know where the name even Kinsey comes from?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't.  Well, we do and we don't.  There was a, a Kinsey out of the Fort White [Florida] area, a white family, that Daddy believed all of this came from.  Dad didn't want to talk about a lot of what happened in Fort White.  My granddad, who worked in a sawmill, got his arm cut off when he was a little, you know, young man, because he had a shirt on and it got pulled inside of this saw.  And, so, there are a lot of not good memories about Fort White because Fort White was near Rosewood in Florida.  I mean that whole area was--and Florida, you gotta remember was a very difficult state, as it is now.  People think about Florida like Miami [Florida] and Palm Beach [Florida], but Florida is basically a rural, agricultural community and it had a lot of the attributes of Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about any, about his growing up, anything he shared with you, I mean more about, you know, his growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was a two-family household, a lot of love in the family.  The kids were very close.  Everybody basically settled in West Palm Beach [Florida] back in the '30s [1930s], and I mean I grew up knowing all my aunts and uncles and it was just, you know, a lot of aunts and uncles. And we all lived within walking distance of each other, and that was one of the fun things about growing up in West Palm Beach [Florida] as a kid.  I mean you go one block this way, you go to one aunt's house and another block, you go to another uncle, and we were all in and out of each others' houses.  All of our cousins were like brothers and sisters.  We were just very, very close, and you just saw a lot of love and sharing, you know, with my mom, I mean my dad's side of the family because they were all in Palm Beach, and, so, all the siblings, we got along really well, and even to this day.
Speaker 1: Now your mother, what about her and her background?
Speaker 2: She [Christine Kinsey] was born in Florence, South Carolina, and Mom just turned eighty in February, and her family settled in Tampa, Florida. And my grandmama and granddad, my granddad died old in the '70s [1970s], early '70s [1970s], and my grandmother died in the mid-eighties [1980s], but both of them lived a long, long time.  We used to go to Tampa every year as kids and didn't, didn't get to know to Mom's sisters and brothers, because her sisters and brothers, one moved to Chicago [Illinois] and one moved to Indiana and another moved to San Diego [California], so Mom was the closest to her mom and dad living in West Palm Beach going to Tampa.  But we used to go to Tampa every summer and spend several weeks, you know, with, with Mom's side of the family. And my grandma used to, she had a wood stove, I remember that.  And we had chickens in the yard, and, you know, and it was, they lived good.  We had, the address was 1505 North B Street in Tampa, Florida.  I never will forget that address.  You would sit out on the front porch on a swing, and they had a pecan tree out front, so it was, it was a good time for us because all five of us, there were five brothers and sisters, we used to get loaded up in the car, and we'd go there and just spend the summer. And that's where, it was almost like living in the country, even though Tampa wasn't the country, but my grandma would cook things that Mom didn't cook, you know, and cook them in ways, you know, the kind of old-fashioned way with the skillet and the wood-fired stove. And, you know, we're wringing chickens' necks and all kind of stuff, you know. So it was a nice, it was a real nice way to spend summer, every summer.
Speaker 1: Now do you--do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: They met at Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] in 1941, 1941.  They've been married sixty years.  Let me make sure I did that right.  I'm not sure.  It may have been earlier, it was earlier than that, so maybe '39 [1939] or something like that.
Story_ID: 9766
Speaker 1: There's a lot of tradition in your family, for Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 2: FAMU, yeah.  It's really one of the more important things for me.  I actually love the school.  I just finished three years as alumni, national alumni president, but, you know, I'm big on legacy and tradition and heritage. And when I grew up, we used to go to the Orange Blossom Classic game in Miami, Florida.  It was like the Negro national championship in football.  And I remember, as a young kid, you know, seven or eight years old, all I wanted to do was play in the Florida A&M band.  That was it.  My mom [Christine Kinsey] had played in the band in the early '40s [1940s], and so all of us grew up musically. I mean, I played French horn.  My brother played trumpet.  My sister played oboe.  Another sister played sax, you know, that kind of thing.  So, we all grew up musically.  Matter fact, the whole Kinsey family, my cousins, they were all in the band, and actually when we would come, if we didn't come to band practice, there was no band, you know, to speak of because there were so many of us and we were all good on our instruments and we were, you know, really contributors, so. But Florida A&M has always had a special place.  If you grew up in Florida, even now, FAMU has a tremendous impact on what has happened with the black middle-class in the state of Florida. So most, many people, you know, contribute a lot of their success to their ability to go to college, and I'm one of those.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think, you know, not a lot, I mean you hear about Florida A&M, I'm just, but a lot is not known about blacks in Florida, you know, that whole component.  Though you know about Rosewood [Florida] just like you're now starting to hear about Tulsa [Oklahoma].
Speaker 2: Tulsa, yeah.  Greenwood [Oklahoma].  Greenwood.  That's a tragic story.
Story_ID: 9767
Speaker 1: I want to take you to what your earliest memories are of growing up, some of your earliest memories.
Speaker 2: Well, we grew up, my dad [Ulysses B. Kinsey] was a schoolteacher, and so he moved, when we moved to West Palm Beach [Florida], he began to teach school at Industrial High back in the, back in Florida in the forties [1940s], there was always--there was one high school, it was Industrial High [School, West Palm Beach, Florida].  And Industrial High was a school for everybody in the county that was black to go to school. So in one respect it was good because everybody knew each other, but it was the only school and the facilities were okay because we didn't know any better, frankly.  But, we grew up in a very segregated environment.  We actually grew up in the projects in West Palm Beach which are still there, you know, some sixty years later. But we grew up and we didn't know that we were poor because that wasn't, that was just, it was an apartment.  Everybody lived in the projects and everybody, you know, got along and it was just a good, a good experience, a very good experience.
Speaker 1: Now, give me your siblings in order. Because you have an older--.
Speaker 2: Bradshaw, Bradshaw Phillip Kinsey, he's fifty, he's a year older than I am, so he's fifty-eight.  And then I have a sister, Cassandra, that is fifty-six and then another sister, Sheryl Kinsey, who's fifty-five and then a younger sister who's fifty, Linda, and she's the one in San Diego [California] working with Xerox now.
Speaker 1: So did you, okay, but I'm wanting you to go back to just memories, memories of just home life, memories of yourself, you know how we--.
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things I remember about Mom [Christine Kinsey].  While, we weren't poor by any stretch of the imagination, but my mom had this ability to--she was frugal and one of the things that I've gotten from her is this frugality, you know, it's really been a big impact.  In other words, Mom made sure that we, the boys, but everybody learned how to sew and wash and iron and all the basic stuff that really made a big difference as I grew up.  But I used to remember going to the grocery store with Mom and, while Dad made a decent salary, it was not enough with five kids, and Mom used to buy just enough food for every meal.  I mean she had an ability to count out almost every grain of rice, I mean, and she figured this thing out.  And I used to marvel at how well she managed the money and it made our ability to do things that in other households they couldn't do even though the people made the same amount of money Dad made.  In other words, Dad was able to buy a new car.  In 1950, Dad built a new house, which was, I mean even by today's standard, is a big house.  I mean it was on one of the nicer corners in the black community.  It had a big yard, you know, it had an inside garage, it was air-conditioned.  I saw the Democratic Convention in 1952 on television, you know.  So, you know, all of this was done because of Mom and her ability to make things work, and even now, you know, I marvel at how well she manages things, and I think, to a large degree, I got a lot of my management ability from my mom, you know.  And, we call her the Jewish mom, because she's very aggressive.  She loves her kids, and, you know, she's outspoken and I have a lot of those qualities, you know.
Speaker 1: Now what sights, sounds and smells do you associate with growing up?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  Pork chops.  Mom frying pork chops.  That was one of the things we really enjoyed.  Pork chops and baked beans was one of our favorites.  And Sunday dinner, which was, well, as a family, we always ate dinner together, I mean.  And we waited 'til Dad came home before we ate.  So, as a family, we really were close in that regard.  We had, we had our meals together. And it was the kind of situation where you couldn't be late or you wouldn't--in other words, if one of the siblings were late eating, you probably was not gonna get your part, because people would just eat it, you know, my brother particularly. So we used to be there on time, in other words.  And it's probably like in a lot of black families, I mean, in this case, Dad was the breadwinner and, in those days, I mean, he set, he set the tone.  I mean when he sat down, we all sat down.  When he started eating, we all ate, you know, that kind of thing.  But, it was a great, it was a great way to grow up.  I remember when we used to have puzzles, and this just popped in my mind, that all of us used to work on, I mean huge puzzles.  They used to fill the dining room table up, and one of the things we wanted to do was to finish it before Sunday dinner, so we could take it apart to eat. But we used to work on puzzles a lot in our house, and the five of us used to get in, and we'd all take a piece of it, and it was a, it was a pretty competitive family, you know, even among the siblings, in terms of working your part and making sure all of it, that it all happened, so.
Story_ID: 9768
Speaker 1: Tell me what schools you went to.  You went to what, where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to the same school that my dad [Ulysses B. Kinsey] went to, Industrial High [School, West Palm Beach, Florida], which turned into being Palm View Elementary [School for the Arts, West Palm Beach, Florida] and, so, and now it's U.B. Kinsey Palm View Elementary.  They named the school in 19--, I think, '88 [1988] after him, the first time they named the school after someone living in the history of the county, so dad told them basically, "I don't need something named after me when I'm dead.  If you're gonna do it, do it now."  And what's significant about it is that Industrial is over a hundred years old, but has been selected about ten years ago to be a magnet school, so now, like sixty or seventy percent of the population is white.  It's an art school right in the heart of the black community.  So, Dad kind of did, he just done a lot of wonderful things for Palm Beach County in the state of Florida, but one of the things that he did was to make sure that the designation became a magnet school because he knew that's how it would get funded and now, I mean, it is just, it has just grown. It's a huge school right in the middle of the community, and you could see all of the housing and businesses taking off around it, so it's really been a catalyst for the black community in West Palm Beach [Florida], growing and changing.  And, so, I'm real proud whenever I go back to Palm Beach and I drive by U. B. Kinsey Elementary and see that school because I went there.  My brother [Bradshaw Phillip Kinsey], and sisters [Cassandra, Cheryl Kinsey, Linda] went there, and, and, you know, our great grandkids will be going there, so it's, it's pretty powerful.
Speaker 1: Now he, so, are you saying that he taught there also?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: He taught there when you were going?
Speaker 2: He taught there.  Well, when I--when we started going to school, he was the principal.  So, my dad was the principal there for forty-eight years.  So, when he retired like in the late '80s [1980s], you know, it was after, you know, just forty-eight years.  I mean even in the seventies [1970s] when, you know, it was integration, but it hadn't been integrated, people were coming, whites were coming to Dad's school because Palm View Elementary was rated as one of the top ten schools in the state of Florida, in reading, in math, in elementary school.  So, people were bringing their kids in to Palm View even before it became a magnet school, so it's always had a great reputation.  And my dad is really one of these guys that, he's always believed in high standards.  I mean it was years before I ever saw him without a tie on.  I mean he was just that kind of guy.  Anytime he left the house, he had a tie on, and he was really well respected and revered in a lot of places and his expectations for you and everything he did was just extremely high.  So, you know, I mean I had a great role model from both my mom and dad's side.  I'll give you an example.  Palm View Elementary was always immaculate.  I mean you could eat off the sidewalk.  I mean the grass was always cut.  The bathrooms were always clean.  I mean he just insisted on these kinds of standards.  So, if you talk to any kid that's gone to U. B. Kinsey Elementary, even now, that's one of the things they would talk about.  You know, the expectation for decorum, how you look, how you talk, how you behave, those kind of things.  So, you know, it really made a difference in kids.  So, when I go back to West Palm Beach, the Kinsey name is a, you know, a really an important name.  And one of the things that I tell our son all the time, he knows this because he, he's really connected, you know, to Palm Beach and to his grandparents, is just how important it is to carry on the name and to do the name justice, you know, and to be, to do it well.
Speaker 1: Now how did your father come to Palm Beach [Florida]?  Do you know that story?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know that story.  He graduated from, from Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  He wanted to go to law school, and it was very difficult to go to law school, being black at that time, so he ended up teaching school kind of as a subset, and taught school for, you know, for a number of years until he became the principal, and really was the principal there for many, many years.  Dad had a chance to be superintendent and all kinds of jobs and never really wanted to do that because he always felt that he could have the biggest impact on the kids by actually being there, you know, teaching.
Speaker 1: Now how was it then going to school where your father was principal?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Tough.  Tough.  Tough.  I mean this was, this was not good.  We were held to higher standards by all the teachers.  One of the worst whippings I've ever gotten was by Coach Eckles when I was in the sixth grade.  You know, because it was like, "Either I'm gonna whip you or your dad's gonna whip you," you know.  So, we usually ended up getting two whippings, you know, because he'd find out and we'd get another whipping, you know.  And back in those days, you know, it would be child abuse today, if the same thing happened.  But back in those days, you'd get a strap out real quick and just go to whaling, you know.  And it was just the way things were done, but we really didn't have a lot of room for error, you know, being one of, and, you know, which was interesting. We got, we had teachers that resented my dad, so we, we felt some of that, so there was a little stuff that went on, but, on balance, it was very good. It was very good.
Story_ID: 9769
Speaker 1: That's when I really started playing a musical instrument [during elementary school, Palm View Elementary School for the Arts, West Palm Beach, Florida].  Mrs. Janie Miles was the music teacher, and she taught music and, you know, and that kind of got my musical career going.
Speaker 2: What year was this?  What grade were you in?
Speaker 1: Like the fourth grade.
Speaker 2: Fourth grade.
Speaker 1: And we used to start off on these little plastic flutes and that's how, that's how we started, and then we had a little band in high school [Roosevelt High School, West Palm Beach, Florida].  I used to tumble, if I remember correctly back, you know, I was a hell of a tumbler, I used to jump over like twelve or fourteen people stacked up, and back in, her husband, Coach Miles was the tumbling teacher.  I had forgotten about that.  But that was something that I enjoyed a lot, that and swimming, you know, was a big deal.
Speaker 2: So, did you, were there things that you gravitated to subject matter-wise?  You know, I mean, I still would like to be in elementary school, but I mean were there things that you, you know, you gravitated to or--?
Speaker 1: I think geography was something that I really always liked.  Although it was like the eighth grade before it really became compelling.  You know, I've mentioned that [wife] Shirley [Pooler] and I, we've gone to about sixty-five countries, but that really emanated from my eighth-grade teacher, Mr. McDonnell, who really was a, just a tremendous geography teacher and really just opened up the world to, to me and my classmates by showing us where everything was and what the significance of it was and then related that back to, you know, how that could be important.  So, like the Parthenon, for instance, was a building that I had, I mean I've always wanted to go, so one of the first places we went was Greece to see the Parthenon, that type of thing.  So, I think geography had a big role, although, you know, I got a major in mathematics, which, so the Sputnik thing got me, so I wanted to be an engineer. So I went to school and became a mathematician and never used it really, but it was helpful.
Speaker 2: I don't know if you would not say you used it.  That's not, you were in business, so I mean.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you know what, because you're right.  I am very good at taking disparate things and making sense of it.  I can take, I can take things that have no connection to them and make sense out of them.  And I believe that, you know, my mathematical training, like calculus and parabolic and all that stuff, you know, trained me to think, you know, that way, and so--it's particularly good in terms of organization because, generally, you don't have clear notions of what the causal problem is, and you have to put a lot of disparate things together to be able to put a full picture together. And then I always say, you have to be right, you know, at the end.  And judgment is one thing that I think I'm pretty good at.
Story_ID: 9770
Speaker 1: I'm back still with you young, because I'd like to always know what forms a person.  So, here you are, the younger son, right?
Speaker 2: Mh-hm.
Speaker 1: And I'm just wondering, you know, what type of child were you?  Were you rambunctious?  Were you quiet?  Were you shy?  Were you mischievous?
Speaker 2: No.  I was a good, I was a good, actually I did, like in elementary school [Palm View Elementary School for the Arts, West Palm Beach, Florida], we were all very good, I mean, I was a very good.  I was a very good student all the way through.  I didn't really "turn out," as Mom [Christine Kinsey] would say, until I got to college.  And my brother [Bradshaw Phillip Kinsey] and I, we kind of switched roles.  He was the hell-raiser in, you know, in growing up, and he became the model student in college, and I, you know, took his other role.  So, we used to give Mom and Dad [Ulysses B. Kinsey] fits with that.  One experience from elementary school, they used to have, you know, like school outings that I remember.  We used to go to a place called Silver Springs, Florida, where they had all this crystal-clear water.  And we used to look, go to Key West [Florida], Tampa [Florida], and one of the things we used to do in elementary school, and my dad used to encourage, was to get kids out on field trips, you know, to different places in Florida.  So, I remember we used to get up at four o'clock in the morning and get loaded on this bus and the assistant principal, Mrs. Fluellen (ph.), she was a  real taskmaster.  She had about eight in the seat, you know, going over there. But we used to have a wonderful, wonderful time.  So, to a large degree, when you grew up at Palm View, and went to school in Palm View, you began to see--you had a world that was bigger than West Palm Beach, which I'm sure had a big impact on me late in life because I really have always wanted to see what was around this next corner.
Speaker 1: Now, did you, okay, but you say you were a good child, basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Good student.
Speaker 1: Were you, did you have an imaginative mind?  Did a lot of things just strike you?  Or were you more adventuresome and sort of exploring?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a Cub Scout.  I was a Cub Scout and really was a Boy Scout up to my sophomore year in college [Florida A&M, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], and love, love scouting, still like scouting.  I think it's one of the best things you can do.  And, you know, I sang in the choir in Tabernacle [Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church, West Palm Beach, Florida], which is one of the two oldest churches in, in Palm Beach, West Palm Beach [Florida], over a hundred years old, both of them.  So, you know, church was a big deal on Sunday.  We'd go to Sunday school church, BTU [Baptist Training Union], you know, that whole thing, and then on the fifth Sunday, then all of us would sing in the choir, so that was a big deal.  And I remember Mrs. Miles, the same lady that taught, taught us flute, she was the choir director, and she was very good.  I mean, so we did a lot of very special things early, musically and, I was always good with people early.  I mean, you know, working, we wouldn't call it working then, but, you know, just getting along.  I mean I always learned to get along.  Now being a Kinsey back in those days just made me think about something.  Being a Kinsey and being light-skinned was a problem because a lot of the other kids, even though they respected and revered my dad, there was a lot of resentment because we lived very, very well, I mean comparatively to a lot of people.  And our home, where it was situated, was a home where you couldn't miss it, you know, one of these deals.  So, so I grew up, probably more so than Brad [brother, Bradshaw Phillip Kinsey], really wanting to belong more than Brad wanted to belong.  Brad didn't give a doggone, you know, about that, where I did. So I spent a lot of time outside of my air-conditioned home in sweltering houses with my friends, you know, trying to get along and becoming friends with them and developed a lot of good skills doing that, you know.  I mean it really broke down tremendous barriers.  And I don't know, but growing up light-skinned in the South, you know, had its own, had its own issues.
Story_ID: 9771
Speaker 1: Well, you know, growing up in West Palm Beach [Florida] in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], you know, colored mattered, I mean whether you like it or not.  And it was just  an interesting thing because the Kinsey dad [Ulysses B. Kinsey] was the principal of the elementary school [U.B. Kinsey / Palmview Elementary School of the Arts, West Palm Beach, Florida]  and, for  that, had stature professionally and, in some cases, made more money than most people.  They  put him in the same status with doctors and lawyers and things like that.  You know, we were,  we used to feel it sometimes, if not all the time, that being a Kinsey, you thought you were better  than somebody else and so forth and so forth.  And, it really was true about, you know, the  brown paper bag test.  I mean people, they may not want to deal with that, but it was true.  You know, "If you're black, jump back.  If you're brown, stick around," you know, that whole thing,  so. But at an early age, I really never liked that, you know, and none of us really liked it, although Brad didn't try and, and deal with it the same way I did.  I wanted to make everybody  know we were okay, so I spent an enormous amount of time with them.  And I think my son,  Khalil [Kinsey], does that even now, spends a great deal of time, you know, converting people, you know,  that we're okay.  You know, that type of thing.  And from that, you get a lot of socialization skills, you know, and I think, you know, I became very good at it. But in West Palm Beach, my  granddad, the one that had his arm cut off, had Kinsey Grocery.  I gotta tell you about  Rosemary [Avenue], because Rosemary, like most streets in black communities, was the street of all the  businesses.  And, frankly, when I grew up, where we grew up, there was no need to go to any  white business because we had everything right there on Rosemary.  We lived on Douglas [Avenue] and four blocks away was Kinsey Grocery and that started this whole business community.  I mean  we had our few nightclubs that had the Duke Ellingtons, and, you know, anybody that was  anybody, the Sunset [Cocktail] Lounge.  And here's the other thing, in West Palm Beach, almost  everybody went to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] or  Bethune-Cookman [College, Daytona Beach, Florida].  So if you were professional, you went to these  two schools, you graduated from Industrial High [School, West Palm Beach, Chicago, Illinois] and you came back to West Palm Beach and  you opened your business or you became a teacher or a lawyer or whatever the case may be.  So,  you know, dress shops and grocery stores and whatever you wanted was on Rosemary, so it was  a wonderful time.  I used to go down and work at my granddaddy's store as my dad worked at  his dad's store and my uncle, Uncle Bill, who worked there full time, so it was my granddaddy,  Uncle Bill, and my dad used to all help out. But if you wanted sausages or pork chops, the best  sausage and meats in town were there.  I mean whites used to come from Palm Beach to shop at  my granddad's store because it had the best produce and meats and all that kind of stuff.  And,  so, you know, I was real proud of being Kinsey because, you know, it was a big deal.  You  know, I mean on one side of the family, my dad was educated and on the other side, you know,  we had, you know, this entrepreneurial piece and, you know, it was just a real close-knit, you  know, community with my cousins and that whole thing.  So, I used to love going down on  Rosemary and, you know, going to my granddad's store.

Speaker 1: ...me about what that really meant to you.  You start out as a Cub Scout and you went on long for this?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a Life, I was a Life Scout.  I really should have gotten my Eagle Scout, and I  just didn't.  I was four merit badge, badges from getting it. But what scout, scouting gave me an opportunity to demonstrate that I could do something well.  I think that's what, what it did.  When I became a scout, I started my merit badge program, but I learned that I was a good  swimmer, I mean a very good swimmer, and by the time I was sixteen, I was, I could basically  out swim anybody, I mean I don't care who it was.  And I got my lifeguard certification and was given the responsibility to run the waterfront at Frederick M. Smalls Boy Scout Camp for the  whole Palm Beach County [Florida].  I mean this was a big deal.  And this was another good  experience because in Palm Beach County, all the boys from Palm Beach County would come  and scout, you know.  So, I got to know everybody in Palm Beach County and they got to know  me, and it was a lot of responsibility for a sixteen-year old kid to run the waterfront.  I had all the canoes and, I mean, you could not touch the water unless I wanted you in the water.  I mean, and we had a hundred kids every Sunday come in to camp and everybody would say on Sunday, we  had swimming trials, they could swim, and we would pull fifty of them out every Sunday.  I  mean, it was just like clockwork because nobody wanted to admit that they couldn't swim until  they almost drowned.  So, at an early age, I got a chance to not only become a leader but to have  a great deal of responsibility and I really cherish the notion of that. And it wasn't just  responsibility of keeping kids safe, but I had to set up the water, the whole waterfront, when two  weeks before camp, there wasn't a barge, not a, I mean we had to paint all the boats, we had to  put up all the tents, we had to put up all of the courts for the different levels of swimming,  I  mean, we had to dredge some.  I mean we just had to do a lot of work, and I had that  responsibility.  And, you know, I used to really like the fact that Mr. Adams, who was a scoutmaster, saw in me, you know, and gave me that kind of responsibility so early.  And then I  picked my team, you know, of lifeguards and, for like, until my sophomore year in college [Florida A&M, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], that's what I did in the summer.  People used to do a lot of things, but I used to go back and be a scout,  and became a member of the Order of the Arrow, which is a honor scouting fraternity, which is a  big deal.  And just, just very good memories from that period, even to now, I think it was, you  know, a great experience that, you know, I think all kids should get an opportunity to do.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you think you learned from your scouting experience, any other  lessons, you know, besides leadership and sort of team building?
Speaker 2: Well, I learned that there were so many skills that you could learn.  You know, I mean skill sets are really, and I'm big on skill sets now.  I mean there was a way to tie a rope, there was a way to cook, there was a way to clean, there was a way to do everything and it was kind of  like the scouting way, but frankly, it was the right way to do most stuff.  And, I mean, to learn  about birds at an early age or how to fish.  I mean just stuff you take for granted but there is a  way to do that and, even to this day, I am very big on practice learning.  In other words, I like, I'm very orderly about everything I do, and I believe there is always an end point to how you  start something.  In other words, I was with the sheriff the other day, Lee Barker [UNABLE TO VERIFY], and I was  telling he and his staff that you have to always know what your headlines are and most people  start, don't know what the headline is, so they end up having the 'L.A. Times' write it.  So, if you know what you want as an outcome of the story, you're more apt to get that outcome by starting  with that vision of your future.  So, that was one of the things that I used to really like, you  know, like about that.
Story_ID: 9773
Speaker 1: Now, church, were there other things you were learning at church at the same time?
Speaker 2: Oh, church was a great, great, great experience.  Well, we kind of had to go, so it wasn't  like, so once you had to go, you kind of have to figure out whether you should make this the best  we can do.  So, you know, I mean that was pretty traditional stuff, you know.  But I think  ground, you know, frankly, coming, Mom [Christine Kinsey] and Dad [Ulysses B. Kinsey] are just a special couple for, I mean, I have  never seen them argue, you follow me?  I still see them in love today and they're going to be celebrating their sixtieth anniversary December 28th of this year.  So, you know, I mean when you grow up with that kind of thing, and not that we were that religious a family on Mondays through Saturdays, because we weren't.  I mean there was not the Bible meeting and all that kind  of stuff, but the family was really grounded on good principles, how to treat each other, you  know, and Dad and Mom to us, and we to them and them to each other and you saw that with  how, you know, Mom was with her sister-in-laws.  I mean they got, everybody got along, you  know, so it was just the right environment.  And it's almost the way it should be.  I mean some people talk about religion so much and then don't practice it and in our house, we thought, we  didn't talk about it much, but it was just a lot of good, solid, I would say you treat people right.  And I always saw Daddy do that.  I mean, very respectful, he called everybody sir, even now, and I've even picked that up because it really is a normalizing kind of way to deal with people, and it really lets them know that you will start with this notion of respect.
Story_ID: 9774
Speaker 1: So you are, so you go, your elementary goes to what?
Speaker 2: To Roosevelt [High School, West Palm Beach, Florida].
Speaker 1: To Roosevelt.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, big time, Roosevelt, so now we got a high school that was just started.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they  finally gave us a high school, you know, one of these big deals.  So, Industrial [High School, West Palm Beach, Florida], Palm View [U.B. Kinsey / Palmview Elementary School, West Palm Beach, Florida].  Now we have Roosevelt.  So we lived on 7th Street, Roosevelt was on 15th [Street] and I started there in eighth grade, seventh grade, and Roosevelt was a big deal because it was the only black high school in West Palm Beach [Florida].  So, the rivalries that came out of Roosevelt with all the other black high schools in Broward County [Florida], Dade [Miami-Dade] County [Florida] and the rest of  Palm Beach County [Florida] were wonderful, so you get to know everybody in all of those areas, and all of those people ended up at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical  University, Tallahassee, Florida].  I mean it just, it was just, I mean, you know. See, I have never been a big proponent  of integration.  I have been a big proponent of desegregation because what we gave away in this notion of integration was all these connections, all these networks that, frankly, were very  powerful, and I have never been a proponent that, some kind of way, sitting next to white folks was going to make me better or was gonna, some kind of, enhance me some kind of way.  So, you know, because Dad [Ulysses B. Kinsey] never believed that.  Because Dad said Palm View was one of the best elementary schools in the state when it was all-black, so why are we going, you know, rushing to  go some place? You know, that kind of thing.  And, so it's just, it's a mentality that we were allowed to, you know, let go of and it really cost us all of our black businesses.  I mean, today,  our black businesses in every city in America have been just decimated because we, we decided  that we could no longer, you know, we wanted to go the malls in the suburbs, and, in doing that,  it really just shattered the very essence of what the black community was.
Story_ID: 9775
Speaker 1: Now, so when you, so when you go to Roosevelt [High School, West Palm Springs, Florida], this is a big deal.  Your father, you're in a school where your father's [Ulysses B. Kinsey's] not principal?
Speaker 2: Big time.  Big time.
Speaker 1: Freedom.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you go from a small school to a nice, humungous, and you're dealing with,  you know, upperclassmen, you know, and now the influence of my cousins, also Kinseys, were  really important because, like Andrew, was like, you know, like a junior or a senior, so they took  care of us, you know, so we came in and, you know, it was, so we were always on the right side  of things in terms of, and we began to play in the band and, you know, that made a difference  and, you know, that whole thing, so.
Speaker 1: So a lot was centered around the band and the games and athletics?
Speaker 2: Oh, big time.  Yeah, it was big, yeah.  My sister was Miss Roosevelt, which is a big deal,  you know, huge deal.  And I mean I was the senior class president, junior class, I mean I did, you  know, did all the stuff, you know.  Growing up, and here's an interesting thing, in 1960 they  used to have a state exam and, as I said, my brother used to just really be a rabble rouser, you  know, in high school, and the state exam, I think the high score was 495. Well, the class of '60  [1960], which was the class ahead of me, took it before we took it.  And I'm telling you, people  that never thought these kids were any good, scored in the high 400s.  My cousin made 495 out of 495, (unclear) Kinsey.  I mean still one of the smartest people I've ever met, he went on to a  Ph.D. at Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, DC], and, you know, the whole thing, tough brother as they would say.  But my brother did the same.  But my brother [Bradshaw Phillip Kinsey] just blew the test away.  And all of a sudden,  people began to see that he was smart, and that's what changed him, I think, because all these  guys that had been kind of rabble rousers but were really smart and came from good families, but  just weren't that interested in school, showed these 430, 450 point scores on the state exam and it  really changed their lives.  And my brother, I could say this about Brad.  Brad was really the only  athlete.  He's 6 [feet] 3 [inches].  He played on the state championship team that ended up, this is1960, going  to Pearl High [School, Nashville, Tennessee] in Tennessee state, Tennessee and we lost by one point for the national  championship, National black high school championship back in 1960, so, you know, Brad is  the star athlete in the family.  He's a good basketball player.  Although he's played in the band  and whole thing, too, so. But I think that changed Brad probably more than anything else  because he went to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] the next  year as a number of these guys and they just, they just, they just, he just changed.  He was the  student government president of Florida A&M, counseling.  He did all the things that I didn't  do when I got there.  I just said, "Man, I don't want to do none of this," you know.
Story_ID: 9776
Speaker 1: You were active in the band, not so much athletics though?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Speaker 1: You were active in the band, though, in the student government organization?
Speaker 2: Well, in high school [Industrial High School, West Palm Beach, Florida].
Speaker 1: That was in high school.
Speaker 2: Senior class president.  And I really had a lot of sway in high school.  I mean I was a, I  was a leader then, I mean big time leader.  I mean I was on the oratorical, the plays, I mean I did  the whole, you know, the whole nine yards.  And one of the things I picked up in trying to  belong in this color thing, I learned how to gamble at a very early age, being down on Rosemary [Avenue, West Palm Beach, Florida],  because there was a pool hall next door, so I learned how to play pool, shoot crap and play tough.  And I learned one of the other kind of formative things was in, people used to call me 'Little  Kinsey',  but from a gambling thing, they thought I was an easy mark, so they used to always  think I had money and then they could beat me well.  And then they learned that they couldn't do either.  You know, and, so I developed, at a fairly early age, you know, like junior high and high school, that 'Little Kinsey' was one of the boys because I was well accepted, because I could play pool, shoot crap and play cards and was probably better than most people doing that, and so I developed another kind of reputation in town which Mom [Christine Kinsey] and Dad [Ulysses B. Kinsey] didn't care for that much. But  I, actually I, a lot of my money made in college [Florida A&M, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] was made gambling.  You know, I used to wear  them out, so, I mean, that was a whole other kind of, part of my formative years in terms of  growing up, but it was another way I was trying to become accepted and then I learned that there  was a skills set.  As a matter of fact, at an early age, I learned how to count cards real good.  I  mean I knew where all the fifty-two cards were almost all the time.  I could and I knew, I mean I  had this photographic mind, so I began to know, I mean I applied a lot of skill to this game called  playing cards and even in college, I became very, very good, you know, and actually played,  played, gambled all the way through my senior year until I got married [to Shirley Pooler] and then I quit and I  haven't played since.  But, but that was a way for me to gain, to get easy money, as I would call  it, you know.
Story_ID: 9777
Speaker 1: Now who, was anybody else influencing you?  You know, any of your cousins, the band,  you know, you were being accepted so you were developing your street skills.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So to speak, but  was there anything else or anyone else who influenced you?
Speaker 2: Well, Mr. Adams, our Boy Scout, Boy Scout director, he was big.  Mr. McDonald.  Mr. Kurtsey (ph.), my band director, was a big influence.  He gave me the first book on [William] Shakespeare which really got me reading literature, which was interesting, and he's one these  guys, he was a math major, but he ended up being music director, and he was really powerful, a  powerful influence on, I guess, all of us, because we all played under him. But he was, he was  just not a guy who would go easily.  He always demanded a lot of you and even his gift of a  book of Shakespeare was an interesting gift from a band director to one of his students.
Speaker 1: It was a very interesting gift.  It's something I could see your English teacher giving but  not your music teacher.
Speaker 2: But he was that kind of guy.  He really had a lot of, he really had a lot of hope and desire  in my ability to go further, you know.
Story_ID: 9778
Speaker 1: You probably also think of, there's a big correlation between music and mathematics?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Big.  Big.  Big.  Yeah, huge, huge.
Speaker 1: I never realized that.
Speaker 2: I'm still, I mean music is still a big part of my life as the Florida A&M [Florida  Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] band.  I mean I love this band, you know.  I mean we  go back every year, since '84 [1984], for homecoming and even for a second game and, you  know.  One of my big thrills is to conduct the Florida A&M marching band ['Marching 100'], so when I go back, you know, they allow me to, to, to conduct this magnificent three hundred-piece, you  know, musical machine, because that's what they are.  These boys, these young kids, can just  play their butts off, you know, and I could go back for years and, as a matter of fact, just  yesterday, or maybe just today, Dr. William P. Foster, who is someone that you should, you  should, he, he created the band in 1941, the Florida A&M.  He's eighty-seven years old, and  he's just magnificent.  He was at FAMU for fifty-two years, and created the best band in  America.  I mean we got the Sudler award [sic, Sudler Trophy], not as the best black band, but as the best band, you  know, that kind of thing, and Dr. Foster was a big influence, but they're writing a book on him right now and they asked me to, to put some reflection, and I put in there a lesson of a lifetime.  My sophomore year, 1963, or maybe my junior year, I was upperclassman, well positioned in the band, we were in Miami [Florida] for the 1963 NFL [National Football League] Championship game.  Dr. Foster had called  practice, you understand.  I was kind of like one of these guys, "I ain't going to practice," so me  and the boys, we didn't go to practice.  We were in Miami.  We hung out, and he wouldn't let me march the next day. Big, big impact on me.  The next day in 'The Miami Herald', they showed  the band, an aerial shot, and you could see my empty space on the front page of 'The Miami Herald.'  I never will forget this.  So, and this story I wrote, just yesterday, to Dr. Foster to be in this book, it's called 'A Lesson for a Lifetime' and it was about this experience in 1963 and  what that taught me was that you gotta do it all the time.  In other words, there's a concept called 'fill in the lanes.'  In other words, you have to, you just have to do your work all the time.  You  just can't let anything, you know, in other words, you don't have any credits in reserve.  You just  have to just go about it, and, but this was a big, big disappointment on my part, and I decided that  that wouldn't happen anymore.  And, frankly, I have not had those kind of major  disappointments because I did not do my part.
Story_ID: 9779
Speaker 1: When it's time for you to go off to, I mean there's no question where you're going?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  I mean I was like, you know, I think I came out of the womb wanting to go  FAMU [Florida A&M, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 1: So, you get there and it's, you're away from home, that's one thing.
Speaker 2: Big time.
Speaker 1: Big time.
Speaker 2: Big time, yeah.  As Mom [Christine Kinsey] would say, I went hog wild.  All I wanted to do was to play in the band, and  that's what I did.  I mean I love the band, you know, because it was such a competitive organization.  In other words, I still believe it's probably the most powerful organization I've  ever belonged to, of all the things I've done, being a member of the Florida A&M band really  rates as one of the highlights of my, my life.  Because it's the only place, we used to say, "We  don't rate ourselves against other bands, we rate ourselves against other Florida A&M bands."  In other words, the band of 1961 would say, "We were better than the band of 1970" or something.  But we would not worry about [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] or Michigan State [University, Lansing, Michigan] and all these kind of places.  As a matter of fact, the dean of the school of music at the University of Southern California is a friend of mine.  He played at the University of Michigan when I was playing at  Florida A&M.  And we knew of each other and we had high regard for each other.  And it was  interesting.  He sat at this dinner table and we ended up in my office looking at videos of the  Florida A&M marching band with Ben [Benjamin] Zander, who is the conductor for the Boston Philharmonic [Orchestra].  He didn't know anything about the Florida A&M band.  I said, "You gotta be  kidding?"  I said, "Let's give you a tutorial right quick."  So, we leave the wives here, and we're all in, this is one of, remember we were talking about these salon dinners, this is another one,  where we put together a musical group and we're in there looking at tapes of the Florida A& M band, and so it's something.
Story_ID: 9780
Speaker 1: Can you just talk about, you know, since you mentioned Dr.
Speaker 2: Foster. Dr. [William P.] Foster.
Speaker 1: Foster.  What, how did it generate, what was its generation?  Do you know why it got started and why it became,  because it is, it is the thing that, you know, Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and  Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 2: It's the icon.  It's the icon, yeah.  Well, Dr. Foster came from the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] and really couldn't find a job any place else, you know, basically, and Mr. Kurtsey [ph.D] who was my high school band director, was the band director at Florida A&M.  I mean, he was just, you know, and that's, my mom [Christine Kinsey] was in the band under Mr. Kurtsey, see?  So, there's a story  about they went to Tampa [Florida] and Mom lost her cymbal because she and dad [Ulysses B. Kinsey] were hanging out.  You know, so, it was that kind of thing.  So, so when Dr. Foster took over the band, Mr. Kurtsey  had moved to Palm Beach [Florida] and took over the music department at Roosevelt [Middle School, West Palm Beach, Florida].  You know, so, I  mean, there's a lot of connection there.  But Dr. Foster created this, what he called, he has a book called 'A Pageantry of Marching Bands' [sic, 'Band pageantry: A guide for the marching band'] and it's, it's, it's the gospel on how marching bands can be more exciting to watch, so he created like the horn movement.  He created, we were one  of the first bands to have white bass horns, I mean, like, in the early sixties [1960s], we started  that.  We used to do all kinds of formations at, you know, musical formations that actually  moved and things like that, and we were noted for our high marching knee length, the slowness of our march and the fastness of our march.  In other words, we had a thing called 'The Death  March' which was like sixty steps a minute, and then we had where we came on at three hundred sixty steps a minute.  So, we go from one extreme to another extreme almost like that, and very  visually exciting performances to watch, you know.  Matter fact, one of the best experiences in  1991, I had just stepped down from being cluster chairman at Florida A&M.  We raised  about nine million [dollars] for them, and they had [wife] Shirley [Kinsey] and I come on the field and the band serenaded  us for halftime, which is still one of my highlights, you know, I mean this was a big deal.
Speaker 1: What did you learn and what did Dr. Foster, in terms of, because you're in a high school band, but this is like the creme de la creme of things.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, this is, this is.
Speaker 1: So, I'm just wondering what did you rehearse?  How much you were rehearsing, you know?  What was?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was unbelievable.  First of all, you would go to school, we started school in the  middle of August for two weeks before anybody came.  We came at the same time the football  team came.  And you probably heard of Jake Gaither.  He's the eleventh most winningest  football coach in history.  He was at FAMU as a coach, so we was to do calisthenics with the  football team.  We used to do all our exercises.  They would go and do block and attack and we  would go get our instruments and do, you know.  But it was enormously difficult to make this  band, so everybody that came had this very high expectation and also this fear factor, because  most people didn't make the band.  And Dr. Foster, and one of the things that was interesting is it  was a student-run band, so sectionally, we were very important.  So, Dr. Foster figured out, even  back in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s], that he could not do this alone, so he encouraged students to become leaders early at early ages, so every section leader had responsibility for that section. And I'll give you an example, that meant the music, that meant all the marching, you know, where you're supposed to be, when you're supposed to be, all of that.  And we had a rule  at FAMU that you could do almost anything that you wanted to do, but the whole, the whole section had to do the same thing.  In other words, there was no individuality.  There may be  sections, in other words, the French horn section could do something, but we all had to do that.  If we wanted to move our horns like that, everybody had to move their horns like that.  One guy  couldn't do it and the other couldn't.  So, it made for a really a (unclear) of accord and  camaraderie and just is, you know, just this feeling of accomplishment.
Story_ID: 9781
Speaker 1: ...A successful life?
Speaker 2: (Off-camera, unclear)
Speaker 1: Okay, you need three things to have a successful life.  You need something to do, someone to love, and something to look forward to.  So, you really  have to, you have to have all those components. So I'm always asking myself about those  components, and, you know, I'm a big planner, even now, about what we're going to do next  year, you know, in terms of our lives.  And, you know, to be married thirty-five years [to Shirley Kinsey], you gotta keep it interesting, which means you gotta always be, you know, working on the very thing that  you say is important, you know, which is, you know, how you treat each other, you know, make  things work.  So, you know, that's big to me, you know, those are the things that make me want  to get up in the morning and go out here and work a little harder so I can enjoy, you know, enjoy  our lives together more.
Story_ID: 9782
Speaker 1: So, now you met her.  Do you want to talk about your meeting with her?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, we met.  No--what was it?  It was like, no it wasn't November, it was  like the first week of school in '63 [1963], like in September.  And it was during the Civil Rights Era and Tallahassee [Florida] and St. Augustine [Florida], which is where Shirley is from, were the two biggest campaigns in Florida and were as violent as Selma and Montgomery were to Alabama.  Most  people don't know that.  But they were very difficult.  Man, Tallahassee was a tough town.  They  did not want anybody integrating Woolworth's [Woolworth's Department Store] and that kind of  stuff.  So, Shirley went off on one of her civil rights marches and was arrested.  She and my  sister-in-law, Penny, who is my brother's [Bradford Kinsey's] wife, so they, they were, they got to know each other then.  And, so, I met her that way. But, you know, I was very involved in that, but I didn't get  arrested, you know, I knew, Dad [Ulysses B. Kinsey] had four of us in college at the same time.  I mean, we were seniors, I mean, it was, I knew there was no money for getting anybody out of jail.  So, but, I met her then and liked her, but, you know, it was, it just took a little while to, matter fact, her  roommate liked me, and was a little disappointed that I didn't like her.  You know, I was, I really  was interested in Shirley.  But, you know, we started off real slow with the movies, every, you  know, I couldn't go off campus, you know, because she heard about my reputation, and, you  know, and all that kinds of stuff, so. You know, I was a little, I was always chaperoned.  Matter of fact, the dean of women told her that she should not even date me, you know, because I was not someone to be dealing with, you know.  But, like, her husband, the dean of women's husband, I  used to beat all him, beat him out of his money in gambling, see. So, so I understood that deal,  you know.  But Shirley had enough insight to see that I was on the money, you know.  Because I really cared about her and really wanted to, you know, wanted to do the right thing.  But, you  know, I was sowing my oats and I was really running away from Dad and the discipline and all  that stuff from West Palm Beach [Florida]. But it's, you know, I tell everybody, it's one of the best things  I've ever done.
Story_ID: 9783
Speaker 1: So, now, you, it's time for graduation.  What are your thoughts?
Speaker 2: Well, interesting, I had one of the poorest GPAs [grade point average] in the history of  Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  When, when, when they did my GPA, they did a two-point, and they had to round it to the tenth or eleventh digit to get to zero.  You know, I mean it was like, it was unbelievable.  And I just did make it.  But, you know what?  I knew exactly what I needed.  I didn't care about it.  It was, it was, I said, "I'm  gonna graduate."  I told my mom [Christine Kinsey], I said "Mom, I'm gonna graduate, believe me."  And, you  know what?  She believed me.  She said, "I'm okay."  And she knew and I went on ahead and  graduated.  But what I learned, there was a guy named Reverend Cunningham who was, who  married us in 1967, who was the career director of Florida A and M, in some kind of way, he  saw something in me and started inviting me over to the career center, and because I was glib,  had these good socialization skills.  And I've always been a big reader, I mean I read now two  hours a night.  I mean I always got something I'm reading.  As a matter of fact, this whole family  is a big reading family, and my dad [Ulysses B. Kinsey] and mom are big readers, you know, that kind of thing, so a  lot of that.  But, I just lost my thought.
Speaker 1: You were saying that Dr. Cunningham.
Speaker 2: Dr. Cunningham, yeah, Reverend Cunningham.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, Reverend Cunningham started  inviting me over to the career center.  I really had no business over there because my GPA was,  like, nothing.  But I started interviewing with IBM and all these big companies and, guess what?  I was doing great with them until they found out my grade point average, and then all of them  turned me down, you know.  But what I was doing, I was learning these skills on how to  interview and ended up with a company called Humble Oil [and Refining] Company which is part of Exxon,  and they liked me a lot.  Now, it was interesting.  They sent me to Los Angeles [California],  which was how we got to L.A. [Los Angeles] and I was in this guy's office, this huge office, probably as big  as this room or bigger, you know, and he was saying, "Well, Mr. Kinsey, tell me about your  GPA," and I was almost fainted because I had every answer but that answer, because I just, I  didn't believe they were looking at no GPAs, you know.  And, evidently, I came through that, but he hired me.  And, you know, they had these experiments.  I was the first black sales rep on the West Coast, and so that's how we got to Los Angeles.
Story_ID: 9784
Speaker 1: I took this job [Humble Oil and Refining Company] in 1967, four days after  we got married [to Shirley Kinsey] on, see, we got married at Reverend Cunningham's church, but we had the  reception in the [Florida A&M, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] student union building because we were very popular.  Shirley was Miss Junior,  was Miss Pershing Rifle and really missed being Miss FAMU [Florida Agricultural and  Mechanical University] probably by about eight or ten votes, probably should've won, you  know.  So, we were both very popular for different reasons, you know.  So, we kind of, and, you  know, we had a lot of, we just had a lot of friends.  Everybody liked us because Shirley balanced  off those rough edges of mine, then I brought this other crew in, you know, that type of thing.  So, you know, but getting an opportunity to come to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] really  changed our lives because I tell people all the time, I say, you know, "Had we stayed in West Palm Beach [Florida] or in Tallahassee [Florida], there are a lot of other influences there, but just coming out here and not knowing anybody and having to be independent made a huge difference in us relying on each other."  And I think couples that have to rely on each other really tend to work out their issues quicker and begin to see those strengths in each other, you know, and really  work toward those common objectives. So in 1967, we came out and we got an $87.50  apartment. We bought second-hand furniture, some of this from my mom [Christine Kinsey], and Shirley came from her grandmother, so she came from a really more humble background than I did, but she also had this frugal nature about her.  So, we, you know, we looked at money the right way, as I say.  I was making about seven thousand dollars a year and she was making about five thousand  dollars a year teaching.  And what we decided then was that we would save her salary and never  spend it.  This was 1967.  And then we decided that we would save all of my raises, you know.  So, for, literally, maybe eight or ten years, we just saved money.  So, we were, we were the first ones to buy a house, the first ones to buy a Mercedes [Benz], the first ones to buy an apartment building,  the first one to get to a million dollars, you know,  I mean. And all of this really took place because we were so frugal.  And I don't mean frugal that we didn't do anything, because during  that period we also went to forty-one national parks, you know.  But, what we would do is we  would drive.  I mean, we'd get, you know, we'd leave on Friday evening and drive to Utah, you  know, and go to Zion [Zion National Park, Utah] or Bryce Canyon [Bryce Canyon National  Park, Utah] or something like that and then be back Sunday night to go to work Monday  morning. And that gave us a great deal of renewal each time we, because you go and see all this  wonderful stuff, and you're ready for this next week, you know, of, you know, and being young,  you could do all, you could drive without any sleep, you know, that kind of thing.  I don't do that  anymore.  But it was a great way and, frankly, we, we set a lot of standards for our friends.  One of the things that we are really blessed with, we got tremendous friends from FAMU days all the  way, you know, through now.  And people emulate, I'll show you some of the stuff, the poems  that have been written about us and to us from our friends over the years really tells you that  people really appreciate what you, what you done for them and just who you are how you  approach, you know, them and everything.
Story_ID: 9785
Speaker 1: But 1967, '68 [1968], they gave me, this is Humble Oil [and Refining] Company, my first territory, which was then the South Central [Los Angeles, California] area. You gotta remember this is two, two and a half years after the first riot in 1965, so. I, my first five years in Los Angeles [California] was in South Central Los Angeles, so I got to know everything about South Central.  So people don't realize how much I know about L.A. [Los Angeles], which later, when I took over to rebuild  L.A.. It paid big dividends because I knew that I knew the area, I knew the people and, you  know, so forth and so on. But I had seventeen service stations.  This is one of the first times that I  knew that I could be good.  I mean, and, it's kind of a defining moment.  I had nineteen service stations and over the year, I put sixteen black service station dealers in.  Right now, in the L.A. County, there probably ain't 16 black service station dealers in the whole county.  In 1968, '69  [1969], '70 [1970], I had sixteen of my nineteen service stations were black-owned.  So, I, this is  part of Kinsey Grocery [West Palm Beach, Florida], you, if, if, if you have a strong business sector, they end up hiring people  from the community, and they can take care of their families better and the whole world works  better for them, so. But let me get to the point.  1970, I didn't even know this, I ended up being  the number one sales rep for Humble Oil Company in the country.  I mean it just blew me away.  And it's kind of like being like my dad [Ulysses. B. Kinsey] running the school.  I just made sure, I used to tell them  that, "I will use your restrooms any time, any place, and they better be as clean as they are at my house," so my restrooms were always immaculate.  "You will always have on a uniform," even  in the ghetto. So, everybody had a little bow tie and they did their own thing.  "You will clean windows and you will look under the hood." This is when you used to give full-service. And the bays are going to be clean, the accounting, the whole thing. I mean my stations were just, they  were the bomb, as they would say, and it ended up being the number one producing area in the country.  So, Humble, back then, they brought all the district managers, this is like three levels  above me, to Los Angeles, put a mic on me and put me on a bus, and took, and took them  around, I gave them a tour of my nineteen service stations on how I made, you know, made, you  know, the marketing side of getting, being so successful.  And that was just, I mean that just blew me away.  You know, because, you know, to take, see, I'm big on this thing.  See, black folks can do anything we want to do, but what we get hung up on is worrying about being Black.  You can't worry about being black.  You've gotta worry about blocking the tackling issues.  If you're a service station dealer, you gotta give good service.  You've gotta be open.  You know, you gotta be clean.  You know, all those kind of things.  It ain't got nothing to do with nothing else.  And, so, I don't, I don't ascribe to this thing that, there's a notion called 'ain't it awful,' you know, 'ain't it awful to be black?'  Well I don't believe in this, you know, I don't believe in that  and because it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.  But that experience really started me on every job I  had from that point on, I was number one in the nation up through 1984.  I mean I just got real  good at it.  I just decided that every time they gave me a marketing, any, well, let me say it this  way, any job that had a budget to it, I was number one at it, for the next, what, '68 [1968] to '84  [1984], whatever the math is on that, sixteen years.  And from '84 [1984] to '91 [1991], I was the  vice president.  I didn't have any job that had budgets like that, but we just blew them away.
Story_ID: 9786
Speaker 1: Was there any resistance to any of this [how he managed service stations for the Humble Oil and Refining Company in South Central Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Well, what you do, I have done this, I did this I mentioned that I hired roughly a  thousand black folks at Xerox.  What I do is just create the model, you know.  I just said,  "Look," you know, remember in '67 [1967], '68 [1968], you know, it was right after the riots, I  mean people were still very pensive about what was going on. So I was, it was easy for me to get  the Humble Oil Company executives to see that they needed to do something special to put people in positions where they could hire because hiring was the thing that was going to keep the  community moving.  And so, we, we came up with loan programs, special training programs.  I  got a lot of help on recruiting, you know, so forth and so on. And then I put up, I developed this system which was really a pretty rigid system, I mean I was a pretty difficult guy to deal with.  I  used get up in the morning, at 4:00 in the morning, and I used to ride my territory because I had  eight service stations that were open twenty-four hours.  And what you couldn't do is be asleep.  You follow me?  You had to be awake, it had to be brightly lit, you know, the whole thing.  So, I ride into the service station and don't see somebody lit, they lose their job.  You know, so I had  the reputation that while I wanted to do the right thing about employment and hiring of blacks  and all that stuff, it wasn't going to be because we lowered our standards any.  In other words,  there were certain standards and we were going to do those and everybody was going to do them.  And I do that even know, I mean I have certain things there are just, you cannot violate them.  And if you violate them, you got a problem.  And I found that people will live up to your expectations, you know.  And those that don't want to live up to your expectations probably  don't have the juice to play the game, you know.  And you might as well wash them out early so  you can get people that wanna play the game because that's what this is, is a game, it's a game of life, and the only ones that win are the ones that play hard every day.  And I'm looking for  people that want to play.
Story_ID: 9787
Speaker 1: Was there anything that you think during that period you did wrong that would provide lessons for later on or was it just that you were?
Speaker 2: Well, what was interesting, I left Humble Oil [and Refining] Company under less than positive circumstances because I think it was during this whole civil rights thing, and I even actually organized against them because I felt that they were charging the black community and our black dealers more than the suburbs.  As a matter of fact, I know they were, and actually I had raised money, and we had a lawsuit against Humble Oil Company when I left, you know, and I just left, and that's when I came to Xerox, but I--you know, I mean, I kind of come from a fighting kind of family, you know.  We don't go quietly about what we believe in, and I just had always seen in the suburbs that prices were lower than the prices, you know, in South Central [Los Angeles, California], and I could never understand it.  I mean this is ridiculous, and I used to ask questions about it, and then I got real pertinent information that showed the tank wagon price.  It was a difference in the different areas, although the same gasoline came from Wilmington [California], you know.  I mean all of it came out of the same refinery, but you know, that gave me, you know, muscle, you know, to know that I could organize, you know, and I had this rebel streak in me, you know.
Speaker 1: Explain exactly what you did.
Speaker 2: Well, what we did, we went on strike, you know.  I mean we closed service stations.  I didn't close my service stations.  I closed their service stations.  We went into, you know, the whitest of the white communities and closed the biggest service stations.  We shut United Airlines down one day because they were buying gas from Humble, and so we did like a tertiary action against them because they--we wanted them to stop buying as a way to put pressure on Humble to deal with us, you know, better and actually filed a lawsuit against them, and what happened, we got washed out because we just couldn't sustain the discovery part.  I mean Humble came up with about 18 million lawyers.  I mean it was like it was unbelievable, but you know, we really struck a good chord in the black community with, you know, what we tried to do, and I left there and went to Xerox.
Speaker 1: See, and that's amazing, too.  There was no--you were young.  You weren't thinking you could get blacklisted.  You know, that's what a lot of people think.
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  I never thought about that.
Speaker 1: And it never happened.
Speaker 2: I never thought about it, you know, because I was young.  I was probably 27, 28, you know, and my dealers loved me.  I mean they just thought the world of me because many of them I took out of all kinds of circumstances and put them in business, basically, gave them the training, recruited them, gave them the training, gave them the money to do it, you know, and then helped them become successful, you know, and they were able to, you know, build their homes and send their kids to college.  It's quite rewarding to see people do well, you know.
Speaker 1: This is amazing.
Speaker 2: To have a little bit to do with that.
Speaker 1: Right.  No, but you know what is--I mean, that Humble even gave you that authority at the time.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 9788
Speaker 1: Okay, so you come to Xerox.  How do you find Xerox and how does Xerox find you?  I  mean you've been in this sort of rabble rousing for a while.
Speaker 2: Well, because of this I got known in the community more, and I'm trying to think, I can't  think of his name right now.  He was a recruiter and back in those days because companies were  trying to hire minorities, they hired blacks to find them, you know.  So Moody Stayton [ph.], Moody Stayton had heard about me and we'd gotten to be friends and he said, "Well, I got this company  called Xerox, you ought to, you know, look and check them out."  So, I went over, and to make a  long story short, it took me twelve interviews to get hired with Xerox, and I thought I was being  hired to be over a hundred-person service organization.  I ended up being over an eighteen-person service organization, kind of like, at the last minute, I kind of got that, but it took twelve interviews to get this job.  It was unbelievable.  And I had an M.B.A. [Master of Business Administration] and a B.S. [Bachelor of Science], and nobody in the  service department, nobody, even at the highest level had a B.S. degree, so it just shows you how racist this whole environment was.  But, at the time, they were paying like six or seven hundred  [dollars] more a month than Humble [Oil and Refining Company] was paying, so I'm saying "Who cares?" you know.  So, I  took this field service manager job even though I was a salesperson, didn't know anything about  the technical area and within the first nine months, turned everything around.  I was number one  in that job.  Then they gave me a regional distribution manager's job.  I had a million square feet of warehousing space all over the West, from Los Angeles [California] to Alaska to Hawaii.  I was number one in that job.  Then they brought me back as a sales manager, even though I have never sold for Xerox, I was number one in that job and, you know, it just, you know, it just kept going.  And I got good at it.  I mean I got, I learned that, early that knowing how to treat your people was the key.  So, my people loved working for me, even though I was very, very demanding.  I mean, I  really, my expectation level was very high.  But that's the only way you can win, you know, if  your expectations are high.  So, we were able to achieve a lot. And that letter from Hank Sibbing,  I mean here's a guy in 1974, he wanted to be a lawyer and I said, "As long as you can do your  job, go do it."  And I'd say a month ago, he calls me and says the impact that I had on him in  1974.  I couldn't believe it.  I mean it's that, and we have a lot of situations where people, you  know, when you know you're doing this thing right is when people from all kind of ways come  back at you with either sayings that you gave them or situations that you had an impact on them  in a positive way.
Story_ID: 9789
Speaker 1: Now I want to go back to, because you went to Pepperdine [University, Malibu, California] to get your, you know, your  master's degree.  What motivated you to do that and where was, let's see, '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you started with Xerox?  With Xerox.
Speaker 2: Because they had a program that paid for it.  And let me tell you, paying for  it makes a huge difference.  And unlike when I was in college where I just kind of played along, I  was very serious about this because Xerox had an interesting program.  They paid 66 percent of  your tuition.  You got the other 33 1/3 percent when you graduated. So it was another form of  savings for us, and so I looked at it like this, I said, "Not only do you get an M.B.A. [Master of Business Administration] , I'm going  pick up about three or four thousand dollars of my reimbursement back," you know.  So, I blitz that doggone thing.  I mean it was a Saturday, it was a weekend, Saturday, Sunday deal, and one night a week. That also had an impact because I had some professors that were very good.  They helped me with organizational development issues.  You know, how to manage and  motivate.  It gave me the language to be able to articulate what I had inside of me, to get people to follow me.
Story_ID: 9790
Speaker 1: Now, also at the time that you're joining to Xerox, Xerox is like the crème de la crème of  the business community and they say that no one really did it better than Xerox in many ways.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: And I want you to sort of talk about that culture and environment, you know, that existed  there.
Speaker 2: Well, there were really two environments, in a sense, one, there was the black environment that I belonged to and then there was the Xerox environment.  And Xerox was making so much money back in '71 [1971] that they couldn't spend it all. So I mean, it was a  first-class company, it paid more, the benefits were better, the stock was great, you know, just everything.  But as it relates to blacks in Xerox in the early '70s [1970s], blacks were relegated to non-starter jobs.  I mean I had this field service manager job, which was one of the few in the country, and then guys like [A.] Barry Rand and Kent Amos and Gene Ruffin and Bill Sykes, Kerney Laday, these are all the seven guys that did this Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] business case study thing [also Art Crawford and Bill Hamilton, organizing committee for Xerox's National Black Employees Association].  We were sprinkled all over the country. So, in one environment, Xerox had these high standards and all  this was great, but in another way, blacks weren't doing nothing.  So, we, of the seven of us, five  of us had come out of black colleges.  And, so, we weren't ready to take this foolishness, and I  had just come out of this Humble [Oil and Refining Company] experience, so I was a real rabble rouser or whatever you want  to call it, but people saw me as a leader and I would articulate that we didn't have to put up with  this stuff, so we organized in L.A [Los Angeles, California]., and there was a defining moment in San Francisco [California] where Gene Ruffin and John Lewis and some other guys really stood  up to the white establishment.  They did not want to hire, I mean promote Axel Andre,  who is a colonel, full colonel in the U.S. Army, to district manager, which is the job I was supposed to get when I came in.  They gave it to some white boy, and so the brothers in San Francisco, led by Gene Ruffin, went on strike, okay?  It's called 'Black Friday.'  And they sent  David Kearns out who is the new vice president of Xerox, who later becomes CEO [chief executive officer], you know, about ten years later, to fire all the brothers.  Basically, that's what  he did.  What he did was he came out and we convinced him that he should fire the white boys.  He fired the white boys, promoted Axel Andre and that's how the movement started.  So, from that time, we didn't know then that Kearns would end up being CEO, but we had this special relationship that we had developed with Dave Kearns, who was the new kid on the block  for Xerox, but was well thought of and we knew he had a chance of being president. So he  organized a, he allowed us to organize a national organization and that's where the seven of us  kind of really started, and that's how the Xerox Black Employees Organization [sic, Association] started.  It started  in California, in San Francisco and L.A. [Los Angeles] and it spread to those cities of Chicago  [Illinois], D.C. [District of Columbia], New York [New York], Dallas [Texas], you know, and  the like.
Story_ID: 9791
Speaker 1: What was interesting, this is a story by itself, the power that this group [ Xerox's National Black Employees Association]  manifested itself.  Gene Ruffin, who is just an extraordinary individual, had worked for IBM and  really was my mentor inside of Xerox and really, a guy I still admire a great deal.  But Gene was  just so smooth, so articulate, and so logical, that, I mean, once, once, he had a mind like a trap  door and I mean, he'd just, you know, he'd walk you through.  So, we had this thing.  I was the  guy who was always hitting you and coming at you and he would just say, "Well, why wouldn't you wanna to do this?" or "would you like us to do this?"  You know, that kind of thing.  So, we  had this strategy and the thing that I liked about the twenty years I spent in Xerox, even though I ran huge businesses for Xerox, was the [National] Black Employee organization [sic, Association] that we developed.  It was  just, and it goes on right now.  It was just a really, really important organization where, we had values like anytime we were in a meeting, we could never talk about our careers in that meeting,  which kept the seven of us out of using that as a way to get promoted.  Okay, so, and that gave  all of the brothers and sisters a real comfort level that we really were representing them.  And, so, what we found out real early was that we were being talking, we were talking to the chairman of the board, the president, CEO [chief executive officer], the division heads, and we were, we  were sales reps and field service managers, first level and we could hold our own with them and  that was the extraordinary thing.  So, we, we became more confident that what we were trying to  do and what we were articulating made a lot of sense.  Even though we were so far down in the  organization it was just unbelievable.  But the things that we were articulating, I'll give you an  example.  We called Xerox to have job postings.  We never had job postings before.  Why?  Because jobs used to go to whites and blacks didn't even know there was a job opening,  you know, that kind of thing.  We called Xerox to have what they call an MRP, management resource program, which is that there's a certain process by which people get promoted and they  get on this list and they go through training programs and they get interviews and if they're selected, they go.  But blacks didn't, weren't on there because it was a good old boy program.  We came up with the whole notion of affirmative action managers as a way to monitor and  police this.  I mean, we just had, just all kinds, we had employee surveys because we said that  employee surveys were important to know who were managing their jobs in the proper manner,  so even now, they use the same survey. I mean, the survey, everybody, all hundred thousand employees gets the survey and it's red, yellow, green.  You get a green, you're okay.  Yellow,  you got a problem.  Red, you got, you're in big, big trouble.
Story_ID: 9792
Speaker 1: Because what we did, we laid the facts out.  One of the things that Xerox does extremely  well, even to this day, is their training programs are par, I mean, they're just, they're just  outstanding, and there's a class called Sales Skills, Presentation Skills, Listening Skills.  Those  three skill sets are pretty powerful skill sets and we use those.  In other words, and then problem  solving, and then what we did, we sat down and said, "Well, how should we articulate, you know, our position?  What is their position back and what should our retort be?" So that's  basically the start.  And then what we always ask was, "What was the role of each of the  members in the black meeting?"  In other words, we never went to a meeting and we weren't  prepared.  In other words, if we had a meeting with [Xerox CEO David] Kearns on Sunday, we rehearsed that on Saturday or Friday, down to a point of who's going to open, what they were going to say and  how we were going to come in.  Not scripted, but to a point where everybody knew their role and  what your angle was going to be and when it was going to come in and you were going to be allowed to speak then.  In other words, the listening skills.  And we used that, and we just blew  him away because we were so prepared and we basically said, "How many employees in Xerox are fighting to do a better job for Xerox?  Nobody other than the black employees.  So, instead  of looking at us as adversaries, you gotta look at us as, you know, really your best employees."  And we really sold that concept.  And even, I mean I spoke for a couple of years to the Xerox  black employees here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and I could see other vice presidents getting up and basically saying that the Xerox black employees was the strongest employee  group inside of Xerox, the ones that cared because only ones that cared would come to a  conference all over the country and pay their own money to work on being better employees for Xerox.  I mean it's quite incredible when you think about it.  So that's how we used to sell this concept.  And this was just not good for us, it was good for Xerox.
Story_ID: 9793
Speaker 1: Another thing that's incredible about it is that there are seven of you?
Speaker 2: Seven of us, yeah  [A. Barry Rand, Kent Amos, Gene Ruffin, Bill Sykes, Kerney Laday, Art Crawford, Bill Hamilton].
Speaker 1: That you worked together [at Xerox's Black Employees Association], I mean that's another thing.  That's another issue that we have  a lot of time.
Speaker 2: No crab in the barrel.
Speaker 1: There was none.
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: But see, that's a story even of itself.
Speaker 2: But it's because of the leadership.  It's because of the leadership, you know.  I, when you  get a chance, I want you to read some of the letters and they will kind of share with you, you  know, how we respected each other, tremendously.
Speaker 1: But I'm saying how did that come, because you're all men, so, you know?
Speaker 2: It was very competitive.  Everybody wanted the same job.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Everybody wanted to be vice  president.  Nobody was a vice president.  But the other part, we were all in different regions, so  in our own region, we were kingpins.  So, when we came together, we were all equals, basically.  I mean one would get promoted and another one, but it was never this thing about, "Well, Barry [Rand] got promoted, and maybe I should have got promoted," because it just never happened.  And we, we, we shared regional issues and national issues.  But the regional issues were Gene [Ruffin] got another problem to solve, because we had our own hierarchy here in terms of the white senior management. But on the national issues, we would  band together as a group to go and solve the national issues, which really, we would get someone  like [Xerox CEO] Dave Kearns to come in and basically tell our boss's boss's boss what they had to do, which  we would call it, he would drive them to our position.  You follow me?  Because we sold it,  you know, we would go to Connecticut, sell the position and then come back and bring it up  from the bottom.  For instance, we would say, "There are not enough blacks in finance," which  was true, because they wanted them in personnel, they wanted blacks in personnel.  Well, we  said, "Now we got personnel, how about finance?"  So, we would go and do all the statistical  work. There's a concept called management by F-A-C-T, fact, so we get the facts.  We'd go in there and say, "Well, why is it 98 percent white, white male?"  So, this is a good time to say, we also spawned the, the Latino group [Hispanic Association for Professional Advancement] , the Asian group [ACT, Asians Coming Together] and the women's group [Black Women's Leadership Council] because what we were able to help them with is that every time we went in to talk about blacks, we also talked  about the whole spectrum.  In other words, if we talked about a gender issue, it really helped  white females, but we really focused on black females from our perspective.  They may have  focused on white females or Latinas.  But, it all works, so over the years, after we, it took about  six or seven years for them to figure it out, you know, because we tried to spawn these ideas early, but they weren't quite ready for it. Because they were, people were afraid for their jobs,  you know, and couldn't believe that we hadn't lost our jobs, you know.  But after a little bit,  because of the successes, they began to organize and those pressures also, you know, helped in  terms of expanding, you know, the diversity inside of Xerox.  Even as late as 1999, Xerox was, received from the Commerce Department [sic, U.S. Department of Commerce], the diversity award, like 14.6 percent of all  management jobs were African-American.  I mean this was 1999.  So, I mean, and the beat goes on, as they say, you know.
Story_ID: 9794
Speaker 1: Do you think, and there were no forces among the white majority [at Xerox] that were trying to sabotage you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, for sure.  But, you know, it was like Barry Rand had a statement. He used to  say, "If you're really good at this thing," you know, "performance will always," you know, "keep them away."  So, each of us in our respective areas were number one.  I mean for like seven or  eight years, there was a black man or woman number one in the country at Xerox in sales for  marketing, for seven straight years.  I took over the Western Region in 1984.  There was a black man in that job for ten years.  I put the first one in when I left and then successively from there.  So, we've had a lot, I mean, just a lot of accomplishments in a lot of areas, that are unheard of in most businesses.
Speaker 1: But why do you think the blacks were number, I mean, see, this is what I'm trying to say,  was it just a lining up of the stars.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: A lot of times we're good, but we don't get the chance to show that we're good.
Speaker 2: We had our own recognition system inside.  You know, everybody wanted to be  a part of the group.  We called ourselves 'The Group.'  And everybody knew what the group was,  it was these seven guys [A. Barry Rand, Kent Amos, Gene Ruffin, Bill Sykes, Kerney Laday, Art Crawford, Bill Hamilton] that really kind of walked on water, who were the mentors for everybody, who were the leaders, and we were a successful, a par excellent in every job we had,  you know.  And this is true, you know.  So, to become a part of this group was a very, very  special kind of invitation.  And you paid your dues.  The part of paying your dues was you had to  be, you know, you had to be stellar in your performances.  And, over the years, Joe Johnson, from personnel, came in the group.  Gill Scott came in the group.  People like that, and they became, because we kept looking down from us and saying, "Who are the next stars?" you  know.  So, we would bring them in and they would get training just by being with us in these  environments.  We'd take them to the meetings.  Most of the time, they wouldn't say a word.  They were just in the meeting, but just being in the room meant that they were part of the group,  which meant that current and senior white management knew that these people were anointed to take on bigger and better jobs.  And they were, and they would go on off.  And then we always  would say, "You have to cascade."  In other words, "What are you doing to bring your group,"  you know, "your circle of influence?" So you go back and you have to do the same thing there.  I'll give you an example.  In 1976, I took over the Oakland [California] branch, 300 people, 297  people.  When I got there, they were probably about 16 percent black.  When I left, 99 of the 297 employees were black.  We were number one in the country, and I, I mean we did some  extraordinary things.  When I took over the branch, we were number 82 out of 92 branches.  I  mean it was just in horrible shape.  In four months, I turned it around to number one, and we stayed there.  And one of the things that I had done in my other two previous jobs, along with being at the [Humble Oil and Refining Company] service station, was that I always believed that blacks could perform in any  environment if you do the right job.  So, I went out and hired and then promoted what I  considered the best blacks and put them in these jobs.  And we even did things like this, Oakland was basically all black and Contra Costa County [California], you know, was basically all white.  I would put the black sales manager, Charlie Gill, in the white area and I'd put the white sales manager in the black area.  And they both did well.  And we started breaking down barriers, you know, all kind of ways.  I changed the Muzak in, you know, when you come in, instead of hearing  that sterile music, you heard black music because it was like a black branch. But it was still a black branch that was terribly successful, you know, and, you know, we just set all kinds of guide marks and we put people in jobs that they have never been in before and they just, they just  shined, they just performed. And that leadership is really what I'm most proud about, is providing, you know, those opportunities.  I'll give you an example.  I was honored by the  March of Dimes about three weeks ago.  A guy came up to me and gave me his card.  He said,  "Bernard, you will not remember me."  He said, "But you recruited me in 1971 in Compton  [California].  I'm still with Xerox after twenty-nine years."  And, basically, then, I just went over and I said, "We're gonna hire some brothers and sisters today," and I interviewed them and  tested them and, you know, that's what we did.  And here's this brother twenty-nine years later, came up to me three weeks ago.  I mean just blew me away, just blew me away.  Just like Hank Sibbing in 1974, he's writing about 1974. So you know you're on the right track, you know,  with, you know, with, you know, this model that we talk about, about, you know.
Story_ID: 9795
Speaker 1: I try to live on two simple principles, just "to whom much is given, much is required" and have a life with no regrets.  And the second one is real hard, but doing pretty good on it.  And a life with no regrets  means doing the things that are important and always keeping that in the forefront.  In other  words, what happens with [wife] Shirley [Kinsey] and [son] Khalil [Kinsey], what happened to my parents [Ulysses B. Kinsey and Christine Kinsey], what happened to my friends, you know, those are the things that I stay focused on, you know? And growing and, and, and trying to get more out of this thing called life, you know.  But I call it having an out-of- body experience, you know, that you could kind of look back at yourself and see, see your life, so you'll know how to make those course corrections, that that's necessary for you to grow and continue to, you know, to feel good about what you do. And there's another saying that I like, "God grant me my gift so I can give it to someone who needs it more." And that's another one  that I am trying to, to, to adopt more of because, you can see, we have plenty, I mean we have  been hugely successful.  And the question is how do you give this away, you know, and help  other people get to where they want to go in life?  Because a lot of things that I take for granted,  obviously, people say, "Well, I still don't get it," you know.  But it's just a lot of hard work, you  know. It's just a lot of hard work and, you know, being real, you know, clear about what you  want.  I'll give you an example. 1971, twelve interviews, the twelfth interview was in the senior  area, senior staff area.  I looked in the vice president's office, a huge office, and I said to myself  right there, I said, "Bernard, you're gonna have that office."  Ten years later, to the day, I was in that office.  I mean, I just knew, I could see myself in the chair.  And I said, "You don't have to  worry about it."  And I did it the right way.  In 1981, there were three region managers, a vice president, and we were all in the same big suite of offices.  I wanted that office as bad as  anybody else, but you know what I said?  "I don't want it that way."  So, I said, I was the junior  guy, I said, "I'll take the smallest office."  Follow me?  And the senior guy got the biggest office.  A year later, Xerox collapsed all three regions into one region, and I got, I was the head guy for everything.  So then I got the corner office without any question.  Follow me?  That's how you  do it.  Follow me?  If I had been fighting for that job then, and I had equal right to the office, but  it wasn't the way I wanted it.
Story_ID: 9796
Speaker 1: Now in 1984, you then get promoted [at Xerox]?
Speaker 2: To vice president, international marketing.  So, now we start doing meeting with the  Japanese and the Chinese and the Germans, and so, not that I had not been to these places, but I had not been there in that capacity. So this was really exciting for me to be able to, we did a 100 million dollar deal with Siemens in 1986, which was a big deal back, in artificial intelligence.  We opened, in 1985, the first printing center in Beijing with the People's Republic of China, you  know. So we broke a lot of ground, you know, in doing some different things, you know, with different cultures.  And what I'm excited about, and I think the benefit for black people particularly, is to the extent that we don't focus on this black thing to the extent that we do better.  And I don't mean being white or being non-black.  I mean, hell, you know you black, but you really have to go after all the other things that are really, in my opinion, far more difficult than whether or not you're black or not.  I'll give you an example, with your project, for  instance. If you focus on this as a black project rather than how do you sell this project and  market it in its most discreet and finest way, you're never going to get it sold. Because what  people generally do is, they'll give you what I call walk-away money, you know, and that's  not enough money for you to do the kind of thing, but if you say, if you establish that this is a project that has broad benefits, you're gonna find somebody out there who's going to agree with  you, and there's a lot of money out there looking for this project.  What you have to do is figure out, you know, who and where that is and do the work, and over a period of time, you're gonna develop a skill set that will be able to walk in when you're gonna say, "I got it."  I mean, it's like  you know. And they know you know. That's what professionalism is.  We used to call it, there  are four types of people, you know, unconsciously competent, I won't go through all of those.
Speaker 1: No, go on.  I want to hear those.  Unconsciously competent.
Speaker 2: See, you can be consciously incompetent.  You can be unconsciously incompetent.  You can be consciously, I mean unconsciously competent and you can be consciously competent.  The professional is consciously competent.  In other words, they know they know. And I often times feel like I'm having out-of-body experiences right in the middle of a very important thing.  I can see this whole situation and know how to say and do the right thing, right then.  And  that's what we used to teach Xerox to be consciously competent.  In other words, if you learn the  skill well enough, the skill becomes a part of you, and as it becomes a part of you, you don't  have to think about it, which means you use it all the time.  There's a concept called you learn something, you use it, you teach somebody else, then you expect it for them. And that's how you make everything revolve.  So, so a lot of this skill training is embedded in a lot of what I do  and think.  But I find that it's the way to get out of issues.  It's a way to solve problems.  It's a  way to get people to see around corners or to respect what you're saying or to adopt your  principles, whatever that means.
Story_ID: 9797
Speaker 1: Now, when you, in 1984, when you take over [as a vice president at Xerox], is your team in place at that point or do  you have to do any more team building?
Speaker 2: No.  I put a team together.
Speaker 1: You put a team together, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  This is a new, this is a new assignment.  And, so I bring in, one of the  things I'm real proud of, you know, I have hired a lot of blacks, but we've had like nine of the people that I've hired have gone on to be vice president, you know.  So, I'm real proud of, like,  Betty Mitchell, who was a schoolteacher in Oakland [California] who I hired as a field service manager who was, the same job I had in 1978.  She's now over the entire Southeast for Xerox as a vice  president.  Or Harvey Huddleston who's a guy who I brought from Detroit [Michigan], who was a  branch manager and I gave him the job.  He's a vice president in El Segundo [California] right  now.  That kind of thing, Larry Thompson, I mean, just, you know, quite a few of them that  have gone on and made me proud.  And you can see, you could kind of see qualities in these people that you could see in three or four or five years from now.  And that's another thing I've  been able to do is to be able to see in other people some things that they may not be able to see  and project that.
Speaker 1: So, what qualities did you look in a person when you were projecting like this?
Speaker 2: Well, interpersonal confidence is a big, is a big, big thing I look for.  Interpersonal confidence is, you know, really what causes people to be able to either have leadership skills or  to be a team player.  Being a team player is 99 percent of the game.  That's almost more important than your skills because if you can't work with other people, then who cares, you  know?  Having a high energy level.  If you don't get up early and stay up late, who cares?  I mean most of these jobs require a great deal of, of, of energy to be able to do. Leadership.  I mean,  when you blow the whistle is there anybody behind you?  That's what a leader is.  I mean if you  blow the whistle and nobody behind you, guess what? You're not a leader because they're not listening to your frequency.  So, you have to tune in to them not they tune into you, necessarily.  So, you may carry them to your frequency, but you just can't start people off, you know, any  kind of way.  So, those are some of the qualities that I look for.  And, you know, high  expectations.  I mean it's amazing.  I'm a big believer in what [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] said about,  you know, "Aim high and miss rather than aiming low and hitting."  You know this notion about  aiming low and hitting is just not acceptable.  And most people that aim low end up not having  what I call, you know, good success patterns.  Because they end up achieving the wrong thing,  and they don't get the value and benefit.  I mean what I get from winning, you know, what you get from this experience of being, you know, number one in something, is just powerful.  I mean  to see a hundred black folks working in one organization, and you got Latinos and Asians and whites, all, and you've broken down these barriers, and that's what I've seen in my career.  I  mean in Oakland [California] and in Los Angeles [California] when I had the region, I saw  people, I saw this, what I call, more perfect world, where people of all different races and genders, because of the ethic that you develop and the environment that you created, work together, and that the challenge for them is not who you are but what you do.  In other words, achieving your objective is a central point in that organization.  And I mean it's a, it's a, it's a  tremendous feeling, you know, we. In 1978 [sic, 1979], there was a song, 'Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now,' that  was our theme song because that's exactly what it was, I mean. And we had everybody singing it  because, you know what, that's exactly how we felt.
Story_ID: 9798
Speaker 1: Now when you start doing this international work, are there things, that's a lot of time  and traveling that you're doing, right?
Speaker 2: [Nods].
Speaker 1: Okay.  How are you handling the demands of that and what also are you learning, you  know, as you have to interact.  You traveled a lot, so travel wasn't, it wasn't foreign to you.
Speaker 2: Well, a lot of it was just learning their customs, you know.  How they did business, and, for instance, in Germany, even salaried employees, up to vice presidents, are part of unions.  So, you don't change employees around quite like you do in America.  I mean it's very difficult to do things.  Their labor laws really restrict how you sell things.  So, I mean all this kind of stuff.  France, they have a whole different way of doing things than England, you know, that kind of  thing.  So, I mean I was fascinated because there's this notion called "discovery," and I think  that's what everybody has to have a big, you know, discovery is just notion of learning.  And I  have a big, you know, big amount of that.  I mean I love, you know, looking around corners and  finding something different.  So, you know, and it's still the same challenge, how do I get these people to buy my product?  But I gotta learn what the hell they're doing before I could get them  to want to do it, and, you know. We had some wonderful trips.  I would always have [wife] Shirley [Kinsey] come over and [son] Khalil [Kinsey].  Khalil has traveled to about fifteen countries and five or six continents,  you know, with us.  And, like we went to, to Munich [Germany] to Oktoberfest.  I had never done that, and that was on my to do list.  I got a big to do list, and I was able to conduct the oompa band in front of six thousand people, it's just, you know, a small, it wasn't quite like  conducting the Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] band, but it  was in that kind of category, but I mean real special kind of thing.  But I had always wanted to  go to Munich during this period, so it was, it was a powerful, powerful experience.  The Japanese dealing with Panasonic and how they do business and how they don't do business and, you  know. How the Japanese, they may say "I agree," but they really mean "I understand," you  know, that type of thing. And just, you know, just over a period of time, you just become  knowledgeable and then you gotta teach your staff and then you still gotta deal with the politics  back home, you know, and the politics in this new environment.  So, it was very, very  challenging and exciting.  I loved it, actually.
Story_ID: 9799
Speaker 1: Well, I left [Xerox] in '91 [1991].
Speaker 2: '91.  Okay.
Speaker 1: I took over,  I was the vice president of the voice systems division, you know, voicemail.
Speaker 2: Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Which was, which was really a good environment, exciting.
Speaker 2: Because that was a new product?
Speaker 1: New product.  But one of the things, it kinda told me, the primary reason I left Xerox is I  probably should have left in '87 [1987], but [Xerox CEO David] Kearns was leaving in '91  [1991], some of my, some of this group of seven were starting to leave or had left, and I really  began to not respect senior management at Xerox. And, frankly, I was dead on right because the CEO [chief executive officer], Paul Allaire, I mean these guys, I could see back ten years ago  that they, they didn't have it.  They hadn't figured it out, you know.  And they were more  interested in form rather than substance. And I mean the fact that they didn't give Barry Rand the  President and CEO when he not only was number one in everything he had done for thirty years  with them, but had done all the jobs Dave [David Kearns] asked him to do. They went out and  got this guy, Thoman [G. Richard Thoman], from IBM and in eighteen months, he destroyed the company, you know.  And Barry left and went on to be president and CEO of Avis and doubled their stock.  You see?  So this is a good example of a company with, as good about certain things  as they were, Paul Allaire just could not see a black man as CEO at Xerox.  And guess what?  Xerox has paid the price for it.  And all these hundreds of thousands, I mean a hundred thousand  people, and what pissed me off is I got a lot of friends still at Xerox, black and white, that have  really been hurt because of this debacle.  And it's just pure mismanagement.
Speaker 2: Now, so you, you knew that your future wasn't there though, mainly because, because  you saw the writing on the wall beyond Kearns?
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 9800
Speaker 1: What are you thinking at this point about, you know, what you want to do  because that's sort of a crossroads, I mean this is a 20-year career [at Xerox].
Speaker 2: Right.  And nobody ever thought I would leave Xerox because I was such a, well, first of  all, going back, [wife] Shirley [Kinsey] and I had done all right financially, so I tell everybody, 99 percent of this thing is options.  If you have options in your life, guess what?  A lot of other stuff just falls in  place. And if you're not worried about whether you're going to pay your bills tomorrow, you  can, you can, you can make a lot of different decisions.  So, leaving Xerox in '91 [1991] was not difficult at all. And I think for the first year or so I didn't do much of nothing.  And I fell into this  RLA job, this Rebuild L.A. [Los Angeles, California] job.
Speaker 1: But how did, okay, that's what I'm wondering, how that even came about.
Speaker 2: Well, to show you how it worked, [Xerox CEO David] Kearns leaves in '91 [1991].  I leave in  '91 [1991]. Kearns goes off, he's the number two guy in education under [U.S. President George Herbert Walker] Bush, in the first Bush Administration.  The riots [Los Angeles Riots, 1992] happen.  He gets appointed the czar over the federal response to the riots.  He calls me the morning after the Cabinet meeting and says, "Bernard, I need your help.  I'm coming to Los Angeles."  So, I said,  "Okay."  So, I don't hear from him.  I mean, literally, I do not hear from Kearns for two weeks.  I  said, "What the hell happened," you know?  So, on a parallel course, Peter Ueberroth is now named by [Mayor] Tom Bradley to head up Rebuild L.A., and I am consulting with an electric car  company on getting Rebuild L.A. to use as one of their first projects so we can get some tax credits to put jobs in the community.  So, I'm working at this level.  I haven't heard from Kearns, so to make a long story short, Harry Usher is the number two guy with Uebberoth, he interviews  me and he basically says, "Well, Peter wants to see you," you know, so.  I know Peter, but not  well, from the '84 [Summer Olympic] games [Los Angeles, California].  In '84 [1984], I managed the Xerox response to the '84 Olympics.  I had about three hundred people.  It was tremendous.  We did 96 million copies in about sixteen days.  I mean it was just a tremendous, logistical management feed to bring in all of these parts, put them out all over the city and make sure that all of these networks  were, I mean it was a pretty good job, but I'm real proud of what we did there.  So, I had gotten  the highest award from the Olympic Committee for what I had done in the '84 games.  So, I  knew him only from that sense.  So, I go in and talk to Ueberroth, and I'm pitching this electric car company, about why he should, you know, they should adopt that as one of their first  projects.  And he's saying, "Yes, yes, yes."  And it was almost too easy because I'm a salesman.  So, he, he says, "Well, I want you to come to work for RLA."  I said, "What?  I don't want to  work for RLA."  So, he said, "Well, Dave Kearns called right before he went into the hospital,  this operation, he has cancer of the sinus."  So, I found out later that when Kearns got here, he started having a nosebleed and he went to the doctor and the doctor sent him to a doctor and, the  next thing you know, he went to Sloan [Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York] and they  found out he really had cancer of the sinus.  So, he had a 12-hour operation and really, he's still  doing okay.  Shirley and I went to see him back September of last year.  But, it really, you know,  it was a tough, a very difficult recovery and the like.  So, he said, "You must be pretty good for  Kearns to pick up the phone and call me before he goes into the operating room and says, 'The  only guy you should hire for this job is Bernard Kinsey."  So, that's how I got the job.  It's just  that simple.
Story_ID: 9801
Speaker 1: We did this starting about '84 [1984].  So, I was getting this new  job, international job [vice president of international marketing for Xerox], and one of the things we decided to do was that we, I mean, if you apply your skills the right way, you know how to get things done.  I mean, what we decided is that we  would only concentrate on homes in the Palisades [Pacific Palisades, California].  Why?  Because we knew the Palisades and it was close to home.  I mean, in other words, it was thirty  minutes from work and we decided that I couldn't, I wouldn't do it any further than thirty  minutes. And once, once real estate brokers know that you're in this kind of business, you get  opportunities.  So, then the question is can you evaluate those opportunities against the standards you set?  And what our standards were is we would buy it for a million, put a million  in, and sell it for the four million.  You know, that's the way you would, and you could, literally,  do that up until about late '89 [1989], you know.  And, so, that made, that made my decision to  leave Xerox a lot easier, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you are, you're just sort of--?
Speaker 1: And another reason why I was able to leave Xerox, I started moving away from certain relationships inside of Xerox, not the close ones.  But there were a lot of peripheral relationships  I decided I didn't have time to do.  For instance, I rarely would have dinners at night.  First of all,  I don't like, I like being home for dinner, but I had too many other things to do at night, so I  mean a lot of times, if you, if you're trying to get to the next level in a company, you'll do a lot  of stuff that, frankly, is just hobnobbing, you know.  And I decided I wasn't going to do that, you  know.  So, I set some real strict standards on how I was going to use my time, and I put that time  either in my family or in this real estate.  Because I needed, I mean you have to either use it more  effectively or you have to drop something.
Story_ID: 9802
Speaker 1: I knew, I knew that this was the right job [chief operating officer and co-chairman of Rebuild Los Angeles] because it  really provided the opportunity to use all of this other background I had about South [Central]  Los Angeles [California]. I mean, I knew this area really well.  I believed in black businesses being the cornerstone for any community to be able to rebuild, and I knew it needed to have a different  approach, a more business and a more managerial approach.  So, I thought I had the right skill  set to be able to do that. And I thought I was strong enough, leadership-wise, to be able to deal  [Peter] Ueberroth and all of the other stuff. And he and I turned out to be, you know,  I mean we had our bumps but, on balance, we worked real well together. And it was just a great  job for me, I mean, because I had been accustomed to being interviewed at Xerox and things like  that. So being in front of cameras or newspaper articles, none of that was, some of it was new  and exciting, but it was not to the point that it was intimidating or anything like that.  So, to a  large degree, I felt very much at home in lot of those settings, a lot of the public speaking roles I  had to take on.  Any time we would open a new supermarket or service station, I'd go out and we  would cut the ribbon and that kind of thing.  So you always had to say something, and, you  know, because I had a lot of practice at this thing, public speaking, you know.  I can't say too  much about getting your skill sets right because they all just play into, you know, making your life more productive.
Story_ID: 9803
Speaker 1: Now you, what was the game plan?  What was status when [Peter] Ueberroth [of Rebuild Los Angeles] talked to you?  What was the game plan, you know, about what was going to be accomplished or was it, was it vague and sort of unstructured?
Speaker 2: No.  He had a pretty good, he had a three-legged stool, which I think is the right answer. And that was another reason why I wanted to do it because I believed in what he wanted to do and what Mayor [Tom] Bradley wanted to do.  The three-legged stool was, in all the other riots in the history of the country, the only two responses were the community and government.  Business was absent, and this was supposed to be businesses being an equal partner in bringing this three-legged stool.  And Ueberroth having the biggest black book in corporate America--and he does--was to bring that part.  My job, as co-chair and chief operating officer, was to set up a infrastructure that could take the opportunities coming out of corporate America and funnel those into the right real estate situation, planning, construction and community group, if they were, in fact, or, in this case, investors.  So, we went out and hired about forty or fifty people, many of those loan executives I had said earlier.  And, really within months, had really filled a vacuum that was created by the disarray that was in Los Angeles [California]. And people ascribed to Rebuild L.A. [Los Angeles], I mean super powers that we could never, we could never fulfill. But in doing that, it created, it gave this--our agency tremendous power to almost get anything that we want done.  And that caused resentment all around, in many different ways, we were a private agency.  We were funded privately, which meant that we weren't beholden to the city council or the state, which really they didn't like because what they wanted to do was to be able to tell you what you could do.  In other words, the city council wanted to say, "Well, I want the supermarket in my area, not this area." What we would say is, "First of all, what, where is the best place for the supermarket and who's gonna build it?"  And the store that's building should have more to say about where it goes than, you know--and then we'd bring the community in as partners in that, we had rules like you couldn't have--let's say we did, we put thirty-three supermarkets in.  Each supermarket represents a hundred fifty employees and then the hundreds of people that supply that store. So, these are big deals.  We said that everybody had to come out of the community for that particular supermarket. So we insisted, not because we had the law to do it, but people really wanted the RLA [Rebuild L.A.] seal of approval.  We had a thing called, you know, you are a member of the RLA team.  Well, that meant that you were certified, that you were gonna live up to these kind of standards.  One of them was hiring within three miles of the store.  Well, we knew that, instead of telling people to go out and hire blacks or Latinos or Koreans, it's better to say, "Just hire from the community."  And if you had a black community, guess what?  You're gonna hire black folks, Latinos or Koreans or whites or whatever.  And it really, really worked out well.  We had twenty-one training programs.  We decided that training programs were not gonna be put together unless the people had a job when they finished the training program, which was novel, because everybody else just wanted a training program.  We said, "You had to have a job."  So, even today, you have the [National] Urban League, it has the Toyota training program.  We put that, that deal together.  The Marriott, you know, trained chefs.  I mean so, and this was the brilliant, brilliant idea, I thought. Peter [Ueberroth], Peter could pick up the phone and call the Chairman and CEO [chief executive officer] of Marriott, and the Chairman and CEO would say, "Well, how can I help?" Well, we had a concept of saying, "Do what you do best."  Now, if you're a hotel chain, you should either teach, you know, hotel management, housekeeping, you know, cooking, that kind of thing.  So, we picked cooking.  So, they set up a cooking school.  Why?  Because cooking is a good entry-level job that pays well and it leads on to other things. And we did this in about eight or ten different sectors marketing-wise and the forty people working for me at the time, they were assigned as account managers to manage those sectors.  In other words, to be the interface between Marriott and the community.  In other words, Marriott had the resources and the training, but they didn't have, they didn't have this ability to walk into the community to find the right trainees, to find a place to put their facility and that's where the community came in. And we brokered all of this.  In other words, I mean, sometimes the community wanted to extract a pound of flesh, and we wouldn't let them.  We said, "That pound of flesh is going to come in the training program."  And sometimes the, the corporation didn't really want to do everything it was supposed to do.  It wanted to do a half job, half-assed job, we wouldn't allow that either.  So, we, we really kept this triangle going, and we got a lot of beautiful examples all through South Los Angeles [California].
Story_ID: 9804
Speaker 1: Let me give you an idea of the size of the problem.  We had an area of  sixty-seven square miles, 2.3 million people impacted by the [1992 Los Angeles, California] riots.  We had a billion dollars worth of insurance loss and a billion dollars worth of additional losses.  So, there was 2 billion [dollars] sucked out of, basically, South Los Angeles and, basically, in the Korean community.  So, we got a total 57 million [dollars] from the government, period, throughout this whole thing.  So, the federal  response, state response and city response was nonexistent.  Yeah, they pay you for overtime and they pay you for roads and those kinds of things.  But everybody thought that this was gonna  be a much bigger response and, in fact, it wasn't.  So, what happened in South Los Angeles because RLA [Rebuild L.A.] was able to convince companies that this was a marketplace that was  ready for them to go.  For instance, if you brought a supermarket into South Los Angeles, you  may have 3 million people to shop at that store.  There's a store right now, well, many of them,  but we couldn't get Vons to want to do it and now it's the number fourth most profitable store in  their whole chain, right on Crenshaw [Boulevard].  You follow me?  Magic Johnson Theaters got the highest receipt of movie theaters in the country.  Why?  Because black folks buy more movie tickets.  I mean we knew all of these things from, you know, having done the  market surveys.  I mean that was another thing we did.  We didn't do anything about, we didn't  do anything in RLA unless it was fact based.  In other words, we didn't just put something out because somebody said they needed it.  It had to be demonstrated from a marketing standpoint.  So, that was revolutionary, and a lot of people didn't like it.  But the fact of the matter is that  businesses resonated to us because we talked their language. And what we knew was that the  response from the government and community had never happened before.  I hired a young man,  Jeffrey, what's Jeff's last name?  That he was an M.B.A. from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], and I gave him an assignment of going back and researching every riot that ever happened in  American history.  Okay?  He did that.  And you know what?  We knew that the response has always been a lot of talk and nothing.  So, we didn't expect anything from city, county, state and  federal government.  So, we, we established this program based on principles and fact, you  know, not based on what the community thought was going to happen or some politician.  And we had every politician in America coming, [U.S. Congressman Richard] Gephardt, [U.S. President George Herbert Walker] Bush, I mean, you name them, they all came to our offices.
Story_ID: 9805
Speaker 1: So, you know, I was wondering how, you know, these current riots [1992 Los Angeles, California] differ from the other riots and did it add really insult to injury?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Because there had been no--?
Speaker 2: No.  It was different, two different riots.  The '65 [1965] Watts Riots, Los Angeles, California riots had tremendous loss of life, like forty-three people and like fourteen, fifteen hundred homes.  So, what happened in '65 [1965] was a very violent situation.  The '92 riot [Los  Angeles, California Riots, 1992] was a very organized riot in that it was the first multi-cultural  riot. I mean there were Latinos, blacks, Asians, everybody participated in the looting, which was  different from what happened in 1965 when it was 99 percent black. And it was black on black homes being burned rather than in '92, they were almost all businesses, all 1,078.  So that was a big, big difference.  There was not the violence in '92 that there was  in '65 even though, people say, it was not the Rodney King riot at all.  It was a series of events that the police department and the fire department did not respond to in a very timely manner and  the city was basically up for grabs for several hours and shot out over TV and then everybody  got in the act.
Story_ID: 9806
Speaker 1: Did you, with, this, what did you have to give to get the grocery stores?
Speaker 2: We gave nothing.
Speaker 1: You gave nothing.
Speaker 2: We gave nothing.  That was the beauty of this.  What we gave was an opportunity for them to expand their businesses.  You see, the fact of the matter is if you get Roger Stangeland, the Chairman and CEO [chief executive officer] of Vons, sitting down in the building with you,  you could cut through some of the racism that he has developed over the years through all of his  marketing surveys.  Follow me?  His people saying why they should be in the suburbs.  We had an interesting thing that happened.  We had an interesting thing happen.  Here's what it was.  For the first time, suburban stores were not growing year over year, the first time.  So, we also knew  that businesses, you've heard of this concept about being overstored?  Well, this is the first time  this concept really came out.  They built all of these stores in the suburbs and exurbs to the point  that it was saturated.  So, how do you get your growth for your stock, market and all of that  stuff?  You have to look for new markets.  Well, for a supermarket chain, the place that needed a  supermarket was in the city.  So, we showed them that.  We showed them the demographics and,  in a lot cases, the per capita income was not much different than what they were doing in the  suburbs.  So, it was a misnomer.  They left the suburbs, I mean left the inner city because they  chased people leaving the inner city going to the suburbs, which is probably not all bad. But they  abandoned the area, which meant that the jobs left, Firestone, Goodyear, all these manufacturing  plants, General Motors, they left South Los Angeles [California].  The jobs left, the community imploded, that's what caused the '65 [1965] riot and for another thirty-five, forty years, it  continued to implode.  So, what we wanted to do was to say, "How do we get services in there?"  And if you look at CNN on the night of the riot, the day after the riot, people couldn't buy milk.  They couldn't get gasoline.  So, we focused on those two areas first.  That's why we rebuilt  seventy-four service stations within like the first nine months and we put thirty-two, thirty-three  supermarkets in.  Because we said the thing that would have the most impact on our community  in terms of services was those two areas.  And those areas we put in first.
Speaker 1: And what did you do after that?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, then, then all the other.
Speaker 1: List of things.
Speaker 2: Pharmacies, bookstores, paint stores, you know,  hardware stores, all the stuff that makes a community go.  See, my notion is, I used to have a  speech I used to go around and talk about RLA [Rebuild L.A.] is, I said, "The only difference  between the inner city and the suburbs is investment." And when you really think about it, that is  really the difference.  If you take a twenty-year old building and don't paint it, it's gonna be  deteriorated and it will become a place for the homeless. But if you take a twenty-year building  and you continue to refurbish it and keep it up to date, it could become, it will be, it could be as  nice a building as you can see.  And the difference is, when you cut capital off to an area, life has  been cut off in South Los Angeles.  Those areas just are left to fester and, over a period to time,  you know, people themselves take on those same attitudes, and they strike out because they see  all this on TV, about what's happening, and then they drive to the Palisades [Pacific Palisades,  California] and other places and say, "Why don't we have a supermarket like this?" And what  we did, we gave them that.
Story_ID: 9807
Speaker 1: So, do you have, have you since then, were you contacted by other cities looking.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Because there's been all kinds, I know Chicago [Illinois] has been doing a study, but it hasn't acted on it,  you know.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean the governments of Germany, of France, of South Africa, all of those, I was  invited over to talk about Rebuild L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and its components.  Because even those countries I  mentioned, Germany even, all of them have their black folks.  Germany got their gypsies.  France got their Africans, you know, England have their West Indians, South Africans got, you  know, their blacks, so.  And, you know, I'll give you an example of South Africa in Soweto.  On Saturday morning, there's a stream of cars and buses leaving Soweto going to shop.  So, what we  talked to them about is, why wouldn't you build stores right in Soweto?  And Eskom is the fourth largest electric utility in the world, that's the South African utility.  We, we, we talked to [South Africa President Nelson] Mandela and his group about, "Don't try to build three-bedroom houses.  Put electrical in, put telephones in."  Telecommunications, by itself, increases per capita income some four or five times, just the fact that people can talk, you know.  Even in Bangladesh today,  they have businesses where people rent cell phones to villages so they can call out and they found that the economic benefit for these villages have just increased ten in twenty-four.  So, this  is not hard to do.  I mean, the problem I had with South Africa, even today was that the white  business leaders, while they, they, they tolerated Mandela, still did not open up their resources,  which could have given them, in effect, new customers.  See, what we told Vons and others, we said, "These are new customers for you, and if you want to grow your company, you want to go to places where you can get new customers." And we found, with supermarkets, for instance,  that security is higher, but the profit margins are higher in the black and brown communities for  one simple reason, blacks and browns eat differently than whites.  Blacks and browns eat more  packaged goods and more meat than whites, which are higher profit margin items.  So, we got down to that kind of understanding. But when you, if you come from a marketing background,  that's part of your selling.  So, when we could present things, because you know an objection is  going to be security.  Security is 7 percent higher in the inner city than it is in the suburbs.  Okay,  so how do you make that 7 percent up?  You make it up because, quote, "Here's a profile of what  people buy in the black and brown communities.  These are the kind of items they buy, and they  spend a higher percentage of their income on these items."  So, I mean, and it's proven big time.
Story_ID: 9808
Speaker 1: Now, how did you deal with the issue of, you know, the different agenda of the races?
Speaker 2: That was difficult.
Speaker 1: The black race who may feel that it's losing some ground, you know, to the Koreans who had  been hurt.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Very hurt.
Speaker 1: The Hispanics who--.
Speaker 2: Thought it was their time.
Speaker 1: Right.  Everyone thought they were going to be the largest and they were unwieldy and  you know, not necessarily knowing their way.  You know, how did you handle that?
Speaker 2: Well, that, that is very, that's very complex.  I mean, we used to have Korean business  people come in and they were very sensitive, you know, for somebody saying this was an unrest,  to them it was a riot.  I mean when you lose your life savings or somebody just burned your store  down, that's a riot, you know?  So, you really had to become sensitive.  All Latinos really felt  that blacks had had their day in the sun.  And it was time for their day in the sun.  And, you  know, I mean in, in, and so, and then blacks believed that they caused all this and so they should get some recognition and some changes should take place, you know.  So, it was, you know, we  formed what we called a human relations committee.  We had ten different committees that we formed, and one of them was this human relations committee where we actually brought people in from all these different places and we had places like CORA and, and the Human Rights Commission and different groups put on seminars and conduct these meetings for these, maybe a thousand people.  I mean it's amazing.  We had a meeting with the educational committee at 7:00 in the morning, and there were like six hundred people there.  Okay?  So, I mean on one  level, I mean it was just a great time for L.A. [Los Angeles, California] because we got people really involved.  People, even though sometimes they didn't like what we were doing, but we  were the catalyst for change.  I always said, you know, "It doesn't care about whether it's RLA  [Rebuild L.A.], but if there weren't any RLA, there wouldn't be any response at all."  Because we were able to, to, to really get the newspapers, the TV, we had billboards, we had, you know. We  got people thinking about this thing and talking about it, and I'm really a big believer that you  have to have, you gotta get people off their duffs to be able to get something done. And from  there, other groups form, and it's still going on.
Story_ID: 9809
Speaker 1: At first, it was [Rebuild L.A. leader] Peter [Ueberroth] and I, okay?  And then we, we had to have a female.  Then we had to have an Asian.  Then we had to have a  Latino.  So, before you know it, you got four or five people trying to make a decision that we  used to make on the fly.  So, it became very cumbersome.  And then, all of a sudden, and most of  the other people that came in the organization, the co-chairs, were from the community.  They  had no management business background.  So, we got people that were basically good people,  but they were trying to do management jobs and didn't have the management expertise.  And  then you had all this influence about board.  We had a hundred person board, which was  unbelievable.  That we consciously put together.  We put it together for this reason, we, Peter and I, and it was a good, I think it was a good concept but it got away from us, we wanted to get  the top hundred people in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] County in the same room, so that we could have  people that would never get a chance to meet and see these people to be able to network with  them.  That was the whole idea.  The board wanted to actually run the organization, and that's where the problem was.  So, we used to have meetings that were televised live.  Can you believe  this?  It was unbelievable.  You would go into the meeting.  Why?  Because it was the biggest.  You had everybody from Cardinal [Roger] Mahoney, to the sheriff, to the  police chief, to the mayor, to the governor, everybody, all these people were on our board.  All  the top business people, all the top community people, all the top religious people, all the top  lawyers, all the top doctors.  It was unbelievable, and it was vertically sliced by ethnic group.  So, I mean we had all, it was unbelievable in the sense that we had the real, we had a lot of the  core of Los Angeles County there, but you couldn't run a meeting like that, a hundred people couldn't run an organization.  And this was getting into '90--late '93 [1993], '94 [1944].  Peter left in May of '93 [1993] after about fourteen months and then we were, you know, I was still the chief operating officer, but I never really got the support of the other co-chairs because they  wanted their own ethnicities and all this. And everybody started seeing things more from a racial  standpoint as opposed to who is the best for the job, how do we get it done, and so forth and so on.  And I had made up my mind around then, you know, mid to late '93, that I was going to  leave, and I did leave.  I left in March of '94, and the organization never was the same, really.  I  mean they brought, I mean, after I left, they did away with the co-chairs.  They brought one  young lady, Linda Griego, who's a fine, young lady, but she, too, was a political appointment  and she basically worked to make the organization a planning organization as opposed to what I  would consider, you know, really going out and being an action organization.  And because the  383 million dollars we brought in, we brought that in the first two years.
Speaker 2: So, just, he left, was that too much for him, do you think?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then you, then it got too much for you at some point?
Speaker 1: Well, at some point.  I had been there a little short of two years.  And I could see, again, it  was like Xerox, you know.  I could see around corners.  I said Bernard, this is not what you want to do when you grow up.  You know, being in an environment where, you know, first of  all, everybody's, you know, you can't get agreement, and we have lost the very mission of the  organization.  And, after almost two years, seven days a week, it was a, it was a pressure cooker  job, I mean, you know.  I got a piece of mail one time where somebody just wrote my name on it and put RLA [Rebuild L.A.] and I got it.  I mean, I mean that's how much profile during that  period, you know.  It was just unbelievable.  You could just, I mean, you used to get hate mail.  You used to get, just, it was a lot, and at some point, you just have to say maybe it's time to get  back to my private life.  And we've always been private people, so this wasn't.
Speaker 2: So, how, but see, that was a learning experience in a lot of ways.
Speaker 1: Great, great.
Speaker 2: And it catapulted you to  grow significant prominence here, you know.
Speaker 1: And now, you know, I mean, there are very few places I can't go, that I want to go.  And  there are not many people who won't return my phone call.  So, in that regard, I was telling you  that people know me more from this than they do from Xerox, you know.  So, I mean it was a,  it was a wonderful experience.  I mean, I wouldn't give anything from it because it  really had just launched into a lot of different areas that I'm enjoying still, you know.
Story_ID: 9810
Speaker 1: I said "Now, tell me what's different about the response to this riot [Los Angeles, California, 1992] than all the other riots that happened before?  Okay?  See, but most people don't think that way, you  know.  They just think that people just woke up one day and said "Well, we're gonna invest this huge amount of money in South Los Angeles [California]," you know, "six months after somebody burned down a store."  People don't operate that way.  Not business people, you  know.  I've been in too many rooms with CEOs [chief executive officers] and, I mean, they are  very, very risk averse to a fault, to a fault.  I mean, you have to, I mean, you know, we had compelling arguments to convince them that this was the right way to go, compelling arguments, statistically compelling arguments.
Speaker 2: And you had the right team.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: It takes the whole [unclear].
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  You can talk their language.  And, you know, when you got a vice president from Xerox, I mean they look at you differently because they already know that you  didn't get there, that didn't just happen.  So, they know that you are someone that could  understand their world, so.
Story_ID: 9811
Speaker 1: Now, so you leave, so what have you been doing after this?  You have KBK Enterprises.
Speaker 2: That's Khalil Bernard Kinsey [son's name].
Speaker 1: That's nice.  Okay, so what have you been doing?  I mean you're still very young.  I  mean you're still very young, you've got a lot of years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I've got a lot of, yeah, I feel that way too.
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things still that you can do, which is a blessing.  So, I'm just wondering,  where you are in this point of your life?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm enjoying it.  Let's see.  My consulting practice is working with senior  management teams on effectiveness.  I only work with CEOs [chief executive officers].  So, I really  look at a very small niche, and I go in and basically say "I know what you do, and you're the  loneliest guy in this building, and I could help you."  So, I have been very successful like, with  Kaiser Permanente, the chief of police, I'm working now with the sheriff and his leadership team.  I'm  actually running a small telecom company in Santa Rosa [California] as their chief operating  officer while I'm doing some of this other stuff.  But I've had a really good success in being able  to talk to CEOs and convince them that I could help them, okay?  And then, in fact, do it, you  know.  Like with SBC, I worked like with seven different presidents in SBC, so that's what I do.  I go in and I'm very expensive, you know.  I charge a tremendous amount per day, which means  that everybody can't afford me. So that means I have to get the CEO to agree, and I, you know, I  basically say, "Look.  How valuable is your business?  How valuable is your career?  I can help  you with both of those."  And, you know, we've had a lot of success.
Story_ID: 9812
Speaker 1: Can you talk a little bit about your collecting?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I love this collecting.  Well, since we moved in the house, you know, we've traveled a lot.  We collected--every culture that we've been in, we've collected from, and in probably the last twelve or thirteen years, we've--yeah, maybe thirteen years we've started collecting African American paintings.  Now we collected--we have sculptures and other kinds of artifacts, but we were never into stuff that was hanging until maybe the last ten or twelve years, and even the last five years I have really become very interested in our old black masters.  As I showed you downstairs, we've started, you know, collecting, you know, [Henry] Tanner, [Robert Scott] Duncanson, [Edward M.] Bannister, Grafton Brown, you know, Palmer Hayden, Hughie Lee-Smith, you know.  I mean, these are all in our community.  These were all the pioneers.  [Wife] Shirley [Kinsey] always said that I'm interested in the dead people, and she's interested in collecting contemporaries, but we also have Phoebe Beasley and Artis Lane and Jonathan Green, people like that, who are young, not just young but have, you know, are contemporaries and have done some wonderful things, but as you can see, our whole house is really an experience for us so we kind of--everywhere I go it's like going on vacation because I'm looking at things that we bought and we acquired in different parts of the world at different times of our lives, and it's just all very special so we built this house so our things could go in it, and the house is just kind of the wrapping for, you know, the art and the items that we've collected, but I'm really very, very close as Shirley and I are very close to everything in here because they all have some special meaning.
Speaker 1: I'd just like to touch upon the collecting because that room down there is very striking in many ways, you know, what you're starting, you know, the slave letters and, you know, the other.
Speaker 2: Nineteenth century.
Speaker 1: Nineteenth century artifacts, and I'm just wondering where did that interest come from, and why has that captivated you?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm a big history buff, you know, I mean, World War II, Civil War, you know, and, particularly now this whole, you know, 1810, this, you know, slavery and this period, and the 'Harper's Bazaar', 'Harper's Weekly' pieces we got--you know, those eight or nine pieces, I actually bought those in 1981 at a Xerox conference with Al Martins, and for the longest--maybe for ten years-- we didn't even put them up, and then I got them framed, and they just spoke to me, and about three years ago we really began to get more serious about collecting African American art, particularly brothers from the nineteenth century.  I mean, when you look at how difficult slavery was and here brothers and sisters that actually made a living either sculpting or painting in 1852 and 1870, I mean, it's just extraordinary.  It's just extraordinary so we said we should own a part of that history so that's what we've done, you know.  We own like six of the top, say, nine or ten nineteenth century artists, and my plan is to own them all, you know, and for that room, that wine cellar downstairs to be a room when you walk into it, you'll get a connection with our past, and some of the pieces that, you know, we've been able to acquire are really, really special pieces.  You know, I'm more interested in the personal side of what happened during this period as opposed to just having a thing, you know, like that letter from the slave owner selling this seventeen year-old housekeeper and would not tell this young girl that she was being sold away from her family.  I mean, this is the kind of letter that just really tugs at you, and it really says a lot about that period but on a personal level, and that's sort of how Shirley and I look at our lives.  I mean, you know, we want to look at this more personal aspect of things from the experiential area we - that makes us go, you know.
Story_ID: 9813
Speaker 1: Now I want to talk also about Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical  University, Tallahassee, Florida] because it's a, it has represented an institution, you know.  You talked a lot about the [marching] band and the role it played, but you've been very involved with, you know, the institution.  Your son [Khalil Kinsey] went there.  And, so, I just would like for you to talk about, you know, just briefly, some of  the work that you've been doing, and you know, some of the fund-raising and why, you know,  that institution is important.
Speaker 2: Well, in 1984 or 1985, I was asked to head up the industry cluster program, and it was  started back in 1968 by the federal government to get businesses involved with black colleges and, basically, it just kind of went dead.  And Dr. [Frederick] Humphries asked  me to, to really revive our program.  We had two companies at the time I took it over.  Over the next seven years, we grew into a hundred three companies and raised about nine million dollars.  And this nine million dollars was the monies that Florida A&M used to attract [National] Merit Scholars and we ended up being the  number one school in America to attract in black Merit Scholars.  And in [1997], it was named  the number one college in America by 'Time Magazine' and 'Princeton Review.'  So, I believe I  had a little bit to do with helping, you know, with that.  In 1998, I took over as president of the [Florida A&M University] National Alumni Association because it was really in disarray.  I mean we were down to about seven hundred paid members, and we just had lost our vim and vigor.  And in three years, we tripled the membership.  We, we had the first successful national convention, actually, we're  gonna have another one here in another couple of weeks, where we had twelve hundred FAMU [Florida A&M University] alumni, the largest gathering alumni outside of a football game in the history of the school.  Had  Muhammad Ali as our guest of honor, has a sold out, we had twelve hundred and some people  for our banquet that Saturday night.  So, it was a very successful, we raised a couple of hundred  thousand dollars. And I left that job just in January of this year [2001] with about six times more money  than it had before and in good shape membership-wise. And I'm like this, I'm not a maintenance  guy.  I want to, if there's a problem, I want to get in and fix it and then I want to move on.  Because I use the saying, "I wanna have a lot of lives" and, you know, you gotta, you know, I'm  not interested in maintaining anything.  I mean when stuff gets maintained, it means it's already  fixed.  I mean somebody else can do that.  I'm more interested in building or repairing or fixing than I am in maintaining.  So, whenever I get a situation that I think is, is back to, you know,  where it should be, then I'm looking for the next hill to climb or the next opportunity.
Speaker 1: And, you know, one thing I noticed is that FAMU now has a law school, and I was struck by that, because remember how you were saying earlier your father [Ulysses B. Kinsey] originally wanted to be a  lawyer.  I want to go, I want to ask a few--.
Speaker 2: They closed the law school at Florida A&M when I was in college.
Speaker 1: That's right. Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was  very important for us to get that back.  It took, literally, twenty some years to get the law school  back, but it was a very painful day in Florida A&M's history when the board of regents or the  board of control basically took the budget away from Florida A and M and gave it to FSU  [Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida].  So, FSU's law school came from FAMU's law school.  It's unbelievable. Unbelievable, some of the foolishness that used to go down.

Speaker 1: What do you think, do you see a good future for blacks in corporate America?  I  mean a staying, sustaining future there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, and I'll tell you why.  Because it really is skill-based.  I mean when you  get, the reason that Ken Chenault and the Barry Rands of the world and others have done well is  because they learned their task.  They learned their craft.  And I think that to the extent that  people, of any race, but particularly black folks focus on, on those things they control, they're  gonna find that they're going to be in control of their lives a lot better.  And that's how, I, I focus  on this thing.  I am still very disappointed that here are many, many businesses I walk into and they're still totally white, white male.  So, I mean, I think there's a lot of room to, you know, for  growth in this area. But, you know, you really do, you know, this thing about your eating an apple one bite at a time, I mean you really have to go at this thing because some of these are big jobs.  Ken Chenault got a big problem right now: he just wrote off almost a billion for American Express, so he is going to be challenged in ways that I'm sure he is going to do well on, but his  training is going to be what carries him through, you know.  [Carleton] Carly Fiorina, who's white, female,  she is being challenged in ways that will have nothing to do with whether she's white, female.  If  she can't turn Hewlett-Packard around, then she's got a problem.  She's gonna be out of there.  So, at the end of the day, the real options for us is really to be better at what we do and to work hard at acquiring the right skills, the right values, the right work ethic and surrounding yourself  around, you know, people that love you and care about you.  Because only where you get that  sustenance are you gonna have the energy to go out here an fight these wars.  And, I know, with  [wife] Shirley [Kinsey], I mean, I come home, you go home with your tail between your legs and you go out the  next day, you know, because you got somebody that really supports you. And you need all of this  to make it work.  But any time we focus too much on race as a condition of where we are, I think  we lose the ability to control our lives.  And I really, strongly recommend people looking  outside, you know, and just saying hey, I got more control over this thing than not.
Speaker 1: So, if you could build the world for black people going forward, what would that world  look like, you know, for its success?
Speaker 2: Well, I think one of the key things is this ability to build on past successes.  One of the  things that I am still really disturbed about is that we like to start all over.  In other words, we  don't want to take what someone else did and build from it, which is, I think is an attribute that  you see in business in the white community all the time.  Even when we, you don't care for  someone, you take the good parts and you use those.  The other one is to get more back to our  communities as it relates to giving.  We give less than almost any people in this country.  Statistically, people that make fifty thousand dollars, we give half as much as, you know, are  counterparts.  But our community organization needs more than almost any place else.  We  cannot look for someone else to do what we can do for ourselves.  I'm a big believer that we  have the wherewithal to do this, but it requires that we, we stop using this term "ain't it awful" as a way to define our condition rather than saying what are we going to do about it, which is  really the only thing that we have any control over.
Speaker 1: And do you see, who would you say you see that this is happening?  Would you point to  certain projects or things where you see that those things are starting to happen and they can be  models within our community to build from?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I'm blocking right now.  That's a good question.  That's a good question.
Story_ID: 9815
Speaker 1: Why is this entity called family important?  Why is it important and why is the sense of tradition important?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think family is important for all, for all people.  I mean if you, I don't care where you go in the world, I mean you see people on Sundays, you know, at the park with  their family.  I mean, you know, I think it is just, it's the core of your belief system, is to protect  and nourish those closest to you.  You know, so, I mean, I mean some of this has just been myths  put out in the black community.  I mean there's a myth that, you know, black people are  probably the most conservative people they know, but we're not conservative about civil rights,  and that's, so we're not, because of that, we're not concerned about anything else.  But, in fact,  our value structure has always been, tended to be more conservative about our personal mores  and how we conduct ourselves. But all of this is, it, we have to focus on what we control and  what we, who we are, and the thing that I feel the, the, the best about is that I see a number of  black folks, I mean many, many, many black folks that have a similar attitude about this thing  that I have, about that we have to restore our black communities, we have to restore this notion  of being able to build on each other's successes.  In other words, I got a number of things I do in  a speech, and one of them is, is writing people and just congratulating them more.  I mean, it's  amazing what that does in terms of, you know, opening up yourself, because you can't get it  unless you give it.  You know, and to the extent that we get, we get used to giving each other  congratulatory statements, we then open ourselves up to receive them.  And there's a story about a guy, [David] Deacon Jones, came from Eatonville, Florida, it's a powerful story, and a guy who was in  the cluster program with me, told me this, almost under tears, he said, in high school, Deacon Jones intercepted a pass and was running down the sidelines to score a touchdown and he said he  wanted to go out there and tackle him himself because he knew when he scored the touchdown  that it would never be the same between him and Deacon Jones, because he was going to leave  town and leave him there in Eatonville. And to a large degree, that happens in the black community all the time.  And this notion about you can't leave me behind, okay?  This is a  true story, so. I mean I think about that and that really characterizes a lot of this behavior, this  counterproductive, destructive behavior I see all the time, which keeps us starting over all the  time, you know, rather than building. And I'm just encouraged that I see so many brothers and  sisters that have adopted a more positive approach to, because they've had the experience and the  knowledge now to be able to see how things are done and to be able to walk past, you know,  what would have caused us to really stop and now we walk past it to keep moving in a, in a  positive direction.
Story_ID: 9816
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: A role model.  Someone who cared deeply about his wife [Shirley Kinsey], and his son [Khalil Kinsey] and his family and  friends and has tried to be a good guy, you know, on a lot of levels for a lot of things.
Speaker 1: Any comments you want to say?  Any hopes for your son?
Speaker 2: Plenty of hopes for Khalil, that his life will be as fulfilled as mine has been.  That the road that he is taking, which is different than the road that I want him to take, you know, proves to be a good road, you know. And, you know, the Aboriginals have a saying when their kids go  off, you know, "We love you, but," you know, "it's your journey," you know. And, as  grown-ups, you know, as adults, we have to let our kids go, you know, to do it, but you really do  hurt for them in terms of their ability to achieve those successes.  I guess, in some cases, they  really have to almost achieve those failures, you know, to be able to appreciate it, you know.  And so I do, I am concerned about his well being and hope that I'll stay out of his way enough  that he can be able to achieve what he wants to do.

So I'm on this plane, and someone knew that I was with  Xerox and seen the billboard.  They saw this billboard and they said, "We love the billboard."  And I thought they were talking about the Olympic billboard.  So, they went on to talk about this  billboard, and then, after a little bit, it just didn't make sense.  I said, "Well, that ain't the kind of  billboard we put out."  So, they said, "Well, no, it's a billboard congratulating you on your new  job."  I said, "You gotta be kidding."  So, coming back, I took a picture and this is right around Carson [California].  You know where the golf course is?  You know where the 405 [Interstate 405] and the 110 [Interstate 110] come together?  Well, a little, a little south of there on the right-hand side,  this is what they put up.  It was, you know.
