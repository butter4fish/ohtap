Speaker 1: Okay.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, can you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Sylvia Diann Trimble Bozeman, S-Y-L-V-I-A D-I-A-N-N T-R-I-M-B-L-E B-O-Z-E-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2: No, my maiden name is Trimble and my husband's name is Bozeman.  I took that name when we married forty-four years ago.  So there's no real story that I know of.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I always ask cause there might be a you know, a story.  And ma'am, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born August 1st, 1947 in Camp Hill, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where is Camp Hill near?
Speaker 2: Camp Hill is in Southeast Alabama near Columbia, Georgia really on, near that state line of Georgia and Alabama.
Speaker 1: It's interesting.  We interviewed someone whose father was from Union Springs which is close by too you know just yesterday.  So--
Speaker 2: Oh okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Camp Hill, Alabama.  And ma'am, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I am professor of mathematics at Spelman College and so I'm an educator and a mathematician.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is December 18th, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: And we are at Spelman College in Tapley Hall, historic Tapley Hall and that's in our new science center which is about ten years old.
Story_ID: 23979
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of warm up and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I don't really have a favorite food.  I favor vegetables, fresh vegetables you know and that's probably because I grew up on a farm and so I don't eat much red meat.  But I just, and I love desserts so those are my--desserts are my weakness and then my favorites are vegetables.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I think not although you would think so by the fact that I wear so much black and brown.  But I think more of a cranberry would be my favorite color.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I like summer time and I like the Christmas season.  Not too fond of the cold weather but you know, but I do like the holiday season.  But I just enjoy summer time.  I like being outside, prefer outside to inside.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Again, probably because I grew up on a farm.
Speaker 1: Now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: We try to go anywhere there's water.  So I like to go on cruises, I like to go to the beach and I also like to go to spots that have history where I can learn about history.  I was never very good at learning history from a book, textbook so I like to go to the spot and learn about the history of places.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't.  I have many, mostly passed down from my mother and my father, they had so many.  And maybe I'll be able to share some of those with you along the way today.  But I don't have any one in particular.
Story_ID: 23980
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now I'm going to ask about your family history first.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family separately from your father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And first--and then we'll put them together.  So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother is Robbie, R-O-B-B-I-E, Robbie Jones Trimble.  Her maiden name was Jones.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: T-R-I-M-B-L-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: September 11th, 1918 and I think she was born in Chambers County, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Is that near Camp Hill?
Speaker 2: It is.  Camp Hill is in Tallapoosa County and Chambers County I think joins Tallapoosa on a border so it's nearby.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your family history?  How far back can you trace your mother's side of the family and what are the stories from that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well I can go back to my mother's paternal grandfather, Israel Jones and his wife Sally Jones.  And my--she was an Indian, I'm not sure what tribe and he's black.  And so mostly I know that they had twelve children and we call them the twelve tribes of Israel and my grandfather, Casby Jones was one of those twelve.  So he's the first person that I knew.  I didn't know my great-grandfather.  I knew my grandfather was--and he married my grandmother Kizzie, K-I-Z-Z-I-E.
Speaker 1: Now how do you spell your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: C-A-S-B-Y.
Speaker 1: C-A-S-B-Y, Casby Jones, okay.
Speaker 2: And so he married Kizzie and they had--
Speaker 1: Now this is before 'Roots' came out.  This is before Roots came out (unclear) Kizzie.
Speaker 2: Yes, right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so they had four children, one of whom is my mother.  I think they may have had five but one didn't survive childhood.  And so they had four children who all lived to be past eighty.  And my mother who is now ninety-four is still--and her one brother who is ninety-eight, they're still living.  The other two are deceased.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now are there any stories on that side of the family about slavery or emancipation or trying to acquire land or going to school or any of those kind of things?
Speaker 2: Okay.  So my grandfather Casby lived, raised his family initially in Chambers County [Alabama] and there were no high schools for black children in the area where he lived in Waverly, Alabama.  And so he had this daughter, my mother and he had you know three other children but my mother was number three.  And so when she finished elementary school there was no place for her to go and she was a pretty studious student.  So my grandfather--so after she finished she went back to school for the next three years to help the teacher with the other three, other children because there was nothing else to do.  My grandfather decided that he was going to move the family to Camp Hill, Alabama where they had just started the first school for black--first high school for black children and the year that the first class graduated in Camp Hill, he moved his family there so that his girls could go to high school.  And when he did that a friend of his sent his girls to live with them so they could all go to high school.  So my mother was fifteen by that time and she went, started in the seventh grade and so she you know blossomed.  She was the class valedictorian and she there learned--I don't know whether she learned to love math there or whether it was before that but she really loved math in high school and used to tell me stories about the math teacher.  But it was a--he evidently really valued education for his children and so he moved there so that they would be able to you know get that education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm interested the stories your mother told about the math teacher.
Speaker 2: She used to tell me how the math teacher would give them a problem that nobody could work and then how she and her best friend went home and the next day they came back with the answer.  They were the only two that could work the problem.  And she was so proud of that and I think her love for math is what rubbed off on me because she always loved math and she would tell me how her father had a unique way of teaching her how to multiply and how to do other basic math.
Story_ID: 23981
Speaker 1: Her father, this is my grandfather Casby was a blacksmith so he had to use a lot of math.  He you know he did things like in addition to sharpening scooters for the plows and making horseshoes for the horses and mules, he also made wagon wheels so that required a good bit of geometry, understanding of geometry.  And so I guess he was pretty good at math too and all of that just kind of made her [Bozeman's mother, Robbie Trimble] that much more interested in math.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So he could make wagon wheels?
Speaker 1: Yes, and that's what blacksmith had--that's who made the wagon wheels the blacksmith because you had to put a metal rim--you had to make the wheel out of wood and then put a metal rim around the outside of it to keep it from wearing down.  And then the horseshoes had to be made and fitted to the hoof of the horses and the mules.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So with a wagon wheel you have to you know find the center so the spoke, and measure, the spokes have to be certain distances.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: It's an exacting type of a process.
Speaker 1: Right, some exact measurements there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, cause if they're not exact you're in trouble.  Right, so he was a wheelwright as well as a blacksmith?
Speaker 1: He was a what?
Speaker 2: A wheelwright, that's what they --
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: -- used to call a person that could make wheels.
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Wheelwright and a blacksmith.  So any other stories about--now I didn't know he was a blacksmith until just then.  So--
Speaker 1: Well he had a blacksmith shop right next to the house when they lived in Camp Hill [Alabama] when I knew him you know growing up, when I was a child but my mother tells me that he had a blacksmith shop everywhere he lived.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So it was at his home?
Speaker 1: It was next--right.  When I, as I--when I was a child it was next door to the house so I used to go out and sit there and watch him fire up you know whatever and heat up that metal and beat it down with a hammer and shape it into whatever he wanted it to be.
Speaker 2: Okay, it's interesting.  What about your grandmother, any stories about Kizzie?
Speaker 1: Grandmother was a gentle lady, active in the church, a deaconess in the church, just a good person you know looking after the people in her community and just a housewife.  And they had a little, they had a garden and a small farm area there also and so she raised food there for the family just like other people did.
Speaker 2: Now is there, since the name has been made famous in fiction that really came after your grandmother's name, but is there a story about how she got the name Kizzie?
Speaker 1: I think Kizzie is a name from the bible, I really think it is although it may be spelled a little differently.  It might have been pronounced Kizzai [pronounced kiz-eye].  People when they read it now I think they pronounce it Kizzai.  In fact people used to call her Kizzai so I'm not sure now.  My daughter is named Kizzie also after her and she was also named Kizzie before Roots.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But you think it's from the bible?
Speaker 1: I think it is.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So, now did your mother go on to college after she went to the school in Camp Hill?
Speaker 1: No, she didn't go on to college.  She married my father and he was in college and he married her as soon as she--grandpapa would let her marry.  And--but my Grandpapa Jones said you know he would not allow her to get married until she finished high school so she was twenty one by then because she didn't start till she was fifteen.  And I think she finished high school and she turned twenty one on September 11th.  I think they got married before September was over.
Story_ID: 23982
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well I'm going to go back to her but I guess it's time to talk about your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Horace Edward Trimble.  It would be Senior now that--I mean he, because he now has a son.  He had a son that he named for himself as a Junior.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 28th, 1913.  I guess he was born in Camp Hill, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so what are the stories from his side of the family?  How far back can you trace his side?
Speaker 2: Only back to his father.  His father was mixed.  His grandfather was white, his grandmother was black.  And so his father--and I didn't understand that until I looked it up in the census report and saw how they listed him.  And then his grandmother, I mean his, my father's mother was named Lula Bailey before she married John Trimble and that's--so my grandfather is John Trimble.  He was a minister, you know preacher, he was a farmer and he was a blacksmith so kind of an all around support for the community.  He was--I, the story behind, with him is that during the depression he was one of the few people who could buy lane.  He bought--I think he bought 100 acres of land during the [Great] depression.  So they were both you know pillars of the community.
Speaker 1: And a blacksmith too, huh?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Not as much of a blacksmith as my mother grandfather but he you know had a blacksmith shop and he did a few things too.  He also made syrup and, meaning that he had a press in his yard where you could put sugar cane in and then you know the mule would turn it around and the juice would come out and then he would cook it right there and make syrup, cane, sugar cane syrup.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did he sell insurance too?  I think I read somewhere that--
Speaker 2: No, my father did, Horace Trimble, Sr. was an insurance salesman.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, you're talking about the grandfather, John Trimble, okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather.  My grandfather was a preacher and a--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --made the syrup and a blacksmith and all that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm getting ahead of myself.  But okay--
Speaker 2: And that's John Trimble.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so are there any stories on that side of the family about the--about emancipation or--?
Speaker 2: You know I guess those are the stories that people didn't pass down too much.  I tried to ask my father about his family to get more information about his grandfather, his great, you know his grandfather and all he would say is you know if you dig too deep there's some skeletons in the closet.  He would not talk about things that went back that weren't you know, that he didn't feel comfortable with.
Speaker 1: So your father has a white grandfather.  He, did he know who he was?
Speaker 2: Right.  He would not even talk about that.  So I think it was a slave owner.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, that, yeah in terms of the time it would add up to that, it could have been.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, right.  And so I think that's where the name Trimble comes from because there's a white Trimble group in Camp Hill [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Do they spell their name the same way?
Speaker 2: Yes, and they know they're related to my family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how do you know they know they're related?
Speaker 2: Because my--there's a white church in the town and my brother was looking for a place to rent and they rented him the parsonage, an old parsonage.  They didn't use it.  And they acknowledged to him that they were related to him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they knew.  So, that's probably where this, the white ancestors, probably a white Trimble (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes.  Right, that's where you would find the Trimbles in the white community.
Speaker 1: Are they well off these Trimbles or--?
Speaker 2: I don't know them.  I don't really know them.  Well you know I actually, I mean I left Camp Hill when I went off to college and I have not lived there since then until I've been going back over the last ten years since my mother's been ill taking care of her and I've had to relearn you know the cousins and the people.  I really didn't keep in touch with the other people outside of the family that much.  So I don't really--you know when we were growing up, when you say do I know them, when we were growing up, it was really a period of segregation and so there was absolutely, I mean there was no contact between black children, white children, black families, white families you know that I could see.  I'm sure there was contact at my parents' level and--but they, I think the way that they kept us from being hurt by segregation is to keep us totally separated from it.  You know just--I mean of course we saw the signs that said white only water fountains or the restroom facilities and all of that.  But in terms of just intermingling or just meeting, confronting segregation head on, they tried to keep us from that.  And so I know very little about the white families in my community in the town.
Speaker 1: Okay, I understand.
Story_ID: 23983
Speaker 1: Now you said your father [Horace Trimble] had a chance to go to college, right?
Speaker 2: My father went to college.  He went to Alabama A & M [University] and think he was, he got into his second year and-- [BRIEF PAUSE]
Speaker 1: He, I think he was in his second year and he quit to, soon as Grandpapa Jones said he could marry mother [Robbie Trimble], he came--then he quite college and got married.
Speaker 2: So, okay.  So getting married cut his college career off too.
Speaker 1: Oh he was waiting.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did he have an aspiration, a goal you know, did he have a career goal in mind when he was going to college?
Speaker 1: He--in agricultural.  That's what, I'm not sure what he wanted to do but when he finished, when he came out there were some--he took a job with the government helping farmers.  And what he used to do was teach them things like how to slaughter their animals and how to cut up that meat into the kinds of cuts that you would get in supermarket.  And so I think they called him a farm agent.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so that's what he did when he first came out, at least in his early years before he became an insurance salesman.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So these were years of the New Deal I guess and he was a--
Speaker 1: Probably so.  That would have been--
Speaker 2: Sounds like an agency of the, you know that kind of agency that was created by FDR [Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 32nd President of the United States] in those days.
Speaker 1: Okay, in the 1940s?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Thirties or Forties.  So he came out of the, he was a--yeah this would be the 40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Right, he, so I think he stopped school in '39 [1939], so that yeah that would have been in the early, in the 40s [1940s].
Story_ID: 23984
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did your mother have a career goal in mind?  Was she, did she want to teach math?
Speaker 2: My mother was a substitute teacher for years and years so even though she didn't go to college, as soon as she finished high school you know later on--I mean if she had--remember she taught, she helped the teacher for three years before she went into high school and then she finished high school.  So she just became a natural teacher and whenever--this was a period when there were small, one room school houses for black children all over the south.  And she became a substitute teacher.  When there was not a teacher and the teacher couldn't come or something, sick, then they would call her to go to these schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then after that she became a substitute teacher in an elementary school and the high school you know in town once all those little schools were closed.
Story_ID: 23985
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story about how your parents [Robbie and Horace Trimble] met?
Speaker 2: How they met?  I really don't know.  I don't know how--you know they attended the same church and that, so that's probably how they met.  My mother and her family lived near the church and my grandfather was a minister at that church.  And so that's probably how they you know got to know each other.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Mount Traveler Baptist Church, T-R-A-V-E-L-E-R and that's in Waverly, Alabama, W-A-V-E-R-L-Y.  And that's still the home church.  It's been that way for, you know since my mother was a little girl that's been our home church.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story behind the name, Mount Traveler?
Speaker 2: That I don't know either.  Yep, that's just the church.
Speaker 1: It's an interesting name.  I hadn't heard of it.
Speaker 2: So yeah, so I, I'm sure that my, that they've all attended the same church.  My uncle, okay so my mother's brother used to tell me recently told me about how he, about my father's sister was the prettiest girl he'd ever seen.  So they all must have gone to the same church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your parents got married in what about 1950 or '49 [1949]?
Speaker 2: My parents got married, '39 [1939].
Speaker 1: '39 [1939], oh '39 [1939], okay.  So--oh, well he dropped out of school then in '39 [1939], not '49 [1949]?
Speaker 2: Right, '39 [1939].
Speaker 1: Okay, '39 [1939], all right.  So they got married, okay.
Story_ID: 23986
Speaker 1: Now when you think about your parents' personalities and their dispositions and their sense of humor and what they were interested in, their hobbies and how they looked, how they walked and talked, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure I take after my mother [Robbie Trimble].  So she's very outgoing.  She was a seamstress by the way even though I said she was a substitute teacher, but her regular you know day time, she was a seamstress.  She also was a gardener and over, you know took care of all the children.  We had--she had five, they had five children and I'm just number three in that group.  And I don't know, she was the person who really believed in academic achievement and so I'm sure I took after her.  My father [Horace Trimble] was kind of easy going, loved to tell jokes, loved to make people laugh.  He always had one.  And my mother was more of a, the caregiver, looking after not only her children but everybody else's.  But they both were great believers in education and so they tried to take us to any kind of program, any kind of activity exposed us to whatever they could and they would take along anybody else who they could.  In fact as they got--as we got older they bought a little bus and they would, so they could take more children and they would take children to conventions and youth conferences and even today people come and tell me, you know I remember going to Selma [Alabama] with your dad, with Mr. Jack, that's what they called him, Mr. Jack and Ms. Robbie in that green bus.
Speaker 1: That's something.
Speaker 2: So they generations of kids in that green bus to--as long as it lasted to--
Speaker 1: Was this an actual school bus or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --it's a little--
Speaker 2: You know like a, bigger than a car but it would hold--didn't they used to have a little Volkswagen bus that--and I can't remember whether his was Volkswagen or not.  But I guess it would hold ten children.
Story_ID: 23987
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is time I guess to talk about your--now your father [Horace Trimble] did become an insurance agent, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, he became an insurance salesman.  In those days, that meant going from house to house collecting insurance premiums.
Speaker 1: And what company did your father work--?
Speaker 2: Atlanta Life Insurance Company which is based, it was based in Atlanta [Georgia].  And I guess that was, I guess that must be one of the earliest black companies.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the one that Herndon [Alonzo F. Herndon], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah that's it.  That's it, Herndon.
Speaker 1: Yeah, his house is here in Atlanta [Georgia] preserved and he's one of the, I guess the--well the mainstays are Auburn Avenue and--
Speaker 2: Yes, right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --lot of--supported Atlanta U [University], you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't remember all the details.  Seems like, I'm trying to remember from--but yes, A. F. Herndon.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Atlanta Life Insurance.
Speaker 2: And so daddy was an insurance salesman and then he rose to become the district manager of the Opelika District [Alabama].  That's where the district office was and he was manager there for a long time and he had other salesmen working you know with him.  They would go out into the different, each one has a different city or district to collect from.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did he ever do anymore consulting with farmers, I mean--?
Speaker 2: He didn't.  Once he became an insurance agent I don't think he did.  I don't think he did.  And even my mother [Robbie Trimble] worked as an insurance agent for about five to seven years.  She tried it out because you know she never have a full time job and so I think she thought she would try it and she worked in that Opelika district as one of the agents so that worked for a while.  That wasn't the greatest thing.
Speaker 1: Before I forget about it, we were talking about the little minivan or the small bus that your parents bought to take the neighborhood kids to different events and things.  So what type of events would they take them to?
Speaker 2: Especially religious events.
Speaker 1: Okay, so church--?
Speaker 2: You know, church events, church district meetings, conventions, youth conferences, anything like that.
Story_ID: 23988
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have--oh, can you name your brothers and sisters for us?  I--
Speaker 2: Okay, I have four, three brothers and a sister.  So I had, my oldest brother was Horace Haywood Trimble, Jr.  The second was Angelo Van, the third, and then I'm third, fourth was my sister Sheree [phonetic] and she is now Sheree Lockhart.  And the youngest is John Condolia and that's John Condolia is C-O-N-D-O-L-I-A, so I call him Condolia but he's named for my mother's brother who is also Condolia.  That's an African name.
Speaker 1: Is it?  Okay, is there--what's the story about that, you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know how my grandparents decided to name him based on somebody who visited Africa I think and came back and named him.  I'm not sure how that worked.  But I don't know anybody else--and it's C-O-N-D-O-L-I-A and so when he goes to the doctor or something they always think that Ms. Condolia is coming in.  But that's--so he didn't have any children, my uncle and so my mother named her youngest son for her brother Condolia and named him John after his grandfather, my grandfather John Trimble.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's an uncle named Condolia so it's two names in, two of them in the family?
Speaker 2: Right, my mother's brother is named Condolia, the one who is 98 and then my youngest brother is named Condolia.
Speaker 1: C-O-N-D--
Speaker 2: --D-O-L-I-A.
Speaker 1: Okay, I-A, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, and his first name is John, John Condolia.
Speaker 1: Now was your, anybody outside of the family a missionary in Africa or anything?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But you think that they were inspired by somebody that went over there and came back?
Speaker 2: Right.  Who, right who came back and gave them that name.
Speaker 1: Which, I know there were black missionaries going over with the AME [African Methodist Episcopal] church and the Baptist church you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, so--
Speaker 1: --to Africa in those days.
Speaker 2: --this would have been 1909, see--yeah.  That would have been 1909 when they named him Condolia.
Speaker 1: Liberia was a popular place for people to go you know as missionaries.
Speaker 2: What place?
Speaker 1: Liberia.
Speaker 2: Oh Liberia, yes that's true.
Speaker 1: Because of the link that was already there.
Speaker 2: That's true, yeah.  I really just don't, I don't know what that--I have to ask my uncle if he knows.
Speaker 1: The way the name is spelled and the way it's pronounced after you know so many years it's hard to tell where it came from.  But that's an interesting story and the name was passed down in the family.
Story_ID: 23989
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory is just being a little, you know as a preschooler just learning songs and practicing dances with my little sister who is three years under me and preparing to perform for my daddy [Horace Trimble] when he came home from work at night and we would sing and perform for him.  My other early memories are just being on the farm, being, stayed at my grandmother's house.  I guess she was babysitting us.  This is a Grandmother Jones and watching grandpapa work in that shop.  See, he passed when I was eight years old so when I talk about the blacksmith shop you know this is before I was eight.  So you know I hope my memory is accurate but this is what I remember.
Story_ID: 23990
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well we always ask this question, can you describe where you grew up and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well I grew up on the farm.  It was a small farm, twenty acres.  And it was just a rather, I guess care free and quiet, pecan trees all around the house and a big garden on the side and mother always had a big garden and we had some crops out in the field as well and we had cows that somebody had to milk everyday.  And we, my, I had cousins that lived next, in the next house which means you know a fourth of a mile away.  We, in the summer we ate lots of vegetables and, from the garden and we went out and picked fruit so we could pick, we picked wild berries, like blackberries and we had apple trees and peach trees and so we always made pies for dissert during the week.  So we didn't eat a lot of meat, we ate a lot of vegetables and desserts and then you ate meat on the weekends for the most part.
Speaker 1: Did you grow a lot of beans I guess--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --different, like kinds of beans and peas and--?
Speaker 2: Beans, peas, carrots, potatoes, greens, corn.  So my favorite vegetables are probably cream corn was one of the favorites.  I mean there's nothing like cream corn straight off of the cob that's right out of the garden.  You know it's amazing how that has nothing to do with corn in a can.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I agree.  Okay.  Well what other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: So we spent a lot of time at church.  We went to church and were very--mother and daddy were both very active in church and my school.  So by the time I was, well okay so before I was school age, I went with mother [Robbie Trimble] sometimes to these little one room school houses and I guess that was when grandmother couldn't babysit.  But I interacted with the children there and actually I guess learned a lot because when I started the school at age six in my own community, I went into the, they put me in the second grade.
Story_ID: 23991
Speaker 1: So I went to Agreeable Hill Elementary School because that's the community that we lived in, Agreeable Hill Community.  Every community--
Speaker 2: Agreeable Hill.
Speaker 1: --had its own little one room school house.
Speaker 2: Now was there a story behind how that community was named, Agreeable Hill?
Speaker 1: Agreeable Hill, have no idea.  And so they--Agreeable Hill had its own Agreeable Hill School, elementary school one room school house for black kids.
Speaker 2: Now was there an Agreeable Hill actual hill there?
Speaker 1: Not that I know of.  That was just the community and maybe it was named, maybe the community name followed the school name, I'm not sure.  And there was a school next to us Chapel School, Chapel, and that community was Chapel Community and Genis [phonetic] Chapel, I don't know why that was on there.  But, so this little--I went to school starting at age six in the little, in the one room school house where all six grades were in one room and had one teacher.  And, but it was a nice big, well built school house and I found out, I just found out recently from one of my schoolmates who's still there that that school had no electricity.  I never thought of that.  It had a whole wall of windows and I never thought about the fact that it didn't have electricity.  Of course I knew it didn't have running water and indoor plumbing and all of that but I never thought that it didn't have electricity.
Speaker 2: So there was nobody turning on the lights when you came in and you used--
Speaker 1: The windows.
Speaker 2: --the window, yeah the window light.
Speaker 1: It had a potbelly stove in the middle and the kids made a fire in the morning unless a parent did it before we got there.  And it had some small rooms on the side, a room for water and lunch so two kids could take the bucket and go down the hill to grand papa's house and get a bucket of water and bring it back and then every child had glasses in there and so that was our water.  And then it had another bigger room for the library where we had all of our hand me down books that were cast offs from other schools.
Speaker 2: Now was it supported by the county at all?
Speaker 1: It was a county school I believe.  I think all these schools were county schools.
Speaker 2: So the county paid the salary of the teachers?
Speaker 1: You know now I'm assuming that.  I don't, I'm assuming that they had to.  I just, I don't know the details of that but I'm sure they all worked the same way.  There was one in every community.  And those schools survived until about two years after I went to high school and I think--and then they started closing them all up.  But it was a great school, I mean a great learning environment and for me it was good because I could learn what the other classes were learning so I would--since I was really interested in math when it was time for math and the first grade had math and the second grade had math, third--well I could see what the third and the fourth graders were doing.  And it was the same way for reading.  You know when it was time for reading then each class had to have reading so--
Speaker 2: Were you ahead of the, of your class normally?
Speaker 1: Well because I started off at six in the second grade so that put me ahead right there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And your mother [Robbie Trimble] was, you said you know had--was somewhat of a mathematician then, right?
Speaker 1: She just loved math.  I won't call her a mathematician since she just finished twelfth grade but yeah that was her fondest subject.  And, but she liked, I mean she liked everything.  She just believed in, that you should know you know, you should have--you know she believed in buying books and having books in the house so that we could look up things.  And when--after television came along we came home from school, at the end of the day she had to let us know okay who won the Pulitzer Prize today?  We had to know that before we went back to school the next day.  So she just believed in education.
Speaker 2: Now did you, were you an avid reader too?
Speaker 1: I really don't think so.  I mean in terms of just loving to read books for no reason you know, just because I loved to read I don't think so.  My daughter is oh, but I was not.  So she didn't get that from me.  But I just like to do math.
Speaker 2: Now did--were your math teachers in elementary school you know good teachers?
Speaker 1: You know so just one teacher for all those schools for all the classes, all these subjects and I think that was just a--math was not a special area for her.  She was a generalist I would say.  But I think--and so the math, any extra I learned about math was probably from my mother until I got to high school.  Then things changed.
Story_ID: 23992
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was your personality like as a little girl growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I talked too much, I told everything at school that went on at home and I was never good at telling a lie.  I--those are the only things I can remember.  I was outgoing, made friends easily.  So I don't know--and I was just a studious, studious person.  And that's all I can remember in terms of different traits.  I was always active in the church activities.  We had, we went to Sunday School and then to church and then to Baptist training union back at night and I was in the little girls' red circle group so I was in everything, choir, I was in everything.  And so I was just totally involved but I don't remember any particular traits.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there opportunities you know--I suppose there were like different opportunities, leadership opportunities in church--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That--
Speaker 2: And I was a leader in those.  I remember being president of the girls' Red Circle.  I remember being a delegate to the convention, going to the convention on behalf of the church.
Speaker 1: Now the, is this the National Baptist Convention or--?
Speaker 2: It would be the State of Alabama Baptist Convention.
Speaker 1: Which would be (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Or sometimes it would district.
Speaker 1: About how many people would come to the convention?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  The ones I remember most would be the district convention so you have thirteen or fourteen churches and they have a convention for two or three days at one church with all the people delegates from, you know coming together.  And so that would happen once a year, you have the Sons (unclear) convention then another time you got the women's convention and another time you got something else.  So you might have three or four conventions a year just for the district and then people from that now would go to a state convention.  I remember the first time I went without my parents and they decided that I was probably old enough to go along with another girl who was a teenager to the State Convention.  So you know there were--those were opportunities to just actually be exposing and learning and be involved with other people.  And then my mother [Robbie Trimble] became president of the women and she was for many years president of the women's--of the district, the women's convention, women's auxiliary of the district.  My dad [Horace Trimble] was, became president of the Baptist Training Union for the district.  You know so they were involved so we were involved.
Story_ID: 23993
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now as you were growing up a lot of key moments in the civil rights movement [1955-1968] were taking place but I don't know what was going on you know in, where you grew up.  So you mentioned before it was highly segregated.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a chance to go into town much or did you--?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I went into town but you'd be amazed that I--and I guess the white families were doing the same thing the black families were doing.  They were keeping their kids separate from the white--from the black kids too.  So I would go into town but I hardly, I can't remember ever interacting with white kids in town or anywhere.
Speaker 1: So the stores downtown, how did they segregate?  So was it real heart of segregation down there?
Speaker 2: No, the stores they were all owned you know by prominent white people in the community and you would just go in and shop, no problem.  But we just didn't see, didn't interact with the kids.
Speaker 1: Okay, so as long as you understood certain things you couldn't do down there or--?
Speaker 2: Well for example there was one--there were no swimming facilities for black kids but I think there was as swimming pool for white kids.  But you know I never saw it.  There was one movie theater and the white kids sat downstairs and the black kids sat upstairs and so my mother [Robbie Trimble] would never let me go there though she let the boys go.  But the girls didn't go.
Speaker 1: Now what was the reason for that you think?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But we were not allowed to go to that movie theater.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--well I mean those are the things I remember most.  And so most of my memories about integration was, were--are about what was happening, what we were listening to on the news about what was happening at University of Georgia and University of Mississippi, you know what was going on in other places.  And that was when I was in high school.  So I guess when I was a senior is when John F. Kennedy [35th President of the United States] was killed.  That was--so that's, I'm trying to place the time.
Speaker 1: It was 1963 when Kennedy was killed.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so I graduated in '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Just a year before that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember being, you know I remember what horrible sadness that was that came across everybody and we sat in gym and cried when he was killed.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that had been the fall of your senior year, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, in November of '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: It was, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And what did he represent you think to the students?
Speaker 2: I don't--I guess he represented hope you know of a different era.  And I think that's what he represented mostly to the black community because he had you know played a role in helping with the segregation I mean with the integration, federalized those troops in Alabama and you know when George Wallace stood in the door and with that segregation now, segregation forever.  And then--so those were the things that I knew about what was going on.  It was always in some other town.  It was nothing that was you know in our town, nothing was happening in our town.
Speaker 1: And I think actually the Wallace thing took place in '64 [1964] when Johnson [Lyndon Baines Johnson, 36th President of the United States] was, during the first part of Johnson.
Speaker 2: Okay you're right.  You're right, you're right, you're.
Speaker 1: But Kennedy did like people--
Speaker 2: But didn't University of Mississippi take place when Kennedy was trying to think now, getting all these things kind of--
Speaker 1: Georgia did, I think University of Georgia did, I know that.  And Kennedy did speak to before--that summer he spoke after the murder, just before the murder of Medgar Evers [African American civil rights activist], he spoke about how this, the country has to change.  You know I think a lot of people heard that and that was the strongest statement we had heard from a president.
Speaker 2: And I was trying to remember Autherine Lucy [first African American to be enrolled at the University of Alabama] in, down in Mississippi, that was the first thing I remember, the earliest I remember of integration attempts.  So my history like I said is not the greatest in terms of trying to sequence all these things.  I need to go and visit, that's why I like to visit historical sites and so I can clarify.
Speaker 1: I don't think they were organizing in Alabama, I mean voter registration till '65 [1965] I think, you know.  I think so SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] made a big push but SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] had been in the major cities and I need to know where you were, I don't know what was going on.
Speaker 2: Not much going on.  I, and then I left in '64 [1964] and I--
Speaker 1: Now was there--okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: I was going to say I left in '64 [1964] and I went to Huntsville and Huntsville is very different and was very different from the rest of Alabama.  It was like a northern city in the south because of the Redstone Arsenal and all the influx of people from all over the world.  And so it was--very different.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was there an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in Camp Hill [Alabama] that you know of?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  Camp Hill is a small town.  There is one blinking light in the middle of town.  I think at that time it was, maybe it was red and green but yeah there's one light in the middle of downtown.
Speaker 1: Now '63 [1963] was the year of the March on Washington.  Did, was there, do you remember what the adults' reaction was to the march?
Speaker 2: I can't remember that.  It was '63 [1963]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the summer before President Kennedy was shot.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I can't remember that.
Speaker 1: And the 16th Street Baptist Church was bombed that September, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yeah that was--
Speaker 1: You know in Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 2: --a turbulent times.  Those were all turbulent times.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well now--
Speaker 2: And it was all things that we were listening to from other places, you know but there was no direct involvement where we were.
Speaker 1: Did you feel like when you saw it on--cause up north we would look at it and say oh, down south they're catching hell you know.  We were too we didn't know it.  But did you have a sense of you know the reports being about you or being about the place that you were at rather than you know some point of trouble some place else?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry did I, did what now?
Speaker 1: I mean did you see yourself in the midst of some kind of struggle those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, I mean I saw black people in the midst of the struggle and--but like I said I was just totally protected from all of that.  I--not until I went to--okay, so I went to college and then that was a predominantly black college and not until I went to graduate school did I interact with other, with white students.  Not until I went to graduate school.  I had white teachers in college, no white students.  So it was--when I went to graduate school I had to first face segregation for myself and the first incident was when my husband--you know I got, well I got married just before college and I'll come back to that, but just before graduate school and we had to find a place to live in Nashville, Tennessee.  And we looked in the paper to look for ads for an apartment and when we found one, this little, you know just perfect apartment I told my husband well let's go look at this one.  And he said you can't have that apartment.  And that was my first time just really having to face segregation for myself.  And I--what do you mean I can't have this apartment?  He said you cannot get that apartment.  You know when you--he's not going, they're not going to rent you that apartment.  And I had him to, I said we're going to go over there and see.  And so we went over there and the, when we pulled up in front the guy came out of his house saying we just rented that apartment.  You know and so I had, that was the first time me really facing it, that there was something I really couldn't you know, that, that was really barred because I was black.
Story_ID: 23994
Speaker 1: Okay.  And let me go back to high school.  Now you went to Camp Hill High School?  This is the new --
Speaker 2: I went to Edward Bell High School.
Speaker 1: Edward Bell, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, Edward Bell High School.
Speaker 1: Now where is Edward Bell, is that in--?
Speaker 2: That is in Camp Hill [Alabama].  So it was Tallapoosa County Training School and we had at some point before I got there, there was a principal named Edward Bell and he was such an outstanding principal that they named the, when they built the new high school they named it for him.  So it was a black principal that was there.
Speaker 1: Was this the principal that was there when your mother [Robbie Trimble] was there?
Speaker 2: No, it was somewhere between my mother and myself.  But by the time I got there he was no longer there.  He was gone and I think maybe he had passed and so there was another principal that I went, name was Lee Rowe [phonetic].  But so we had the Edward Bell High School and then there was still the County Training School was now the elementary school.  And we had a brand new high school for black kids, well you know--which was a very nice high school with science labs and a new gymnasium and all of that.
Speaker 1: So this is another, this is the school since your mother went, when your mother went was the first time they established a high school.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So that high school became a--?
Speaker 2: That was Tallapoosa County Training School.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And so it lasted until you know I'm not sure about which buildings but that school lasted until they built a high school and a new one and named it Edward Bell High School.  And then finally that became the whole school.
Story_ID: 23995
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were just commenting on the fact that they organized training schools for black people in a lot of counties, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So if you look at different counties across the south there were training schools organized for black students and so there was one in Tallapoosa County and so it was Tallapoosa County Training School until probably late 50s [1950s], early 60s [1960s].  I can't, I don't know exactly when that became Edward Bell High School but it was named after this principal.
Speaker 1: And there are a lot of--do you have any idea about why it was called, these schools, a lot of these schools are called training schools, these counties, these schools established for black people by the counties?
Speaker 2: I guess it was a realization that they needed to have high schools for black kids and I'm not sure why they were all called training schools but that was just a southern thing.  I'm not sure whether that was some kind of national movement or governmental decision. I'd have to look that up.
Speaker 1: You think it has anything to do with the difference between education and training?
Speaker 2: That's a good point, that's a good point.  It probably is that--not educating, just train them.
Speaker 1: It makes you wonder.
Speaker 2: It does, it makes you wonder.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that--so the school yeah I was saying at the end of the last reel the school that your mother [Robbie Trimble] came-father [Horace Trimble] brought her to Camp Hill [Alabama] to go to was the old Tallapoosa County Training School which is the first high school that they had--
Speaker 2: For black kids, right.
Speaker 1: --in that area, yeah.
Story_ID: 23996
Speaker 1: Then Edward Bell High School was established, about what year?
Speaker 2: It was just the new name you know that was established and they made that the high school when they built the new high school then they built that, called it Edward Bell High School [Camp Hill, Alabama].  And then they still had the training school but that became now an elementary school.
Speaker 1: So Edward Bell opened just before you started high school or--?
Speaker 2: Probably a few years before I started high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now you came out in '64 [1964] so you what started in sixty, 1960, high school?
Speaker 2: You know I started in seventh grade so I went to high school for six years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't have middle schools, it was just elementary--the one room school house went from first to sixth and then the high school went from seventh to twelfth.
Speaker 1: So this is 1958 then until '64 [1964]--
Speaker 2: Okay, yes.
Speaker 1: --I guess, right?  Okay, all right.  So in high school now were you involved in a lot of activities in high school?
Speaker 2: I was.  I was.  When I went to high school my first year in seventh grade, that was the largest class they had ever seen.  I guess we were the baby boomers and we had two homerooms.  So I don't remember, maybe we had fifty or sixty kids in seventh grade.  But remember now we are all coming from these little one room school houses all over the county now all coming together in seventh grade at Edward Bell high school along with the little kids that came from the elementary school right there in town.  So there was a big group of us.  But I, you know so you wonder how you're going to match up, you know your academic background but we were good students and on par.  And I did real well, I was a good student at, in seventh grade and eighth grade, you know.
Speaker 1: And did you have a favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: We had, my teacher, my homeroom teacher was named Ms. Jean Bozeman.  First time I'd ever heard that name Bozeman, never thought it would be my name.  And she's actually a distant relative of my husband's.  But she was I guess she was my favorite teacher at that point in terms of--one of my favorite teachers.  The other was my math teacher Mr. Frank Holley, H-O-L-L-E-Y, and so he was probably my favorite teacher because he taught math and because he was a good math teacher.  He was a young man right out of Alabama A & M and this was a time when the country was in the race to go to the moon and we had Sputnik [1957] and the government sponsored a lot of teacher institutes across the country, science and math institutes for teachers.  And so he went to some of those and brought back ideas and you know he was just inspired to make us you know science and math students, good science and math students.  And then to--and good math students I guess in his case, and he did.  So he was--he inspired me and he stayed with me to make sure that I developed my mathematical abilities and not just me but the other students as well.  But I really owe him the credit for really helping me become a good math student.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now so you had him for more than one course?
Speaker 2: I did.  I had him all through high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, for all the math courses?
Speaker 2: I think I did.  I don't remember another math teacher.
Speaker 1: Now that's interesting because that provides some continuity of the instruction that you wouldn't get--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know today when there's one teacher for geometry, another one for algebra.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, so--but I can't remember him in seventh and eighth grade but I just don't remember having another math teacher.  And then by the time I was, when we got to, when we finished Algebra I, Algebra II, let's see we finished algebra, we had geometry.  Oh, and then he wanted us to have trigonometry and the county would not allow him to teach trigonometry because they said there were not enough students to take trigonometry and he thought that we needed the trigonometry to be prepared for college.  So he told our parents if they would bring us back at night he would teach trigonometry at night and they did.  They, from all these little farming communities they brought--so I mean I can't remember how many of us but you know at least a half dozen or so and he taught trigonometry at night.  That's how I learned Trig.
Speaker 1: That is something.  That's really something and it does show a dedication to education that--
Speaker 2: A commitment on his part to his students.  He wanted us to be prepared for college.
Speaker 1: And on the part of your parents too to bring you at night.
Speaker 2: That's right, on the part of our parents because they had to drive us back.
Speaker 1: So this is how long a drive are we talking about?
Speaker 2: Well I was four miles away and some of the others were a little farther than that.
Speaker 1: Okay, but that's a commitment and so you had trigonometry in high school.  Now--
Speaker 2: And then after that when there was nothing else for me to take, no other math, he gave me a study hall.  I had a study hall on my schedule and he had me to read solid geometry and he worked with me you know in that book so that I would continue to learn math.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so he was really a dedicated teacher?
Speaker 2: He was.
Speaker 1: Okay, any other teachers or personalities in school with you that you remember that--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had, you know we had dedicated teachers, all black teachers, they were all dedicated to--and they all insisted on excellence, all insisted on you, you know doing what you needed to do, what you should be doing.  And they had a lot of parental support so they didn't back down.  So I had English teachers that were good, I had even the librarian had us doing special programs and you know speaking and they just you know did a good job.  I had chemistry, Spanish, I remember those teachers, they were all good teachers.  So I guess that's one thing that happened in those segregated schools that the teachers were all committed to your total development and committed to send you on to the next level and they had parental backing so I think all that made a difference, which it's probably a lot different from what we have today.
Speaker 1: Now did you run for class office or anything or--?
Speaker 2: I, what was I?  I guess, I think I was, you know I'm trying to remember now.  Yes, I was a class, I was in the student government and I was a class officer.  But I'm trying, I can't really remember now.  And I worked, I sang in the choir for all those years, what else did I do?  I was in the class play, I you know was just active.  And I worked in the principal's office.  That was my little side job.  I don't know if I got paid but I worked in the principal's office.  And I think you know those are the things that I remember.
Speaker 1: Now did they have a National Honor Society there too?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was in the National Honor Society.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So when you graduated were you the top student or--?
Speaker 2: I was.  I was valedictorian.
Story_ID: 23997
Speaker 1: All right.  So now what kind of advice did you get about you know college?  I mean what did--who advised you about college?
Speaker 2: In terms of where to go?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and how to pay for it and all that?
Speaker 2: You know there weren't a lot of options.  Okay, so I applied to Alabama A & M [University], Spelman [College] and Tuskegee [University] and when we saw the bill and saw how much scholarship I could get and how the scholarship and the bills and the cost correlated, then it was just down to Alabama A & M.  That was the place that we could afford for me to go.  Now my brother had gone there, my oldest brother and when he finished, my young, next brother had to wait on him to come out and then he went.  And then he had only been there two years so they were backed up then I had to go so we had to be there together.  And so there wasn't a lot of money you know.  Daddy, we still had, he still had after me he still had two more children at home and so I got a scholarship to go to Alabama A & M that would just about cover everything and that just sealed it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did your teachers provide any connections there for you?  Or, well your brother was there but--
Speaker 2: My brother had been there.
Speaker 1: But was that the only real connection?
Speaker 2: Remember, my father [Horace Trimble] went there?
Speaker 1: That's right, he started there, yeah.
Speaker 2: But you know my, so my math teacher went there.
Speaker 1: Okay, well that's a lot of connections.
Speaker 2: Lot of connections.
Speaker 1: Had you been on the campus before?
Speaker 2: No.  So the registrar, Mr. Ralph Lee who was the registrar at Alabama A & M went, that particular year he went to a lot of small towns in Alabama and recruited the top students.  And so he came to Edward Bell and recruited maybe four of us to go to Alabama A & M and gave us scholarships and went on down to Carver High School in Montgomery [Alabama] and recruited about twelve of them I think.  It's a large high school and my husband was one of those, my husband to be.  And so we ended up together in that class at Alabama A & M.
Story_ID: 23998
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well is there a story about how you met?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I guess we were in this group together and Mr. Lee had started a great books club for all his scholarship students so we all had to read these classics and come together and talk.  And then Robert and I, my husband is Robert, and we were in the same math class and at one point we were in--we weren't in the same biology section we had the same biology teacher.  But we had some classes together and so we got to know each other the first year.  And his, one of his best friends from Carver was also--became a friend of mine and I think it was through her that we really met.  Her name is Flora.  And that's how we really met.  And by the end of freshman year I needed at the end, near the end of freshman year I needed an escort to take me to the debutante ball and I asked him to escort me and that was the beginning of us really starting to date.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's good.  So you all got married right after school, right?
Speaker 2: We got married, yeah right.
Speaker 1: After you got your bachelors degrees?
Speaker 2: We graduated on Sunday and got married the Saturday after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know in those, in that period of time most people got married right after college.  They went to college, they found a mate there and they got married.  We didn't wait till twenty, age twenty-six like they do now.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 23999
Speaker 1: So now, so what was going on at Alabama A & M [University] in 1964, right, you were there?
Speaker 2: I was there from '64 [1964] to '68 [1968] and when I started there it was the very conservative.  As a first year student we had to be in the dorm by 6:00 p.m., you know.  Yes.
Speaker 1: You're right, that's very conservative, yeah.
Speaker 2: After that you had to check out.  You had to sign out to go out on campus, just to go on campus after six.  And so first thing we did was protest and got the--by sophomore year I think we could be out till ten on campus and you could go--if you were off campus or I don't know somewhere ten to eleven range we could be out.
Speaker 1: Now I guess in contrast to say a school like Michigan State [University] or Ohio State [University] or probably even the University of Alabama, no restrictions on students in terms of that.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Come and go anyway they want to.
Speaker 2: Even then, even back in 60s [1960s], '64 [1964] to '68 [1968]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in the 60s [1960s].  Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm not surprised but--
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure you know at University of Dayton [Ohio] it was like that and where I grew up in Central--well Central State is a black college.  They had restrictions, they had like you know rules about no males could visit the females and--
Speaker 2: Right, oh we had the--
Speaker 1: --and the time curfew I think was 11 o'clock at Central State.
Speaker 2: We, so we had to break down a lot of those rules during the early period, '64 [1964], '65 [1965] in terms of--and establish some new rules about you know when males could come in and so forth.  But, so that was a period of--and maybe they were trying to be protective of the fact that we were all coming from these small towns all over Alabama, mostly over Alabama and did not--were not familiar with the city, you know what could happen in a city and so forth.  So I think they were just trying, they were trying to be very protective.
Speaker 1: Now [Alabama] A & M is in Huntsville [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: It's in Huntsville.
Speaker 1: Huntsville, okay.
Speaker 2: It's a land grant college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were saying that Huntsville was a more progressive town than a lot of towns in Alabama?
Speaker 2: It really--yes because we had the big Redstone Arsenal that had just developed you know there and there were people brought in from around the world, scientists and so their families.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I guess around the country too you know.
Story_ID: 24000
Speaker 1: Now Huntsville is now the sight of a, is a NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] center in Huntsville.
Speaker 2: Right.  So Redstone Arsenal turned into Marshall Space Flight Center.  And so that's one of the NASA sites.  It was originally named Redstone Arsenal.  But it is still the same NASA facility, evolved.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now it's the Marshall Space Center.  So--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Robert worked out there when he, as a, you know sophomore, junior in college math major.  He actually worked out there in the evenings as a, in an engineering position.  That's what they called them, engineer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is, you really--did you follow the space program closely when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I don't know that I followed it more close than anybody else but you know I was aware and I went out to, onto Redstone Arsenal.  Actually my department chair, Dr. Howard Foster was a physicist and he had some connections out there and he hired me as a student research assistant to help him with some calculations and he took me out there and had them to give me access to a computer, a small computer, small meaning probably the size of that file cabinet over there but at that point it probably could do about as much as a little hand (unclear).  But you know, but it was my first introduction to the idea of computing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you learned how to--was the computer basically a big calculator or something that--?
Speaker 2: Yes, really.  And I don't, I can't even remember how much I learned from being out there you know working on that because I didn't really have a lot of help.  But I, you know I did help him with his calculations there and back in, back on campus using desk calculators to the point that he did acknowledge me in his paper when he published his results.  And so you know that probably gave me my first introduction to research and then the next summer I can't--I would, and it must have been due to his influence but I ended up spending a summer at Harvard [University] in a summer program for students that came from minority institutions, mostly across the south.  There was a summer program in Harvard in math.  Well I guess it wasn't just in math.  I was in math and some of the other students but some of the students were in other areas.   So I spent a summer there and after that you know I was primed for graduate school.  So I have to think that Dr. Foster influenced me to do these things.  I can't imagine how else I would have ended up at Harvard in a summer program.
Speaker 1: Now what's his first name?
Speaker 2: Howard Foster.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh Dr. Howard Foster.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And he was, he taught physics and math at--?
Speaker 2: He was chair of the math and physics department.  It was one department but he was a physicist and he taught physics.
Speaker 1: Now did he teach you calculus?
Speaker 2: No, just physics.  He only taught physics but he was the chair of the--it was a combined department.
Speaker 1: So, but you had calculus I guess for the first time in--?
Speaker 2: I had calculus at Alabama A & M with Dr., I'll think of that in a minute.  His name just slipped right out of my head.  I had a Cuban calculus professor, Castillo, Dr. Castillo.  He was one of my favorite teachers too, C-A-S-T-I-L-L-O.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dr. Castillo, so he taught all of us calculus, my husband, taught my husband calculus too.
Story_ID: 24001
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now in terms of the, you said the students were kind of revolting against some of the rules on campus.  Now was there any civil rights activity amongst the students in Huntsville [Alabama] itself?
Speaker 2: Not a lot that I can think of.  The best, the thing that sticks in my mind most is marching the night that we got the news that Dr. Martin Luther King had been assassinated.  And there was just a spontaneous march that you know where we all left campus and marched down to this courthouse downtown which is about five miles away and had a rally down there and came back.  And there was, it was peaceful and you know people were just so, they were just in such deep sorrow and it was--people didn't know what to do and so they just hit the streets, started marching.  And so as a student--now so this is in college.  So then I was one of the vice presidents of the student government and so the student government officers were involved in the marching and the--but we had a great dean, Dean Henry Fonda who was also out there marching with us and I think that helped to keep everything orderly because of the way he spoke at the rally.
Story_ID: 24002
Speaker 1: Okay, Henry Fonda, okay.  So is there--so you said you were ready for graduate school?  You knew you were going to go to graduate school after completing your bachelor's degree?
Speaker 2: I did.  Well I did by the time I got to that point.  I was--I knew I would apply to graduate school and I would apply for jobs and you know see what I got.  And--
Speaker 1: And what was your projected ceiling on what you could do in math when you entered college?  Did you see yourself as a school teacher or what did you see?
Speaker 2: When I entered college I thought I would study math and that I would not prepare to be a schoolteacher.  And so my mother [Robbie Trimble] couldn't figure out what I was going to do if I was not preparing to teach school.  And I told her well I don't know but I think somebody will need a person that knows math and so I just decided I would study math.  And we had the education track and arts and sciences track and I just took the arts and sciences track.  And I just went on faith that if I knew enough math I would be employable.
Story_ID: 24003
Speaker 1: Now did--at [Alabama] A & M, were there many female math students?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, it you know it was never male dominated it was just, it was, I can't remember how many but we never thought of math as being something that women shouldn't participate in even in high school because teachers never let us think that there was anything that we couldn't do.  You just do whatever you wanted to do and if you--long as you work hard and prepare for it.  And so I never thought that my doing, being you know interested in math or wanting to do math was something special.
Speaker 1: Okay, cause you hear people say that now there are more women in math now than it ever has been before.
Speaker 2: We never heard that.
Speaker 1: So but you never really--?
Speaker 2: We didn't--we were never told that.  We never introduced that thought.
Speaker 1: Did you have any women math teachers?
Speaker 2: I can't remember any.  Like I said I had the same math teacher all the way through high school.  But--
Speaker 1: Well in, at A & M?
Speaker 2: But I can't remember, yeah for the others.  Yeah I can't remember who the other math teachers were really to be perfectly honest.  Mr. Holley taught most of the math classes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's high school but in--at A & M were there any (unclear)?
Speaker 2: At A & M, yes I had women math teachers.  Yeah, I--and so one had a Ph.D. in education, one did not have a Ph.D.  So I never had a math teacher, a woman that had a Ph.D. min math.  But I had, I did have math, women math teachers.
Story_ID: 24004
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now you chose to go to Vanderbilt [University] from graduate school.  How did that, how did you make that decision?
Speaker 2: We applied no--so now, by now I'm married and, or about to be married and Robert and I were deciding on picking a graduate school together.  And so we applied to three places and Vanderbilt just turned out to be the school of choice.  So we applied to Auburn University and someplace in Missouri and then Vanderbilt.  We just applied to those three.  And then we went on job interviews together and we got a good offer at Vanderbilt and decided that we would go there.  And probably Howard Foster encouraged us to choose that.
Speaker 1: Did he have a connection to Vanderbilt?
Speaker 2: He had a physicist friend that was at Vanderbilt and--as a graduate student though in physics.  So I'm not sure what his connections were.  I'm not sure except for that friend who is Dr. Ron Mickens who is here at CAU [?].  And when we went to Vanderbilt we moved into the apartment that Ron was moving out of and so I can't--but I don't know you know, I don't know what other connections Dr. Foster had at Vanderbilt.
Story_ID: 24005
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well all right, so Vanderbilt University, now this is--had Vanderbilt [University] been integrated long?  I don't think it had, had it?
Speaker 2: Okay.  It had been integrated four years I think in terms of the undergraduate level 'cause I had a girlfriend who was in the first class, entry class where they integrated the undergraduate school.  And she was just, so she finished in '68 [1968] I think.  And when we went in the fall of '68 [1968] the graduate school in the math department had been integrated one year.  We were the, we were in the second year and there was one black student there in the math department already.  And so we came in, three of us came in from Alabama A & M [University].  So my husband and I and another young woman Nancy Fields came.  And so that was my first, you know as I said before first time going to school with white kids.
Speaker 1: Okay, and well now how did the experience play out?  Was it okay or--?
Speaker 2: It was okay.  It was a little nerve racking in terms of the teachers because of the, you know you hear about what the, how the teachers responded to the whole idea of integrating the department and so you have lots of rumors and so it was a little nerve racking to have some of those teachers as--in the math classes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: So you're saying there were stories about how some of those teachers reacted to integration that weren't very pleasant?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You're saying and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And now you know you have them for class.
Speaker 2: And now I know I have them for a professor so it's not clear how they're going to respond to us.
Speaker 1: Are there any particular stories you remember about what they did?  I mean when they first integrated the department?
Speaker 2: You know and so I don't want to repeat rumors.  I heard that some resigned their positions you know, administrative roles in the department but I don't really know, can't confirm that.  But they were pretty, they were very reasonable.  They were very--they didn't show any signs that they did not want us in the department or in their classes.  And so we had no trouble and we got along well with the students.  That was not a problem.  We made lots of friends, good friends and some that we've had ever since.  So it was a good experience for us in the math department.  I had a friend who also went with us from Alabama A & M and he went into chemistry and it was not such a good experience for him mainly--not so much in the classroom but he lived in a dorm.  My husband and I lived off campus so we only had to go to class then we could leave and then we had each other and we could be you know off campus.  But he lived in the dorm and he, the only person that would speak to him was the cleaning lady and so it was you know difficult environment for him and at the end of a year he had an ulcer and by the--and he transferred, went to another school and got his Ph.D.
Story_ID: 24006
Speaker 1: Now is mathematics the kind of subject that you should, that it helps to have a study group?
Speaker 2: Oh definitely, it definitely helps.  So it helped that Robert and I made a study group with the two of us.  That helped as well.  And then we learned to study with some of the other students especially as we got to studying for preliminary exams for the Ph.D.  So we studied with other students as well.  And then we had a few professors who reached out to us so that if the two of us were studying in an empty classroom one might come in and you know offer some, ask us if we had questions or what we were working on or you know teach us something that we didn't know.  So it was a pretty good environment.  There were two or three that were very supportive.  You know I could name some of them.
Speaker 1: Well go ahead.
Speaker 2: Well Richard Ernsdorf [phonetic], he's a German and he was one of the most supportive in terms of just checking with us to see if everything was all right mathematically, to see if we needed any, you know we--if there was anything that we had questions about.  And then Dr. Billy Bryant who became the department chair.  I'm not sure he was department chair when we got there.  Billy Bryant was very supportive throughout the time we were there.  And we were there five years I guess.  So that's a whole story and you have to tell me how much of that you're ready to hear in terms of our five years at Vanderbilt.
Speaker 1: Well was there--do you feel you were, you know prepared well for graduate school?
Speaker 2: I did not have the background that I needed for the classes.  I did have the study skills and some of the other students for example had already taken the algebra course out of the same book at the undergraduate school and I had not seen most of that.  So we had algebra, we had analysis and then we had topology.  And in algebra and analysis they all had a better background and so they didn't struggle as much.  In topology, they had not seen it, we had not seen it and that was the place where we could determine how well we could you know, our background, our knowledge, our skills would stack up against theirs.  And so when we did well in topology, did about the same as they did, then we knew that you know we could survive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was there ever a time that you thought oh this is too hard.  I ought to do something else or too--?
Speaker 2: No.  No there were times when after I took the first preliminary exams, this is like in year three I guess and didn't pass, that they told me I should do something else but I didn't listen to that.  You know the advice I was given was--okay, so I, my husband and I both took the exams together and during the time we were studying for the exams, I was expecting.  And I refused to do anything that would make me unhappy.  I didn't want to have a, I wanted to have a happy baby.  And so anyway we took the--so some things I didn't study.  We took the exams and after it was over he had passed and I didn't pass all the parts and they advised me that since my husband was going to have a Ph.D., I should not have one.  It would be too difficult for both of us to get a job at the same place and I should not continue to get a--that's the advice I was given.
Speaker 1: And you didn't listen to that?
Speaker 2: I did not, did not listen to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, so you earned a masters there in '71 [1971] right but you--?
Speaker 2: I got the masters in '70 [1970], January of '70 [1970] I believe.
Speaker 1: '70 [1970]?  Okay.
Speaker 2: So it took me--let's see, he took, it took him a year and we were both writing a masters thesis and I was trying to type both of them in the summer of '69 [1969] and I had a little accident and I couldn't finish both of them.  So I finished in January of '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Okay, then he--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, so, and he finished in '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we both just stayed there.  We just stayed--both--and then we were really ready to start a family and we did.  So we had one child in '71 [1971] and then another child in '73 [1973] while he was still working on a dissertation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was still--and I was, I stayed in school for a while and then I started working part time teaching.
Speaker 1: Now did he get his Ph.D. from Vanderbilt [University]?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, he did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he stayed and went all the way through at Vanderbilt?
Speaker 2: He--right he went straight through.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So--but after you had your children you went back to school to right (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right, we--after the second child was born then he graduated and we moved here to Atlanta [Georgia].  Then I went back--I came to work at Spelman.  I got a job teaching at Spelman [College] and taught two years before I went back to school, went back to Emory [University].
Story_ID: 24007
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now when you were at, in Nashville [Tennessee], you taught at Tennessee State [University] too, right?
Speaker 2: Part time, yes.  I was just teaching part time at Tennessee State, I think in the Upward Bound Program.  There was a lady in the choir at church and oh, I can't, bet I can't call her name, Geri, I can't call her name.  So she was over the Upward Bound Program and we were at choir practice and she said I'm looking for a teacher at Upward Bound, a math teacher and I said I'm looking for a job.  So we were a good match.  So that was a nice you know thing to help support us as we were--since I was not in school and we had two children.  Well I think we had one child at that point. And then Robert taught part time at Fisk.
Speaker 1: Okay. So when you moved to Atlanta [Georgia], that was like 19 what--?
Speaker 2: '73 [1973].  Um-hmm, and he--we came here for him to take a job at Morehouse [College].  So he taught, he started teaching there in the fall of '73 [1973].
Story_ID: 24008
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right and you went on to Emory [University] to get your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Right.  After coming here, I came here and I went around--like I told you I didn't have an idea of what I wanted to do but I did teach at Vanderbilt [University] too as a TA and I interviewed, I looked for jobs at insurance companies.  I thought a bank or you know and then Spelman and so when I came here then I met two women, both mathematicians and they gave me a job and also a good talking to about going back to school.  So I had, I was--they considered it all but a dissertation you know.  And so I stayed two years and then got back into school.  I, after I stayed two years I realized that if I was going to stay in college teaching I really did need a Ph.D. and--because I couldn't be a full participant in the community without that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now Emory--did Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology] or Georgia State [University] offer a Ph.D. in math?
Speaker 2: Georgia Tech did, yes.  Georgia State only offered a Ph.D. in statistics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you ended up choosing Emory. I was just wondering like why you chose Emory.
Speaker 2: You know so one of those two women that interviewed me, she had gotten her Ph.D. at Emory and Emory--and so I don't know that might have been a part of it.  And then in--and Georgia Tech was, is more of an engineering school, Emory was more liberal arts kind of.  So I don't know, but the main reason, it was close enough to stay at home.  You know at first they were trying to get me to go back to Vanderbilt and finish and leave my two little children here with my husband and that would never work.  So I chose Emory.
Story_ID: 24009
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now who was your advisor at Emory [University]?
Speaker 2: Okay, you know these names, as well as I know.  Okay, we'll come back to that in a minute.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: His name will pop into my head.
Speaker 1: All right, well okay.  So the title of your dissertation I guess was Representations of Generalized Inverses of Fredholm Operators.  And can you explain to us what that is?
Speaker 2: I probably can't.  You know it's a--at the undergraduate level we teach linear algebra and, which is matrix theory, vector spaces and then we also teach real analysis which is about like higher level calculus.  And so I, so operator theory is kind of a cross between those at the graduate level.  You put those two together and you step it up a notch and you have operator theory and you know--so anyway it's a very, it's a topic that if you're not in that area you know you probably wouldn't be so interested in it.  I don't know how to--and it's also a topic where once I finished and wanted, and came back to Spelman I wanted to go out and give talks to high schools or to even to college students.  I could not explain that to them so I, eventually I found some other areas of math to focus on where I could go out and give a talk to high school students.  But that was one that couldn't be brought down to a high school level.  It could only be brought down to a college level by, in a linear algebra class in the context of linear algebra.
Speaker 1: Well how would you explain in on a college level then because I mean just pretend I'm on the college level which I'm not, but with the math (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.  So operator theory is, you can think of functions as being operators and there are certain properties of these functions--boundedness is a property meaning that the function doesn't go off into infinity.  And so Fredholm operators had some special type of properties and I was trying to look at how you can take an operator and you can think of it as a matrix.  That would be an example of an operator, a matrix.  How you could take it and perturb it just a little bit and changes, how much did the properties change if you just perturb the matrix just a little bit?  So if you perturb the operator a little bit, how much does its properties change?  So that was the kind of question I was investigating.  When you change something just a little bit then how much do the things related to it change?
Speaker 1: Hmm, okay.  I guess that will do for me.  That's--okay.
Speaker 2: It's called, the area is called functional analysis and operator theory is one little piece inside of this area of functional analysis.  And functional analysis brings linear algebra and calculus together.
Story_ID: 24010
Speaker 1: Now at this juncture in your life, I can ask this question, had you begun to or had you met like the community of black mathematicians in the country or part of that community?
Speaker 2: There's an organization called the National Association of Mathematicians which is a black organization of mathematicians and one of the people who was very active in that organization, Dr. Johnny Houston was in the math department over at Clark-Atlanta [University].  I guess that would at Atlanta University [Georgia] at that time.  And so he tried to keep, maintain a community of black mathematicians.  And in fact at one point he had me organizing lunches or gatherings for them and then the organization itself would have regional meetings.  We had one at Savannah State [University].  So in this way the black mathematicians locally you know kind of were organized and participated together.  At the time that I graduated in 1980 that I had gotten my Ph.D., I didn't realize how small the community was.  I didn't realize how few black women had Ph.D.s.  Someone, a lady came out with an article that year on black women in mathematics. Her name is Patricia [Clark] Kenschaft and it was published in a math monthly.  And she listed all of them and so I must have been around No. 22, you know of black women who have earned their Ph.D. in mathematics in the U.S., and I was surprised.  I didn't know that.  And then afterwards we had a conference, the math honor society at Spelman [College] I was advising them and we decided to invite as many of them as we could to these women to come to Spelman for a conference.  And so then I began to learn more and more about the black math community and I started to go to national meetings and--that that organization has.  So every year in January the National Association of Mathematicians meets at the same time as the other math professional organizations meet and then they have other meetings in between at different places.  So I became involved then in the black math community.
Story_ID: 24011
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know there are some other math, there are some other women mathematicians that kind of fall under the radar cause they're not Ph.D.s.  One--did you know, ever meet Katherine Johnson who worked--she's from Hampton, Virginia.
Speaker 2: What's the first name?
Speaker 1: Katherine?
Speaker 2: Katherine Johnson?  I didn't.  I didn't know her, from Hampton [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was plotting the trajectory of space flights with John Glenn and other people she was--yeah.  But you know we interviewed her last year, last Spring.
Speaker 2: Had a what?
Speaker 1: We interviewed her last spring.  She's in her--
Speaker 2: Oh you interviewed her, okay.
Speaker 1: --in her nineties.  But the, you know I suppose there are people that don't get Ph.D.s don't get into you know, through other--
Speaker 2: And it's--
Speaker 1: --who have other functions you know.
Speaker 2: That's true.  It's even hard to find those who do get Ph.D.s and it's harder to find those that don't.
Speaker 1: Now have you ever heard--now she was what they called a human calculator for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] before the--then they called it the jet propulsion for JPL I guess.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Very much like Evelyn Granbill.  You know Evelyn Boyd Granbill?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she did get a Ph.D., she was about the second, third--second black woman to get a Ph.D. but she was also in the NASA community doing calculations.  And there were probably others that we just don't know about.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was describing it as a pool of women you know that were used as human calculators by the space program in the early days you know before computers were reliable.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And she kind of emerged as one of the top you know calculators in the pool.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So this is a lot of, it's more you know probably here than we realize though.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Oh yes.
Story_ID: 24012
Speaker 1: Okay.  So after you got your Ph.D., was it hard to find a position?
Speaker 2: Well no, because I had been at Spelman [College] two years and they gave me a leave to go back and get the Ph.D.  So I was away three years and then I came right back to my position.
Speaker 1: You just came back with more weight than before?
Speaker 2: Right with more expectations, more responsibilities, right.  So--and so it was very convenient since Robert was across the street at Morehouse [College] this was a convenient arrangement.  So it defied what I was advised to do back when I you know was at Vanderbilt [University], not to get a Ph.D. because it would be too hard for both of us to get a job.  So you know with these two schools right across the street we didn't have to work in the same department which you know there used to be a lot of rules about nepotism and so we didn't have to worry about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's been really like a math teaching heaven in some ways because of the, you know cause you're able to work at almost in the same institution but not quite?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Exactly, it was the perfect arrangement for us.
Speaker 1: Now did you share, ever share students?
Speaker 2: In the sense that, yes in the sense that we have taught the same students.  Is that what you mean?  Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Because a lot of students here, a lot of our math students, especially those that were engineering, math and engineering majors have taken their differential equation course at Morehouse and Robert taught differential equations for years at Morehouse.  And so a lot of times we see Spelman women who would tell him that, oh you taught me differential equations.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then occasionally, a couple of times he taught over here a part time class and so, and we taught--you know he taught a student in one class that I've taught in another class.
Speaker 1: Yes, I know that there are students go back, they can take courses on both campuses.
Speaker 2: Right they can take courses.
Speaker 1: Depending on what it is.
Speaker 2: And then we knew some of the same students also because we have one chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon National Honor, Math Honor Society, one chapter between Morehouse, Spelman, Clark-Atlanta [University] and Morris Brown [College].  And so we had worked with the students through there also.
Story_ID: 24013
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I have this on the outline in 1977, is this when you founded the Center for Scientific Application of Mathematics?
Speaker 2: No, that happened in 1993 so I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I think I got it in the wrong place.
Speaker 2: '77 [1977], I'm trying to see what--
Speaker 1: Well lets not worry about that now and--
Speaker 2: Okay.  I don't know what happened in '77 [1977].  I was trying to remember what that would have been.
Speaker 1: But I know that after, it sys here--
Speaker 2: I probably went back to graduate school in '77 [1977], I guess.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you had been working on your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, I went back in '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay, but in '82 [1982], this is two years after your Ph.D., you became the chair of the math department here.
Speaker 2: Right, like I said more responsibilities, right?  So it's unusual to, I thought it was unusual for somebody to be, have two, be two years out of graduate school and then become chair of the math department but that's what happened.
Speaker 1: Well in a time when you know technology and the science and technology are leaping forward, what--did you have--I mean what were your priorities as chairman of the math department at Spelman [College] in '82 [1982]?
Speaker 2: In--so I guess it was 1980 when I was finishing up.  I think that--I guess I have my dates right.  I had a student named Daphne Smith and she went, left Spelman and went to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, private research university] in math and she got a Ph.D. in math and probability.  And it was a realization, it was--she was the first student out of this department, math department to get a Ph.D. in math.  And I think it made us start to think more about our--the need for more of our students to go on to get Ph.D.s in math and it was a realization all across the sciences here, that not just math but in all of the sciences, we needed to put more emphasis on having students to go on to graduate school and to get Ph.D.s.  And so we started an all out effort to do that and that was one of my priorities during the time I was chair to get more of our students into graduate school and more of them to earn Ph.D.s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now was the department in pretty good shape when you inherited the chair, chairmanship?
Speaker 2: In terms of good shape you mean in terms of the number of faculty and number of students or--?
Speaker 1: I guess in terms of the--you had just come out of a Ph.D. program.  Were they up to, you know was it up to speed the way you would like it to be when you came out?
Speaker 2: In terms of the curriculum?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I think, we had a pretty strong curriculum because see when I was taking over as chair I was taking over from Dr. Etta Faulkner who had been chair and she was top notch.
Speaker 1: Right, now I've heard of her before.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So she--
Speaker 1: Tell us something about her.  Now what's her background and--
Speaker 2: She, I can't remember what year she came to Spelman, maybe it's '69 [1969] but she finished her Ph.D. at Emory [University] and she was, came here and became chair of the math department and Dr. Shirley McBay was also here, another black woman mathematician and Shirley became associate dean or something like that.  She was you know, one step up.  No, and chair of the science division.  That's what Shirley was and the dean.  And so the two of them had already, when I came they had already started looking at the fact that only 10 percent of our students were in math and science at Spelman and they thought that there needed to be more, that we needed to really put more effort into getting women into science.  So--and some of what I'm about to say I'm thinking, I'm taking from an article that Dr. Faulkner wrote about the history of the sciences at Spelman and she talks there about how the science building was dark and dreary and there was no talk about women being in science and math on campus, nothing appeared in our literature about it.  And they talked the president into starting a new era to try to change that.  And they started a summer science program to try to bring, get these women who were coming into the school into the sciences at the very beginning and they did all kinds of things to try to improve the sciences and they did.  And so they got the whole faculty on board so whatever we did it was not in the math department it was all across the sciences.  We worked together to try to increase the number of students that were going on to, that were coming into the sciences in the first place and graduating with a BS and then by the time I came along as chair in the 80s [1980s], it was now okay, how many of these students can we get to go on to graduate school and to get Ph.D.s in math and science?
Story_ID: 24014
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell us now so the entire math and science departments were moving forward together here at Spelman [College] trying to increase the student enrollment through various means, that's what you're--?
Speaker 2: Yes, trying to--the departments all across the sciences and actually when they started this process in the late 70s [1970s], there was just a biology department and a math department and then maybe around '77 [1977] they added the chemistry department.  And then Dr. Faulkner with her visionary leadership, we added physics and then computer science and in order to really--we didn't have a computer science faculty member qualified and this was in the period when no one had, you know very few people had computer science faculty.  So she actually had the Ph.D. in math and went back and got a masters in computer science so that there would be a bona fide computer science person here.  And then, so we started the computer science department and I think you probably are aware of Andrea Lawrence who is, who became chair of that department and was chair for so long and helped to build that department up.  Andrea was hired in the math department originally.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--and then we finally added environmental sciences so I think that's the full complement.  But, so the whole sciences really built up and got to the place where about a third of the students in the school were in the sciences, sciences, math and engineering.  There was an engineering program, it's a center wide partnership that was created to--in order for all the students in the school to have engineering together at Spelman, Morehouse [College], Clark-Atlanta [University], Morris Brown [College].  So we had one engineering program and--
Speaker 1: And there's a relationship formed with Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology] too right, for graduate school?
Speaker 2: Right.  No it's for undergraduate.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: It's for the engineering degree so we had to have an engineering school that would offer the engineering degree and Georgia Tech was the primary partner at the, I think at the beginning.  And so students could then go three years here and then go two years at Georgia Tech and they would get an engineering, Bachelors of Engineering from Georgia Tech and they would get a Bachelors of Science at Spelman an inter-discipline usually.  And then, so then we you know added more partnerships so now there are about fifteen schools that the students can go to for that engineering degree so that has happened over the years.  But a lot of this came out of the early efforts led by Dr. Faulkner, Dr. Shirley McBay and other faculty members who were around at that time.  And so when I came into the math department there must have been about six faculty members in math, I think I, if I remember correctly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was it a--was it hard to convince the university to do more or to concentrate more on math and science?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I think we had a president that, Edward Manly, that was, that could see you know the need and you know but I'm speaking second handed from Dr. Faulkner's notes, her writings about it because that was in '72 [1972] maybe.  I came in '74 [1974].
Story_ID: 24015
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now it says here in '84 [1984], you were the, on the Board of Directors of NAM [National Association of Mathematicians], right and you were vice president for, I think in '84 [1984] as well, '84 [1984] to '88 [1988].
Speaker 2: So that was--right.  So that was when I really got involved with the black community of mathematicians and was elected to that office.
Speaker 1: National Association of Mathematicians.
Speaker 2: Right.  That's the, predominantly--you know it focuses on minority students.  That's what it does.  It does not, it's not all minority faculty it's just that it's faculty that a lot of them teach at historically black colleges or they're interested in the development of minority students.
Speaker 1: Okay, now '88 [1988] it says you were, you received the UNCF [United Negro College Fund] award for excellence in teaching, right?  That's the-
Speaker 2: Let me think about what award you're thinking--you're--
Speaker 1: It's a Tenneco UNCF.
Speaker 2: Okay, yes.  Okay, so that's an award I think that, I'm not sure how or why but yes.  So I guess I was considered a good teacher.  But you know it's an award that I think was given to a Spelman faculty member by UNCF and so it was you know local.
Speaker 1: Okay, so in '89 [1989] you were on the Board of Governors of the Mathematical Association of America, right?
Speaker 2: I guess I was at that point, '89 [1989] you know I'm having trouble with time, sequencing.  I think I was representing minority institutions so I was like a general board member you know not elected.  Well elected but not elected from a region.  But they have some like at large members.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and I was representing minority mathematicians.  So I've been active in the Math Association of America for a long time and lots of you know committees and so forth.  So they started a committee on minority participate in math and I was active in that so you know I became more visible.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And there's a whole group, there's a whole list of organizations.  The Georgia Coalition for Excellence in Math Education, the National, is this the National Physical Society, just the physics, the physicists or--?
Speaker 2: Physical Sciences, NPSC.
Speaker 1: Yeah, National Physical Sciences--
Speaker 2: National Physical Science Consortium.
Speaker 1: --Consortium, right.
Speaker 2: That is an organization that provides graduate fellowships to women and minorities and so I was affiliated with them in the regard that I was on the selection committee to help select the students who would get the fellowships.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And it's still in existence and it's a good organization that you know if they can't give the students a fellowship, if they run out of money then they will recommend them to some other organization.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.  It says here in '92 [1992] you were on the Math Science and Education Board of the National Research Council?
Speaker 2: Right.  You have a good list, things that I can barely remember.  Okay, right.  So that's at the National Research Council, I was on that board for a while.  I went to meetings and I'm trying to remember.  You know each period of time is marked by some publication that came out from the National Research Council, all about moving math forward.  And you know like no child left behind, well you know what period that is, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I'm trying to remember what the document was for that period, can't call it right now.
Story_ID: 24016
Speaker 1: Now when did you become a full professor of mathematics?  I guess you--well if you were chair of the department does that mean you're a full professor (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, I was an assistant professor and then I became an associate professor at some point and I'll have to look at my vitae to see what the year was.  And then I had to on down the line, apply to become a full professor.  And so you know it's just, it's a, just a process that after six years at one rank you can apply for the next rank and then you're evaluated by the faculty tenure and promotion committee.  And they determine if they think that you, you know have the qualities to be called--go to the next rank so promote, to get that promotion.  So I have just, I've gone up the line and now in the last, was it the last six years I chaired the committee to tenure and promotion to evaluate people for a promotion to full professor.  In fact I've done it twice now.  So I did six years and then before that I did five years but I ended that term a year ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you joined a Board of Trustees in '93 [1993] of Spelman College?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, so I served two terms as a faculty trustee.  We have a position where they elect one faculty member to be a trustee on the board.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So '93 [1993] is the year that you founded the Center for the Scientific Application of Mathematics right (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right, so and I think it's in '92 [1992] the Kellogg Foundation decided that it wanted to give--it had been giving money to lots of different institutions and communities and it decided that it wanted to give $30 million to black colleges.  And so they asked, they decided to give $3 million to ten schools and they asked for proposals, say what could you do to make a giant leap forward if we gave you $3 million?  And each school put forth a proposal with Spelman under the leadership of Dr. Faulkner, put forth a proposal to, that--to impact math and science, what we could do to really improve our math and science areas.  And I was asked to chair that, to be the principal investigator for that project and so I worked with her some on the--and she always brought together a group of faculty to sort out the ideas to go into a proposal and so I worked with her on developing the plan but also then it was my responsibility to implement the plan once we--and to oversee that project you know using that $3 million.  It was supposed to have been $3 million over three years but that was some hard money to spend.  It went about five years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But what we did there was to really try to improve faculty.  We had created what we call faculty fellows and so we would give six faculty members a year a little release time to take time to work on their research, to mentor two students in research and to look at how they could work together, those six faculty members.  They were from different science areas, and how the curriculum might be improved and how their own research could be improved if we had provided them with funding for equipment you know to really step up their research areas.  And so that was my job to work with them in doing that and getting the equipment and you know improving their research.  And I directly worked with all of the students to try to move them toward graduate school really.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's what the Center for Applied--?
Speaker 2: That's what the center did, and it was across the sciences.  It said scientific application of mathematics but it was across all the sciences and math.
Story_ID: 24017
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I thought at--when I saw the name I thought about some of the people we've been interviewing this year that were talking about how various disciplines are using mathematical computation a lot more than actual experiments.  I think they model a lot of things now in chemistry and of course physics has always been like that, theoretical physicists you have theoretical chemists now doing the same thing.  And there's a computational biology going on.
Speaker 2: Right.  And so you know that, so that center was a little bit at the beginning of, was more at the beginning of this whole issue of computational biology and yes.  So it was a little earlier than we, I mean more and more we see that all the sciences are becoming very computational.  But--and I guess Dr. Faulkner could see that at that point.  I'm not sure I could see it at that point but it certainly has happened now.
Speaker 1: So you see her as kind of like the leader on the campus in terms of the math and science--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She became--so as I said when I came she was the chair of the math department.  She moved up and became chair of the division then I became chair of the math department and then she moved up and became like associate provost for science.  And so she was kind of a leader, we saw her as our leader in the sciences and mathematics areas.  She wrote a lot of the proposals or she designated them out you know and passed them out for other people to write or she coordinated things so that we could get more outside funding by working together because we were a small school, our departments are small.  But by coming together and working together we could actually apply for larger funding, pots of money from different agencies and so she kind of coordinated that.  And it worked well because after the Center for Scientific Applications of Mathematics, the next was the, was funding from NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].  We were designated as a model institution of excellence in science and then we were able to get that funding to kind of pick up where the Center left off.  And it just enhanced even more the infrastructure, strengthened the infrastructure by adding the new programs and new departments, by adding new faculty, putting in place more opportunities for students to do research on campus, more support staff for students, for--and changes in the curriculum so it was just a growing thing and more opportunities for student scholarship and aid.  You know but it was all for students in the sciences and mathematics department so it really strengthened this whole you know corner.  And out of that you know came the need for a new building and that's how we got here.  This, what you're sitting in is a renovation of Tapley Hall which had been here since about 1925 and then they added on the piece over there, the laboratory component, wing.
Story_ID: 24018
Speaker 1: Now you became what they call the project shepherd of this, the development of this new science center here at Spelman [College], right?
Speaker 2: I did and that's a designation under a national organization called Project Kaleidoscope is--focuses on quality science and math instruction.  And one program inside of Project Kaleidoscope is infrastructure, science infrastructure, trying to help schools design and redesign their science facilities in such a way that they support modern ways of teaching.  So I went to Project Kaleidoscope workshops for training and I became the shepherd which meant that I was a liaison between the faculty and students and the architects and the administration.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This--and around the same time or maybe just a little bit before you became the shepherd, you were the Governor of the Southeastern Section of the mathematical Association of America, right?
Speaker 2: So that's a position that's similar to--okay, so the Southeastern Association, Southeastern Section of the Math Association of America covers about five states and there is a chair of the section but the governor is the person that interacts with the national organization and sits on the national board on behalf of the Southeastern Section.  And so that's when I became, went back to the Board of Governors and what were those years?
Speaker 1: That's 1997, I guess until--I don't know when it ended here.
Speaker 2: Okay.  It's about a three year term I think.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah so that's when I went back and was on the Board of Governors of the MAA [Math Association of America].
Speaker 1: Now this--so you represent the whole southeast of the United States?
Speaker 2: Right, and that was an elected position so I was elected from the whole side.  So it was the first time a black person had been elected from a section to go to the Board of Governors.
Speaker 1: So lets put this in perspective here.  I have to call the name, the University of Alabama, University of Florida, University of Mississippi, all these, representatives from all these schools--
Speaker 2: Okay, well--
Speaker 1: --University of South Carolina, is this everybody here?
Speaker 2: Okay, so it doesn't, it only covers about five states so it covers Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina and Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay, so no Mississippi?
Speaker 2: So it doesn't use Florida and Mississippi is in a different, right section.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So just Tennessee--
Speaker 1: So we're still talking about you know states that Dr. King said their governor's lips were dripping with the words of interposition and nullification.  And now you're looked at as their governor for the math and--to the Mathematical Association of America which is--
Speaker 2: Well that's true. I hadn't, you know I hadn't--sometimes I don't think of things in the same way.
Speaker 1: Well it's interesting you know--
Speaker 2: Well it's very interesting because this is the same section that many years ago and I'm trying to think of what year, a group of faculty and students from Fisk University so that's in the section, tried to attend the section meeting in Nashville [Tennessee] and they were, they could go to the meeting but they were not allowed to attend the banquet.  And they you know wrote a letter to the Association you know condemning that act and so there's a lot of history around that.  And so there was very little black participation in the section in those, in the early days.
Speaker 1: We heard a similar story from Dr. Frederick at Tuskegee [University] Saturday when--he's ninety, he's about ninety years old.  He went to such a meeting as a student and was, he couldn't go to the banquet or the, they didn't let him in you know they (unclear).
Speaker 2: And couldn't stay in the hotel--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --where they were having it, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Had to stay with local families.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So there's some progress I guess in the--?
Speaker 2: Right, a lot of progress in this section.  And you know I don't have my little history with me.  I could tell you about the dates, but yes.  The person who was the leader of that protest in Nashville [Tennessee] was Dr. Lee Lorch.  He is a civil rights activist from his heart and a mathematician and he was chair of the math department at Fisk.  He's white.  He was chair of the math department at Fisk [University] during the time that Dr. Faulkner was a student at Fisk so he was her chair and he is, he was a--he is still alive too.  He's, he was taught at Philander Smith and he's taught at a few other colleges in the U.S. before he was run out of the U.S. into Canada.  And he retired from York University in Canada and that's where he lives now.  But he was a civil rights activist and so was his wife.  But he often has come here and spend a week or two with Dr. Faulkner and you know and our department giving talks and working with students and he has been a significant person I think to help you know with just in the math community and in the black math community as well.
Story_ID: 24019
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you also, the same year that this building [Tapley Hall] was opened, the science center--well before I even ask you about the Edge Program, let me ask you about the opening of the building.  That had to be a great event, you know just to--?
Speaker 2: It was a great event.  It was a great event.  Just trying to move into this build was an event.  We had a trailer on the other end of campus with faculty in it and the science and math faculty.  We had a research building that, that's right outside the campus where we had faculty there with, in the research laboratories.  Our faculty that does laser research was over there and so we had people spread all around and the idea was to bring them all together into this building.  And so we moved into that side over there and then they were still renovation this old Tapley here.  But we had a great celebration and the president--and so my job at that time, I'm trying to see was I associate provost.  You know for a while I was associate provost for science and math for about four years and trying to see did that overlap with me being project shepherd.  But anyway, it was my responsibility to get everybody moved into this building.  Well you can't imagine how many chemicals, how, what, how much old stuff was in this building that's been here since 1925.  And so the first thing was to discard and safely get rid of all the old stuff.  So there was a young woman who now is over this building, her name is Cherise McKenzie and she was such a wonderful leader in that effort.  But the president told me she said now I want you to just move everybody into that building.  I don't care how you do it, just make it smooth.  So we you know we formed a team.  Cherise McKenzie and a couple of the other lab assistants and myself and we organized the effort and spent a year trying to get everybody to discard you know and get ready to move in so it was quite a project, quite a project.
Story_ID: 24020
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm going to ask you about the EDGE [Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education] Program.  Now what is the EDGE Program?  That was established in 1998 too that same year that--
Speaker 2: Okay, so I spent about four years from 1993 to let's see 7 [1997] with, working with a summer program for the younger, for younger college students who were women trying to get them to prepare to think about going on to graduate school in math by doing summer research.  I was in partnership with a colleague at Bryn Mawr College, Rhonda Hughes and so for four years we had students just in the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] area and in the Atlanta [Georgia] area, eight students each summer.  And one day we looked at the students that we had and then we always talked about the students that we had sent on to graduate school and how many--the women were dropping out for seemingly non-academic reasons.  They just--different things would happen and the women weren't getting through graduate school.  And we said, we decided that there were lots of programs like the ones that we had, summer programs for students in college who wanted to do research.  But nobody was paying attention to the students who went on to graduate school.  And so we decided that that's what we should re-focus on.  We should re-focus our attention on the students going to, women who were in graduate school and see how they could, what was wrong, why were they dropping out, what could be done to prevent that and how could we get them through with a Ph.D.  So we established a program called Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education [EDGE] to try to mentor women through graduate school so that--and to slow the dropout rate.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And we worked on that for like thirteen years.
Speaker 1: And why did it stop?
Speaker 2: It hadn't stopped.  We got to the point of being ready to retire you know and ready to think about retirement and we found two other women that over the years had worked with us, younger women and we tried to make a smooth transition, turned it over to them and it's continuing to go.
Speaker 1: So it's operating now under new leadership?
Speaker 2: It's still operating.  It's still operating under new leadership.  So Rhonda and I turned it over to--we recruited Urica Wilson [phonetic] who is one of my old students from graduate--from Spelman, Urica Wilson and Amy Retinskya [phonetic] who is a faculty member at Pomona College, California.  So those two are continuing the program but during the time we had it oh, maybe 160 young women went through all going on to get a--to graduate school.  Many of them have gotten Ph.D.s so now we--you know it takes about five or six years for them to just get started coming out but at this point we're over forty Ph.D.s have come out of that program.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's something how--
Speaker 2: And probably a third of them are African American or Hispanic.
Speaker 1: Now this may be a reason that the American Association for the Advancement of Science awarded you with a mentor award in 2008.
Speaker 2: Probably--a part of it was the EDGE Program and then a part, probably just Spelman [College] students.  We get a, we have a pretty good record of getting Spelman students out with Ph.D.s and out of the math department.  But probably what would have come to the AAAS' [American Association for the Advancement of Science] attention is the EDGE Program because the--before they gave me that award the American Mathematical Society gave an award to the program and named it programs that, One of the Programs That Make a Difference.  And they give out, they give two, they designate two programs each year.  They give that designation to two programs in the country each year and they, one year they picked ours.
Story_ID: 24021
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in 2009 you were invited to Washington, D.C. to Capital Hill, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was invited by the Math Association of America [MAA].  They decided that they wanted to make a pitch on Capitol Hill for math and to try to promote math at the college level. And there were three of us who went to be a part of that congressional caucus.  I think that's what they called it.  And so the president of the MAA [Math Association of America] who is David Pursue and myself and Carlos, what's Carlos--Carlos Castile--I can't call his name, Carlos from University of--no, Arizona State University.  So yeah that was an interesting thing to, interesting experience.  I didn't know what to expect and--but we went there and there was one congressman who, a congressman from Texas who was I think head of the caucus that invited us and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the Congressional Diversity and Innovation Caucus I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: This is Congressman Hinojosa.
Speaker 2: Hinojosa, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Congressman Hinojosa.
Speaker 1: Reuben Hinojosa.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and so he was there but most of the other people were I guess congressional staffers and my understanding is they're the ones who write the bills and the policies.  You know so--and then there were a few visitors who came because they knew we were coming and--but it was interesting.  So we just tried to make the case that there was a, there's a role that the government needs to play in trying to promote mathematics at the undergraduate level.
Story_ID: 24022
Speaker 1: Okay.  And has the government's support of STEM initiatives been what you had imagined it could--or that you--I mean has it been you know adequate do you think?
Speaker 2: It certainly has not been adequate at historically black colleges and the thing is that it's the historically black colleges that turn out the largest majority, the greatest majority of the math and science professionals and the degrees and of the people who go on to earn Ph.D.s.  And I don't know if you know, if you look at the NSF [National Science Foundation] statistics and look at the people, the African Americans who get Ph.D.s in math and science and look at the undergraduate, the baccalaureate institution or origin, then you'll see that Howard [University] is number one, well you might expect that and you see Spelman is number two.  And then if you look at the Top fifteen, eleven of them are historically black colleges or either minority serving institutions.  So--
Speaker 1: Do you think--well what's the reason for that do you think?
Speaker 2: You know I'm not quite sure but I think you know we don't have a history of going into math and science, right.  You talked about well when you go to a black college there's this expectation that if you say that that's what you want to do, you can do it.  But I'm not sure that you have the same expectation and support when you don't go to a black college.  And so many students who go to other colleges, and planning to go into math and science don't finish in those areas.  They end up drifting over to some other area.
Story_ID: 24023
Speaker 1: That's true.  Now in 2010, you were, became part of--or featured on a website, Mathematicians of the African Diaspora.  You know I've seen the physicists and now this one too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a mathematician named Scott Williams of that, one of the SUNY [State University of New York] campuses so what is it, Buffalo.  And he started this website called Mathematicians of the African Diaspora, MAD, and he has tried to put as many mathematicians on there as possible and you know so he just keeps adding.  And he's now trying to turn that over to someone else.  He's at retirement age too but it's been a great resource for the whole math community really to be able to find people who--and find out who are the black mathematicians.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's a--it's inspirational for a lot of us who didn't realize we had so many mathematicians and physicists and you know just--yeah I didn't realize there were so many though.  There's still a dearth of them compared to what we ought to have.  So--
Speaker 2: That's true.  That's true.  And the rate at which they're coming out hasn't increased as much as it should.  That's the other disappointing thing you know just still it's only in the last few years that we've seen the number of mathematicians go above ten you know above single digits in a given year, the number of mathematicians that--people that get Ph.D.s in math.  And so the rates should be increasing and that's not happening and which is you know the reason that we--that the EDGE Program is there to--it's a--the Edge Program is about 50 percent African American and Hispanic.  And--but it has still, it has increased.  I think it has helped to increase the number that actually get through.
Story_ID: 24024
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what are your--now you just turned the EDGE [Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education] Program over to younger people.  Are you thinking about retirement soon or was it--?
Speaker 2: I think I probably should.  Yes, I am at some point in the near, you know not too distant future.  My husband retired two years ago so I'm thinking about it in the not too distant future.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now do you have a big project you're working on now or something that you want to see done before you retire?
Speaker 2: I have one project and that is I'm trying to--you know so the EDGE, I'm trying to see what did we learn from running the EDGE Program?  The EDGE Program was a mentoring program to get women through graduate school but it was also a research program to figure out what is it that helps women to get to graduate school and what is it that hinders them?  What is it that they bring to the situation and what is it that the institutions that they go to are doing or not doing to--that helps them to finish or not finish.  And so we're trying--I'm trying to, and I have Helen and I should say we are trying to see what can we understand from the, all these women that have gone through the Edge Program and what can we learn from those, from them about what it takes and you know what helps and what hinders.  And so I'd like to try to organize that information, put it on paper and you know for other people to consider and maybe it can help to make some changes that will help more women to be able to get through and more people from the minority community to get through you know graduate school and you know without this big drop out.  And so if it maybe can be, maybe--you know if I can leave that information in the public domain as a resource, then that's what I'd like to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I'm working on that.  I've done a survey of the students who have finished, those forty something students that I was telling you about and trying to--so I'm down to the point of trying to compile that data.
Story_ID: 24025
Speaker 1: Okay.  We always ask this question, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well I hope that we can refocus our attention on student development in mathematics but just generally.  Have to figure out how to improve the schools, how to improve what students have available to them but also how to improve what we do to help teachers be good teachers.  For Spelman [College] I would like to see us focus more on how we prepare students who are going to be elementary school teachers so that they give a better mathematical foundation to their students at the elementary level and at the middle school level you know because I think that's the beginning.  Elementary School teachers are not required, are not asked to do much in the way of mathematical preparation and so it's, and their mathematical preparation and their attitude towards mathematics has a great impact on the students that they teach and I think that there's a lot that can be done there.  And I would like to see us at Spelman and at other places as well, I mean nationally I'm not--I don't know what--I know you know what goes on at different little spots but on a national level I'm not sure how much is being done, what is being done.  But I know that we could do more at Spelman.
Story_ID: 24026
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Bob Moses who is a SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] organizer in Mississippi in 1964 you know who is one of the real heroes of that movement, he organized something called the Algebra Project.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, I'm familiar with it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what is your opinion of that and what--?
Speaker 2: Of the Algebra Project?  I think it's a good project and it's effective where it is and the places where--but I don't think it has taken national hold.  You know I don't think it's you know grown, has been adopted broadly enough to make it have some kind of national impact.  That's my understanding of it so far.  But where he has taken it, it's been great.  But--and I think in addition, so we need some local projects and we need some national efforts.  But yes Bob Moses has, he's a hero of mine too and I've met with his board on the Algebra Project once or twice too.  But--and I--and his daughter was a Spelman student and she graduated here in the math department.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was a math major in college I think.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so they have the young people's project too and you know--but, so his ideas have spread and it's been great.  One of our Spelman [College] graduates did some work related to his project in--for her Ph.D. dissertation at University of Georgia.  So I know that his ideas are spreading but I'm not sure how far and how much of an impact they've been able to make in a broad scale.
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people we've interviewed around math and physics have basically said that if certain principles are learned in the right sequence, anybody can be a mathematician even those who--it's the missing chunks that they don't get when they--
Speaker 2: When they're young.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And that's why I say that if we--we could do a lot by preparing elementary school teachers well in mathematics.  But now, right now the math requirement is very low and sometimes I think people go into elementary education because they don't want to do math and science you know.  But there's a certain amount of mathematical training that you just, you know exposure that would help to give the right attitude to young children.  And so I would like to see us do something along those lines.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you're right it would help to have a teacher that's excited about mathematics as you know, in the classroom.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, at least neutral if not excited.
Speaker 1: That's true.
Story_ID: 24027
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point is there, and I'm going to ask this crazy question, is there anything that you would want to change or do over again if you could?
Speaker 2: I can't think of a thing.  You know I think I had the best job, the best career I could possibly have, I could have had.  I have enjoyed working these years at Spelman College.  I had great colleagues and great students.  It's been wonderful.  I thank God for leading me you know to this place and I've been pleased with what I've been able to do here and I always said if I had not become a mathematician I would like to be an electrical engineer.  That was my second choice after mathematics because I like what I see there.  I did a little work in image processing and I like that.  That's just fascinating work and electrical engineers and mathematicians I guess do that.  But I don't have any regrets and I'm just happy about that.  And you know one thing about working here is I've had--it's good to work at a place where you don't have to watch your back.  You don't have to look over your shoulder and so I had, I've just been fortunate to move through places that I don't have to watch my back.  And you know you talked about you asked me about my Ph.D. supervisor, Luis Kramarz, you asked me what his name is, Luis Kramarz, L-U-I-S K-R-A-M-A-R-Z.  And he was--I--going to Emory and having him as a dissertation advisor was a wonderful experience as well.  He was about my age at the time I went there.  I went there after having two children so I had a young family, he had a young family and we were just a good team to work together where we could just both focus on the mathematics.  And I came here to Spelman and I've had just good people to work with and I just never felt like I had to watch my back.  And so that's the--that's one thing.  The other thing is I've moved, as you see I've moved through different positions and different roles here and I have had a wonderful team of people who have been watching out for me.  I guess they've been watching my back you know.  And so I've had good people to you know work with along the way and they've had my back all the way.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fortunate because it's so many times in college environments some of the other schools there's a lot of politics you know.  But you--
Speaker 2: It's the department I work in and the people that I work around and you know I work with mostly people in the sciences.  But I have great relationships with people all across campus and I've just been fortunate I think and everything.  And so--and I've been blessed.  I've been blessed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used to, when I was in graduate school I had these in each, in the front of each one of my notebooks I had written: "Lord help me to remember that nothing is going to happen to me today that you and I together can't handle."  And that has been--you asked me about a motto, so that's been it.
Story_ID: 24028
Speaker 1: All right.  Now we always ask this question too, when you look back over everything you've done to this point, what today would you say of your accomplishments is your legacy?
Speaker 2: You know I guess as a teacher you have to learn how to be happy with delayed gratification.  When you're teaching students nobody appreciates what you're trying, you know what you--the students don't appreciate what you're trying to do for them or with them or you know they just see it as difficult.  And so years later they come back and they tell you, I really appreciate what you did.  And so the students that I've had all over the years, that's my legacy it's just the students down through the years.  But other people will probably say that the EDGE [Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education] Program has been a part of, big part of my legacy, just that, the end of that because there I touched students all across the country.  You know it's not a Spelman, it's not the Spelman [College] students, it was a national, it's a national program and so students come from all schools, all colleges and universities and so I've been able to reach out beyond Spelman through that program.  So I guess those two things would be you know that would be my legacy.
Story_ID: 24029
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us about your family.  Now you've had a mate that actually is in the same field you know in the same vicinity and all this time.  Has it been--most people don't have that kind of a experience.
Speaker 2: Oh that I've stayed in the same field?
Speaker 1: Yeah, your husband's in the same field and he's right you know--
Speaker 2: Well you know and my husband and I have enjoyed being in the same field.  People ask us do you talk about math at the table?  Well yes we do.  We want to.  We also help each other out you know.  If I'm teaching a course that he hasn't taught in a while then he'll help me to--with the ideas, the notes, the thoughts about how to sequence the course.  And if he's teaching something that you know he hasn't taught in a while that I have you know we talk about that.  We talk about our students so it's been great.  And staying in the same field you know, I don't feel like I have all these years.  I feel like I've moved around a lot.  I started off in my early years after I finished the Ph.D., I was doing research.  I was writing technical papers and publishing them in the journal.  And then as I moved from that I became a department chair and so I thought more about administration you know how to handle the curriculum, how to--and my, and the thing I hate most is hiring people, but how to manage personnel.  And Dr. Faulkner taught me a lot about how to manage people and how to manage programs.  And then I became, then I started with the center and so I had a period there for five years where I did very little teaching and I just worked with other faculty to help them, to mentor them really and help them to move their research forward and mentor students.  And then I became associate provost for science and mathematics and I spent four years working with the administration and then worked with this building, the building of this building.  And after--when my first grandson was born I gave up administration and decided to go back to the classroom so I'd have more control over my time so I could baby sit and so I went back to the classroom and I spent all these years with the Edge Program.  So I feel like I have been in lots of different areas.  I don't feel like I stayed with the same thing throughout, in all these years.  And I recommend that to other people.  And I tell, I try to tell team committees that evaluate faculty to think about faculty as being you know very productive in research and then as they become senior faculty they might go off in a different direction and be productive in something else.  You know they don't--we don't have to stay in the same area.  We shouldn't.  You know we probably won't.  And so I feel like I've had a varied career path even though I've been at Spelman most of the time.  And I think part of that is Spelman allows that.  It allows you to move around.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So it allows you to be a--to use all your resources to benefit the--?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, and your abilities and your interests, allows you to use those to move in different arenas.
Story_ID: 24030
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--well tell us about your children.  You have two children, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Thought you'd never get to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  I have two children so Kizzie Renata is married and is now Kizzie Brown.  She's in Baltimore [Maryland].  She is--was then--well they're both good students on up through high school and so forth but she went to Howard [University] and finished in business and then she went on Wall Street for two years and then went to Harvard [University] and got the MBA at Harvard [University].  So she's worked for maybe five or six years for a company and then she decided to go on her own and become a financial analyst you know consultant.  So she--one of her major clients is--and where she spends most of her time is with a small research, I mean sorry, real estate development corporate in Washington, D.C.  She's the chief financial officer for that small company.  And then otherwise she's a financial analyst.  And our son went to Florida A & M [University] and got a degree in chemical engineering.  And after working in engineering for a year or two, and maybe he always knew this that he didn't, that was not what he really wanted to do.  He didn't want to stay there, he wanted to go to law school.  So he went to law school and then he passed the bar and he joined a large firm in Atlanta, stayed there for a while and joined a small firm and then he decided he wanted to open his own law practice.  And so now he is one of the two partners in Davis and Bozeman Law Firm.  So he's--and they're doing well.  They must have, they've grown from those two and a half employees to about fourteen so over the past five years I guess.  So he's--so now what kind of children are they?  He's very community minded.  In other words their law practice focuses on helping the black community.  And his--he's a partner that where they're of the same mind so we're really proud of him and proud of my daughter too.  She's active, involved--actively involved in community stuff as well, largely through Delta Sigma Theta which sorority--I'm also a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so you know she's an outgoing person, reads all the time.  I don't know how she gets through so many books.  But--and they both still very much involved in the church, in their own churches and I guess that's something that goes back to our grandparents, right, to my grandparents that we are just still very closely connected to the church and whatever relates to it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to ask discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Just my two grandchildren.  I have two grandchildren and they're eight and ten, Nia and Robert.  So Robert, II named after my husband.  So they're on their way.  We'll see, they both like math--
Story_ID: 24031
Speaker 1: Well the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Just remembered, you know.  Hope somebody remembers me.
Story_ID: 24032
Speaker 1: This is my daughter Kizzie Renaza Bozeman and she is, she's our oldest.
Speaker 2: About what year is this picture, was taken?
Speaker 1: I think that this may be a young adult picture somewhere between high school and young adult.  That is a picture of me in my high school, let me see high school or college?  That looks like a high school graduation picture, my high school graduation picture.  Okay, so that's our family going on vacation and going on a cruise.
Speaker 2: Can you name everybody from left to right?
Speaker 1: And that's, that is my husband Robert on the left, our young son--so my husband is Robert E. Bozeman, the son is Robert O. Bozeman and then myself Sylvia and then finally Kizzie, our daughter.  This is my son Robert on the left, my daughter Kizzie in the middle and on the right is Nicholas who is our foreign exchange student from Paris.  He spent a month with us as an exchange student.  This is a picture of me as a youngster so I'm probably 16.  My sis, my youngest sister and then that's our, my little brother.  So that's, on the left is Sheree and then Condolia at the bottom John Condolia and then myself Sylvia on the right.  This is a--skip it, let's skip it.  Let's skip it cause I don't know which graduation that is.  So this is my husband Robert and myself with our first baby and that's little Kizzie when she was probably a month or two old.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is about 1972 or so--?
Speaker 1: She was born in '71 [1971] in April and so that's 1971.  This is my son, our son Robert and that looks like a high school picture.  Professor Luis Kramarz on the left, my dissertation advisor and this is commencement when I was about to get the Ph.D.  I just, guess I just have it because I see I have on a hood so that's graduation 1980.  Skip it, that's just a picture of me.  That's--this is my husband Robert at his retirement.  He has on a vest that says Math at Morehouse and he was known for wearing those vests all the time and so they have given him a vest for his retirement and they put one on the wall in the building.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is Robert, my husband and myself on vacation in Hawaii celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary: my daughter Kizzie and myself as she went to work on Wall Street.  This is the wedding of our son Robert, my daughter in law Anica and so they're getting married at Friendship Baptist Church.  This is myself and Robert my husband.  We are dressed in white robes because we are about to be baptized in the River of Jordan is Israel and that was in February of 2011.  This is a Christmas get together of our family.  Every year we get the whole family together at Christmas if we can.  Well we do once, at least at Christmas and this is oh my goodness, maybe this is about 2007.  This is a celebration of my mother's 92nd birthday and so these are her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and then a few of her friends at the back.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: She is in the middle with--wearing blue sitting down because she's in a wheelchair.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a wedding and we are posing--this is Robert and myself in the middle posing with our goddaughter, Ponchita Reddrick [phonetic].  And so here we are at a theater.  This is my daughter and my kind of adopted daughter, Carol Leveret.  So she has been a part of our family since she was about second grade.  She is now you know 45 years old.  And this is commencement at Spellman College.  And I am there with the academic regalia on with one of my students Victoria Frost who was a star student.  Okay, let me think about what his name is, 1989.  Okay, so this is a picture of me with Paul Ersch [phonetic] and he is a famous mathematician.  He came to Spellman to speak at--for our Pi Mu Epsilon Mathematical Honor Society Induction, brought by Dr. Etta Faulkner.  And that's my daughter Kizzie as she is getting the masters--MBA at Harvard.  And that's the wedding again.  I missed--so that's our son and his wife posing after the wedding.  And I think I don't have a picture of her.  Do I, in her wedding?  Oh you know you can skip that if you want to.  That's just us.  We've gotten enough.
Speaker 2: Here's another one.
Speaker 1: Yep, yep that's--okay.  So this is Robert and myself ready to go on another vacation 2010 going on a cruise.  This is the occasion when I was made a fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences.  This is a family reunion, 1991.  This is a Trimble family reunion and on the left the gentleman with the walking stick at the--is my father.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) right here?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's my mother peeping out from behind him.  And the rest is all of his sisters and brothers and their children and grandchildren.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) family.
Speaker 1: So this is a picture of my first--my earliest mentor in college, Dr. Howard Foster is on the far left, I'm on the far right and this is a summer program that Dr. Foster started for high school students in the Huntsville area and these are the students that we had that summer.  He hired me to be the, you know the graduate student mentor.  I have played hand bales for about almost 30 years and this is my hand bale choir and you can see the--this is one from about 18, 18 to 20 years ago so this is one of the early ones.  And that--hold on.  Hold on--and that's the hand bale choir director Rosalind Lewis right in the center and I am the fourth person in from the left.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my great grandfather Israel Jones and his wife, my great grandmother, Sally Jones.  And so they are the parents of the 12 Tribes of Israel so we call them.  He--they had twelve children.  She's an Indian and he's black.  And he looks like an Indian too doesn't he, his little high cheek bones.  This is a picture of me at the high school prom.  And this is my son, our son Robert, oh and his wife Anica and the two grandchildren Robby and Nia when they were younger.  I should say Robert and Nia.   Now how are you going to do that?
Speaker 2: I don't know why don't we go clockwise, start here?
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Or are there specific ones you want?
Speaker 1: Yeah we could go generation wise.  We could go here, here, here first if you want to.
Speaker 2: That's fine.
Speaker 1: And that's just because--so this first picture is the son of Israel Jones.  So that's Casby Jones and his wife and then this is their daughter Robbie Trimble which is my mother and my father Horace and now then me and my family.  So that's the third generation.  Okay then let's see, yeah okay.  So this is my husband's family right here.  These are his--do you want to--so this is my husband's father and the three sons.  My husband Robert is on the right and then the other is my brother and his family.
