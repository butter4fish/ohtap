Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as kind of a warm-up, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I like food. (laughter). But I do, I have categories of food that I like. I do like southern cooking, southern cuisine. I like Creole cooking, and I also like Indian cooking.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Pink and green tend to be my favorite colors, so--(laughter).
Speaker 1: Alright. Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Uh huh. Not so much winter. Winter kind of makes me want to hibernate. But I like the spring and I like the fall.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I like the beach.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's one of the things I like to do, is just kind of turn into a beach bum for a morning or afternoon, and run down and get some sand in my suit (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: My favorite saying, probably, "I like giving forward." Not so much giving back, but giving forward.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25704
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please.
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Sarah Deloris Vaughan Bailey. S-A-R-A-H, D-E-L-O-R-I-S, V-A-U-G-H-A-N, B-A-I-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in what was called South Norfolk, which is now a part of Portsmouth. And she was born on May 16, 1932.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family? How far back can you trace them? Can you go back to the 19th century with them? And what were they doing?
Speaker 2: I can go back to the woman who raised her, was Novella Jones. And her birth mother's name was Alice. And Alice died fairly young, and was brought to Novella by her father. And from that point on, Novella was our grandmother. That's who we know as grandmother--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On my mother's side.
Speaker 1: So, your mother's mother was Alice--
Speaker 2: And we don't know all that. We don't have a last name for Alice.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. And she married a Vaughan?
Speaker 2: She--now, Alice's last name may have been Vaughan.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, alright. So--
Speaker 2: That's kind of our guess of things, is where the Vaughan came in.
Speaker 1: Okay. And well, so your mother was raised by--
Speaker 2: Novella.
Speaker 1: Novella Jones.
Speaker 2: We called her Sweetie.
Speaker 1: Okay. And was this a friend of your, of her mother's, or a relative?
Speaker 2: My understanding is that it was a friend of Mother's father.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, alright. So, did your mother--so, are there any stories that go back any further than that?
Speaker 2: I know Novella had a daughter of her own, Estelle, and they lived--Estelle was a dry cleaner, she worked in the dry cleaning business. Sweetie, I don't know that Sweetie ever worked. She was a homemaker for the most part. And Mother, Mama, was a nurse's aide. I remember when she went back to school to get that degree. She and some of her friends were actually working in the cafeteria at the hospital. And they all decided to go back to school together to become nurse's aides, and they all did. Because I remember she used to always make A's on her papers, and she had to learn to convert medicine from one measurement to another. And I used to see her papers, with all these 90's and 92's on them, and so, you know, that was exciting. Because, I always knew she was a real smart woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't--I remember the father, the grandfather, coming over to the house some Sunday mornings. And that was a big time, when they would make hot rolls and fry fish, and have a nice Sunday breakfast. But there's very little I remember of the grandfather.
Speaker 1: And what was his name?
Speaker 2: I don't have a name for him.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. But he would keep, he stayed in touch during the--I mean enough to where you saw him a few times?
Speaker 2: I saw him, yeah. I remember him as a child, but after that, no more.
Speaker 1: Okay. So did--
Speaker 2: I remember more of Sweetie and Estelle and, you know, getting together at their house on Saturday or Sunday after church.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, now, did your mother go to I.C. Norcom [high school] in Portsmouth, or--?
Speaker 2: I don't know. Mama didn't go to I.C. Norcom. Dad went to I.C. Norcom.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, alright. Do you know where she went?
Speaker 2: I'd have to look that up and send it to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right off, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay. And so, she was a nurse's aide in the hospital there in--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Portsmouth General Hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay. Portsmouth General Hospital, okay.
Story_ID: 25705
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name was Linwood Copeland Bailey. L-I-N-W-O-O-D, C-O-P-E-L-A-N-D, B-A-I-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born on Christmas Day, December 25, 1928.
Speaker 1: Okay. In--
Speaker 2: '29' [1929]. He was three years older than her, so it would be '29' [1929].
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Portsmouth [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what can you tell us about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: Okay. He had one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was also a Bailey, Wilbert Bailey. And the other children were, their last name was Smith. So, the grandmother was Lillian Daisy Smith Bailey. But his sister was Vivian, Vivian Smith. And he had another brother named Walter Smith. And he had, his last brother was Freddie, Uncle Freddie.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now--
Speaker 2: Freddie Smith.
Speaker 1: Now, did they have any stories on your father's side from way back, or anything about--
Speaker 2: They lived on London, what was then London Street. It was a segregated community, of course. But London Street had the Copeland family... Grandmama and her family lived all in the same block. There was series of duplexes, and I remember the duplex. The walls were so thin they only needed one alarm clock to wake them up. And I remember them talking through the walls with Miss Bernie and Miss Bertha, who lived on the other side. And they eventually became like kin to me. I call them Aunt to this day. And their children are like cousins to me. We used to spend a lot of time at their house, especially on Saturdays. We'd go there, and I remember the baths in the washtub. And she used to take in laundry to make a living and to pay the rent. So, I very clearly remember the, when they would, the ladies would bring the baskets of dirty laundry over, and we'd have to wash them in the kitchen. And eventually, she got a little washing machine with the roller that you--but before that, there was none. And we used to have to hang those drapes out on boards that had nails on them, and to stretch them. They used to call them stretchers, and let them dry that way. When the ladies would bring their curtains--
Speaker 1: So, people would bring their curtains over to be washed and--
Speaker 2: Curtains.
Speaker 1: And they were washed by hand?
Speaker 2: And they were washed by hand, yeah. And the washboard, we had a washboard. So, we all had to wash the clothes. And then we had to dry them on a clothesline or on a stretcher and iron them. So, it was, it really was almost a week to do the laundry, because the ironing was--you had an iron, a coal stove. And you had to heat the iron up on the coal stove. And then you'd press, and you'd put the iron back on the coal stove again, heat the iron up again, keep it going like that.
Speaker 1: So, you had to make sure the iron--how did you make sure it was not too hot?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but we, I don't remember us burning anything, I'll tell you that much. (laughter).
Speaker 1: We're talking about a family business.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: We're talking about everybody in the family. So, how many family members would be working on this project of laundry?
Speaker 2: All of us had our parts to do. I don't ever remember being responsible for the ironing, but I do remember hanging the clothes out, and I do remember washing them on the washboard. And I remember the bluing that she used to add to the last rinse water, to make sure they were, you know, extra white when it came out. So, that was the way that she earned the money for the family, Grandmama did.
Story_ID: 25706
Speaker 1: Now, did your father [Linwood Copeland Bailey] have a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--
Speaker 1: Oh, you say he finished I.C. Norcom [high school].
Speaker 2: He finished I.C. Norcom. And he actually, I think, had a football scholarship to Elizabeth City, but he didn't take that scholarship. Instead, he opened his own business. He had a barbershop. He had a barbershop on Effingham Street, which really was the hub of black business in Portsmouth, Effingham Street. And Chestnut Street used to run parallel to Effingham Street, and you know, it was just blooming there. There was a theatre, and there were little marketplaces, and several churches. And he had his business, and that's where all--everybody who was anybody, got their hair cut at Daddy's barbershop. It was just the place to go.
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: The Ellis Barbershop.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Ellis Barbershop. And they had--and there was Kenny, the shoeshine boy. He had his little section in the barbershop, and he had three or four chairs in there. And then there was the back room where the men used to go and relax in. But there was always, it was always busy. And there you'd find all the politicians and all the school people. It was a segregated school, but--and that meant that we were close together in there, so... You know, the principal--I might get up in the morning, on Sunday morning, and my principal would be in there playing checkers or chess with Dad. (laughter). And you'd see the same thing in the barbershop. That was really something, that barbershop was. I got a good look at it. I used to, when I was in elementary school, after school was out, I would walk over to the barbershop until somebody had time to take me home. And so, I used to spend quite a bit of time there in the barbershop with them.
Speaker 1: So, his clientele was black?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: I asked, because there is a tradition in some parts of the south where the barber has got a white clientele only, you know--
Speaker 2: Um--
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing, which is--
Speaker 2: Now, that was not the case. Effingham Street was primarily an African-American, there were African-American establishments there. The theater, the Capital Theatre was, catered to a black clientele. We spent a lot of time there, too. On Saturday mornings we would go to the theatre and spend most of the day there. We'd see two movies, a couple of cartoons, (laughter) for little or no money.
Speaker 1: Now, did your father have any stories about growing up, that he shared with you?
Speaker 2: I remember that he was a football player. He was a quarterback, and so that was a big part of his conversation, and that Grandmama wouldn't go to his games because she didn't want to see her boy hurt. But he had quite a name for himself in that community. He was also a golfer. And golfing was something that a lot of the men in our community enjoyed, but their time on the golf course was severely restricted to certain days when they could use the golf course, or certain sections of the golf course. And so, that was an issue that they fought. And some of them had some real repercussions. I--there's a newspaper clipping that I really wanted to find for this interview. But, he was standing there in this newspaper clipping with Holley, Dr. Holley, who eventually became mayor of the city, and Mr. Gray, a master plumber and their lawyer. And they were suing the city for rights to use the golf course. And eventually, they won that suit. But eventually, he also lost his business behind that.
Speaker 1: How did they do that? What happened?
Speaker 2: What happened? They surveyed, they got surveillance on the barbershop. Anytime they saw any activities that they thought were suspicious, they would raid his barbershop. He had a soda machine in there. And so, if a man came in with a flask or anything, they would say he was running, you know, an establishment that was selling drinks or something. And so, he got rid of that. But it was just one thing after another that continued to threaten the business.
Speaker 1: Now, about what time is this? Is this in the '60's [1960s] or '70's [1970s]?
Speaker 2: This is in, let's see. This was in the '60's [1960's]. Well, '50's [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: '50's [1950s], '60's [1960s], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, did he ever re-establish his barbershop?
Speaker 2: He did not re-establish his barbershop. He, after that, rented a chair with some other barbers.
Speaker 1: Okay. A sad story there, you know. So, did he ever--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah. But he kind of felt like it was worth it, because they had moved forward, and they did establish the right for themselves and others who came after them to use the public facilities that they wanted.
Story_ID: 25707
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: I don't remember a story, well, about how they met. But, I do know that during that time... As I said, the two houses were, the houses were very close together, and the walls between them were very thin. And so, it was like the people in the duplex were one big family. And girls couldn't go out so much, especially at night, without somebody being with them, a family member being with them, especially in Portsmouth [Virginia], because you're talking about a port city where sailors would come down in those white uniforms. And, you know, it was, the daughters had to go inside. And so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, those sailors are--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a threat. So, Gloria was one of the girls who lived in the house that was on the other side of our duplex, Grandmama's duplex. And Daddy used to always have to go places with her. And Gloria didn't like it, he didn't like it. But they were friends so, you know, that's the way it had to be. And I know that my mama was very suspicious of Gloria for a long, long time. And Gloria jokes about it now. My mother's gone, but Gloria's still alive. And we were laughing about it just last week. She said, "Sarah used to always think that..." She'd be mad because Lin couldn't go with her, he couldn't go with my mother, because he had to take Gloria somewhere. And she said finally when Gloria went off to school--she went to Virginia Union to become a teacher--and she said she remembers that day very well, because Mama came up to the car and handed her fifty cents. Now, that was her way of making peace with Gloria, after all those years of, you know, thinking Gloria was her rival, when Gloria really wasn't a rival. But that was interesting. I said "Well, maybe, Gloria, maybe she was just happy to see you go, you know. (laughter). It was worth fifty cents." (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, now, how old was your, where were your parents when they met? I mean--
Speaker 2: I was born when she was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was, I think he was then nineteen.
Speaker 1: Okay. They were both teenagers.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Story_ID: 25708
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, when you think about your parents' personalities, their disposition, their sense of humor, their habits, their hobbies, how they walk, talk, look--who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Mama [Sarah Deloris Vaughn Bailey] had a sense of humor. Boy, she would, she could laugh at just about anything. And so, you know, but, I know I'm probably more serious than she. So, I'm probably more like Dad [Linwood Copeland Bailey].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now, let's see. Now, can you name your brothers and sisters, and where you fit in the lineup?
Speaker 2: Uh huh. I'm the oldest of the three. And I'm three years older than my sister Stephanie, Stephanie Denise Bailey Johnson, Dr. Stephanie Denise Bailey Johnson. And that's S-T-E-P-H-A-N-I-E, D-E-N-I-S-E, B-A-I-L-E-Y, J-O-H-N-S-O-N. And then there's my brother, Linwood, Linwood Copeland Bailey, Jr., who passed away in the early 1990's.
Speaker 1: Is that it, it's just the three of you?
Speaker 2: It's three of us, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And we each had one child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And so, you all grew up in the duplex. Is that right?
Speaker 2: That's where my grandmother's, my father's mother was. But Daddy actually had a house. He bought a home, which was a big step for, at that time. He bought one of the first houses in the community of Cavalier Manor. The first section was called Victory Park. And Cavalier Manor is actually one of the largest black owned communities in the United States. And he was one of the first to move out there. He bought 306 Beechdale Road, and we stayed there for a while. And I remember, you know, well, the people who lived around us, who were the teachers and the ministers in the community. Eventually, he sold that house and moved a little further down, because there was a drainage problem in that area. So, we stayed on Beechdale Road, but he bought further up, sort of up the hill, 105 Beechdale Road. And that's where we are to this day. We still own that property.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My son lives there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He owns the house.
Story_ID: 25709
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory was--before he bought that house on 306 Beechdale, we lived in an area called Lincolnville. And Lincolnville was walking distance, about a half a mile or so away from London Boulevard, London Street, at the time. I remember London--I remember the aunts and uncles talking about how they had to move when they were going to change London Street into London Boulevard, by widening it. And the side of the street they were going to take was on our side. And to this day, the homes that were on the other side are still there. And so, I can still, you know, go drive down that street and see it, and realize we lived right in the middle of that, what is now London Boulevard. But I do remember the widening of London Boulevard. London Street would become London Boulevard. And I remember walking from Lincolnville to London Street, to be with my grandmother and my aunts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, Lincolnville was, it was kind of a fun place to be. Again, there was family all around us--the people next door, the Hardy's.  And then there was a vacant lot, a couple of extra houses--and my Aunt Doris, who was actually from the duplex, the other side of the duplex. And I remember if I ever got into any trouble, all I had to do was try to--if I could make it past the Hardys and past that lot down to Aunt Doris's house with Uncle William, I was okay. Because would say... (laughter). Yeah, I remember that. And I have some pictures from her house, as a matter of fact. I remember playing with my sister in the backyard, and going to the stores, the little, you know, store, getting a penny's worth of ginger snaps, like that. I remember watching television on Friday night, because that's when the people would go to the supermarket, or go shopping. And we'd watch 'Oh Suzanna' and some other things on the television until they came back. And then we'd all have some nice snacks to eat, and so forth. So, I remember very clearly, Lincolnville. And I remember London Street, and that tight-knit community.
Story_ID: 25710
Speaker 1: So, you've been talking about--one question we always ask is about the sights and sounds and smells of growing up. And you've really been doing a good job with that already, without me asking you. But, what are some of the sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Oh, I remember, I remember the dirt outside of my grandmother's house where we used to draw our little hopscotch, and the color of that dirt being a muddy--kind of a brown. There was no grass. It was just, you know, but it was a hard dirt and it was a good thing. We'd draw--you know, all you needed was a nice piece of glass, and you could draw a nice hopscotch with it. And the color of that dirt... Yeah, I remember when I did see, you know, places where there was glass, like in the backyard. She used to have a fig tree. It was really great, because I love figs. And we'd search for four-leaf clovers in the areas where there was grass growing, always happy when we found one, a four-leaf clover. I remember her kitchen--and Saturday--you didn't cook on Sunday. She always cooked on Saturday. And she would make the rolls, and if there was any bread left over, she'd pat it down and put cinnamon and butter over it. And she'd slice an apple very thin, and she'd just lay it on top of the bread, and we'd have that cinnamon bread like for breakfast in the morning. And that smell--oooh, ahhh, brings back some real memories, that smell of cinnamon bread baking. I remember that she cooked on a wood stove, or a coal stove. In the kitchen, there was one in the kitchen. And there was always a coffee pot sitting on the back of the stove. And that coffee would be, they'd make it in the morning and it would just, you know, first thing you'd smell would be the coffee. And they'd drink it all day long. That would be some pretty strong coffee. And to this day, the first thing I do when I get up in the morning is make some coffee. And people in my house don't drink coffee, except for me. So, I make a half a pot, but every single day I make a pot of coffee. It's just sort of my connection to the world, and it's, yeah, it's decaf. So, it's not the caffeine that gives me, you know, the rush or whatever. It's the warmth that's good and the aroma is good. And I just think it is just kind of my link back to that time. Coffee on the stove, I remember. I remember the nights when we would all sleep in that one bed. It was Grandmama and myself and Aunt Vivian, and sometimes Stephanie. And how we would--if you had to get up at night, then there was no indoor plumbing for a long time. So, there was a jar, a jug, that we'd have to use. And then somebody would have to take that out the next day, of course, in the morning. So, I remember that. Smell--I remember the smell of the lotion that Aunt Vivian used to use, that Jergen's lotion, that I thought was just wonderful. I remember the vanilla ice cream, that whenever Vivian's friend used to come over. And there was a living room that nobody got to play in. I mean, we'd come in the front door and we'd go right through the living room. You didn't stop there. Only visitors got to sit in the living room. But whenever her friend would come over, he'd bring ice cream for Grandma. (laughter). And so, I remember that. I remember her, I remember the sound of the man who used to bring ice. He'd come selling ice, big chunks of ice. When she finally got a refrigerator, you got the ice and put it in there to keep stuff warm [does she mean cold?]. And it was the ice pick that we used to use, you know, to chip pieces off, if we wanted a drink. So, that's pretty clear in my memory. And the feel of that coal heat which was so dense, you know, it was really a heavy, heavy, heat in the family room. The sounds when we'd go out and get that coal and bring it in, and the buckets and the wood, the wood had to be cut also to keep us warm. And then we'd all go upstairs and we... at night. Get up--wouldn't nobody would get--Grandma would get up first. And she'd go down and she would, you know, start the stove up and make a pot of coffee. And then a little later, we'd get up and go down and wash up, because there was some warm water, a kettle of water, where we could wash up then. So, that's what I remember from early days. Now, after that, when Dad [Linwood Copeland Bailey] bought the house, they say, people used to say, well, you know, he was cooking with gas, because he didn't have to cook with coal anymore, he cooked with wood. They had, you know, a gas furnace and (laughter) a gas stove to cook on. So, we didn't have to go through that anymore when we moved to 306 Beechdale Road.
Speaker 1: Now, how old were you when you all moved?
Speaker 2: I was about five or six.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was school age.
Speaker 1: So, you went to school in the new neighborhood, right?
Speaker 2: Actually, the school was still downtown that I went to. And so, I would ride down to school with him in the morning and go to school. When I got out of school, I'd go to his barbershop and wait until somebody had, you know, the opportunity to take me back home.
Speaker 1: So, that is interesting, to spend a lot of time in a barbershop, with the discussions that--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Did they clean up their conversation...
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.
Speaker 1: ...when you came in?
Speaker 2: I spent a lot of time in the back room (laughter). Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Because they were--I'm the son of a barber, and I know they would do that--
Speaker 2: Are you?
Speaker 1: --and you'd come in the guys would try to talk, they--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they didn't--
Speaker 1: They'd chastise each other for, you know, for--
Speaker 2: They did not talk dirty around me, no. I don't remember any of that.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: I remember spinning around in that barber chair a lot, though. That was a fun thing to do. Did you do that? (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 25711
Speaker 1: Now, what was, what was your first school? What was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: Let's see. I believe I went to Riddick Weaver [Elementary School].
Speaker 1: Riddick?
Speaker 2: I went to a lot of schools, elementary school. I went to Southwestern--
Speaker 1: Now, let's start with the first one and try to go chronologically.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, you started at Riddick Weaver?
Speaker 2: Riddick Weaver.
Speaker 1: And that's R-I-D-D-I-C-K?
Speaker 2: ...CK, W-E-A-V-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when we moved--well, we started off at Zion Baptist Church kindergarten. And that was run--what was her name? I don't remember her name. It'll come to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she made a big impact on me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I still have a photo of that graduation, standing in that white robe and a little white cap and a little piece of paper in my hand.
Speaker 1: Not every--
Speaker 2: Miss Wade, Mrs. Wade--
Speaker 1: Miss Wade, okay.
Speaker 2: --was her name. And she lived in the community, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was, you know, that was the place to go, because education was big in my community. A lot of educators lived all around us all the time. So, I started off at Zion Baptist Church kindergarten.
Speaker 1: That's like 1955 or so?
Speaker 2: That would have been '49' [1949]--about '54' [1954], '55' [1955], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was five years old, five years old.
Speaker 1: Right. So, then you went to Riddick Weaver for elementary school?
Speaker 2: Uh huh. But I think only for about a year, because we left there, and at that time the area of Portsmouth [Virginia] had not been annexed. And so, I went to what is now a school in Chesapeake, Virginia and--Southwestern Elementary.
Speaker 1: Okay. Southwestern Elementary School.
Speaker 2: Uh huh. And made a dear friend there that I have to this day, Thelma. And then I remember going to Cavalier Manor Elementary School. That was the longest period of time.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you went to Cavalier?
Speaker 2: Cavalier Manor? I was in like third, fourth grade--fourth grade. That's when I met Mr. Byrd, who was my science teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had a big influence over me, too. He just loved science. He made science so much fun. And his rock collections, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, let's go back to the early years. Now, is Mr. Byrd your first real science teacher?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, we can start there. (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Alright. So, this is your first awareness of science--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as such, through Mr. Byrd. And he--
Speaker 2: Who is an Elizabeth City State University State graduate. He's alive to this day. And I just remember him and his rock collection. And it was just so much fun in his class.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, he had a rock collection, huh?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did he encourage his students to collect rocks?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So, could you identify the different kinds of rocks?
Speaker 2: Yes, I could then. (laughter). He--in fact, at that point, we had, you know, I remember teachers teaching us how to create bulletin boards. And I remember creating one in his classroom, as a matter of fact, about the rocks, and learning how to cut letters and do all sorts of things. My sister started school there just before I left. So, it was about the fifth, sixth grade, she started school there. And she was like first or second grade. And then I had to leave Cavalier Manor because I was going to junior high. And junior high was when I really started getting more science, getting more excited about science. Mrs. Jenkins was there. And Mrs. Jenkins would let us stay after school and work on science projects.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of this junior high school?
Speaker 2: The junior high school was--oh, wait a minute--and it's still there to this day, S.H. Clark.
Speaker 1: S.H. Clark.
Speaker 2: S.H. Clark Junior High.
Speaker 1: Now was S.H. Clark an educator, a black educator in the area?
Speaker 2: Yes, just like Norcom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, that's, that was what I--Miss Power was my home room teacher. And Mrs. Jenkins used to, she used to--it wasn't a science club, I don't think, but there was a lot of, at that time they had science fairs, lots of them. And so, we used to stay after and work on our science projects. And that actually was the thing that made the big difference for me, eventually. It actually got me a scholarship to go to college. So, she started something then.  And I remember we needed some glass to cover whatever it was we were growing, and I don't remember what we were growing. But she, we went down to the barbershop one day and found somebody there with a glass cutter and the glass, and got it to her measurements that she needed in order to finish that project. But it was very hands on, it's very community, a lot of community involvement and support of the work that was being done there in terms of science. I only stayed at Clark for one year. And because--for some reason, Norcom started accepting students in the eighth grade, and I was one of the first students to go to Norcom in the eighth grade. So, I was actually at Norcom for five years, as opposed to usually being 9th grade, 10th, 11th, and 12th. I was there 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12, which gave me exposure to those science courses, advanced science courses, at an early age. And by the way, I had already been skipped one grade at Cavalier Manor Elementary. They moved me forward a grade.
Speaker 1: So, this would be, you'd be, this would be 1962, I guess, then?
Speaker 2: I finished Norcom in '66' [1966].
Speaker 1: '61' [1961] in eighth grade, okay (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: So, it would be '61' [1961], I think, when I first went to eighth grade.
Story_ID: 25712
Speaker 1: Right, in eighth grade [in 1961]. And so, I was already younger than anybody in the class. And then I was thrown into a high school environment... go back ... really young (laughter). And so, but that was just great, because you know, those teachers really challenged you, and there was a lot of formal--I got to take lots and lots of math classes that we--we took trigonometry, we took analytic geometry, we took pre-calculus. It was just lots of good science going on there. Chemistry with Mr. Bailey, physics with Mr. Bowse.
Speaker 2: You had a Mr. Foust, who was a--
Speaker 1: A physics teacher, yeah. He was, actually, Mr. Foust had just graduated from college when he came to Norcom. So, he wasn't much older than were we. (laugher). But he came in teaching us physics. I remember I was just--when I saw physics I was in love, because physics was so closely aligned with mathematics, as opposed to biology or chemistry. And so, when I went to Virginia State, I decided I wanted to study mathematics and physics as a result of being in his class.
Speaker 2: How high could you go at I.C. Norcom?
Speaker 1: At Norcom?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in terms of math. Did you go to calculus?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Did you? Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, that's great, to have--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: To have calculus in high school.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: And--okay. So, I.C. Norcom was on the case.
Speaker 1: I.C. Norcom was a wealth of information and role models and mentors. And they expected you to achieve there. There was Miss Clark.  And I don't know, her name was White, I believe then. Mrs. Foust, she originally married Mr. Foust, so we know her now as Mrs. Foust. I believe her name was White then. Those teachers were-- there was no nonsense. It was, you know, we love this stuff (laughter). When you come in here, you learn. And that was one of the best things. In the summertime, all I wanted to do--I didn't want to run and play. I wanted to get a calculus book, I wanted to graph some functions.  When I learned to graph those functions, you know, to take a function and find the X axis, the X intercept and the Y intercept--and where it was concave up and concave down and those intervals on which it, you know, where the asymptotes were. And then you put all that stuff together, you know, a point here, a point there--you put all that stuff together and you get a nice smooth curve. Oh, that was good stuff. That was just wonderful. And they would let me do that. In fact, the project that I remember after Miss Jenkins' project in middle school was a project where I was graphing trig functions. And that project, actually, we took it to a science fair at Hampton [University]. There were all of these universities around us. And it was Hampton, it was Norfolk State [University], and Virginia State [University]. At that time, Norfolk State was a Norfolk division of Virginia State. Well, it was Virginia State there, too. So, they would have science fairs. We'd take our projects there, and the professors would come and judge our projects. And so, my function--I had spent all this time after school charting these functions. And then this guy came by. He was a big, big man. He talked to me about my project and he was, you know, he said, "Well, you know, what about the aptitude? And what would happen if you changed this co-efficient, and you know, how would that affect your graph?" And he made me think about that. And that was Dr. McDaniels, who was head of the math department at Virginia State.
Speaker 2: Now you, so you met him at a science fair?
Speaker 1: I met--he was a judge at the science fair.
Speaker 2: And how old were you at that time?
Speaker 1: I was a senior by that time. And we just talked and had a good time, you know, talking about those functions. And eventually he said, "Well, if I give you a scholarship, will you come to Virginia State?" And I said, yes. And so, that's how I, you know, I mean, summers otherwise were spent running the elevator at the Professional Building, or working in somebody's kitchen, watching the kids or ironing clothes for somebody. So, the thought of going to college really never occurred to me.
Speaker 2: Now, were your grades fairly good in school?
Speaker 1: My grades were good.
Speaker 2: Okay. Were you making--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I loved it.
Speaker 2: --straight A's or--
Speaker 1: Oh, no. I was pretty much a B student. (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay. So, they were pleased with them. You say they were pretty good, but--
Speaker 1: Pretty good.
Speaker 2: But you were real excited about math and science?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Math and science, always B's and A's.
Story_ID: 25713
Speaker 1: So, did you spend a lot of time working at home on the laundry business and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Summers, yes. But after we moved to Cavalier Manor and Mama [Sarah Deloris Vaughn Bailey] went back to school, Vivian, Aunt Vivian, took a job in New York. And she was cleaning for some people. And so, she would send money back to my grandmother. And Grandmama didn't have to do the cleaning as, when she was, she was getting older, too. So, she didn't have to do the laundry as much anymore. But once we were in Cavalier Manor, the barber, barbering was Daddy's [Linwood Copeland Bailey] main occupation, and nursing was my mother's [Sarah Deloris Vaughn Bailey] main occupation.
Speaker 1: Okay. Let me ask you. Now, when you were in high school, were you involved in extracurricular activities, too, like, you know, clubs and--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --you run for office?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah. That was fun. Yeah, science clubs, math club, and I remember working on the yearbook staff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. But most of my time at home was spent either studying or graphing functions. Like I said, I loved it. To find a new function was just the best thing for me. So, they would give me math books to take home.  And, you know, when you get like a radical function, or a function that was, that had a denominator involved, that's when you've got some interesting features to those functions. That's when you got the asymptotes, and the denominator couldn't be zero. So, that also put some restrictions on the way the curve looked, as such. So, that was really interesting to me.
Speaker 1: Well, explain to those who don't know what a function is, what is a function, in terms of how you--?
Speaker 2: Oh, a function, okay. So, you have this relationship between variables, usually X and Y. And the function expresses that relationship as such. So, you get something like, oh, Y equals X squared plus 3X plus 5. That's a polynomial. That's a second degree polynomial, because X is squared. And then is X--you give X a value, and you can solve it for Y. So, that gives you a coordinate, an X value and a Y value. And you can take the coordinate plane--Y axis and the X axis--in the middle is zero. And you can actually apply those points. So, in this first coordinate, all of your X's were positive and your Y's were positive. So, a point like, oh, X having a value of 5, and Y having a value of 6, would be in the first part of that Cartesian plane. And then the second coordinate would be your negative values for X and your positive values for Y.  And then the third coordinate would be negative X's and negative Y's. Then the fourth part would be positive X's and negative Y's. So, as you solve those--as you plugged in the value for X, and you got it, you solved it for a corresponding value for Y, you could then plot that point, to find the X intercept. That's the point where X equals zero. So, you put, that's a little different. You put the zero in for Y, and you solve for X, and that would give you the place on the X axis where it, the function crossed the X axis. If you put zero in for X, then that would give you the point where the function crossed the Y axis. So, you get a zero and a Y value. So, you can find your X intercept where you cross the X axis, the Y intercept.  And then you put in other values for X, like 2 or 3, whatever, and find the corresponding value for Y, so you end up with all these points. Eventually, you get a picture of the function. And all you had to do was connect those points with a little bit of finesse in between, and you get these beautiful curves. And I remember Dad asking me one time what I wanted for my birthday. I told him I wanted a pencil sharpener, because I could get my pencil point sharp enough so that my curves wouldn't be all lumpy, and it would be nice and smooth, just gorgeous curves. And so, he got me that pencil sharpener. I remember (laughter) Mama got mad because he attached it to the dresser and drilled a hole in the dresser. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, you had to bolt it down on the table.
Speaker 2: You had to bolt it down, right.
Speaker 1: It didn't have the suction device on it that it has on it now.
Speaker 2: No suction device, right.
Speaker 1: A couple of wood screws--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --and you'd screw it to the table.
Speaker 2: That's right, exactly. But, you know, that was the fun part for me, was doing that.
Story_ID: 25714
Speaker 1: Now, so, when you graduated, did you have any counseling at all at I.C. Norcom [High School] about college? Were they expecting you to go to college?
Speaker 2: Actually, yes. I was, at that time the group of kids that were in the math club and the science club, we pretty much knew, they knew they were going to college. I really didn't, because I didn't, I didn't know where the money was going to come from as such, you know. So, there wasn't any real expectation there. But, I would say that I was just in the right group to--so I kind of heard that, you know, Sheryl was applying to Wilberforce [University] and Kenneth was applying to Howard [University], and stuff like that. But those applications took money to send off. And so, I never really sent off an application.
Speaker 1: Yeah. There was what they call an application fee--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --for you to even apply.
Speaker 2: Uh huh, right. So--
Speaker 1: So, did you have a counselor, a session with a counselor about college?
Speaker 2: We had counselors. I remember having a counselor. I remember her, you know, discussing some colleges. And then the other thing is Norfolk State [University] played a big part in what was going on in our community, as well. And I thought, if anything, I could go to Norfolk State. Norfolk state used to send around a bus in the community. It was called the Blue Goose. It was a blue school bus. And the people in the community would, you know, get on the bus and go over to Norfolk State in the morning--take their lunch, whatever. They'd take their classes, and then they'd come home in the evening on the Blue Goose again. And so, that was probably in the back of my mind, thinking that I could go to, you know, to Norfolk State. Norfolk State was really the reason that a lot of people in the community were educated. As a matter of fact, they made a big contribution to establishing a middle class in that area. You found a lot of women who were teachers. And then there was the government, you know, the shipyard and all. You found a lot of combinations of women teaching, and men who were master plumbers, master welders in the community--those kinds of couples.
Speaker 1: You're saying at some level that men could get jobs without having to go to college...
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: ...easier.
Speaker 2: Yes, they could, uh huh. Because, you know, the Norfolk Naval Shipyard is right there in Portsmouth [Virginia].
Story_ID: 25715
Speaker 1: So you were considering going to Norfolk State [University].
Speaker 2: Yeah, because there was a summer or two when I was able to go to Norfolk State.  And, now, that's one thing the guidance counselor did do. She helped me get to Norfolk State during the summer. And they had, you know, an outreach program where we would go and work with their professors in mathematics.
Speaker 1: Was it like similar to Upward Bound or was it--
Speaker 2: It was something like that, but it was science based. And I met people from Louisiana. I remember Kennedy, I met a girl named Kennedy from New Orleans, in that New Orleans area there. And we were just encouraged to explore mathematics. And that was, that was very interesting, too.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, did you get a scholarship from Virginia State [University]?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the only scholarship I got.
Speaker 1: This was through Dr. Ruben McDaniel, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was, come to find out it was a scholarship that covered tuition, but not room and board. And so, when that reality hit, it was a real kind of a panic.
Speaker 1: Now, we just heard Dr. Houston talk about the same panic.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: He got a scholarship for tuition, but he didn't know what it meant until--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --he got another letter, and he said--
Speaker 2: You got to come up with $350.
Speaker 1: Right. So, how did you do, how did you do it?
Speaker 2: Uncle Flick took out a, took a loan, he signed a loan for me to go.
Speaker 1: So, this is an expression of a lot of faith.
Speaker 2: It was a community effort (laughter). You know, somebody had to come up with the truck, and take me up there. (laughter). Oh boy, yes, absolutely, it was a... But they, you know, they all kind of--Uncle Flick was very encouraging. In fact, the neighborhood was encouraging. They always said, "Get your education, get your education." And he was just always very supportive of our efforts. And so, he had gone off to the service, and had come back. He didn't go to college, but had gotten a good job in the shipyard. And so, he was sort of the stable, you know, family member who was very stable financially.
Story_ID: 25716
Speaker 1: It says here Virginia State [University] is located in Chesterfield [Virginia], but I always thought it was Petersburg [Virginia].
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, Petersburg--Chesterfield is a little community around Petersburg.
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah, it's the site of the historical last battle of the Civil War, basically.
Speaker 2: Oh God, yes, up on a hill. You had to climb a hill to get to Virginia State. And McDaniels was there. We lived in Byrd Hall freshman dormitory. And there were a lot of math majors there. Mathematics was sort of the thing. That was around the time when Sputnik and the race to the, race to the moon, and some other things were going on. So, it was an exciting time to be in the sciences.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And what role models they had there! Oh, my God. Ma Hunter was there, and her husband in chemistry--
Speaker 1: Who was that, who was that?
Speaker 2: Ma Hunter, Dr. Hunter, Louise--
Speaker 1: Dr. Hunter, okay. Louise Hunter, right, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, Ruben McDaniel was there, right?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Dr. Louise Hunter--
Speaker 2: Louise Hunter was there.
Speaker 1: Now, she'd been a classmate, I see here in my notes, of Walter Ridley. He became the first African-American to get a degree from the University of Virginia.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, Dr. Louise Stokes Hunter?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was something.
Speaker 1: Now, was she related to the Stokes from Wilberforce [University], the Wilberforce Stokes?
Speaker 2: I do remember something about that--
Speaker 1: Remember Stokes, and all of that?
Speaker 2: --but I'm not sure about that story, yeah. But she was a tiny woman. And I remember her coming in, and the room was like, there were blackboards all around this big room.  And she would come in, and she would--looked like she would have no notes, no books or anything. And she'd just start working problems and explaining problems. And when the class was over, she would have covered all the boards with solutions and challenges. And then we had to get up, and we had to work problems. And she really gave me a tough time, though. She wore me out in that analytic geometry class. I remember going--and I would have to come and see her after class in her office. And she would take off points. If I had 1 over 3 equals, oh, 6 over 18, and that equal sign was not there between those two fraction lines, it was up too far or down too low, she'd take off points. She would hit every single detail. And I was, I loved writing the solutions out, so I was very meticulous. All I wanted was a sharp pencil and a clean sheet of paper. I didn't want any lines on it. But at the end of the freshman year, she gave me the freshman year award, the Freshman of the Year Award in mathematics--a book of trigonometric and a book of functions and formulas, and a certificate. And then she smiled at me. (laughter). But that was, it was a real challenge working with her. And then there was, Emma Smith was there, Dr. Smith. It's wonderful, because as I think about giving forward, Emma's son has now come through some of my programs. And Dr. Walters, Walters was there also. I remember him teaching me topology. And Dr. Walters has come through Elizabeth City. He and Emma Smith, I have photos of them here in my lab. So, I was able to teach them now about the computer science, after they taught me all that good mathematics and stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but, yeah. And then there was the physics part of my life there, which was also wonderful.
Speaker 1: Who taught physics?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see. What was his name? I forget it. Oh, it'll come to me in a minute if I stop pulling for it. Great guys. I remember the fellow who is, was dean of the School of Physics at Howard [University], was in class with me. Then, oh, what his name? Oh, I have to stop pulling for that name. It'll come to me, too. But I remember the nights in that physics laboratory with those Bunsen burners. And we were working those formulas. It wasn't a chemistry lab, it was a physics lab. And we had to set up our optics experiments.  James, James Daniels--James Stith, one of the guys was Stith.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we know him, James Stith, right.
Speaker 2: James Stith, right, okay. And Davenport, Dr. Davenport, yeah, was the other physics man.
Speaker 1: So, this is some serious science going on at--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --Virginia State.
Speaker 2: They laid a foundation that just was, you know, the foundation was there from Norcom and Norfolk State. And then going to Virginia State would just continue to build on that, and feed into my love of it, of the science.
Speaker 1: Now, did you know James Avery, the actor? He was there. And he was born in '48' [1948]. And he was at Virginia State. I don't know for how long, but--
Speaker 2: He was there during that time?
Speaker 1: I would think, because you're a year apart.
Speaker 2: Wonder what his major was?
Speaker 1: James Avery--I would imagine, you know, he was the father on the Fresh Prince. He was the actor that played--
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was there. So, I don't, you know. Tim Reid was--no, he was at Norfolk State [University].
Speaker 2: Tim Reid was at Norfolk State.
Speaker 1: Norfolk State, that's right, alright.
Speaker 2: Yes. Well, if he was in the sciences, I probably knew him. And, if, or, if he played cards, because we played cards a lot there, too--
Story_ID: 25717
Speaker 1: Now, you became an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] there, right?
Speaker 2: I did. Alpha Epsilon Chapter.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you had time for, although you're in a serious field, you had time for extra-curricular activities?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, I played cards. (laughter). I think that's really the first lesson I learned when I set foot on campus, was to shuffle a deck. (laughter). I love cards. Yeah, if I didn't play cards, probably my GPA would have been even higher. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, did you like music? I never asked you about music before?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't too--well, I liked, they used to be able to check out a radio player from the library. And we used to check that out and take it to the dorm, and with Lou Rawls music. And we used to play that a lot.
Speaker 1: Lou Rawls live?
Speaker 2: Yeah. We played a lot of Lou Rawls music there. And Aretha [Franklin] was just beginning to be big right about that time, so we played some of her music, too. But I wasn't a real music fan. My main thing, when we had to take that music appreciation class, I was on line for AKA. And the girl who was ahead of my line, Magalene, had been in the band. And so, it was my job to check out the radio player and the records, and get them to Magalene and make sure she studied them. And she knew just enough to teach us so that we could get through that class. (laughter). So, if it wasn't for Magalene, I don't think I would have made it through music appreciation class.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now, did you run for any class offices or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Did not.
Speaker 1: And did you have a math club or science club?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did. And I worked for a while in the library. My job was to make sure those newspapers were on the, those poles, and hung just right. And then after--I think we made fifty-five cents an hour. And after my first semester, they invited me to work in the math department, after I got the first year.  After I got the award, I got to work in the math department, grading papers.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now what was this called?
Speaker 2: The Freshman Math Major of the Year Award, the one that Dr. Hunter gave me.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did you receive any other awards at Virginia State [University]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't remember any other awards. I don't remember any other awards.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I had a lot of friends in the sorority. And to this day, we still get together every couple years, Alpha Epsilon gets together.
Speaker 1: Now, did mathematics come easily for you?
Speaker 2: Very easy. It was just a pleasure. One thing I found about mathematics, and a lot of kids don't like about mathematics, is that you have to be, you have to stay on top of it, from chapter one. If you don't know chapter one, then you're probably going to have trouble with chapter two, and you'll never be able to do chapter three. And so, it's not like, you know, history, where you can fail a test on World War I and pass the test on World War II [1939-1945]. You know, it's just, it's a total, sort of unconnected.
Speaker 1: So, we've been told that--by physicists and others--that math, though some people may be, you know, extremely talented like yourself, but even an ordinary person, if they take it step by step, they might be able to get it.
Speaker 2: Right. But you can't just jump in the middle and say, you know--it doesn't happen. You got to go back and learn all that stuff that you missed, before you can come up and be successful on that next test. That's one thing people--so, it tends to be, you know, a discipline. You have to be very disciplined about it. And it's a call to discipline, as a matter of fact. And that piece was good for me. I could do that.
Story_ID: 25718
Speaker 1: Now, when you were in school, basically the civil rights movement, most of the activity had, was passing away, you know, as you were coming through. Did you, I mean, what were race relations like in Norfolk [Virginia], I mean, in Petersburg [Virginia], for black people?
Speaker 2: I remember, I remember going to a conference. It was a statistics conference with one of my professors, when we got the word that Martin Luther King had been killed.
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: And we cut things short and ran back to campus. And that was, it was a lot going on then, because a lot of guys had come back from the Vietnam War [1959-1975] then, too. They were, you know, they wore those, they brought those jackets back. They had the snakes on the back of them, and all the elaborate clothing from Vietnam. And I remember them all being out on the yard. It was a pretty, it was a different look to the campus after that. Wow.
Speaker 1: Did a certain attitude manifest itself in the Vietnam vets? I mean, did they, you know, were they all different, or did they all kind of have a similar kind of--
Speaker 2: From the rest of the students, you mean?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were different. Those were, they were men. You know, they weren't boys. They were, they were some pretty serious guys. And the other thing is that there's a fort, Fort Lee, is not too far from the campus. And so, they interacted a lot with the soldiers from that facility as well. And they'd be on campus a lot at dances and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, at that time they still had curfews, and separated. We had to be in at a certain time. And there was a lot of protection there in terms of, if you didn't want to--you had to make a special effort to get out there and be social, as such, during that time. Because we had dorm mothers who kept a strong eye on us. So, it was different.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think except for maybe a few places, that's like a thing of the past today, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it is.
Speaker 1: Even here at--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is this, are there dorms here now--
Speaker 2: Uh huh. They're mixed.
Speaker 1: Okay. But those days were different, much different. So--
Story_ID: 25719
Speaker 1: Now, when you graduated--in 1970, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what were your plans? What were your plans?
Speaker 2: I had a job offer to, I had several job offers as a matter of fact. In Utah, I'd gone out there for an interview. And there were a couple of internships with General Electric in Schenectady, New York. And so, I had an offer with them. That's where they built the nuclear submarine engines up there. And I had a job offer with NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]. I think, of all of them, I didn't want to go back to upstate New York. I loved the facility, because that's the first time I learned about computers, up at GE.
Speaker 1: In Schenectady?
Speaker 2: Uh huh, Schenectady. I got the program using the cards. So, I loved that work. And Mr. Phipps, who worked with us up there, made it very comfortable. But I thought--and NASA was, you know, the place to be. That's where all the cool science was. And there was a good job offer. It was like five thousand dollars, or something like that.
Speaker 1: Now that's, now put that in perspective, that's real good money--
Speaker 2: That's good money.
Speaker 1: --in 1970.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it was close to home. So, of the three offers, probably NASA was the one I was giving the most consideration to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, one of my professors told me about the opportunity to go to grad school at the University of Cincinnati. And it seems like they were trying to get some African-Americans up there in Cincinnati [Ohio] in the math department. And so, that meant I could continue to study. And I really liked that idea. So, I took them up on that offer. There were about four of us that went up there. I was the only math major that went up there.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, the others were, what?  What were they in?
Speaker 2: Sharletta was music, and there were one or two business majors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, University of Cincinnati, 1970.
Speaker 2: 1970, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, I'd done, I did an, I graduated in May, and I went to GE in Schenectady that summer and worked. And then--because that was about--all the money I had was what I earned that summer, and took that to Cincinnati. I didn't know where I was going to live, didn't know what--(laughter), but I did know Sharletta, because Sharletta was a soror. And so, I got from Schenectady to the airport in Cincinnati, and then I just started screaming for help. You know, I just started dialing every number I knew. And eventually, I got her, she was home. And she told me to take a cab over there. And there was another girl who had been there a week or so, a couple of weeks before I was. And she was from Virginia State [University], too. And she had a loft apartment, like an attic. And she said I could come and stay with her. It wasn't too far from campus. So, I did that and stayed there for, oh, a couple of weeks. And walking from her house to the campus, I saw a 'For Rent' sign. There was a guy who had a second-story apartment he was renting. So, I said I'll take it. And there was nothing in there, it was just empty. My Uncle Flick had given me a radio that also had a little spinner on it, so I could play, you know, 45's. And I had my trunk that had a few clothes in it. So, I took that apartment. That's what I moved in with, with that radio and that trunk, and I went to the little store on the corner and bought a rug. And so, I slept on that rug and listened to that radio all night long, because I was scared (laughter) in that place by myself.
Speaker 1: So, were you near the university?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wasn't far from the university. It was about a half mile or so from the university. And that's what made it work. Eventually, I think the landlord gave me a table for the kitchen. And the fellows downstairs, there were some kind of hippy guys downstairs, they gave me a mattress. And so, I moved up from the rug to the mattress. And I just kept going to class. Cincinnati was, it had some good people there, but it had some really racist people there, too, terribly racist. So, I learned some tough lessons there.
Speaker 1: Were you surprised?
Speaker 2: I was. I was, you know, when I walked on the campus, it was different from Virginia State. There was no saying hello to everybody. People just, you know, didn't speak to you. So, it was kind of a rude awakening to a different environment. But eventually Sharletta and some of the other girls we just, girls and guys, we sort of formed our own little support group, you know. And we'd get together. There was nothing in my house but, you know, a mattress and a table. So, we'd get together there because it was more room than anywhere else, anybody else's apartment.
Speaker 1: Now were there--
Speaker 2: We had fun.
Story_ID: 25720
Speaker 1: Was there any particular teacher there that mentored you at the University of Cincinnati?
Speaker 2: There was a lady there who I eventually got to know after being, getting in trouble with one of the other professors. This guy, who just, you know--I studied with the other students. I knew what I knew, I knew what they knew. But when I got my paper back, it had 'X's all over it, big 'X's all over the blue, the little blue test booklets. They were like, you just, you know, like everything on this page is wrong. And eventually he called me in his office one day, and he just had my withdrawal slips already filled out on his desk. And he withdrew me from his class. And I think I cried for like two days straight. And eventually when I, you know, dried my tears and got up from there, I said, no I'm not going to let him turn me around from this. So, I found someone else. They would talk to me about the mathematics education program, because you could not go through the math program without going through this guy. And so, I said okay, I like math, I like education. I'll do this, although I never really saw myself as a math teacher, you know. I liked education, and I knew I'd been in class all my life. So, I learned a lot of things there about math history and PeerJ and, you know, theory of teaching and learning and things like that. And Bloom's Taxonomy, and so forth, along with the mathematics that I was learning. And so, that sort of saved me there. And so, I was about to finish that program. I was headed home that December, the last fall. And I stopped by Virginia State [University]. I drove home, and I had to come through Petersburg anyway, so I stopped at Virginia State, and got there and Walter Elias was there. And so, I went in and I talked to him for awhile about, you know, the Cincinnati [Ohio] experience. And he said, "Well, what are you going to do after this?" And I said, "I don't know, Dr. Elias, I don't know what I'm going to do. Maybe teach for awhile or something." He says, "Well, there's an opening in our program at Kentucky State. Why don't you get in touch with Hattie McDaniels--Hattie Dunkett, there at Kentucky State [University] about this program?" And so, I followed his advice. And, you know, Kentucky State was right across the--I think it was about an hour, an hour and a half or so away from Cincinnati, in Frankfort. And she hired me there. And the salary was ten thousand dollars, but it was for nine months--ten thousand dollars, which was, you know, pretty sweet.
Speaker 1: So, you weren't tempted to go on to--after the University of Cincinnati experience, you weren't tempted to go on to a Ph.D. from there?
Speaker 2: There was no, I didn't see a path. I didn't see a--and I was pretty--and I had some tough experiences there. That was the first really tough educational experience I had, in terms of somebody telling me I didn't know what I knew, what I loved, really, you know, to do. And so, I think I needed to pull away for a minute.
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you about your project, your thesis project. What was it?
Speaker 2: At Cincinnati?
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: I was, I didn't do a thesis there. They had an option for an oral exam.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had an oral examination.
Speaker 1: Okay. But it was like a, like a major of mathematics, in mathematics education? Was that what it was?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which turns out now to be one of the best things that ever happened to me. (laughter). It really was. So, because it just kind of laid the foundation for all that I'm doing now, and giving forward, learning... Because what I do now is the integration of research into education, and the creation of environments where kids can learn to apply their skills to these complicated sciences, like polar science and cyber-infrastructure. And it's just, you know, mathematics education is the perfect foundation for that.
Story_ID: 25721
Speaker 1: So, Kentucky State [University]. Now, how did you like Kentucky State?
Speaker 2: Oh, Kentucky State was great.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a historically black college.
Speaker 2: HBCU, absolutely. I was back in, you know, the world that I understood very well. HBCU is kin to Norfolk State, Virginia State, you know. And I made some very nice friends there, lifelong friends, other faculty members who came in at the same time. It turned out to be really the TRIO Program that I was teaching in, which offered supportive services. So, they hired me to teach all of the mathematic classes, the TRIO students.
Speaker 1: What is TRIO?
Speaker 2: Trio is, was a federal program that was made up of Upward Bound, Talent Search and special services, I think it was. And so, I was in the special services which dealt with college students. A really great--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --great experience, teaching those kids.
Story_ID: 25722
Speaker 1: Okay. So, alright, Kentucky State [University]. Now, you got married while you were in Kentucky, right?
Speaker 2: I did. I had a friend named Valeria who was a counselor at Kentucky State. And she said, "Linda, we're going to..."--because we'd been living in Lexington [Kentucky] which is about a thirty, forty, minute drive from Frankfort [Kentucky], so we, I drove back and forth and commuted, a little commute. So she said, "We're going to be judges in this Miss Black Lexington pageant." And so I went with Valeria to do that. And after the contest we were talking to some of the other guys who were judging the contest. And we were supposed to meet up at the little pageant after-party, after the pageant at the community center. And so, I went there to meet, you know, some of the other judges, guys. As it turns out, Lee, who is my husband, his sister Pearline was helping to organize the pageant, and he was there helping her. So, he was, you know, trying to talk, trying to talk to me. And I was there looking for the other judges, so I didn't pay too much attention to what was going on at that time. But then about, oh, three or four months later, his friend Donnie brought him over to my house, and we started seeing each other then.
Speaker 1: Okay. So it was a long courtship, or--
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Two years, okay. So, you got married in what, '72' [1972]?
Speaker 2: I got married in '76' [1976].
Speaker 1: '76' [1976]. Okay, alright. I'm behind on the timeline. Okay, 1976.
Speaker 2: '76' [1976].
Story_ID: 25723
Speaker 1: We stayed in Lexington [Kentucky] through '79' [1979].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: '78' [1978], '79' [1979]. At that point my mother [Sarah Deloris Vaughn Bailey] started to, her health started to fail. And I was, you know, flying back and forth to help her. And she kind of said, this is not working. And so, my husband said, well let's just move to Virginia. So he was willing to, you know, pull up roots--because that was his home--and moved to Virginia with me. And we did that. We just packed up everything in this terrible snowstorm, awful snowstorm. And friends and family had come over and helped us pack up. And unfortunately, we packed up one room at a time, and the last room was the room that had our record collection in it. And there was no music in Lexington at all. You had to have your own record collection. By that time, the truck was full and the car was full, and folks were starting to leave. And so, all those records and everything went right in the trashcan. I'll never forget that. But we, you know, put the kid in the back seat and came on to Virginia.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, you had a job lined up at Norfolk State already?
Speaker 1: Not really.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, we were pretty much in that 105 Beechdale Road with--it was my father [Linwood Copeland Hayden], my mother and my brother, and the three of us--my husband Lee, my son Kuchumbi and I, in a little two-bedroom bungalow. I think it was a total of one, two, three, four rooms and a bathroom in there. Yep. I did a little substitute teaching in Portsmouth Public Schools. But, you see, that was January. And my mother actually passed away in May.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I was really glad that we made that move. You know, people told me, oh go back, you know. You're leaving your life. You're coming here, you have little going for you. But no, it was really important to us then, because she was, she was important to us. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay. So--
Speaker 1: So, we stayed there. And the job with Norfolk State came the next year.
Story_ID: 25724
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, let me see. It had to be '79' [1979]. I was at Norfolk State [University], I believe, two years. So, that was '78' [1978], '79' [1979].
Speaker 1: Norfolk State?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at Norfolk State, right. And then I started the job at Elizabeth City [State University] in 1980.
Speaker 1: Alright, okay. Well, Norfolk State--I mean did Elizabeth City offer you a better deal than Norfolk State?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Norfolk State for the most part was offering one-year contracts. And Elizabeth City really needed people. So, they were offering tenure track positions, and the money was $16,500. I think I was making about $12,000, $13,000 at Norfolk State. And so, Dr. Sohindar Sachdev was the chair of the department here. And--
Speaker 1: What was his name again?
Speaker 2: Sohindar Sachdev.
Speaker 1: Now is he, was he East Indian, or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us then because--
Speaker 2: S-O-H-I-N-D-A-R, S-A-C-H-D-E-V.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, it meant driving down here every day, because we were still in Portsmouth [Virginia]. So, we put the kid in the back seat and came down.
Speaker 1: So that's about a thirty five mile drive?
Speaker 2: It's forty.
Speaker 1: forty?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And 80 round trip so, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, what did you think of Elizabeth City State?
Speaker 2: Well, by that time, I liked teaching. And I liked being again on a HBCU campus. I enjoyed the students very much. I was teaching mathematics, because there was no computer science course at that time. Eventually, ECSU was approved by the state to get a, to give a degree in computer science. But they approved the degree, but they didn't give any resources, as such. No computers, no faculty, none of that came with it. Just, you can offer this degree in computer science. So, Dr. Jenkins, who was the chancellor at that time, asked me if I would go back and get a graduate degree in computer science, because they needed someone with a degree in that area. And living in Portsmouth [Virginia], I was very close to ODU [Old Dominion University]. In fact, I'd actually taken a course or two at ODU in computer science. And so he saw that, and he gave me a sabbatical, a one-year sabbatical to go and get the master's in computer science. It was what I did, at Old Dominion University.
Speaker 1: Okay. So did that, you got paid at the same time that you were going to school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Alright. So, well, what were some of the, what's the, I guess, the core of what you learned about computer science? And was it tough to do?
Speaker 2: It was interesting to me. I had to take-- because it was a new field, I had to start off taking a couple of undergraduate classes in Pascal. And I learned about data structure and data communications and link lists. That was interesting. They had--Dr. Wild and Dr. Wahab, had a little lab that they--and in there they had a UNIX machine. It was a little mini--it wasn't, what did they call it? It was different from anything I'd ever seen. It wasn't, it was, you know, a mini computer, as such. And we had to restart it often, but we learned to program in not just Pascal, but also in UNIX. And there was a different culture there too, because there were a lot of, there weren't many African-Americans at all. It was just me, as a matter of fact. But I didn't have any problems because--making friends there--because I was very thorough in what I did and I liked--I could type, and a lot of the folks couldn't (laughter). And so, you know, I had my little, I had something to contribute to the group. And then people, if you've got something to contribute, they'll invite you in. So, we used to spend a lot of time there at night. I loved going through those data structures. And the professors would be there, too.  So that was the first time that--no, I wouldn't say the first time--well, the first time since Virginia State, when I really learned to, you know, live in the labs again. Because we didn't do that at Cincinnati. And I'm a big, kind of lab bunny. I like that, at night.
Story_ID: 25725
Speaker 1: So, this gives you a background in computer science. So, you take that back to--
Speaker 2: Back to Elizabeth City [State University].
Speaker 1: Elizabeth City, okay.
Speaker 2: And I had a responsibility for teaching those computer science classes. I didn't have a computer, and eventually the state gave us a connection to their mainframe. And so, and that was in the basement of Johnson Hall. They put a few terminals in there.
Speaker 1: I have a note about Joan Sterling Langdon.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Joan.
Speaker 1: Was that one of your--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --fellow students?
Speaker 2: Joan was at, Joan was at Old Dominion [University] with me. And like, there weren't many of us, but she and I were pretty much it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she taught at Hampton [University] at the time. Now, actually there was a connection with North Carolina A&T [University], and they supported--that was while I was at Norfolk State [University]--they gave us a little grant to come to North Carolina A&T and study for a few weeks with them there. And Joan, I remember we got off the plane together. I didn't know her before then. And she had just had twins. And so she, and she had stumped her toe. So, there she got off the plane with a baby in each arm, hopping, (laughter) and, you know, my heart just went out to her. And so, from that point on we've just been friends, and we worked our way through that workshop together and took some classes together at ODU. And so, we, you know, it just--forged a bond that took us right through our Ph.D. at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, now, you started working on your Ph.D. almost immediately, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: '85' [1985].
Speaker 1: You started working on it in '85' [1985]?
Speaker 2: '85' [1985].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was '85' [1985].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: '84' [1984], '85' [1985], something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, that's about a year, you're back about a year before you--
Speaker 2: Back about a year, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we, but we knew, you know, she was teaching at Hampton and I was teaching at Elizabeth City [State University]. You've got to have a Ph.D. if you're going to maintain a university position. And so, we were in the meantime looking for an opportunity to go get a degree. We both got kids, you know, and so it's not that easy, to just pull up and go. So she, well we were looking for a place where we could get a little, some money. We didn't need a lot, because we both, you know, wanted this to happen, but--
Speaker 1: Now I take it you weren't still married at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You were? Okay, alright, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We're married now thirty eight years.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: We're still together. So, Joan was not married at the time, but I was still married. And so she eventually heard about this program at American University and--oh, Mary Gray was in the math department there. And Dr.--oh, what's her name? I can't forget this lady. I'll have to stop. It'll come to me in just a minute. She had a grant to give Patricia Robert Harris Fellowships. And so, Joan heard about it, and she called me and she said "Linda..."--it was early in the morning--she called. But we, but we, you know, we talked all the time. And so she said, "Linda, I think this is going to work for us..." So preliminary mathematics education. "...and we can go there and then they'll give us $375 a month to live off of, and pay our tuition." And so, I said "Well, okay, Joan." And I didn't think much of it. In fact I think I went, went on back to sleep. But we kept talking about it, and eventually we just said, we got to--you know, life has a way of, you know, making you uncomfortable in some other situation. So, you just do what you got to do, and we did, and went up there. We, you know, packed up the kids, and my husband was working at the, in Norfolk at the shipyard over there. And he decided to go with us. And so, he gave up his job and we cashed in insurance policies. We'd just bought a new house. And so, we found somebody to rent the house. And my car had just died, so we bought a little station wagon, Volvo station wagon. It was really raggedy, but we bought it anyway. And it got us up to [Washington] D.C., and died about three months later (laughter), but... Yeah, so we just went up there, went for it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And we had enough to make it for the first, from September to January. And we said well, we don't know. If nothing breaks in January, I may have to go back to Virginia State, to Elizabeth City and work. But in January his check came for the retirement fund he had cashed in, and that allowed us to make it until May.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I said well, if nothing breaks in May, we may have to pack up and go back. And in May they hired me to, at American, to teach, as an instructor. And that gave me a health insurance plan as well. That was really nice, you know. So we were able to stay.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, though you didn't know what the outcome was going to be, by persistence you were able to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, just had to go for it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Step out on faith. That'll take you a long way, if you learn to step out on faith.
Story_ID: 25726
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about Mary Gray. I hear, I mean, I was reading that she was a good role model and helpful.
Speaker 2: And a tough cookie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (laughter). Tough as nails.
Speaker 1: Now this is a white woman, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But an activist. Not only was she a Ph.D. in math and statistics, but she was a lawyer, and she had a law degree as well. And together with her friend--and I have to remember this lady's name before this interview is over--but they were determined to make a difference in the quality of women and minorities in mathematics. And she actually mentored quite a few of us. We also met Martha Brown there. And Linda Lewis was there. Linda came a little after us, but she was in the loop as well. A number of people came under Mary Gray. But she was a no-nonsense professor. If you did your work, you were fine with her. But if you, but you know, you had to perform, and so we just did.
Speaker 1: So, did your husband help you balance your workload and everything, you know?
Speaker 2: He worked while we were there in the apartment. Actually, the apartment hired him to work as a janitor to kind of offset the rent a little bit, because we were only getting $375, and the rent was $600 (laughter) a month. And so, he was also enrolled at UDC [University of the District of Columbia] at the time, in business. Fortunately--unfortunately, he was, the business campus was downtown. So, even though we only lived a few blocks from Van Ness, he still had to take the subway down to get to his classes at UDC. So, he was studying for his degree in business--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the time.
Speaker 1: Alright. So, but you had the one son, right?
Speaker 2: My son--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --running around [Washington] D.C., and that was tough, too, keeping an eye on him.
Speaker 1: How old was he at that time?
Speaker 2: He was elementary school age. Let's see. So, I'd say Kuchumbi was seven, eight.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Alright. So, everybody's in school.
Speaker 2: Everybody was in school. (laughter). And our friend's daughter came up and lived with us, too. And she was in school. She was at UDC as well, for awhile there.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, did people's schedules kind of make it so somebody was around you, when your son was around?
Speaker 2: There were times when, you know, I remember feeling really isolated and wanting to have, you know, a parent or somebody, grandmother or somebody, that would help him there. And I do remember sitting in the middle of the floor crying one day about that very issue. But it all worked out, fortunately. We found friends to help. And when Yolanda came up, that helped even more.
Story_ID: 25727
Speaker 1: Now, well, tell us about your Ph.D. dissertation. What did you--your dissertation was entitled the 'Impact of an Intervention Program for High Ability Minority Students on Rates of High School Graduation, College Enrollment, and Choice of a Quantitative Major.'
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Now, this is an education Ph.D., right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was fate, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of the jobs I had other than teaching at American [University] was working at the Saturday Academy at UDC [University of the District of Columbia] just down the street. And I taught mathematics courses on Saturday. And--
Speaker 1: Now, Saturday Academy, was that for grade school kids, or for--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was for high school and middle school kids in the District of Columbia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but he was having such an impact on those kids. You know, in [Washington] D.C. even the brightest kids had only a fifty percent chance of graduating from high school. And so, this program was able to make a difference for those kids. And so, I, you know, at that point, I wanted to know what components were really working, you know. I had seen, I was a product of intervention programs--so, those programs at Norcom [I.C. Norcom High School] in the afternoon and those programs at Norfolk State during the summer, the science fairs at Hampton [University]. So intervention was something I, you know, felt very comfortable with. But, and, but this guy was having a serious impact right in the District, which had a significant minority population, and these really bright kids, who were just kind of going down the tubes. And so, Mary [Gray] allowed, she approved my study of that program, and that's what I did. And the head of the program was really excited, because he needed some formal documentation of what he was doing. And a lot of times those grants you get don't have money to pay an evaluator. And so, essentially what I did was to perform an evaluation of his program. I found some really exciting things, too.
Speaker 1: Okay, like what?
Speaker 2: Well, his impact on males was even more significant than females. And I think that was because primarily the hands-on nature of the experience he was giving them. He was spending time in the classroom, not just in the classroom, but in the laboratory, running experiments. They were figuring circuit boards, designing circuit boards. So, it wasn't just, you know, classroom stuff. They were, they were active, it was active, actively engaged in those science experiments. And I realized that that's a lot of what had caught me too, my attention too, back when I was in high school. It was those, those after school interactions where we were actively putting together our science projects. We were cutting glass and growing all sorts of fungus (laughter) bacteria and things. That was really, you know, exciting to me. So, what I found was that I was learning from Cincinnati on, how to construct these learning environments that challenge our African-American students in particular. And all of that eventually came together here at Elizabeth City [State university].
Speaker 1: Now, you graduated in 1988, I guess? Is that it, or '89' [1989]?
Speaker 2: '88' [1988]. I think we, the degree was conferred in January of '89' [1989].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25728
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, you came back to Elizabeth City State [University] in 1989--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. Houston came and got me.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did he?
Speaker 2: Yes. (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, Dr. Houston came to get you, huh?
Speaker 2: He came and got me. Because I had taken a job at UDC [University of the District of Columbia] to give, you know, some other people around me time to finish up. But Dr. Houston said, "Are you coming back?" "You got to come back." (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, okay. So, Dr. Houston went and got you--
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: And brought you back. And so, now, things--now he had, I think he came after you left for your sabbatical, right? He showed up, and you said just as you left--you were telling us a little while ago--
Speaker 2: He came here, yeah, yeah. But he came in, not in the department. He came in as an administrator.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay. Well, and a, yeah, as an administrator of--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah. A professor--
Speaker 2: Vice chancellor of Academic Affairs, I think.
Speaker 1: Right. But he built the first computer science lab here, right?
Speaker 2: He did. He brought the first UNIX machine in here.
Speaker 1: Right. And so, you're coming fresh from being a professor of computer science at the University of the District of Columbia--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --when you come here. And so, what did you all get together to do?
Speaker 2: Wow. We turned Lester Hall into our playground, and our research labs were just jumping. I mean we, he bought the first UNIX machine, he bought a Next machine. And then I got a grant with the Navy, and was able to buy enough to put another whole lab of UNIX machines in, and to provide scholarships for some students. And so, it was just, it was real exciting in Lester Hall. The students came in. They were there early in the morning and late at night. It was just the kind of creative environment that you wanted to have on a college campus. I mean, security hated us. You know, they--(laughter)--
Story_ID: 25729
Speaker 1: So, you said that the UNIX machines only lasted a short period of time--
Speaker 2: The Next.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Next is a brand name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For a short period of time. They went out of business, that's what they did. But by that time, we were already bitten by the bug. The UNIX machines were what we, I cut my teeth on at Old Dominion [University]. And so, I couldn't wait to work with those students on those operating systems. And as it turns out, that's what really made us different. Because everybody else was using PC's. But the machines that the people who designed PC's, the people who, you know, were going to create the next Microsoft, whatever, they were UNIX programmers. The scientists wanted a UNIX machine. Either that, or they wanted a Macintosh. And they'd take a little bitty Mac, little bitty Mac, and put a big old screen on it, and that's what they would work on. If you went to Langley [Research Center, NASA], if you saw a PC at that time, it was on a secretary's desk. Because all the scientists either had UNIX boxes or they had the Macintosh. If they had a PC, then it was running a UNIX operating system.
Speaker 1: What was the difference between the machines, in terms of--
Speaker 2: Well, because you had access to the lower level functions of the machine. You could basically make it do what you wanted it to do. You could program it in assembly language, or in Linux now. We program in Linux. UNIX wasn't a language that you could program. So, you had control at the very basic level of the machine, as opposed to running a program, okay, which you would--basically, you're using something that somebody else set up for you.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you program UNIX yourself--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: To do what you want it to do?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And, which would mean that probably really it's not very likely that anybody would be able to, you know, break into it, or to--[unintelligible, simultaneous talk]
Speaker 2: That wasn't a big issue then. (laughter). That really wasn't a big issue. But what it did allow us to do was to create like the very first firewall on campus--was created in our laboratory.
Speaker 1: The first?
Speaker 2: Firewall.
Speaker 1: Firewall, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Was created in our laboratory. The very--
Speaker 1: You mean the first firewall, ever?
Speaker 2: Here, on this campus, no, we was, you know. But we went out, and we learned and we brought it back here, and the folks here just had not heard anything about that. The very first--in fact the University website, "www", that EC issued at EDU, that was created in our laboratory using my undergraduate student researchers. We created faculty web pages, department web pages, and we--the server that housed all of that was on a UNIX machine. You needed a UNIX box to house that then, you did. The very first, let's see, the very first wireless network was set up down there on this campus in Lester Hall. All the IT managers really hated us. (laughter). They would meet me in the parking lot and have some very strong words for me at that time. "You know, you're doing this to our network." But anyway, nevertheless it was just a wonderful opportunity for students to learn and create, and a lot of proud things. In fact, my son and I were sitting down this morning as we were going through some of the pictures. And we were talking about all the wonderful things that we were doing, and got to do during that time, as a matter of fact.
Story_ID: 25730
Speaker 1: I guess in 19--, was it also in 1989 that you started working with NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]?
Speaker 2: In '89' [1989], before I came back here, George Edmonds was on the faculty. And he had gotten his Ph.D. at Old Dominion University, in mathematics. And Dr. Edmonds asked me to go in on a, an award, a grant with him, which we did. We wrote--it wasn't NASA, it was Navy, I believe. I believe it was Navy.
Speaker 1: Was this the Office of Naval Research?
Speaker 2: Office of Naval Research, right. And we did not get that award. But at the same time, we had partnered with Hampton [University] on their grant. And they got their award. And we had just said that we would make sure that our students were a part of the summer program that they were having in the classroom. So, we did that. And in doing that with Hampton, I was exposed to, our students would go there during the summer and they'd come back to ECSU [Elizabeth City State University], and they really didn't have anything to work on, because that was before any of the computers started coming. They really didn't have anything to work on, and so I talked to one of the program managers that was there doing a review, an annual review. And I told him that we needed some resources at ECSU. And he went back and he carved out, I think it was $29,000 out of his department budget, Dr. van Tilborg with the Navy, Andre van Tilborg. And he did that for about two or three years in a row. He gave me $29,000, $33,000, and $35,000. And we bought Macintosh computers, set up laboratories with that. And I also met a gentleman named Charles Luther, who turned out to be a very big influence over this university, a very big friend to this university, by going to Hampton for both the review of their program, and participating in their process by which they select fellowship recipients, through another grant they had. And so when we came--after about three years of working with Andre, he said, "I want you to apply for this solicitation", which I did. And that was the first one million dollar grant that we got.
Speaker 1: About what year was that?
Speaker 2: I believe that was in '93' [1993], '94' [1994], something like that. I could look it up for you.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now this is through the Office of Naval--
Speaker 2: This is O&R.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Office of Naval Research, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, Navy was really the first investor in this, what we've got going now in our research efforts here at the university. And, you know, lots of scholarships, so I was able to bring in more students to the program, support them during the academic year, feed them during our research training service seminars. Because we had research training seminars on every Tuesday and every Thursday from 5:00 until. And so, they couldn't go to dinner, so we'd have to provide some food for them. And we did that. And to this day, we still have research training seminars every Tuesday and every Thursday, from 5:00 until. And we formed groups for the students. So, one faculty member would have a team of four or five students. Usually, during the fall semester we would work with the freshmen to make sure they understood the essentials of how to work in the lab, you know. They'd get comfortable with the platforms, with the software, with the tools we would use. And then they'd start their research projects in the spring for the faculty. And we'd finish up about, oh, mid-April or so. And then during the summer we would either have those students, or other students come in and join us. At that time I was working primarily with ECSU students, and I'd bring in high school students from Norcom, like Jamie Powell and Kuchumbi and Lakesha Mundon, and some more students. They'd get in the car and they'd drive up here and meet us at night. And it was just one big, you know, big happy research environment on those Tuesday and Thursday nights. Around '95' [1995], NASA put out a solicitation for a network resources and training center. I guess it was '94' [1994]. The solicitation came out in '93' [1993], '94' [1994]--so.  And, we actually won one of the, we were awarded one of those grants. And that was, that established us a network resource and training site for NASA.
Speaker 1: So this is 19--
Speaker 2: '95' [1995], I believe.
Speaker 1: '95' [1995]?
Speaker 2: I believe was the first NASA grant.
Story_ID: 25731
Speaker 1: Now what does the NSF [National Science Foundation] UFE--
Speaker 2: UFR? Undergraduate Research Experience?
Speaker 1: Undergraduate--
Speaker 2: REU?
Speaker 1: --Faculty Enhancement Program.
Speaker 2: Oh, right. I mean, I was going to Colgate University during the summertime. I was going to Michigan State to keep my skills up.
Speaker 1: That was to enrich your--
Speaker 2: That was to enrich me, right.
Speaker 1: --your ability to keep, you know, teaching.
Speaker 2: Exactly, uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's where I was studying parallel processing, at Colgate. And I would come right back and teach it to them. So, as soon I finished that parallel processing course, I came back and set up a parallel processing team (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Now, parallel processing, explain what parallel processing is.
Speaker 2: Parallel processing allows you to break a problem into parts, and you have different processors working on different parts of the problem at the same time, in parallel. And then they come back together again.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, instead of the whole system trying to--
Speaker 2: One--
Speaker 1: --solve each problem at a time--
Speaker 2: Right. Instead of--right, one processor sequentially solving--you would farm out parts of the problem to different processors.
Speaker 1: Then they'd come--
Speaker 2: Then they'd come back together again, right. And so, we would... Now, I remember the parallel processing team, one summer they got a hold of my notebook computer. And you know, they were all into the operating system then, because they knew how to program at that low level. And they, they did some--so, I turned on my machine one day and on comes this--[singing]: "parallel processing, we rock, da da da." (laughter). Boy, those guys, they were always, you know, they were just kind of curious. (laughter). And that's the way I loved them. That's just the way I wanted them to be. But they were full of surprises, they really were.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, these are your students having a good time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 25732
Speaker 1: So, in 1994, you got a million dollars from the Office of Naval Research. And then NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], the first NASA grant, was in '95' [1995]?
Speaker 2: '95' [1995]. And NASA, one thing NASA did was-- now, Navy put in some essential infrastructure, in terms of computers. Because up to that point we were teaching computer science with no computers--minimal, minimal computers. And so, the Navy allowed us to put, you know, computers in the lab that the students could put their hands on and could work with, and on my desk. But NASA allowed us to impact the community. They assigned us the region of North Carolina and Virginia. Northeast of North Carolina and southeast of Virginia were the regions. And our focus was to help these under-represented communities and institutions within that area to get connected to, you know...  We were to build that off-ramp from this information super highway into their neighborhoods. And it was very clear, the mandate, what we were supposed to do. And we were ready to do that. And so we, we had university partners like Norfolk State [University], Virginia State [University]--let's see, we also worked with Bennett College, and there were some other institutions other than...  Those were our university partners. Oh, Pembroke was also a part of that. And then we had a series of K-12 schools that we partnered with. And, you know, these schools had no internet access for the most part. So, they were in Portsmouth [Virginia] and they were around here in Halifax County. We pulled all these, this consortium together.  And in addition to that, we had community centers, we had churches in our consortium, and just made a really big effort to get these schools connected. And that meant going into these schools, like Douglas Park Elementary School and pulling the internet cables through there. I can't tell you how many drill bits we wore out on those cinder block walls in Douglas Park Elementary School. It meant bringing the community together around them, and having them help us. And so, we'd held Net Day operations for the schools. And those were nights when we'd bring in teachers and parents and we'd teach them how to build the cables that we needed. We'd give them these big rolls of wire and the end pieces, and a set of crimping tools. And they actually built the cables. And then we set a date, and we'd come back and we'd drill the holes. We'd pull the ceiling tiles down and we'd run the cable. So, we didn't connect the whole school, but when we finished there was a library, there were two or three classrooms that had internet access. And we also had some funds to pay their providers, their service providers, if the school district didn't have that cable bill for the schools. And so, many, many elementary schools, like Emily Spong Elementary, Douglas Park Elementary, all in Halifax. I sent my folks out to places in Halifax, but they said they didn't think they were coming back (laughter). We're so remote, you know. But the other thing is, they didn't have computers, and so we faced that task also.
Speaker 1: So, this was addressed to, which grant was this?
Speaker 2: NASA.
Speaker 1: NASA, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh huh. And so--
Speaker 1: And it was called, do you remember the full name of--?
Speaker 2: Network Resources and Training Site.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And so, we would take a U-Haul van, we'd get the biggest U-Haul van we could get, and we'd drive it up to Langley [Research Center], or we'd drive it to [Washington] D.C., to Goddard, or we'd drive it to the mapping agency in Washington. And we'd load it up with equipment, used equipment. And then we'd bring it back here. And we rented one of those storage facilities off-campus where you just, where people store their furniture and stuff, you know. And we would bring equipment into the labs and invite the parents and the school administrators, or whatever, to come in. And we'd show them how to refurbish computers. So, we'd buy new hard drives and pull hard drives out of old computers and we'd take two or three, and we'd make one. But when we were finished, we'd have, say, sixteen computers with monitors, and we'd set up labs in the community centers and in the churches and in the schools. And once they had the hardware, they had to know what to do with it. So, we'd have to go there, and we'd hold training sessions with them. And this was a really big effort, but we, you know, the students were there to help, and the staff was there to help. And everybody wanted it to happen, and it did. So, at that level, the community center and the elementary level, we were successful in getting many, many schools on. Right here on River Road, we were able to connect three or four classrooms with a grant for five thousand dollars--for five hundred dollars--that we gave to the school, and help from our engineers and our students. We were able to get those couple of classes on the internet. With the colleges, they needed something different. Virginia State needed a router and hubs. Modabas (ph.) and Dr. Elias had initially put in a couple of labs, but they had, you know, a lot of traffic on the lab, on their network. And so, he had to, we bought the new hub for them and installed that hub. For places like Bennett College, we had to do something very similar. So, we were able to get them get their first routers on campus and get those labs up. They targeted the labs. We got those labs going. At Norfolk State, it was the physics department. And we were able to help them to support their UNIX lab there in the physics department. So, it, and Pembroke, we had to, you know, we went down and there and helped them install equipment. And Hampton was also one of the institutions that we were supporting, primarily through student support there, though.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: I like that giving forward started right there. Love it.
Story_ID: 25733
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about working with NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]. Is this the, is this part of the--
Speaker 2: NOAA, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: NOAA, how did that work? Okay.
Speaker 1: It's the National Oceanic and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Atmospheric Association.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes. NOAA had a program called EPP, Educational Partnership Program. And at that time--I'm trying to figure out how I hooked up with Dr.--with them. There was a gentleman from NOAA who came down and worked with us, Ambrose Gerald. I took a team of students up to NOAA, because they had a wonderful library up there in Woods Hole. And they--resources we couldn't get, articles we couldn't find, they had there. And so we, Ambrose Gerald hosted us, one of the teams of students that we had for a couple of days there. And I met some other people there, too. And they, that started the connection with NOAA. It started with Dr. Gerald. And from there, we were able to get, they helped me write this grant for the EPP Program which was a new program that NOAA had just started, aimed at minority institutions. And we partnered with the facility in Beaufort. And that was an internship program, so we were able to have teams of students go down there during the summer and work with their scientists, essentially.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now in 1997, here's an interesting project with the University of Cairo [Egypt]. Now, what was that about?
Speaker 2: That was, I can't think of how I met Dr. Atala. How did I meet Dr. Atala? The--we were doing some work with multi-media, one of the teams. We were doing a lot of work with multi-media at that time, because we were generating web pages and, you know, web service, and so forth. So, the project with Cairo was with actually the campus in Fayoum [Egypt]. And he was a physics professor there, and he was interested--there are a tremendous number of physics majors, and he really wasn't able to give his students the one-on-one attention that they needed in a lot of cases. So, he was interested in putting a lot of the lessons on a media that they could access outside of the classroom. And so, he wanted them to be interactive. And so we worked together to build interactive physics lessons, starting with the thermal dynamics, and there were some mechanics. And that was essentially what the project involved, was the generation of those lessons. So, he came here and he studied with us for a while, and we helped him to design the lessons using authorware. And then--Jeff Woods. I had a multi-media personal staff by then, because NASA [National Atmospheric and Space Administration] required us to maintain a website. And so, they paid for me to have a multi-media person. And Jeff Woods was very, he contributed a lot to that project. Jeff had actually retired from the Coast Guard base. He had some health issues, and he came to us for some training on multi-media, and he kind of just got sucked into, (laughter) you know, what was going on at Lester Hall.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: And he's still here to this day. He is, he didn't have a B.S. degree, so we supported him to get his B.S. here at the institution, and then we also gave him a fellowship and he got his master's. So, now he has a master's degree and he serves as our web master.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: He had a lot of skill though, when he came to us.
Speaker 1: Do your students often come back and work at the institution?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. In fact, if you go over to the IT department, you'll find quite a few of our folks, including my son, who is the network manager over there now.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now, your son has, his name appears on some of your papers as a co-author?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 25734
Speaker 1: So, tell us about the, I don't know what year this happened, but the Eastern North Carolina Chapter of the Geosciences Remote Sensing Society was created here.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. That was one of the influences of Mr. Charles Luther that I told you about at Hampton, I met there. What I didn't know was, he worked with Navy in the remote sensing division. And they studied sea ice, using satellite imagery. And so, working with NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], I had started to experiment with satellite imagery, and had actually gotten a remote receiving device. And I had a team of students, and we crawled up on the top of Lester Hall and installed it. And we were receiving data from NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], from Navy, and we were, from--excuse me, it was a NOAA satellite, but we were only getting it two or three hours a day, very limited. But we took what we had, and we were trying to distribute it to some public schools in the area. So, Mr. Luther called me one day and he said, "You know, what are you doing with satellite imagery?" And I told him. And he said, "I'm surprised you aren't doing more." So, I said, "Well, we want to do more, but we don't have the receiving capability." And so, I went to one of the GRSS meetings in Hawaii and made a report on what we were doing. What I didn't know at the time was that he was the assistant--I don't know--vice president of IEEEGRSS, which meant that he was about to become president of that society. And so while there--we had a little encounter while we were at Hampton [University]. And he was, he came in looking, with fellowship money, looking for people to give the fellowship to in remote sensing. And he never found, he didn't find--I think he found one. And we were looking at stacks of applications, great applications, from 130 students, and we only had like twelve fellowships to give. And he was, you know, not finding what he was looking for there. So, I told him, I said, "You know, you have to be proactive in terms of helping these students create the resume that you're looking for. You can't just assume that these students are going to magically appear, in remote sensing. It's not going to happen." So, at that conference in Hawaii, he said "Linda, don't leave here without talking to me." And so, when I--I was a little afraid, really, because of the way we'd--our last conversation was I was kind of scolding him for that. But he said, "I'm interested in setting up a program that will outreach the students in the area of remote sensing." And so, he talked me through it, and then he gave me $58,000 to run a summer program in remote sensing. Now, that was my initial encounter with IEEE.
Story_ID: 25735
Speaker 1: So, your research associates are your students then, you know.
Speaker 2: For the most part. That was what we were working with, were the students. And we got a lot accomplished with those students, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay. And just, so you all used, once again, just the remote sensing. The way you use it is to use, well--
Speaker 2: Okay. So, Mr. Luther was really at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]. You know, it happened at NASA. It was really the beginning of the remote sensing research community here at Elizabeth City [State University]. So, he kept encouraging me to do more with what I had, and was providing some funding. He said he was interested in a program that was remote sensing based, satellite imagery. He wanted also to engage students from other universities, because just like Elizabeth City, there were a number of HBCU's out there that had very little research, in terms of research going on. And so, he challenged me to find students from other universities to come in during the summer, where up to that point, I was primarily working with students from Elizabeth City. This would be for institutions all over. So, that was, that allowed me to build on that relationship that I developed through the NASA grant with these institutions. Norfolk State [University], people knew me there, you know. We were still working with them and supporting their effort. Virginia State [University]--
Speaker 1: And Bennett [College]-
Speaker 2: Spelman [College]--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Bennett, uh huh, all those schools. And so, I'd just tell them, find me a couple of students during the summer, and I'll bring them up here to work with me. So, these experiences were all building to this wonderful crescendo. But Mr. Luther continued to challenge us and continued to provide us the funds that we needed, since he saw this program started to produce the kind of talent that he was looking for. And so, eventually he introduced me to Buzz Bernstein, who was the head of Seaspace. Now, Seaspace is a leading, a world leader in providing satellite remote sensing capabilities.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: S-E-A-S-P-A-C-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When you see those white domes on the top of buildings and ships, those are, that's Seaspace equipment for the most part, that's Seaspace equipment. And so, Buzz came down and we forged a relationship. And he helped me to acquire an L-Band receiving station, which received the data from several NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] satellites from Seaspace. And that's on the top of Dixon Hall right now. Now, Buzz didn't stay with Seaspace long, unfortunately. But we had our dish, and we kept it going. And I had to, you know, use money from the NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] and the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] funds that I was getting, to maintain a maintenance contract on it. But we had that satellite data, and we had a relationship with Goddard that allowed us to have a C-width encryption key so we could get the data, encrypted data. And the GRSS [Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society] chapter of IEEE [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers] came in around that time. We, Mr. Luther again encouraged us to set up a chapter. There were at that time no GRSS chapters, Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society chapters, on any minority-serving institution in the world. And under his presidency--and I remember very, we were very proud, he announced that Elizabeth City State University had established a chapter, the first chapter of IEEEGRSS on our campus. We had the data, we had the facility. We were doing it, we were actually doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that was exciting.
Story_ID: 25736
Speaker 1: Now, in 2002, you became the director of the Center for Excellence in Remote Sensing Education and Research.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: For CERSER, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: CERSER started off as a proposal. It was a proposal that I wrote to NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]. They had a solicitation for Centers of Excellence. And the thing is, they wanted the centers to be in institutions where there were, where there was a significant amount of graduate work going on. And we had just been approved for a master's degree program in mathematics, but it didn't start until September. The proposals were due in May or spring. And so, I explained that in the proposal, but it wasn't strong enough to compete with schools like, you know, schools that already had programs well-established. And I tried it one more time with another solicitation for a center, the Center of Excellence for Remote Sensing Education and Research. Although there was a lot of research going on here, there was a lot of integration of that research into education, into these K-12 schools and these other universities, but we didn't have the master's and Ph.D. level programs they were looking for. And so they rejected my proposal. And eventually, I just said, you know what, this idea is bigger than any one proposal. We need to do this, we just need to do this. And so, I was able to get the facility on campus-some--but not all that I needed, but I got some. And over the course of those other small grants--I've been--grants with Navy and NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]--I've been accumulating some indirect costs funds and just kind of using, saving them. And I said this is a good purpose. And so, we used those funds to buy the carpeting and the furniture and the video equipment, and you know, and just set it up. So, we just did it, and we established that center. And you know, Mr. Luther was encouraging me the whole way. And that's how the Center of Excellence in Remote Sensing Education and Research came about. It was first, two proposals that were rejected. And under that umbrella, we are able to engage partnerships that are focused on coastal, marine, and polar science programs. And those partnerships are both educational and research based. Under the umbrella of CERSER there are a number of programs now that operate, and a lot of good research going on in CERSER.
Story_ID: 25737
Speaker 1: So in--all these efforts kind of, are recognized in 2003 when you're awarded the 2003 Presidential Award for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Engineering Mentoring by the National Science Foundation.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's exciting. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is. Everybody doesn't just get this, so.
Speaker 2: No, not everybody gets that. Eight people got it that year. I think there were two or three in the State of North Carolina that have it. And a lot of it grew out of our integration of research into education efforts with these K-12 schools, with these other universities. And that's what the application was based on, for the most part. And in fact by that time, we were engaged in not just ECSU [Elizabeth City State University] students, but students from other MSI's--Minority Serving Institutions--community center students--thousands of students were coming through here. It was just growing to no end. I said God must like what we're doing with these students because he keeps sending them. (laughter). He just keeps sending them. Our students were--with the research experiences based on top of their classroom experiences, they were going on to graduate school. And they were successful in completing those graduate schools. Our students were being sought after, and you know, people were kind of just beating a path to our door. And the partnerships were coming, they were coming very strong. So, that's what that was based on, was the tremendous number of students that we had engaged in remote sensing and computer science research.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, in 2005, the NSF [National Science Foundation] announced that the establishment of a multi-million dollar research center at the University of Kansas, called the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets.
Speaker 2: Of ice sheets, yeah. Let me say one more thing about that Presidential Award.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mary Gray was a Presidential Awardee. And she invited me to go with her to her induction ceremony, by the way. And I was so proud to be just invited, to be a part of that. And then she looked at me and she said, "You're going to do this, also." And so, I really am a legacy when it comes to this Presidential Award. I'm second generation under, with her. Because she's continued to guide me. She said, "Don't do it this year, wait two years." And she kept following, you know, my work, and she said, "Now is the time for you to apply." And we did, and got it.
Story_ID: 25738
Speaker 1: So now you're asking me about the--
Speaker 2: CReSIS [Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets], I guess.
Speaker 1: CReSIS, yes. So working with IEEEGRSS [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering-Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society], GRSS, it took me to Australia to one of their meetings. I was given a paper. And I met, again through Mr. Luther, Dr. Prasad Gourineni. And he said, "You two should work together." And it was the first time I'd ever met Prasad, but we--
Speaker 2: Can you spell his name for us? I hate to, you know, stop you-
Speaker 1: P-R-A-S-A-D.
Speaker 2: Prasad Gourineni, that's the last name?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll give you that one.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay. And so, we agreed that we would work together. So, finally this opportunity comes like two years later. So, where he--now Prasad is an engineer at the University of Kansas. And he develops radars. And he's been applying his knowledge of radars to investigating the thinning of the ice sheets in Antarctica. So, this project, CReSIS, allows us to build the radars that can withstand those extreme conditions, to also design the unmanned aerial vehicles that are used to fly these lines, and to design the robots who will also take these sensors out on the ice. And to try to visualize what the bottom of those ice sheets like, what the beds look like. How--and measure thickness and thinning, and to really characterize those ice sheets. As a part of that center, that big grant, you had to have a significant integration of research into education component. You couldn't just do the science. NSF [National Science Foundation] was emphatic about that. So Prasad came and got me. And he said, "I want you to design this integration research and education component." Well, I knew just enough about satellite imagery to understand what they were doing. I didn't know anything about polar science, but I understood the satellite imagery piece of it, and something about the radars. And so, we did, we wrote the grant and we were, we won the award. I mean, there were other institutions involved as well. Ohio State [University], Penn State [Pennsylvania State University] which did a lot of the seismic activities, and Maine, the University of Maine was involved. It did a lot of the visualization work. And for five years, we worked together on that project. And we were so successful in doing that, that they re-funded us for another five years. But it had to have a different focus. I mean, the radars were getting so good that the data was coming in, in tremendous amounts, so much so that the visualization was lagging. You know, the ability to crunch all those numbers and to generate the images of the beds was just, it was, it wasn't happening fast enough. And so, we had to shift our focus. And in doing so, for the second five years, we also restructured the partnership. Ohio State stepped out. Maine stepped out. The University of Washington came in, the experts in visualization. And the partnership that I had with the university, with Indiana University, also proved critical there. We'd done a little work together.
Speaker 2: Now that was quite a mix of schools. I mean, you got like mixed schools like Kansas, the Ohio State and Penn State and--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --then you got like the Haskell Indian Nations and--
Speaker 1: Yeah. Haskell was in for the first five years and then they had to step out for the second five.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But they're, we still try to engage their students as much as possible. So, Indiana's in there. Now, so what we had to do, was very quickly apply what we knew about big data to--and cyber infrastructure to help these guys out. A lot of times they would go out in the field and they would collect data for weeks, only to find--and they didn't have the power to band with computing capabilities, to look at the data and to see that the instruments needed to be calibrated a little bit, tweaked a little bit. It was corrupting the data. And so, we had to address that problem right away, and we did. That's when we went after the polar grid, MRI grant, with NSF. That's between ECSU and Indiana. And what that allowed us to do was to design the equipment, the rugged equipment, that they could take it to the field and work it under those low power conditions. And it actually saved a number of field experiments. We got rave reviews from that. The data could be sent back to ECSU, Indiana and Kansas to be examined. We got a grid storage capability here to hold that data on campus. So, it was just a breakthrough in terms of polar experiments.
Speaker 2: Okay. So--
Speaker 1: In addition to that, we got some tremendous recognition from a number of under-represented students that are now engaged in polar science.
Story_ID: 25739
Speaker 1: Yeah, just to recap. In 2008, you created a computer center that would support the polar grid, right?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: That's the one I was telling you about, it's in--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, it's this one.
Speaker 2: Yeah. That's now on campus in the Wilkins Building.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a polar grid. The polar grid project was a major research instrumentation award to create the instruments that I was describing to you, and the center as well, and the grid that we have here as well--to be able to crunch all that data.
Speaker 1: Okay. In 2009, you were recognized by NAFEO [National Association For Equal Opportunity in Higher Education], with their NOBLE prize.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Not Nobel, but Noble.
Speaker 2: Noble (laughter).
Speaker 1: Noble prize.
Speaker 2: Noble prize, yeah.
Speaker 1: NAFEO is an organization, the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education. It's consistent of former college presidents.
Speaker 2: It's powerful, yes.
Speaker 1: Dr. Humphrey, Dr. Art Thomas and others--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: They've been on this project a long time.
Speaker 2: They have.
Speaker 1: So, that must have been exciting.
Speaker 2: That was exciting. And I met some interesting people, too. Loretta from Grambling, I met. She was also an awardee. And since then--we agreed then that we were going to work together on something because, you know, it's just a meeting of the minds. We didn't know how or when, but now we work together on the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] innovations and global climate change projects. She's--
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. So, now, you're, are you still, you're still in the department then, still working?
Speaker 2: Hell, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Alright. So you don't, do you have plans of when you're going to--
Speaker 2: Retire?
Speaker 1: Yeah, retire or--
Speaker 2: I'm having fun. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And making a difference. And I'm, I'm giving forward. I'm beginning to see hundreds of students, minority students, go out and get graduate degrees, and get into fields like, that they just otherwise would have no entree into. I was amazed. It was at NSF because--and the lady in polar science said, she said, "Linda we can tell the day and hour that you took over as education coordinator for CReSIS." She said, "The numbers just did like this", you know. And that is what gets me up in the morning, to know that these students are in Antarctica, they're in Greenland, they're in Germany. You know, this summer we'll be in Australia again with several of them presenting their papers and their research. And that really is the way to get into these Ph.D. programs. You have to, you know, someone's there when I get them through the B.S. degree or the master's degree, to reach and say, "Come work in my lab with me." Because they've seen what they can do, and they know that they're capable of making a serious contribution to these incredibly complex disciplines, and therefore impacting problems that are, you know, worldwide problems of incredible importance. And sea level--people say, "Well, why are you worried about, you know, glaciers?" And I say, "We live on the coast. You know, if those glaciers melt, if this coast and sea rises, then our coastline could disappear."
Speaker 1: And I believe it was just last year that 60 Minutes did a report on the tide water area about the rising sea water.
Speaker 2: Absolutely. So, we'd be, we're like the man in the water, you know. So, yeah, it's, these projects are very much interwoven with our lives. And our coastal managers need good data so they can make sound decisions. You know, our state legislators, they need this information. The last time I was at NSF, one of the program officers told me, she said, we included your project in our report to Congress, you know, and--have been invited to be on the advisory panel for polar science. Someone needs to be there that has an understanding of our community, to give a voice to what our community can contribute to these issues. And I feel very fortunate to be able to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay. When you look back on everything you've been able to do to this point, what do you consider, I guess, is the major contribution that this project has made to the ongoing scientific community?
Speaker 2: It is, it is, you know, without challenge that the contribution that the polar grid work did for studies, for those scientists in Antarctica. It just, you know, put them ahead by leaps and bounds. We have also, as a result of our use of satellite imagery, we were able to identify through a project with Goddard Space Flight Center, a ice shelf in West Antarctica. And it is actually the one that's furthest south that has disappeared. We studied the data over a series of years, and it disappeared. And Goddard came after us, and they checked the data and checked our results, and it worked out. And they then recommended to the U.S. Panel on Antarctic Naming, that that area--because when that ice shelf retreated, it left a bay--and that that bay be named Elizabeth City University Bay. And it was approved. And now on maps and globes all over the world, (laughter) the name Elizabeth City State University Bay is being printed. Awesome. I feel like that's a major contribution, because that will always be there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, Elizabeth City State University is not just in northeastern North Carolina.
Story_ID: 25740
Speaker 1: Okay. Likewise, when you look back at, over everything you've done to this point, what would you consider to be your major accomplishments?
Speaker 2: I think, most proud of the large number of students that we've been able to engage and bring on board that are now scientists, that are now Ph.D.s, that are in programs and institutions that--like Indiana and Kansas and Penn State [Pennsylvania State University], where they may not have been without this track, been able to make connections with universities like the university of New Hampshire, that has facilitated the involvement of teachers from minority serving institutions and students from minority serving institutions to learn about the different watersheds that we live in, and has provided scholarships for those students. UNH sends me scholarship money for students to come here and study, and then they go on to graduate school. You know, scholarship money is everything to these students. When I went to school, yeah, I had a scholarship, but I needed some--I needed the scholarship first. (laughter). Then I needed some additional money. So, being able to give them scholarships and then when they get here, to support them to work in the laboratories means that they got a complete package and they can stay. They don't have to go work at the food line in the evening. They can come in the lab and work, and that makes all the difference in the world.
Story_ID: 25741
Speaker 1: Now, once again when you look back at everything you've done at this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently, you know, if you could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  I don't think I would have been as hesitant as--well, I've always kind of went after it, when the opportunity presented itself.  But I think I would have done so with even more gusto, and just kind of trusted, and had faith and stepped out there.  Actually, I think--my favorite scriptures are Hebrews 1--Hebrews 11, Chapters--Chapter 11, verses 1 and 2.  And it talks about faith being the evidence of things not seen.  But even more important to me, was that second verse that says, "By faith, the elders received a good report."  It was stepping out on faith that made things happen for them.  You know, you wonder, well how did they do that?  They stepped out on faith.  And I wish that I'd done that a lot, lot more.
Story_ID: 25742
Speaker 1: Now, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African-American community today?
Speaker 2: We've got some talented individuals.  And we really need what they can bring to bear on, especially on science stem.  It's just, stem fields are just crying for their input.  I heard--I can't remember who was saying that.  But I heard that for every--if you're looking for a job, there are two science jobs out there looking for you.  You just don't have--if you have the right skill set, there are two jobs out there, if you're out there looking for a job.  And developing that talent is what we need to focus a lot of our energies on.  So, stem education I think is one of the most important things we can give attention to right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And making sure our teachers are also empowered with knowledge in science, engineering and mathematics.  You know, they need it, too.  And the teachers at the college level also need it.  And that's why some of my projects now involve working with these college teachers who are responsible for teaching the next generation of teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You mentioned that you've been married a long time.  You've got a son now who works here at the, on the campus.  Do you have any grandchildren?
Speaker 2: I'm still hoping.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  (laughter).  There's still hope.  Yes.
Story_ID: 25743
Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't talked about before we ask our last question?
Speaker 2: Well, I would just like to say that there is also a lot of talent within the minority professional organization, the community of minority professional organizations, that I think is not being tapped.  There, these are groups that have over the years been committed to developing our students.  Organizations like Adley, which is an association of computers, and computer engineering departments on HBCU and MSI campuses--organizations like the National Technical Association.  George Caruthers just recently received that Medal of Science.  He's been a long-time member there.  Organizations such as those, I think, need to be acknowledged for the contribution they've made, and they need to, we need to partner with them.  We need to--not try to reinvent what they're doing, but bring them in to some of these centers, these NSF [National Science Foundation] centers, and use them as resources.  So, you know, didn't ask about professional affiliations or anything like that, but I am on the board of Adley.  I've been on the board of NTA and served as secretary under three of their presidents-- really four--because I was under Catherine also.  And I'm just a fan of the work that they're doing, and feel that they're just under-estimated in terms of the impact that they can have on development of stem talent.
Speaker 1: Now, are you a member of NAM [National Association of Mathematicians]?
Speaker 2: NAM?
Speaker 1: Yeah, NAM.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  NAM, yeah, Dr. Houston used to have a campus here--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Where the office is.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And I saw your mentor's bio on the Mathematicians of the African Diaspora website that's run by Scott Williams, whose one of the founders of NAM.
Speaker 2: Yes, Buffalo?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Buffalo, New York, right.
Speaker 2: Right, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Indeed.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: That's another one.  I can go on.  You know, there are others as well in terms of these organizations.  There are ones with physics and chemistry, and for teachers, and for--it was NAM, we said that one.  I'm missing--oh, the engineers also have a society.
Story_ID: 25744
Speaker 1: Is it better for women now than it was before, in terms of mathematical sciences?
Speaker 2: I know a lot of women mathematicians.  Absolutely.  And many of them, mathematicians in computer science, many of them are in these organizations, as a matter of fact.  So, I see those numbers changing.  And we have what we call a Celebration of Women in Mathematics, just to kind of address some of that.  In fact for a while there, I ran a national program for (unclear), did their programs, excuse me, through the National Security Agency.  And what that did was allowed us to bring girls to campus for a day of mathematics celebration and competition.  We do it once a year now, in October every year.  It's so big that I can't do it while classes are in session, because I'm competing for resources.  So, we got about 400 girls last year.  And every year, we've had about 400 girls every year for the last seventeen years, which means that there aren't too many women in this area of North Carolina that haven't been to the Celebration of Women in Math--that don't have an "I Love Math" bag or that don't have a "I Love Math" cup (laughter) in their cupboard, or know that it's okay to love math.  And so, there's very little testosterone around when we're doing the Celebration of Women in Math.  They're just free (laughter) to enjoy, and not be intimidated at all.  The guys get to come with them for Research Week.  The last research week is--we just finished it.  It's usually the first week in February.  This year, we had the second week because one of my students, Jamie Powell, received the Graduate Leadership Award from the Black Engineer Magazine during their Black Engineer of the Year Conference.  So that kind of conflicted with it, so we moved Research Week back a week.  But the last day of Research Week we bring students to the campus, and this year we had 900 middle and high school students come for a day of workshops and hands on exploration in science.  So, the guys do get to come eventually.  But there's still a lot of girls around, too.
Story_ID: 25745
Speaker 1: Maam, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered by those, by hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of students who have master's and Ph.D.s [degrees] in STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] fields, as a mentor.
Story_ID: 25746
Speaker 1: Mrs. Sharon Saunders Brown, one of the first network managers we had in our lab in Lester Hall.  She worked with me in the early days of the Network Resources and Training Site, funded by NASA, and is now a faculty member at the College of the Alma Mark Computer Science; This handsome gentleman was a person who did a research project on me, and made a presentation at the Chrome Awards in Portsmouth, Virginia, a very proud moment.  I wish I knew his name.  We used to set up computer centers wherever we could.  Wherever they'd open the door, we would put some of the computers that we refurbished;  And this shows the YMCA in Portsmouth, Virginia computer camp; Jamie Powell, one of my first students, grew up in Portsmouth and came to Elizabeth City, studied computer science with us, and now has his master's degree and is working on his Ph.D. and recently received the Black Engineer of the Year Award for the Graduate Student Leadership, a proud moment;  This is husband Lee and I during our annual Kwanza ceremony at the house for our neighbors and friends, my life partner;  And the wedding ceremony in Lexington, Kentucky in 1976.  We just bought a bolt of material and made a shirt and a dress and we invited some friends and started our long journey together; Proud parents, Sarah Bailey and Linwood Bailey with--Linwood's in the background, although you don't see very much of him, as they meet their new grandson, Kuchumbi Linwood Hayden; This is my sister and I in the backyard in Lincolnville, just playing as girls will do, enjoying life at that time.
Speaker 2: What's your sister's name?
Speaker 1: My sister's name is Dr. Stephanie Denise Bailey Johnson; And at our friend's home, Aunt Doris' house, again, in Lincolnville;  A proud moment at Virginia State University's graduation, showing my mother Sarah Bailey, myself, and my Uncle Flick who was very instrumental in helping me to get there and stay there at Virginia State.
Speaker 2: What's his full name?
Speaker 1: His full name is Wilbert Bailey; And this is Wilbert Bailey again, with Sarah and my father Linwood Bailey; So, this is my brother Linwood in the middle, and my sister Stephanie.  And each of us had one child.  And Don Warthall is shown under Stephanie along with my son, Kuchumbi Hayden, and Lamar is directly under Linwood;  Again, the three of us together and happy times;  These are my sister and brother;  The loves of my life, my husband Lee Hayden, Jr. and my son Kuchumbi Hayden, are with me at the Emerald Awards Ceremony;  This is part of our trip to Cairo to work on our Egyptian Linkages project, multi-media project with the University of Cairo Fayoum;  And whenever I get an opportunity to do so, you can find me at the beach just enjoying the surf and sand;  This is Napoleon Byrd.  He was my first science teacher, and showed me how much fun science could be.  And this is a ceremony honoring him;   This is one of our first teams of student researchers with Dr. Zang, a powerful mentor.  This was actually our computer visualization team.  You can see Sharon Saunders on the team, along with some of the other students who now have their master's degree and their--and who worked as system engineers;  The NAFEO Awards in Atlanta was an opportunity to get the family together.  Shown is Mr. Foust, Howard Foust, physics teacher at I.C. Norcom who is the reason that I majored in--minored in physics at Virginia State.  Next to him is my sister and her husband, Dr. and Dr. Johnson.  In the center I'm with my husband Lee.  And then to the side are my sister's daughter, my niece and her friend, who all came to be with me during that celebration;  Again, the love of my life, Mr. Lee Hayden, Jr.;  This is Mother, Sarah Delores Vaughan Bailey, who worked as a nurse at Portsmouth General Hospital for many, many years;  The polar grid project allowed us to reach, to make a significant contribution to the work of our polar scientists by providing them with equipment and technology so that they could examine the data sets while they were still in the field, and it recognized if adjustments needed to be made;  This is my father, Linwood Bailey, at his graduation from I.C. Norcom High School;  And my sister and I often join efforts in reaching out to schools in our area, and supporting their science fairs and their projects that deal with stem;  Wow, well, this is graduation from I.C. Norcom High School at age 17, just barely.  So, we would go to collect equipment from NASA, Langley, and NASA Goddard and other places.  And then we'd put those computers, we'd tear them apart and put them back together again and establish centers like this one shown at--I believe this is Emily Spong Elementary School in Portsmouth.  And then we'd train the teachers to use the equipment.  Neighbors, friends would help us to bring the equipment back to our homes, where we would refurbish those P.C.'s.  Sometimes we'd take three or four computers and put together just to make one.
Speaker 2: I've done that. (laughter).
Speaker 1: You've done that?  (laughter).  Alright, Net Day was an important part of outreach to these schools that had no network connectivity.  The Net Days were preceded by training activities for the teachers and the parents.  And then they would help us to pull the cables and to drill the walls to run the cables from classrooms to libraries; The New Spin community project really gave us the opportunity to reach a large number of community centers, K-12 schools and institutions, and minority serving colleges and institutions within the southeastern Virginia and northeast and North Carolina community.  Our focus was high performance networking and earth science education and research at Elizabeth City.  We were one of seven centers; Very proud moment.  Very proud moment, when the teachers that had taught me so very much at Virginia State University came back and worked in my laboratory, since Virginia state was one of the institutions that we served to help them get connected to the internet during our NASA grant. That shows Dr. Emma Smith and Dr. Elias and Dr. Wahab (ph.), studying in our laboratory.
