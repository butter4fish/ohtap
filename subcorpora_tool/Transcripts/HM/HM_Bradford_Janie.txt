Story_ID: 638875
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Richard Bradford] side but separately so we don't get them mixed up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Elizabeth Almeda Coleman [Elizabeth Coleman Bradford]; that's E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H, A-L-M-E-D-A, C-O-L-E-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is June 29th, 1911.  I've seen two different dates--1910 and 1911--so I think she used the 1911.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we'll use, use hers.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Arkansas.  What city, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you think it was in a city or in a rural commun- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I think Dumas, Arkansas, is coming to mind for whatever reason.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what do you--what, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How, how far back can you trace them, first of all?
Speaker 2: To my great-grandfather.  I was so small, though, seeing him.  Robert Coleman [ph.] was a tall, mysterious man.  That was my great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: When you say mysterious, what do you mean?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  As a kid, we were afraid of him.  I don't know why, (laughter) so--was something mysterious about him.
Speaker 1: So he was tall (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: About how tall would you think?
Speaker 2: I would say I--well, as a kid, he could have been maybe 6'1" or 2", but he just looked extremely tall.  He was taller than my grandfather, who was around 5'10" or 11".
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did he do for a living, your, your, your great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: My great-grandfather, I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any stories that are passed down in the family about--
Speaker 2: About him?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: He would've--now, I'm thinking, great-grandfather, he would have been maybe born around the--close to the end of slavery, right, or, or during slavery?
Speaker 2: Possibly so, because grandpa was born in 1884, so great-grandfather was be--naturally before that.
Speaker 1: And what, what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Jessie Coleman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they, they don't have any stories from that era that they talk about or anything?
Speaker 2: No, 'cause grandpa was a railroad car Pullman.
Speaker 1: Pullman porter?
Speaker 2: Yeah, porter, and he was also a music teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so he's a Pullman porter, which was a good job for those, in those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Back then.
Speaker 1: --in the black community.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And a, a teacher, a music teacher?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So did, so did he go to college, or--
Speaker 2: That I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so what, so what did he teach in terms of music?  Did he teach an in- an instrument or, or--
Speaker 2: The piano.
Speaker 1: Oh, piano?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And was he--do you know, know if he taught, like, classical piano or, or, or, or popular piano?
Speaker 2: Popular.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now he would've been almost contemporary of--well, no.  Let's see, he was born in 1884.  He would have been, yeah, he'd have been close to around the time of Scott Joplin, another Missouri piano player, you know, famous ragtime music, you know, in 1890s and turn of the century.  Did, did he play that style of music, stride piano?
Speaker 2: I, I never heard him play.  My sister [Clea Bradford] took a few lessons from him.  She kind of learned by ear, and then he enhanced her piano playing.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.  I was wondering if he was a stride piano player.  There's a style that Scott Joplin popularized called stride that they played--they played ragtime music.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 638876
Speaker 1: Did you know your, your great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: I didn't know great-grandmother.  I think she'd passed on when I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about your, your [maternal] grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, Clea, C-L-E-A, Anna, A-N-N-A, Coleman [Clea Coleman].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did she do?
Speaker 2: Just--well, not just--but a housewife, because there was--was it twelve?  It's seven--fourteen, fourteen children, seven boys and seven girls, so she just had time to take care of the children.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a lot of children to keep track of.  Is there a, a story about how the family, you know, moved to--or, or how, how your mother [Elizabeth Coleman Bradford] moved to Missouri from--
Speaker 2: From Arkansas?  No.  I, I don't know it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did the whole family move, or did she just, did she move by herself to--
Speaker 2: No.  The whole family lived in Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now, did your mother share, you know, what it was like to grow up with you?
Speaker 2: What it was like to grow up with me?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, what it was like when she was growing up--
Speaker 2: When she was growing up?
Speaker 1: --with you, you know, yeah, so and (unclear).
Speaker 2: Not--no, I can't recall any specific stories.  Mother I think was--well, by the time I was born she was in her twenties.  But when my first sister [Clea Bradford] was born, she was like in her late teens, so it was kind of like a bigger sister, as I remember growing up with us.  Daddy [Richard Bradford] was kind of like the mother and the father in my mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother was so young she didn't seem like--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --she was the mother figure, I guess.
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she, did she ever talk about what she wanted to do in life?  Did, did, did she get a chance to finish school herself, or did she have a aspiration to do something that she, you know, either got a chance to do or wanted to do?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, she wanted to be a nurse.  She did take up nursing.  She did eventually become a nurse.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so did, did she go to school some, some place in--
Speaker 2: In Missouri (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Missouri--
Speaker 2: --but I don't know where, be-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, because--
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 638877
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side.  Can, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Richard Henry Bradford [Richard Bradford].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February 10, 19--I'm sorry--1885.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1885.  So he was considerably older (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was--
Speaker 1: --than your mother [Elizabeth Coleman Bradford].
Speaker 2: Yes, he was one year younger than grandpa [Bradford's maternal grandfather, Jessie Coleman] (laughter), and two years older than grandmother [Clea Coleman].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?  How, how far back can you trace them, and are there any stories, historical stories on that side?
Speaker 2: Very, very little on daddy's side.  I understand that--wow (laughter), that daddy lived on a farm or a plantation.  I guess they still had a trace of the slavery thing going.  And either he, he beat up real bad the master, and he ran away, you know, like tra- the river going through rivers so the dogs wouldn't smell his trace.  And he changed his name to Bradford, which was the master's name that he'd beat up 'cause he figured they wouldn't be looking for him.  Now that, that's the story I have.  Whether it's true or not, I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, that's--we're after the story, so I, I know you can't verify it 'cause you, you weren't there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And probably nobody's ever written about it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But, but yeah, the story is, is--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Okay, so the story is that your, your, your father lived on a, in a plantation type situation (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: This is after somewhat--now this is not unusual, 'cause a lot of people--
Speaker 2: They were still there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, people stayed on the land--
Speaker 2: After, after--
Speaker 1: --and worked--
Speaker 2: --slavery yeah.
Speaker 1: --after slavery for--'cause change was--
Speaker 2: And I think that's what his family did, stayed there on the land.
Speaker 1: Right.  But you say he beat up the master real bad and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --had to go.
Speaker 2: And had to run away, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, changed his name--
Speaker 2: He escaped.
Speaker 1: --to Bradford, which is the same as the master's (laughter), thinking that the master would never think he would do that (laughter).  Okay, so was it--so where was this plantation, was it--
Speaker 2: I guess in Mississippi.  He was born in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know what city, township or whatever.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, what did your--now your father was a reverend, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, I don't know if he had any other occupations, but often people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Certain--no, minister as long as I've known him.  He'd go--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --various churches and--
Speaker 1: Now he was a Baptist (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The church I remember--
Story_ID: 638878
Speaker 1: Your father [Richard Bradford] was a Baptist minister in, in, in Charleston [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of his church?
Speaker 2: Morning Star Missionary Baptist Church, which was out from Charleston, in a rural area called Alfalfa Center [Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay, Alfalfa Center.
Speaker 2: I think about seven miles from Charleston.
Speaker 1: About, about how far?
Speaker 2: About seven miles out from Charleston.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay, okay.  And now, so do you, do you know if your, your father had a chance to finish school or go to, you know, a bible school or--
Speaker 2: I'm sure he went to bible school, and I don't know how far he went to--in school, but he was very--a scholar.  You know, he, he was real smart.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't mean just mother wit smart.  I mean book smart, so he probably went pretty far in school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was he like a community leader in those--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --days?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so, are there any, so, are, are there any stories that you remember about him that he's talked about in terms of him, him, his growing up or what life was like on that plantation or--
Speaker 2: Very (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) or why he, you know--
Speaker 2: --very little.  His mother's name was Sarah [ph.].  That's all I know is Sarah.  I don't know her last name or anything.  And he had a half brother, Amos Worley [ph.].
Speaker 1: Amos--
Speaker 2: Worley, W-O-R-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they both were half white, because I understand Sarah was Indian [Native American].  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: I guess they were plantation babies.  That's what I'm trying to say.
Speaker 1: So Sarah was--
Speaker 2: Both of them.
Speaker 1: --and so was Amos Worley?
Speaker 2: Amos Worley is Sarah's son--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --my father's brother.  And Uncle Amos' kids came out with the silky brown hair, looking just like white kids.  And I, I used to fuss at mother [Elizabeth Coleman Bradford].  I said, "And we came out black just like you," (laughter), "with nappy hair.  What happened" (laughter)?  But, no, so you could see the mixes of the, of the races in my father and my uncle there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, could it be that the, the plantation owner that your father punched out was his own father?
Speaker 2: Could have been.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's interesting.  I mean, it's not the first story like this--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that we've heard, as you well can imagine, so.  So now, it, it--anything else about your father, 'cause--did, did you, did you ever--did your grandmother come up from Mississippi to--
Speaker 2: No, I never met--
Speaker 1: --Charleston?
Speaker 2: --Sarah.  I never met Sarah, and he never really talked about her.  He kind of explained things to us like once.  And me being the smaller of the lot, I don't remember that much.  Now my sister [Clea Bradford] just knew it all and would talk about it, but she passed about four years ago, in 2008, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: A lot of the history passed on with her.
Speaker 1: So there are a lot of mysteries in this in terms of your father obviously was--you said the educated man and was a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --smart man.
Speaker 2: I think he was very young when he ran away, so I don't know how he was able to continue his schooling or whatever.  But evidently he did, because, like I say, he was very smart man.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was he a member of the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.]?  Did he go to those meetings?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, was he a member of any of the African American organizations in those days, like the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 638879
Speaker 1: Now, this part of Missouri, and correct, correct me if, if, if I'm wrong, is very southern, right?  It's not--I mean it's a very southern place.  It's not in--some, some people get confused about Missouri and think it's midwestern or something, but it's--
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't experience that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I experienced more when I went to Detroit [Michigan] than, than--where we lived, in Charleston [Missouri], daddy [Richard Bradford] had farmed.  He raised cotton and corn and all that stuff.  And we had as many white people working for us in his farms as we did black.  And it was, you know, only after we left and after the march, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and we went back to visit him, we saw that they had changed some buildings, you know, black in one door and, and white in the other.  But as we were growing up, that was not there when we lived there.  That was only after the Martin Lu- I guess they were trying to show some difference between us or whatever.  But far as the farming and whatever, I really never saw it different.  In fact, daddy didn't drive, but we had a car.  And Mrs. Phelps [ph.] was our driver, who was a white lady.  So that's the way we, we lived.  And then, Clifford Fowls [ph.], who owned the farm where my daddy was farming on, I mean, he would give him the cream of the crop, so I never really experienced it in, maybe in our little niche.  It might have been all around.  But, but our schools were segregated, so I couldn't, you know, I would--wouldn't know about the kids in school, how they reacted and whatever, because Lincoln High School [Charleston, Missouri], where I went, was strictly a black high school.  And the Charleston High School [Charleston, Missouri] across town were for the white kids, so we never bumped heads there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638880
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Elizabeth Coleman Bradford and Richard Bradford] met?
Speaker 2: I don't know it; no, I don't know it.
Speaker 1: Did, do you think they met at church or, or--
Speaker 2: I don't know if he knew the family or just how that came to be.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, did they--see--so, but, but they got together by what, what--when, I guess in the, in the mid-'30s [1930s] or--
Speaker 2: No.  My sister [Clea Bradford] was born in '33 [1933], and I think there were two stillborn brothers passed before she was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So it must have been like--
Speaker 1: Your ma- your mother was very young.  She was, she was--okay, your sister was born, she was like twenty-two I guess then.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, all right.  Now, when you--can you describe your parents' personalities?  And in terms of their disposition, and their habits, and how they, you know, how they approach things, their sense of humor, their thinking on things, and, and, and tell us who, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My father.  My father was a jokester, prankster.  He would tell the most god awful jokes for him to be a minister.  Everybody else would be sitting their astonished, and he would be laughing like crazy (laughter).  So, but he was very--I don't--stern--I guess that's the word--direction driven in making sure we did what we had to do, but he was a fun guy.  Mother was more the motherly type.  You know, she didn't have Daddy's sense of humor.  And, and usually when she would bring people over, she would tell them, "Oh, you got to get to know Janie [HistoryMaker Janie Bradford] 'fore you understand her," 'cause I act so much like Daddy (laughter), so.  I know one girl, a friend of mine, had asked me once was my father still living--no, was my mother living, and I said, "Yes."  She said, "Well, I didn't know because you talk about your father all the time, and you never mention your mother," which was not intentional, but, but Daddy just did so many things that stood out in my mind to me.  And I would always mention Daddy and then I guess being a daddy's girl, being the baby, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638881
Speaker 1: Now was he [Bradford's father, Richard Bradford] a good preacher?  I mean did, did, did he have a good, you know, I guess an exciting style of delivery?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he wasn't flamboyant.  He was a good teacher more than the (unclear) preacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And was it--did the church have a big congregation or--in the, the Charleston [Missouri] area, or was it (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, it was big for that rural area, yeah, because, I guess by the time I remember him building Morning Star Missionary Baptist Church, I understand he'd built several churches before.  So he did that in various areas.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So was, was he--was, was it--would, would it be considered one of the more influential churches in the area?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, because I remember them--I don't know for what or what time of year, but about twice a year they would, like, dig a hole in the ground and roast a pig in the ground.  And some of the deacons would sit out all night taking turns, you know, with, with the pig.  And then we would party the next day and eat all this food.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So that was an annual event?
Speaker 2: Annual event, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 638882
Speaker 1: Do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have one brother and one sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had one brother and one sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, your sister's the oldest, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was her name?
Speaker 2: Clea, C-L-E-A.
Speaker 1: Okay, and same as your--
Speaker 2: Clea Ethel [Clea Bradford].  She was not Clea Anna [Bradford's maternal grandmother, Clea Coleman].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was Clea Ethel.
Speaker 1: So, she was I guess named after your grandmother then, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was your brother's name?
Speaker 2: Joseph Ezekiel [Joseph Bradford], two biblical names.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And he--was he born after you were?
Speaker 2: He was born '35 [1935].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so that's just, yeah, four years before you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 638883
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory is very vague.  I remember how, back in the country when they'd clean the yard, rake up all the leaves, and burn them in a burn--bonfire, and the, the sparks was very exciting to me.  I guess I was three or four--might not have been old as four--and I kept reaching for the sparks.  Daddy [Richard Bradford] was at the front of the house, and I was in the back by myself looking at this fire, and I fell over in it.  And daddy heard my screams.  There's the results (points).  And, and he ran and he got me, and he took me to the doctor.  And they were like, you know, watching over me.  And they say I started singing, "This little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine," ['This Little Light of Mine'].  So then they knew that I was gonna be okay.  But right now you can see a fireplace there, but no, the rule is you do not light it.  I can't stand an open flame.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's mentally in my mind, yeah.
Speaker 1: So about how old were you when that happened?
Speaker 2: I had to be around three, I think.  I was very small.
Story_ID: 638884
Speaker 1: So you grew up in Charleston [Missouri], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, teen--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --early teens.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I went to Detroit [Michigan] in my teens.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you live in the same neighborhood the whole time in, in Charleston?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And what, what was the neighborhood like?  Did, did it have a name or--
Speaker 2: Just the neighborhood?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, there was no name for the neighborhood, just Charleston.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is Charleston, like, segregated by a, a physical barrier?  Like a lot of times black people are across the railroad--
Speaker 2: Cross the--
Speaker 1: --tracks and--
Speaker 2: --railroad track?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Kind of segregated by the area, like a downtown area.  And on the other side of downtown, there were the whites, and on this side of downtown where the Lincoln High School [Charleston, Missouri], there were the blacks.
Speaker 1: Okay, so downtown kind of separated the two sides of town?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any sense of, of the black population sign, I mean, proportionate to the white--
Speaker 2: I did not, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Or did you, when you look back on it now, do you think there were just as many black folks in town as white, or--
Speaker 2: Basically, 'cause you know, when, when daddy [Richard Bradford] would take us out shopping for clothes or whatever, we would be in the downtown area, and you would see basically many, many blacks as you would whites.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, how strict was the segregation in Charleston when you were growing up?  Did--
Speaker 2: Like I say, growing up, I didn't experience it at, at, at all.  I know--I guess reading back and looking back, it had to have been there.  But we were fortunate enough not to experience it until we moved to, to Detroit.  I moved to Detroit with my sister [Clea Bradford].  And after the marches and all that, we went back to visit my father and went to a restaurant that we went to all the time.  And they had a sign, "For whites only," in the door.  And there was a little window cut out like on the side, near the back, for blacks to pick up their food in this little window.  So--
Speaker 1: Now that's--
Speaker 2: --naturally we walked away.  We didn't go in because you know, we (laughter)--it was something brand new.
Speaker 1: Now that's interesting.  So they were the--
Speaker 2: They rebelled I guess after Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came along and you know, was trying to liberate the blacks and whatever.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Evidently, the city did rebel, because it wasn't like that.  We went into that restaurant all the time before we moved.
Speaker 1: So some kind of white backlash to the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: --Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.

Speaker 1: So your household growing up consisted of you, your brother [Joseph Bradford], your sister [Clea Bradford], your mother [Elizabeth Coleman Bradford] and father [Richard Bradford].  Was there anyone else living with you?
Speaker 2: No, not on a permanent basis.  Daddy was the kind of person--thank God, he lived then instead of today--he would take people in if they were hungry, and he would feed them.  He would let them spend the night and get a bath and clean clothes, and then send them on their way.  One family in the neighborhood, the mother of the family died.  They were Hamptons [ph.].  And she left the baby, I guess, four or five months old, William [William Hampton (ph.)] was.  And naturally, the other children didn't know how to take care of the baby.  The baby became malnourished.  Daddy went and got William and you know, nursed him back to health, kept him clean and all that, and then about six months, he was ready to take him back home.  And we were so upset because we thought William was our baby (laughter).  We didn't want him to go back home at that time.  But he would do those kind of things.  So we grew up with people in and out of our house and in and out our lives all the time because he was that kind of person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, as, as a full time pastor, he, I guess he really had a lot of traffic.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Counseling people.
Speaker 2: Yeah, feeding people and clothing people and doing all those things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he presided over funerals I, I imagine and all those--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --events, those public marriages and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, this kept, you know, this keeps a lot of traffic, yeah, as you said.  Yeah, now, well, how, how big a house did you live in and--
Speaker 2: We lived in I guess it was three, four bedroom house, and it was a big pecan tree in the yard.  I remember that, yeah, and that brown rust looking siding that would be on those country houses (laughter).  I guess it was imitation brick or something to look like brick.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So it was a frame house with like a, with a siding, a brick siding (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Not a brick siding.  It was--oh, god, what is that?  Something like a tar paper, but, but the outside was like a brick facade or something.  It, it--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --was a--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I know what you mean.  Yeah, it's a siding.  It's, it's to simulate brick.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I lived in one of those too (laughter) at one point, so yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 638886
Speaker 1: We always ask this question: what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The sights, sounds, and smells, I guess, well, I guess food, there was always food cooking.  I remember one Christmas I ate so much I just had to lay down and sleep the (laughter) rest, rest of the day.  So, we weren't rich, which I did not know that until I was grown, you know, because he always give--gave us whatever we needed  provided for us and didn't know how hard it was.  It was just always there.  So, I do remember feeling secure and, and very happy at home.  Like a lot of kids, they want to run away or whatever.  It never crossed my mind, 'cause when I get hungry I want to eat, and when I get sleepy I want to go to bed, not know where I'm gonna sleep that night.  So I was very content and very happy at home.  It was a peaceful place.
Speaker 1: Okay, other sights, sounds, and smells?
Speaker 2: I, I really (laugher) can't put together sights, sounds, and smells--trying to think.  Well, there was--sounds there was always--daddy [Richard Bradford] had a little, a farm again out near the rural church [Morning Star Missionary Baptist Church] and things.  He had cows.  He had not horse, mules, or were they horses?  He had horses and--because I remember riding one of the horses, and my friend had to run and catch me and pull me off.  I was afraid after the horse took off.  I thought he was just gonna stand there.  There were pigs, horses, chickens, ducks, guineas.  You name it, we had it, and dogs (laughter).  We didn't eat the dogs, but we had dogs (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you have dogs at home too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there any particular dog you, you remember, or--
Speaker 2: A three legged dog, yeah; I remember that dog.
Speaker 1: Did, did he have a name?
Speaker 2: Oh, he probably did I'm sure, but I don't remember, but I remember the three legs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 638887
Speaker 1: You mentioned your, your mother's father [Jessie Coleman] being a Pullman porter and a piano player.  Now did they live there in Charleston [Missouri] too?
Speaker 2: No.  They lived out from Charleston in, in another rural area.  I don't remember that because they moved to Indianapolis, Indiana early on, before my sister went to Detroit [Michigan], and then I followed her to Detroit.  But they, they didn't live in Charleston.  They lived out from Charleston.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was--so, I mentioned it because you said he was a piano player and, and a--was, was there, was there music in your home when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, from my sister.  She played, played the piano.  Somebody gave her a piano, because before that, she would go down to the church [Morning Star Missionary Baptist Church] and play.  And then somebody gave her a piano.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what type of music would your sister play?
Speaker 2: My sister played basically at first was church music, because she played for the choir at a very, very young age.  I think first time she performed in church she was three years old.  She--, "I come to the garden alone, while the dew is still on the roses," ['I Come to the Garden Alone'] she performed that song.  And then as soon as she was old enough to play, I'm sure eleven or twelve or whatever, she played for the church choir.  And like I say, she acquired her playing first by ear, just, just sound.
Speaker 1: Okay, she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then she evolved into a jazz singer.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so did she just play jazz, or did she sing too, or--
Speaker 2: She sing, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She have--she was on Chess Records couple--three albums--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I think she did--
Speaker 1: So she became a professional--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --musician.  Okay, all right.  So did she, she perform under the name of Cleon--
Speaker 2: Clea, Clea Bradford, just--
Speaker 1: Clea Bradford?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Is, is there a particular song that she's famous for or noted for that--
Speaker 2: I think--well, was the strange part about that is that she did jazz, and she was doing an album, and she needed just one more song to complete the album.  So she threw an R and B song on there just to complete the album, 'My Love's a Monster,' which became a big hit--
Speaker 1: 'I Love a Monster.'
Speaker 2: --in Ohio.  'My Love's a Monster.'
Speaker 1: 'My Love's a Monster.'
Speaker 2: 'My Love is a Monster.'
Speaker 1: 'My Love is a Monster,' okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It became a big hit in Ohio?
Speaker 2: I, yeah, I know 'cause she worked there.  I went over to see her, and, but she was so--do you hear that? My husband [Dean Hobbs]. I need to go make him be okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  That's all right.
Speaker 2: She was so obsessed, as most jazz artist are, being just strictly jazz.  They booked her there because of the hit record.  She went and she performed all her jazz tunes and closed her show and left.  She did not perform 'cause she did not want to be known as an R and B act.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were the people disappointed?
Speaker 2: Well, they never invited her back (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so she's a music purist and so--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so that's some--that's something.  Well, you know, so, your--so did your sister get involved in the music business I guess before you since she's older, or--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --definitely, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So your sister--was, was your brother [Joseph Bradford] involved in music at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He could sing, could sing very well, but he never pursued it.
Story_ID: 638888
Speaker 1: Now was the, the radio a regular feature in your household, or?
Speaker 2: Definitely, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And were, were you allowed to listen to, you know, secular music on the radio?
Speaker 2: No, we were not.  We could listen to Patti Page, 'How Much is the Doggie in the Window' ['How Much is that Doggie in the Window'] and, and Bang Crosby [Bing Crosby], as my daddy [Richard Bradford] call him.  But we could not listen to the blues and R and B and all that stuff.  So when he would--they would leave, we would stand somebody by the door to watch for him (laughter), and we would find R and B stations and blast them until we saw them coming back (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now there--in those days, now, there was a--wasn't there, wasn't there a stronger line between black popular music and what you heard on the radio, I mean, in terms of content and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And basically I think I--what we wasn't supposed--it was actually the blues at that time.  There were more, more blues being played in the record--radio than, than R and B.
Speaker 1: Were there--I know there weren't that many, you know, stations that played black music, but, but do, do you remember what radio stations (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't.
Speaker 1: --to?
Speaker 2: It was one like from the South somewhere that we would pick up.
Speaker 1: That one from WLAC [WLAC Radio] in--
Speaker 2: Oh, I wouldn't remember a call letter, but yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Gallatin, Tennessee, or outside of Nashville [Tennessee].  I mean--
Speaker 2: It was a strong signal that we could pick up, 'cause I re--
Speaker 1: That's not--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: The, the Hossman [Bill "Hoss" Allen] and, and all--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I think I know what you're talking about, yeah.  So that's--'cause they'd have 'Randy's Record Shop' ['Randy's Record Shop Show'] and all.  Was that, was that the one with the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.  Okay, so, now, now did you sing (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Not at all.  You know, I talk with a lisp.  Have you heard (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Not really--
Speaker 2: I, I can't sing--not at all.
Speaker 1: I don't notice a lisp or anything.
Speaker 2: No, I'm just teasing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I always say that when somebody say, "You sing?"  I say, "No, I talk with a lisp," but I (laughter) didn't sing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't sing.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And did you play an, an instrument?
Speaker 2: I didn't, didn't play no more than chording, you know, just enough to get by trying to get a tune over.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't sing or, or really play.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really wasn't into the music scene.  I got into it as a, as a threat later on to Mr. Gordy [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, I've read about that.
Story_ID: 638889
Speaker 1: Well, let's go to, what did you like to do growing up?  What, what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Growing up, I, I did write, but I wrote poetry.  I loved writing poetry.
Speaker 1: Now did you, did you have a favorite poet when you were growing up, or--
Speaker 2: I did like Rudyard Kipling, and my favorite poem growing up, and still is, is 'If.'
Speaker 1: Okay, that's by Kipling, yeah?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did they teach any of Dunbar's [Paul Laurence Dunbar] poetry when--at school, or--
Speaker 2: Very, very little.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember Robert Frost though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Was it Robert Frost came to--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --visit?  He's the one that died in the 1900s, and he came to visit our school once, yeah.
Speaker 1: Robert Frost?
Speaker 2: Which one died in the 1900s?  I think it was Robert Frost.
Speaker 1: Oh, Frost was the poet from Chi- you know, from Illinois [sic.].  He was Chicago and wrote about Chicago [Illinois] a lot and about Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] and--would he have--
Speaker 2: No, he's, he's shaking his head.
Speaker 1: Would he, would he have come to--yeah, I just don't know if he--
Speaker 2: One, one of those poets came to our school to visit.
Speaker 1: Is this a black poet or a white poet?
Speaker 2: It was a white poet.
Speaker 1: White poet, okay.
Speaker 2: And that's what made me really continue with the, with the poetry writing.
Speaker 1: I'm getting Frost mixed up with Sandburg [Carl Sandburg].  Now I think that's he's--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --shaking his head (laughter).
Speaker 2: Was, was not, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Frost, was, "Stopping by the woods on a snowy evening" ['Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening'] by Robert Frost.
Speaker 2: He--I'm sure--
Speaker 1: That's Robert Frost.
Speaker 2: --that was him, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, okay, all right.  So, did he come to Lincoln High School [Charleston, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Came to Lincoln High School, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, did you have any, any poems published when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No, no, I did not, because I got into the songwriting in mid-teens before I would, just really into the poetry end of it.  But I did publish my own little book of poems about ten years ago myself.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 638890
Speaker 1: What school did you start at?  I mean, what was the name, name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: Bird's Mill elementary school [Bird's Mill School] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Birds--
Speaker 2: B-I-R-D-S, Birds Mill, M-I-L-L, Mill.
Speaker 1: Now, was that actually in Charleston [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: No.  It was out from Charleston--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --couple of miles.
Speaker 1: Was that, was it out, out near the church [Morning Star Missionary Baptist Church]?
Speaker 2: Kind of but be--wasn't quite that far.  Maybe it was like a two mile walk.  Seemed like we walked to school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so two miles away instead of seven miles.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, now, that's an interesting name.  Is there a story behind the name of the school?
Speaker 2: I often have wondered myself.  I, I never knew.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is a segregated school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All black school?
Speaker 2: All black school.
Speaker 1: And was this supported by the state, I mean in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So about how many would you guess--how, how big was it?  About how many students were there?
Speaker 2: Student wise, I don't remember, but it was one of those one room schoolhouses.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And every grade was in there, from kindergarten up to the eighth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How, how many teachers did, did you have there?
Speaker 2: One.
Speaker 1: One, okay.
Speaker 2: One teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you say about fifty students maybe, or--
Speaker 2: Well, like there was a row for the kindergarten, a row for the first, and so on like that, so probably about that many.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, I was gonna ask you if you had a favorite teacher, but that would be that one teacher.
Speaker 2: The one teacher, Wilma Mountjoy [ph.].
Speaker 1: Wilma?
Speaker 2: --Mountjoy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, now what was she like?
Speaker 2: She was, was almost like a substitute mother, very loving, very kind lady.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was she the person that introduced you to poetry?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't even remember an introduction.  I think it was just something that came natural.  I just started doing, and it kind of really blossomed in high school [Lincoln High School, Charleston, Missouri] because I would write poems that would end up on the bulletin board.  And I, I think I liked that, so then I kept writing.  And then when the poet came to the school to visit, that really, you know, took off for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, I was trying to get at that when I was asking you about publishing.  It didn't have to be a major publication.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: You know, if it was around town and on the bulletin board at school--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's, that's important.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Did your father [Richard Bradford] write po- poetry at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he have any poetry books at home?  Did you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was just trying to find out who--if--who introduced you to Kipling [Rudyard Kipling], you know, as such.
Speaker 2: I guess in literature at school, just, just reading the very--I loved literature.  I loved 'Macbeth' [William Shakespeare] and all those things, so, guess it came from that.
Speaker 1: Okay, this would be in high school?
Speaker 2: That would be in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now were you a, a good student for, for Ms. Mountjoy?
Speaker 2: I was a good student.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--all right.
Speaker 2: When we graduated, all the various, I guess area schools, had to take a test to go to high school.  And my best friend was number one, and I was number two of all the rural area schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now who was your best friend?
Speaker 2: Vernell Craighead--not Vernell Craighead--Vernell Perry [ph.].  I had another friend later in life, Vernell Craighead [ph.] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so she--so your best friend was, was the top student in the class.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, not in that class; it was from the gathering of school--I didn't go to school with her.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh, okay.
Speaker 2: But from the school she came from, we were, we were the two tops in all the various, I guess, schools in that area, district, or whatever you want to say.
Story_ID: 638891
Speaker 1: Did you ever see any live music growing up other than church music, you know?
Speaker 2: Not growing up, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean not younger, before, before (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, was there--
Speaker 2: --high school [Lincoln High School, Charleston, Missouri].
Speaker 1: --was there a venue in Charleston [Missouri] where, where they were bring, bringing the black acts?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So, to see something like that, you have to go where?  Where would you go?
Speaker 2: We probably go to Cairo [Illinois] or, or somewhere much bigger.  And we would go over to Cairo sometime like, even just for, for a dance--to dance or whatever.  They did not have--Charleston was a very small rural town.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so did--so, it seemed like your, your father [Richard Bradford] was strict on, on some level, but he liked to have a lot of fun too.  But--
Speaker 2: Yeah, strict to the point more so on my older sister [Clea Bradford], I guess because she was older.  And I guess if I wanted to, wanted to do something I would ask him.  He had a way of not answering us if he didn't want to do it--didn't want us to do it.  He just wouldn't say anything.  So, maybe like a friend I was asking could I go spend the night with them, and he wouldn't say anything.  So when I'd come back the next day, he'd say, "I didn't tell you you could go over there."  I'd say, "You didn't tell me you [sic. I] couldn't," (laughter).  So, I was so much like him in that way.  I had a little more freedom because simply because I took it.  But my sister would not take it, so she--I know once when we were grown, both married, she had kids, and we went back to visit him.  And we were going out.  He say--he called her sister.  He said, "Sister, be back here by twelve [o'clock]."  He didn't say a thing to me.  And we were walking out the door together.  She said, "Can you believe him," (laughter)?  But he just had that way about him.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 638892
Speaker 1: So, you went all the way through eighth grade at Birds Mill [Bird's Mill School]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.

Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, now that, that's in--is that, that actually in Charleston [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Lincoln was actually in Charleston, yes.
Speaker 1: And so did Lincoln, like, draw black students from around that area?
Speaker 2: Yeah, even bused in, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what, what are some of the other communities I guess that Lincoln drew from?
Speaker 2: Wyatt [Missouri], W-Y-A-T-T, and I guess some of the rural areas probably didn't have a name, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But there were, there were various rura- rural areas that they were bused in also.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how many classrooms would, say, Lincoln have?
Speaker 2: Lincoln was a pretty big school.  It had various classrooms.  I'm trying to remember, maybe, maybe ten, twelve, and then we had basketball gym and, and the whole thing at Lincoln.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had a gymnasium and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Lincoln High School's team play other teams in the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --other black schools?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so, so you're starting school, what, about 1951, is that it, high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so 1951, okay.  Did you--what was your favorite music when you were--in 1951?  Did you have a favorite performer?

Speaker 2: On the radio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I heard it on the radio.
Speaker 1: Now did you have any records at home when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Not before high school.  In high school we had those big 78 records [78 rpm record], I guess, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were, were you allowed to have any secular music at home (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Not really play it (laughter) at certain times, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the 45s [45 rpm record] hadn't come out yet.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I think the 45s are some kind of music revolution I guess in some way.
Speaker 2: On the way, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  All right, okay, so, 'Pledging My Love' by Johnny Ace.  And that, that's sometime during high school you're saying, but you're not sure.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember--

Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did she teach?
Speaker 2: She taught literature (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so this is--so she taught literature.  And so, so she's the one that introduced you to some of the poets and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, anybody else in high school?
Speaker 2: There were several other teachers, but she was my favorite.  There was Mrs. Artophe, A-R-T-O-P-H-E.  I don't remember Mrs. Artophe's first name.  There was Ms. Ashley [ph.], who was the home economics teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mr. Davis [ph.], who was the algebra teacher.  And I'm sure there were others that escapes me right now--oh, and Ms. Wilma Mountjoy [ph.] came to the high school to become a teacher when I was there.  She left the grade school system.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have her there in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, that had to be interesting.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.

Story_ID: 638893
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a, in high school [Lincoln High School, Charleston, Missouri], did you--were you involved in clubs or high school activities?
Speaker 2: Not, not really.  I was the president for one of the, one of the years, the class president.  At graduation I was the valedictorian, because Vernell [Vernell Perry (ph.)] had dropped out (laughter).  So she did end up going to Charleston [Missouri], though.  We did go to high school together.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But she dropped out of high school before she graduated?
Speaker 2: Yes, personal reasons.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, so you were the valedictorian.  Now, let's see here, so did you, did you all have a yearbook or anything?  Did you--

Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So just, let's see, you didn't put a poem in it or anything?
Speaker 2: I didn't put a poem in the yearbook (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did you do any public speaking, as a daughter of a minister [Richard Bradford] and all (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no.  What was so funny, once in Ms. Scott's [Naomi Scott (ph.)] class, I was talking--I know what it was.  We had--I had to read a book and tell the story.  And I got up and I just went blank.  I could not, you know, tell what I had read in the book, the story.  And I say, say, "Ms. Scott, I can't tell the story," so she sent me to the principal's office.  He said, "Bradford [HistoryMaker Janie Bradford], as much as I have you in here, more than your sister [Clea Bradford] and brother [Joseph Bradford] combined, about talking, you get up to tell a story, you know, for your, for your assignment, and you can't even speak; I don't know."  So I've always had problems with speaking publicly. I don't know what it is, but I, I can be the class clown or the life of the party, but when the spotlight just goes directly on me, I, I freeze.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, well, we'll pause here.
Speaker 2: I'm getting better.  I'm working at it, okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 638894
Speaker 1: Now what were your thoughts as a high school senior about career?  What did you want to be, or did you--had you resolved that you were gonna pursue a certain career, or, or did you have a dream of becoming--
Speaker 2: I, I really wanted to become a doctor, and I really thought that's what I wanted to do, until I discovered I'm afraid of blood (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you wanted to be a doctor.  And now did you, did, did they have a college prep course in, in, at Lincoln [Lincoln High School, Charleston, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Not at Lincoln but in Jefferson City, Missouri, that--the Jefferson City university, they, they had one there.  But I did not go there.  I was supposed to go there, and then that's when I went to Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Oh, wait a minute.  I think we're getting mixed up.  You, now you came out of Lincoln High School, but that, but they had a Lincoln University--
Speaker 2: University in--
Speaker 1: --Jefferson City, Missouri.
Speaker 2: --Jefferson City, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  Yeah, but you were gonna go to Lincoln.
Speaker 2: I was gonna go to Lincoln University.
Speaker 1: But, but you decided not to go, hm?
Speaker 2: I went to Detroit instead.
Speaker 1: Well, okay.  Now, your sister [Clea Bradford] was already in Detroit.
Speaker 2: Already in Detroit.
Speaker 1: And so you had a choice of either going to school, going to the university, or going to join your sister in Detroit.
Speaker 2: In Detroit.  And I went to DIT in Detroit.
Speaker 1: D--now what's DIT?
Speaker 2: DIT is Detroit Institute of Technology [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  Now by--when you came out of high school, you knew how to type and do that--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --sort of thing.  I figured that, you know, that, that you would, that you would, but I didn't, I didn't know, so I thought I'd ask.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did have typing in, in high school.
Speaker 1: So DIT, Detroit Institute of Technology.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  And so, your sister had been in Detroit for a few years?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, two or three years at least.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was she playing jazz then and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --even playing jazz before she left.  Well, she left Charleston [Missouri] years before and went to St. Louis [Missouri].  And that's where she started working in clubs with Ike and Tina [Ike Turner and Tina Turner] and Jimmy Forrest.  Jimmy Forrest was our next door neighbor, the 'Night Train' man.
Speaker 1: Jimmy--what's his name?
Speaker 2: Jimmy Forrest, F-O-R-R-E--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --S-T, the one that had the instrumental 'Night Train.'
Speaker 1: Oh, the, the (hums).
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So she worked with all of those.
Speaker 1: So he lived next door--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: to your sister.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is--
Speaker 2: In St. Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Okay, next--so he lived next door to your sister in St. Louis?
Speaker 2: In St. Louis, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so, now did your father have any problems with you moving to, to Detroit, or did he want you to go to Lincoln, or, or did, did it matter?
Speaker 2: No.  Naturally, daddy [Richard Bradford] always wanted me to stay home, but I always had--was kind of headstrong and wanted to do whatever.  And he always kind of wished me well in whatever I was doing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so this is 1955 when you graduate.  And--
Speaker 2: But he knew, you know, upon graduation there was nothing to do there in Charleston, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now did you work when you were in high school?  Did you have a job or anything?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was the baby (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I just thought I'd ask.  That just occurred to me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And my daddy cooked and washed clothes.  My brother [Joseph Bradford] cooked.  They did everything after my sister left home (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and you, you just had a chance to just be the baby.
Speaker 2: I was just the baby (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so, and, okay, so, 1955, did you leave immediately after graduation, or did you go in the fall, or--
Speaker 2: No, no, I left that summer after--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --graduation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638895
Speaker 1: So you're in Detroit [Michigan].  Now what, what side of Detroit did you all live on?
Speaker 2: I'm sure it was the west side 'cause I'm trying to remember the east side--the west side, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how did you like Detroit?
Speaker 2: I liked Detroit very much.  Detroit was happening at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So tell us about some of the things you liked about Detroit in those days.
Speaker 2: I guess maybe the, the avenues, the venues, the things that you could do, the sights and things that I had not seen or experienced before in Missouri, they were there in Detroit.  Another example, which probably later on, the story Jackie Wilson was our neighbor.  And you got a chance to see people that you knew succeed and, and do things that was not happening in Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now pretend that I'm somebody that's never been to Detroit, never--don't know anything about it whatsoever (laughter), and I'm living like, three hundred years from now.  So now tell us about Detroit (laughter) when you were there.
Speaker 2: Well, Detroit to me was a place where you could experience so much more in life than I had previously experienced before.  There were clubs that you could go to.  There were various schools of college, like there was the Wayne [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan]; there was the DIT [Detroit Institute of Technology, Detroit, Michigan]; there was other educational schools or career geared schools that you could go to.  There was just--it was diverse from what I had known before.  Even, even where we lived, the, the housing, the, the nice neighborhoods and yards, and, and just nice things was happening that we didn't have before.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were the names of some of the entertainment venues in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Well, naturally the 20 Grand [Detroit, Michigan] that's world known and the--there were skating rinks, which I'd never even seen before let alone knew how to skate.  There was Phelps show lounge, P-H-E-L-P-S [Phelps Lounge, Detroit, Michigan], that was pretty big at that time in Detroit.
Speaker 1: Were black people going to the Fox Theatre [Detroit, Michigan] then?
Speaker 2: Fox Theatre, not early on when I first came.  I'm trying to think of a club where my sister [Clea Bradford] used to work.  The Flame Show Bar [Detroit, Michigan], did I mention that?
Speaker 1: No.  Flame Show Bar.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there was one more I fail to remember.  But there were a lot of places to go and, and lots of things to do at, at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then your sister, you said at this time, she knew Jimmy Forrest, Ike [Ike Turner] and Tina Turner and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the St. Louis [Missouri] area, and she worked, she worked with all of those.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so those, those, those performers become nationally known.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, we're listening to them in Dayton [Ohio], you know, and everybody--everyplace else.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So I'm just--and her neighbors are Jackie Wilson, you said (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Jackie Wilson--
Speaker 1: Yeah, who--
Speaker 2: --in Detroit, yeah.
Speaker 1: --who becomes a superstar at a certain point in--by 1961 he's a superstar, at least in the black community anyway.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 638896
Speaker 1: Who did you meet on the entertainment scene [in Detroit, Michigan], 'cause this is the era when rhythm and blues and, and what--
Speaker 2: Well, through Jackie I met the [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's how Jackie had come to the house after "Reet Petite" and told my sister [Clea Bradford] that he wanted her to come down and meet his songwriter.  Well, by Jackie being our neighbor, he--even though he had a hit and I was glad, he wasn't the famous person in my mind.  This man that wrote his songs must have been the celebrity, had to be the celebrity or the hero.  And so Jackie say, "No, you're too young; you can't go."  And I say, "Well, I'm tall as my sister," 'cause I was just tall then as I am now--say, "I can dress up in some of her clothes, and I can look older."  And I begged and begged so finally he let me go.  And he did introduce me to Mr. Gordy, who, when I met, I was disappointed because he was a just a normal man.  And I don't know; I thought the celebrity supposed to had wings and a halo or something.  I don't know.  And that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So did you know about Berry Gordy at that point?
Speaker 2: I didn't know a thing about Berry Gordy.  I just know this man wrote songs for Jackie Wilson, and he had to be a celebrity.  And that's when I got angry and said, "Well, if you can write a song, I can write a song better than you can any day."  And eventually he did come by to hear my songs.  I had no songs, but I had the book of poems that saved my life.  And I went and got--I said here are my words.  I didn't even know the term lyrics.  And he looked at them, and a couple of months later I had two songs in Jackie's 'Lonely Teardrops' album, because he taught me how to take the poetry out and put the song in or the hook or you know, whatever, whatever may work.  So he did turn into an angel after all (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, so what was, what was Jackie Wilson's biggest--I mean hit at that time?  Was it "Lonely Teardrops"?  Was that--
Speaker 2: "Lonely Teardrops." He was working on the album.  And he was looking for songs, of which I didn't know or didn't even care.  I was just, you know, this, this celebrity don't look any different from any other man.  That's where I was coming from.  And you know, being a brash teenager, it just came out.  You know, "I can write this song good as you can" (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  But I, I was thinking like Jackie--now, did Jackie Wilson have a hit out at that time at all?
Speaker 2: He had "Reet Petite."
Speaker 1: "Reet Petite," okay.
Speaker 2: And that's why he wanted my sister to come down and meet his songwriter.  And then following "Reet Petite" he had "To Be Loved."
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And so this is 19--working on 'Lonely Teardrops,' this is 1958?  Is that about right?
Speaker 2: Fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957], okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, 'cause the, the album is published in '59 [1959], I guess, right?  And so you're working on it in '57 [1957]?
Speaker 2: Fifty-seven [1957]?  Wait, well, '57 [1957] is when I met Mr. Gordy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it had to be maybe late '57 [1957] or '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: So he already had "Reet Petite" out.  "To Be Loved" had not come out.  And I guess when they completed in the album, that's when "Lonely Teardrops" came out.
Speaker 1: Now, so what--well, start with, with Jackie Wilson.  Then I'll ask you about Berry Gordy.  But what was Jackie Wilson like?
Speaker 2: Jackie Wilson was a crazy Gemini (laughter).  He could sing.  I guess he was a Romeo.  He had so many women following him or whatever (laughter).  But he was, he was a beautiful person.  He was a beautiful person.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Wonderful performer.
Speaker 1: And what about Berry Gordy at that time?  You said he just seemed like an ordinary guy to you?
Speaker 2: Just, yeah, just ordinary, ordinary guy, didn't--just on meeting him.  Then once you do meet him and get in his present comp- company, you realize that he was really, really smart, really focused and dedicated in what he wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was Berry Gordy still working in, in, at Ford [Ford Motor Company] I think at that time, or had he--
Speaker 2: He had just quit.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause like he says, he quit the company, and his wife quit him.  So (laughter), so he was living with his sister, Gwen [Gwen Gordy Fuqua], when I met him, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he--had he formed Motown [Motown Records] yet?
Speaker 2: Oh no, he had not formed Motown.  He was still writing, as a writer for Jackie.  And then upon meeting, and see, Eddie Holland, he wanted to start his own management and producing on certain artists, so he signed Eddie Holland then because to do demos for Jackie because Eddie had so--sounded so much like Jackie.  And then next he signed Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, Marv Johnson, and was just doing productions on them, because The Miracles was first on End Records, I think then Chess Records.  He was farming out to other labels.  I forget what Eddie's first label was, but Marv Johnson was on UA [United Artists Records], and he was just producing them and selling the masters.  And then he decided well, let me do my own company, and then Motown.  Well, Tamla [Tamla Records] first was the parent company, and Motown and Tamla came later.
Story_ID: 638897
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were describing I guess we--sort of like what the process was of writing songs.  So you, you got like, the first--was the first big hit 'Money' ['Money (That's What I Want)'] with Jackie Wilson [sic.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now did this start off as a poem?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no.  Mr. Gordy [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] was in the recording studio, Studio A, as they call it now at, at, at the historical museum [Motown Museum, Detroit, Michigan], which was Hitsville [Hitsville, U.S.A., Detroit, Michigan] at the time.  And he was sitting there just playing this, this riff.  And I was down in the studio, a couple of other people, and Barrett Strong, and Mr. Gordy said, "I need a title; I need something that everybody want."  I said, "Money; that's what I want."  He said yeah, so we, we just started writing the song from there.  And Barrett was there, and he got Barrett to sing, and it just, just came together.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so the, the--that's Barrett Strong, right--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --who is, who was the original--
Speaker 2: Who, who was the first one, yeah, singer.
Speaker 1: --singer, yeah.  So, so how long did it take to, to do this?
Speaker 2: Oh, just--
Speaker 1: I mean to, to come up with a--the basic song.
Speaker 2: Just a few minutes really, less than a half an hour.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sometimes songs can take days, and sometime they just pour out like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember the one line (singing), "Your love gives me such a thrill, but your love won't pay my bills.  I need money," (laughter).  I think everybody remembers that line (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that's so true (laughter).
Speaker 1: So did you--what, what inspired it?  Was there any inspiration for this, this record?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, no inspiration other than probably needed to pay rent at that time (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  You know, you, you hear people say that kind of thing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, outside of the context of the song.  But did--so, did you have a sense at the time that you were writing something that was felt by a lot of people (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh, not really, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, now this is, now this is 1957 or so, '57 [1957], '58 [1958]?
Speaker 2: Oh no.  I met him in '57 [1957].  This was, had to be '59 [1959], close to '60 [1960], once he had formed his own company.
Speaker 1: Now, had you--were you--had you finished school at Detroit Institute for Technology [sic. Detroit Institute of Technology, Detroit, Michigan] at this point?
Speaker 2: No, I had not finished.  I think I was in my third, third year there and junior year there.
Speaker 1: What, what were you majoring in?
Speaker 2: Nothing special, just going to school 'cause I had to go.  My sister [Clea Bradford] threatened me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Were there any courses there that, that really, you know, focused your interest or, or any teachers at Detroit Institute for Technology?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I met a friend there that, I guess, after I got into the music and, and never really had time to study, who would do all most all my homework (laughter).  So it was a little different in college than it was in high school [Lincoln High School, Charleston, Missouri].  It wasn't as easy.  It was harder for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I guess I was living in two worlds.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you were living in the music world--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at this point.  Now is this a world that you imagined at all before you got to become--
Speaker 2: Not at all but one that I did not fear, because my sister wrote her own songs.  And I figured if she could do it, I could do it.  You know, if Mr. Gordy could do it, I could do it.  So, then after he really showed me, you know, really kind of what to do, it was, it was easy because it was already doing poetry, which I very similar.
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of the song 'Money,' how, how did Barrett Strong's version do?  I mean what, what, was it produced as a record? It was, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It, it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was, it was a big hit.  By Tamla [Tamla Records] being new, the predecessor of Motown [Motown Records], it, it just bust the seams out of, of our label.  We, you know, could not distribute all the, the records that was requested of us and so forth.  But Anna Records, Berry's sister, Gwen [Gwen Gordy Fuqua] and Anna [Anna Gordy Gaye], they were already established.  And we turned the, the first records were released on Tamla, but then we turned it over to Anna to go nationally with the distribution, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's a national version on, on Anna Records (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you, you, you can find old records on two different labels.  You can find it on Tamla, and then you can find it on Anna.
Speaker 1: Okay, named for his sister, Anna Gorry--Anna Gordy--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Story_ID: 638898
Speaker 1: Now, were, was the record ['Money (That's What I Want)'] produced as a 45 [45 rpm record]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is--45s are starting to become the, the--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, by then.
Speaker 1: So this is kind of, this kind of revolutionizes the, the industry, doesn't it, on some level?
Speaker 2: Very much so, yeah.
Speaker 1: And tell us why.
Speaker 2: Because I guess the accessibility of the smaller records that you could play basically anywhere, was easier to carry, easier to transport than the, the big records.
Speaker 1: Right.  I know many households that had the plastic disc you could sit inside the bigger hole as was inside the 45 to make it fit on an old fashioned--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --78 record player [78 rpm record player] or, or the kind of record player that usually played 78s and 33 1/3 [33 1/3 rpm record].  So, so in--now, I think, like, I don't remember older record shops, but I know when the 45s came out, you know, you could go to the corner in a neighbor and there'd be a record shop.
Speaker 2: Yes, you are so right.  How did we acquire the 78s?  I don't (laughter) remember where they come from.  But, but the 45s, you're right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they would cost like what?  What'd a 45 cost then?
Speaker 2: Like seventy-nine cent, yeah.
Speaker 1: Or maybe less.  I'm thinking, you know, you--
Speaker 2: May, maybe less.
Speaker 1: --could get them even less or two for maybe that price.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you have two sides.
Speaker 2: Yeah, A and a B side.
Speaker 1: Right.  So, and they start to stack up at home (laughter).
Story_ID: 638899
Speaker 1: So then Jackie Wilson had a version of "Money" ["Money (That's What I Want)"] on his album, right, on his 'Lonely Teardrops' album?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: He didn't?
Speaker 2: No.  There was a couple of songs that we did from, from the poems that I had.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what were the songs that appeared on Jackie Wilson's album?
Speaker 2: One was "The Joke (Is Not on Me)" and--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was that about?
Speaker 2: The song?
Speaker 1: Yes, "The Joke (Is Not On Me)."  Now it derives from a poem, right, of yours?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, that was about I guess a love affair, and the, the, the guy was cheating or whatever.  Anyway, but he wanted to come back to the girl, and she had somebody else, so whatever, the joke was not on me.  She had gone on with her life.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what was the other song?
Speaker 2: The, the other song was (singing), "And now love begins."  "And Now Love Begins," I think [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: "The Joke (Is Not on Me)," it was a single, but the other was--just remained an album song.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 638900
Speaker 1: You had a principal role in naming The Primettes, right, another name, right, give, giving The Primettes a new name?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And The Primettes, what was the--tell us that story.
Speaker 2: Well, Mr. Gordy [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] felt like the name need to be changed, I guess since he had changed The Primes to, from--to The Temptations or whatever.  And I came up with three names and put them in a hat, and Florence Ballard drew out The Supremes.  Now I've been asked a hundred times since, what the other two names?  God knows I don't know, 'cause like I say, at that time, we were just doing whatever had to be done, not thinking tomorrow or the future or god knows fifty some years down the line.  So, but she did pull the names out of the hat of the names that I had put in the hat, The Supremes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And The Primettes were the, associated with the, you said The Primes, who--
Speaker 2: The Primes.  Well, two of the Primes, which was Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks, because the other Prime had left the group, and it just left Paul and Eddie.  They be--Otis Williams [HistoryMaker Otis Clayborn Williams] had a group called Otis Williams and The Distants.  So--but they all merged and became The Temptations.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this is--were they--so in those days, so Mr. Gordy then was creating the--he, he was--I suppose that he, that he's the hand that creating this group, right, from the remnants of two other groups?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so this is--now had, had he established Motown [Motown Records] by, by that time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, this is 1960 when The Primettes become The Supremes.  And Motown's established, what, in '59 [1959] or?
Speaker 2: Fifty-nine [1959], early '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638901
Speaker 1: Now, there you have several other songs that you had a hand in that I have like, you know, names of here during the '60s [1960s], I'm not sure which comes first and 'cause I don't, didn't have the dates.  But tell us about 'Your Old Standby' by Mary Wells.  I think Mary Wells was the first big star?
Speaker 2: Yeah, female star that he has.  We-'Your Old Standby' was just a lyric--I knew, I knew the term by now, and I know how to write in song structure--that I had and I had given to Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson], and he took and put the melody to it and formed the song.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is the trick of learning to write in, in lyric form, in song structure then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In song structure?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: As, as Mr. Gordy [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] said, you need, definitely need a beginning, middle, and an ending.  You, you need to make good use of your title so it will stand out as the title.  And most songs, you need a good hook, something that may be sing along that people can familiarize with.  And they may not know a word in the verse, but they know when that hook come, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you need to have a beginning, middle, and end; you have to have a good title; and you have to have a hook.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you have to make good use of your title so it will stand out as the title.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you can, can feel--you can still find versions of 'Your Old Standby' on YouTube, and I think somebody just recorded one recently I think.
Speaker 2: I know it, it is right now on, on YouTube.  Mary Wells' version is getting a lot of hits.
Speaker 1: And another song is 'Tie a String Around Your Finger.'  Now this is--
Speaker 2: That was The Supremes [sic. The Marvelettes] was an album tune, but somehow it survived all these years.  And another I guess underground song for Carolyn Crawford, who never became a big artist, but 'My Smile is Just a Frown (Turned Upside Down).'  It still gives pretty good royalties.  It does get good play.
Speaker 1: Okay, by Carolyn Crawford.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now was part of the Motown [Motown Records]--
Speaker 2: She was part of it in, in the transition as we were moving, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When it was moving from Detroit [Michigan] out to--
Speaker 2: Out to L.A.
Speaker 1: --Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's another song--now you wrote a, a hit song for The Marvelettes too, right--I mean a song for The Marvelettes that did fairly well.
Speaker 2: 'All the Love I Got,' yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'All the Love I Got.'  And there's another one called 'Time Changes Everything' [sic.].
Speaker 2: 'Time Changes Things.'
Speaker 1: Just things, okay.
Speaker 2: That was The Supremes.
Speaker 1: Okay, The Supremes.  Now, the song, 'Too Busy Thinking about My Baby,' everybody knows that like 'Money' ['Money (That's What I Want)'].  That's like, that's a--
Speaker 2: That was for Marvin Gaye.  I wrote it with Norman Whitfield.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did The Temptations ever perform that one, too?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In fact, they performed it maybe four years or so prior to Norman recutting it on Marvin.
Story_ID: 638902
Speaker 1: So we're talking about 'Too Busy Thinking about My Baby.'  And so you--did, did you write that around '63 [1963] initially?
Speaker 2: Initially, yes, around that, around that time.
Speaker 1: And who did you collaborate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you'll notice I'll--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --say something about, I said something about, "Don't have time for my school books," or something; I mention school because I was still in school (laughter).  So, I guess you wrote according to what was happening with me at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, there, is there a story behind that (singing), "Too busy thinking about my baby and ain't got time" (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) "Ain't time"--
Speaker 1: --"for nothing else?"
Speaker 2: --"for nothing else."  Well, I guess that's the story there evidently (laughter).  I must have had my own some little cute boy or something (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that was performed first by The Temptations.
Speaker 2: By The Temps.
Speaker 1: And I think I read that Eddie Kendricks was the lead.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it's that time we call album songs.  You know, we had album tunes, and then we had hit tunes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So that was on an album and--
Speaker 2: And for The Temps.
Speaker 1: --and I remember, I remember it with the Eddie Kendricks singing it.  But then like, it really blew up when Marvin Gaye--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --sang it later.
Speaker 2: Well, Marvin was so hot at that time, so I think anything he would have sing would've blown up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now who did you collaborate with on that in terms of the music?
Speaker 2: Norman Whitfield--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for that one.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Did, did you have a favorite collaborator in terms of the music?
Speaker 2: No.  You know, we had Holland Dozier Holland and we had several group writers.  I never wanted to be in a group.  I never wanted to be confined.  I wanted to write with whoever I wanted to write with, so I did.  I kind of flitted around all over the place.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you--at--now what about--now this, this one intrigued me 'cause I had no idea.  But I'm a Junior--well, I'm a fan of all these people, but Junior Walker and The All Stars, you know, you, you wrote 'Hip City.'  And, and when I was looking I said I can't remember any lyrics for 'Hip City,' you know, but, but there actually were though, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, 'Hip City (Part 2).'
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So was this like the flip side of the 45 [45 rpm record] of 'Hip City'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it was the groove ins grooving continuation of the part one.  That was like a Mother's Day. And I got the phone call: "Junior Walker is in the studio trying to complete his album, and he need this song finished, so come on down."  So, that's how that came about.  It was, was not like I was working with Junior Walker at the time, but I did come down to help him out.  And we would do things like that for each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it doesn't seem to kind of be like the kind of song, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that, that tells a story the way your other songs do.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was more of a dance thing, naming cities he's going through and all this kind of stuff, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, and there's one called 'Contract on Love.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: That was on Stevie.
Speaker 1: Stevie Wonder, yeah.
Speaker 2: And that was with Brian Holland and Lamont Dozier.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you say you don't have, you didn't have a favorite collaborator--
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: --as such.
Speaker 2: --I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638903
Speaker 1: Any other songs that, that you--did you have a favorite song of all your songs you wrote?
Speaker 2: No, I really, really can't recall any one favorite song, probably a song that never got released.  That's the way it happens (laughter).  But I wrote so many I can't--one don't stick out in my mind right now.
Speaker 1: Were you amazed at all by the ones that became a hit?  I mean, you know, if you have a favorite song, you would--I guess you would imagine that that would be the one that would be the hit.  But some other song becomes the--I mean were you ever surprised about, say, money or any of the--
Speaker 2: Well, well, no, not really because, like I say, at that time, we did not know the value, or even what we were doing, let alone the value of what we were doing.  We were just kind of following the leader, and things were just happening.  And it was just kind of a, a natural state of things, you know, that was going on.  And there was no way we could have even imagined that fifty some years later I would be sitting here talking to you or anyone else and those songs still paying my house note and taking care of my kids [Lance Finney and Nicole Hobbs] and grandkids.  And you know, that, that's just unreal.
Story_ID: 638904
Speaker 1: Following the evolution of the songs, I mean the two songs, 'Money' ['Money (That's What I Want)'] and 'Too Busy Thinking About My Baby,' have been recorded by other artists all over the place.  And I think the beginning of the mid-'60s [1960s], the British musicians started recording your songs, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I think The Beatles were the first British that did and then the Rolling Stones, and right there, that gold record for Flying Lizards.  That was funny.  My daughter [Nicole Hobbs] went to school and told her teacher that I had written that song.  I said, "Why didn't you tell her I didn't write that production and arrangement?"  They rearranged, Flying Lizard, "That best things in life are free, but you can give them to the birds and bees."  It's one of those kind of (laughter)--I said, "Why did you tell her that," (laughter)?  But I got a--I'm proud of the gold record on the wall, so (laughter).
Speaker 1: The Flying Lizards.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, all right, so, so, is there a particular group that surprised, that you were surprised that even performed it other than the Lizards?
Speaker 2: Boyz II Men, because they sing such lush ballads, ballads all the time and blend their voices.  And when I--was, was about two years ago they recorded 'Money' and released as their single.  I was really surprised.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'Money' has also been heard on commercials, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, movies, commercials, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  How, but how, how many--could you, can you estimate how many, many commercial or movies this appeared in?
Speaker 2: Oh, maybe, movies, maybe about fifty, 'cause year before last I think it was in five movies at one time that same year, so maybe fifty or more.  In movies--commercials, I don't know, quite a few, and it's been recorded by various artists over three hundred times.
Speaker 1: So this song is--it's safe to say it's an iconic song.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I mean, it's something that's a part of popular culture now, and I don't think you could ever get it out of it, out of popular culture today.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I hope not (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about 'Too Busy Thinking About My Baby,' is that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Phil Collins and several others have, have recorded it, so it keeps pretty good but not compared to--well, very few songs compare to 'Money.'
Speaker 1: Yeah, something everybody wants.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, something that everybody wants (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, that was the question of the day.
Speaker 2: I gave the right answer.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think we're sitting here on the eve of the largest payout in lottery history.  I mean, there, there, you know, the what's it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Powerball is at the highest level it's ever been as we sit here today.
Speaker 2: And it's in Arizona.  We can't play here (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 638905
Speaker 1: Now, what about the business of, of making money off of a record like 'Money' ['Money (That's What I Want)']?  I mean, now what were the rules when you wrote the song, and, and how does that break down now, you know?
Speaker 2: The, in, in, in the making money off a song, usually the publishing and the writer, because, for instance, Barrett Strong recorded the first version.  He only got paid as an artist for his record.  Then The Beatles, they got paid for their version.  The Rolling Stones got paid for their version.  But the publishing and [HistoryMaker] Janie Bradford and Mr. Gordy [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] get paid off of every version because that stands alone, and they are owners of the song, not just of a version.  So every time somebody records it, the writers and the publishing get paid.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And as a rule, that, there, there's two organizations, ASCAP and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) ASCAP [The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]--
Speaker 1: --and B--
Speaker 2: --and BMI [Broadcast Music Inc.].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They're performance societies, meaning, when they're played on the radio or, or if somebody, a venue, now they even collect when they play it on stage or in a play or even in the movies you get from one of those performance societies, whoever you belong to.  I belong to BMI.
Speaker 1: Okay, so BMI actually has agents.  And I've met BMI agents at meetings for community festivals even.  They come and they announce that if you play 'Money,' for instance, and there're enough people present, you--
Speaker 2: You have to pay, yeah.  And that was not so years ago, but that is so now, that, yeah, somebody playing at that, one of their shows or whatever, you have to pay now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so--if you--the only thing that would save you is that you have no audience (laughter), or very little audience.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so on--for instance, a song like 'Money,' what, what is it--I don't know if you, you mind telling us, but how, how much does, does a song like that earn in a year?
Speaker 2: Well, well, it's according to whatever the copyright law is at that time.  Now, when years ago, when we first started and came out, it was only two cents.  Now, well, I'm back to the sales, two cents, so that, that would be for the sales.  Now it's like up to eight and half cent per record sale.  So it's based upon the, the scale of what you get paid.
Speaker 1: Okay, or say if I perform it in, in a lounge, and I have a lot like oh, you know, over the number of people there to hear it, how would, how, how much money would I owe?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, that, now that's hard to say, the, the performance end, because it, it is, it's not just cut and blank like the copyright law, like the sale of the record.  It's so many steps and so many reasons: if you perform it in a theater, if you, if it's performed in a play, if it's performed in a movie.  Every, every level is a different, different price, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: But usually, for a movie or on stage or whatever, they give you the--you get what is called a synchronization license.  They pay you X amount of thousand dollars up front just to use the song, for the use of it.  And then you get whatever their royalty rate per play after that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, anything else about the business of music publishing that we need to know?
Speaker 2: Well, just that the publisher owns it for (laughter) however long (laughter), however many pe- records it.  So, that's, that's how you really keep getting paid.
Speaker 1: And how, how, how, how many years does your copyright last?
Speaker 2: The copyright--well, at first when we started--again I have to go back to the beginning.  That's when I was really active--it was fifty-six years; it was twenty-eight and twenty-eight.  Now that has been extended to, I think, seventy-five years after death.  So your benefactors can, you know, benefit from some of it, it's not just cut off.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And I've heard some--the horror stories.  You've probably heard them too.  I think, I think Jimi Hendrix's family was--went through some trauma about his music being published after he passed and you know, fight about--well, there, there were probably lots of fights about money, in terms of artists that are--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, there, there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) now passed.
Speaker 2: --there are several artists right now that's fighting to get their publishing share or writer's share back for various reasons.  They might have been in a tight, needed to pay their house note, or buy a house, or whatever, and some of them sold it, and now they're trying to get it back.  Or maybe it was just illegally taken from them, and they're trying to get it back.  Thank God we did not have to deal with anything like that.
Story_ID: 638906
Speaker 1: You actually--at some point, you had a position I think with--well you, you actually worked for Motown [Motown Records].
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --I, I worked.  I wasn't--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --like a lot of them was just there only as a writer.  I, I worked from the inception of the company.  On, if you notice, I put on my application October 2nd, '58 [1958], because that is the day of our BMI [Broadcast Music Inc.] contract for the publishing (laughter).  I remember that date still, so I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --just use that as a work--start working date.
Speaker 1: So the, the publishing company was called Jobete?
Speaker 2: Jobete Music [Jobete Music Company, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was named after Berry's three children, Joy [Hazel Gordy], J-O, B-E, Berry [Berry Gordy IV], and T-E Terry [Terry Gordy].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Jobete.
Speaker 1: All right, so, so, what were your--you were like the--well, what were your duties with Jobete?
Speaker 2: Well, in the beginning when you're just forming something, there are no specific duties.  You do whatever have to be done.  But to pinpoint it more accurately, I was the receptionist, 'cause I sat on the desk and answered phone, and basically the copyright secretary, because we were copyrighting the songs, securing the songwriter's agreement from the writers, getting them to sign the agreements and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy had to have a, a good lawyer I guess when he started, right, to make (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, George Schiffer out of New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, was there, was there a story about someone who refused to sign or didn't want to (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well, now in the beginning it was sing a song.  It wasn't like the exclusive.  So if they turn in a song, then you got to sign--to give us the right to publish it, so it was that simple.  You know, maybe later on when the exclusivity came in, there might have been a problem or not.  But most of them were, if they signed to become exclusive, then they were getting paid, either getting a lump sum or they were getting a weekly or biweekly check, or monthly whatever they were getting paid.
Story_ID: 638907
Speaker 1: Tell us about I guess the, the--what, what would you consider to be the high poi- point of working with Motown [Motown Records]?
Speaker 2: The high point is the love and the unity and, and the family atmosphere.  You, you, you, you knew there were people there that you could count on.  In fact, like now, fifty some years down the, down the road, my best friends are from Motown, that the relationships formed at that time.  Still, like Marilyn McLeod, [HistoryMaker] Claudette Robinson, we still go shopping together.  We go to Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] together.  Claudette and I just went to Chicago [Illinois] together for the 'Evening With Berry Gordy' ['An Evening With Berry Gordy'].  So we do these, these kind of things, and, and it's like a family relationship that was formed at Motown.  So, it was just a good place to be.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when--now this is, this is something that's carried over from the, the big hit that I, I know a lot of people--guess I'm included--always think about, you know, the glory days of Motown as being in, in Detroit [Michigan], you know.  And do, do you have that kind of feeling about it, or do you, or do you think of it that way?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, that was because it was so many of us at that time still together.  Now so many of us have passed and gone on.  But the ones that are here still kind of clump together.  And even when we go back to Detroit, the ones there, it's like you never left.  You know, there's no, no time lost in between.  So it, it was, it was the glory, glory days at that time.  Because basically, again, we were young; we were making money; we didn't think today was coming; we just had a good time and spent and whatever.  Now today is here, and thank God for 'Money' ['Money (That's What I Want)'].  I can still spend (laughter).  No, no, but if it hadn't been, you know, you often think well, what would I be doing or what, you know, what would I have done without that period?  And so many of them can say I've had, or because maybe one song, they are legends.  You know, just so much came out of that time.  And the whole world knows about, well, at least the artists and a lot of the producers and arrangers and like The Funk Brothers.  The spotlight just was shining on, on Motown at that time (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 638908
Speaker 1: Now those are the musicians, The Funk Brothers.
Speaker 2: The Funk Brothers, the musicians--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --we--
Speaker 2: And whatever company the, the musicians that played on the record is as famous as The Funk Brothers.  You know, you can go to Capitol [Capitol Records]; you can go to Columbia [Columbia Records]; you can go to RCA [RCA Records].  You can think--you don't know them, not like you know them collectively as The Funk Brothers.  You know, may know one or two that came through.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we didn't know them back in the day when we were playing the records.  We didn't know who they were.  And--
Speaker 2: You didn't know the writers either--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --did you?  You only knew the artists.
Speaker 1: Well, the writers, you could see the name on the record, yeah.
Speaker 2: You could see the names, but you really didn't stand out like the artists.  It was basically then it was just the artist, but then everybody started to kind of--backstage people start kind of getting on the stage--
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and so then came The Funk Brothers.
Speaker 1: But I, but I think, like, it's recently, at least in, in the world I live in, that we, we, you know, figured out who the musicians were because they made a--there was a documentary ['Standing in the Shadows of Motown'] made about them and some other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But before then even.  That's how they got famous already to, to get a documentary made about them, 'cause they were all individually known even.  You knew what instrument they played, and then knew them by name.  And that has never happened before in the history of music, as far as I know.
Story_ID: 638909
Speaker 1: Do you have a special story about from the Motown [Motown Records] years in Detroit [Michigan] that, you know, that you consider to be like a high point?
Speaker 2: High point of, of--
Speaker 1: Of your career with Motown.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I have one that's almost embarrassing.  Brian Holland and Lamont [Lamont Dozier] came to me early because you remember they were just writing together before Edward [Eddie Holland] came aboard.  And they had said, "Would you come write with us?"  But you know, earlier I said I didn't want to team with nobody.  So, I told them, I said, "Well, you know, you all are just one time hit songwriters, overnight hits."  I said, "I have a standard.  I have 'Money' ['Money (That's What I Want)'] (laughter)," said, "I don't want to write with you guys," (laughter).  And so they said okay.  They went and got Edward and just bam.  Everything they wrote turned to gold.  But no problem with me (laughter).
Story_ID: 638910
Speaker 1: Now is there a period of time that there was a worst time at Motown [Motown Records] where, where you're afraid it wasn't gonna make it or something or that you--
Speaker 2: No.  It kind of just, just start hitting and just kept going, just kept going, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there was never a danger moment when you said uh-oh?
Speaker 2: Well, Mr. Gordy [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] may know of one.  I, I would not know of one because I was not handling the finances.  But to me it just looked like everything was going good, going up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I asked you about favorite collaborators, but did you have a favorite artist at Motown or a couple of favorite artists, maybe, that--
Speaker 2: No, I, I really didn't, you know, far as putting songs on and recording, no, I really didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, how did you--tell us about the transition of Motown, like moving from Detroit [Michigan] to Los Angeles [California], and, and how, and how you felt about it.
Speaker 2: Oh, I was all for it because, like I say earlier, every time I took a vacation I came to L.A.  And when I heard we were moving to L.A., I said, "Oh, goodie," so.  It was--he only, the only thing was the culture shock.  You know, I had this big house in, in Sherwood Forest in Detroit, I think four bedrooms, about three baths and all this, cost thirty-six thousand dollars.  You come out here, and a house that I could put in my living room in Detroit was almost a hundred thousand dollars.  So I wasn't ready for that kind of, kind of living culture shock.  But other than that, just visiting back and forth, I, I loved L.A., and I still love L.A.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And how did things change for you once you moved out, out here?
Speaker 2: Just trying to adapt or whatever, and it was, it was relatively easy once you adapt to what's going on.  All the other living conditions was basically the same.  It was just the house thing that was just a little hard, but everything else worked out.  So, it, it worked out fine for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, did you continue to work for the, for Jobete [Jobete Music Company, Inc.] here?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, up until the sale.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was in--
Speaker 2: It was '86 [1986], I think, eighty-something, I remember.
Story_ID: 638911
Speaker 1: Now, chronologically I'm challenged 'cause I'm not sure about everything.  But I guess in 19--well, 1974, now you're still working with Jobete Music [Jobete Music Company, Inc.].  You won the--you're a, a winner of the American Song Festival award, and there's a picture of you in the song book of your songs standing next to Paul Williams.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And someone is congratulating you and giving you this award.
Speaker 2: The song called 'Plant a--,' 'Plant a Seed,' yes, that I sent in and the Oak Ridge Boys performed it.
Speaker 1: It was called what now?
Speaker 2: 'Plant a Seed.'
Speaker 1: 'Plant a Seed,' okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that won the American Song Festival award (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, for inspirational.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They have divisions, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And now, when did you form Mountain Goat Music?  Was that after the, the mo--
Speaker 2: After the--
Speaker 1: --the sale of Motown [Motown Records]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is about 1986 or so?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so this something you had to do?
Speaker 2: Well, it was nothing--It was just something I wanted to do since I worked in publishing.  And I was familiar with publishing, and I know the value of publishing your own song.  So I fig- after experience with Motown, if somebody wanted my song, they can't have the publishing 'cause I've earned the right to it.  So that was why, as a protection to anything else that I might--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, what--do you publish other songwriters' works with Mountain Goat?
Speaker 2: Yes, only, only a few though, because I trying to just kind of concentrate on mine through there, but I have published others.
Speaker 1: Okay, any, any songs that we would know that, like--
Speaker 2: No, no, not yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We're working on that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Somebody publishes a 'Money' ['Money (That's What I Want)'] we'll (laughter), we'll know it.
Story_ID: 638912
Speaker 1: Now, you opened a music and gift shop in Beverly Hills [California]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Music Notes.
Speaker 1: Music Notes, okay.
Speaker 2: Music Notes gift shop.  Everything in there, even sheets, lamps, whatever it is, it's a music theme some kind of way.  It has a music theme.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so these are--yeah, I--on the website I saw jewelry and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --even records and stuff, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've--well yeah, I definitely do a collection of some old things.  That's the--they really, the collectors things, they're on dolls, Diana Ross and different people like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But how, how's business?
Speaker 2: It's pretty good, and this time of year, yeah, it really picks up.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, yeah, I was hoping to see it, and I, I, I, I may well before we leave town.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 638913
Speaker 1: Tell us about Heroes and Legends [Heroes and Legends Scholarship Fund].
Speaker 2: Heroes and Legends stemmed from Motown [Motown Records], really.  In the publishing office, my office was next door to, at that time, they called the song plug or the song pusher.  And I would hear him in there with various writers, and oftentimes he would turn down their song.  And I would think, well, now if he'd told them, you know, to change the melody a little or to start the song off with the hook or to catch them from the beginning, whatever, that song could have been saved.  And in my mind I was thinking well, I'm gonna help these kids, you know, when I get the money and can.  And being a Gemini, the other mind said (laughter), "You'll never get the money; just help them now."  So just, just cold turkey, I started putting to- together things for my first event.  And I, naturally I got [HistoryMaker] Mary Wilson.  I used the people that I know, so I had name value that I was honoring.  And people started to sending in congratulatory ads and whatever, and we got the money.  And from day one we've had a successful run.  And the purpose of it is to give these kids scholarships, but not just music, any form of the arts.  We've had dress designers.  We've had people behind the cameras.  We have cartoonists, you know, and actually music and whatever.  So any form of the arts, we give them scholarships to continue their prospective field.
Story_ID: 638914
Speaker 1: Who are some of the recipients of the Heroes and Legends scholarships [Heroes and Legends Scholarship Fund] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, one, one fellow I called when I was putting together a record label [Mountain Goat Music], I called the musicians union [American Federation of Musicians Local 47], and they switched me to this odd sounding name.  And it struck me.  I said I've heard that name once before, and it can't be but one person.  So when I got him, I asked, I said, "Are you last year's Heroes and Legends scholarship recipient?"  He's now vice president of the musicians union here in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then Steven Ellison, we gave him a scholarship twice.  When they continue, sometime we give them extended scholarship the next year to help them continue.  He is now--oh, what is his, his name?  Flying Lotus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He is so big in Europe.  He was just here at the Hollywood Bowl [Los Angeles, California].  He was here at the Ikea theater [sic. Club Nokia; The Novo by Microsoft, Los Angeles, California], so he went on--these are the kind of clubs and things he's working and, and playing now.  And then there was another, Ebony--what's Ebony's last name?  But anyway, they called her Lady Sticks.  So she, she's a drummer, and she have gone on to play for Sheila E. and a lot of the, the big names.  So, they do go on and continue, most of them.  But what happened, we give the scholarship to--they must be going to an art school first, even if it's a regular school, it must be an art department where they're studying whatever they tell us they're studying.  And we give the money to the school in their name, so they have to go in order to reap the benefit of the money.  And we try to give it to as many local art places as possible, so therefore, we help the school if the student should not go, which so far has never happened.  But you know, we kill two birds with one stone.  We're helping the school and the student at the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So these are local artists in the Los Angeles area?
Speaker 2: Los Angeles area or, or California, long as they're in California and so forth--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so far.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this has been going on for twenty-four years now.
Speaker 2: Twenty-four years.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.

Speaker 1: You've, from what I understand, you've, you've been, you know, sort of amping up your songwriting again now after--
Speaker 2: Well, you never really stop.  Only thing, we don't have that open door like when Motown [Motown Records] was just there where we could touch the--whoever was working on the album we knew or song and knew they needed songs.  So Marilyn McLeod, to who I mentioned, was still close friends with, she co-wrote 'Love Hangover' and some of the songs.  So she can sing, and she did have out a record ['(I Don't Wanna Dance Tonight) I Got Love on My Mind'] or so on Fantasy Records.  But we got together and we did some tunes, and we did an album on her, 'cause we were doing songs just to place with other artists.  So I said, "Well, let's just do an album on you, you know."  We can--now with the iTunes and the whatever, you can put it on CD Baby.  That's who we have it with.  You don't have to have a big record label or all this to, to get a hit or songs out.  So, we're getting some sales there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did, did you have any--I mean a, a future project you can tell us about that's a--
Speaker 2: That (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that you're working on?
Speaker 2: --that I'm working on right now?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No.  I just did some, a few songs that I'm try to decide, you know, if Marilyn and I want to get together and do another album or if I want to place them outside.  So, that, that's where I am now, but yeah, I'm still writing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is your sister [Clea Bradford] still performing, too?
Speaker 2: My sister passed--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --four years ago.
Speaker 1: Did, did you publish her work before she passed?
Speaker 2: No.  She published her own work, 'cause she was writing before I even started.  Yeah, she was doing her own songs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638916
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite--now I have to ask these kind of favorite questions.  (Laughter) I know you don't like to answer them, it seems--but do, do you have a favorite musician, you know, any, anybody, I mean for--out, out of any artists, whether they're at Motown [Motown Records] or not, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, well, yeah.  One was Marvin Gaye.  I loved Marvin Gaye; Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson], I liked Smokey's style, that little high voice; basically, but bar none, Gladys Knight.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what, what, what is it about Gladys Knight that appealed to you?
Speaker 2: Her voice, the sincerity.  You put her on that stool and turn out the lighting and here her sing 'Help Me Make It through the Night,' oh, my god (laughter).  Yeah, I just, I just love her singing, and she's a sister Gemini (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, so you were recently in Chicago [Illinois] for The HistoryMakers event ['An Evening With Berry Gordy'].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did--what were some of your thoughts as you were listening to I guess the life of Mr. Berry Gordy [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] being--
Speaker 2: My thought was to thank God that I came along in the same lifetime, you know, to be with this, these people.  The, the interview just really took me back, as you say, to the glory days in Detroit [Michigan], just had that feeling with, with everybody and the surroundment of love, you know.  It was really enjoyable to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638917
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.  You've lived through the great changes in the recording industry, but you also lived through the Civil Rights Movement and a lot of other changes in the black community.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, well, my hopes for the, the black community, that we stop hurting each other and we stop pulling each other down, you know, and, and let us grow.  For instance, it can be like the record companies I was naming: RCA [RCA Records], Capitol [Capitol Records], and Warner Brothers [Warner Bros. Records, Inc.], and the other, whatever.  But you mentioned Motown [Motown Records], and you mentioned Stax [Stax Records], and automatically they say, you know, there, there's a war.  There was no--you know--how come it can't be ten black record companies without them competing with each other like it can be ten white record companies?  Stop thinking in competitive terms and just be our own selves, be our own person, and think of yourself more as a person or individual and do what you gotta do, rather than so and so got a new house, and I'm jealous of him; I'm mad at him, or you know, pulling each other down.  That's, that's what I hope, we can grow to just become people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638918
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point in life, is there any major thing that you would go back and change if you could?
Speaker 2: I, I, I don't think so.  I know I've had ups and downs, mistakes and successes like everybody, but I don't think I would change a thing.  I think I enjoyed the experiences.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And likewise, when you look back on everything, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I would consider--you mean my legacy?  My legacy is my grandchildren.  I'm sorry forget (laughter), forget all the other things.  To me I guess that's why I'm here.  I just love those little boys.  Don't want anymore.  I don't have all that love to go around.  But yeah, my, my grandchildren I am most proud of.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638919
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your family.  I haven't asked you about your family.  You're, you're married, and you have grandchildren, children (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I, I am married to Dean Hobbs, so don't call him Mr. Bradford.  He didn't take my name, so I didn't think I should take his (laughter).  I said I love my daddy's name (laughter) like he loved his daddy's name.  But anyway, without him--I guess he feel about the grandkids like I do.  He's just there.  Right now he's not here 'cause he's gone, gone to pick the big one up from college.  He gets out at 11:30, so they'll be coming back in about half hour or so.  And he's just there doing whatever, you know, needs to be done with them, helping me with them.  So it's, it's just a blessing.  I have a son [Lance Finney] who lives out in Oxnard [California], and he works for--as a manager at Oxnard winery [Herzog Wine Cellars, Oxnard, California].  I love that.  He always bring me wine when he come (laughter) over.  And my daughter [Nicole Hobbs] lives in, in the Valley in North Hollywood [San Fernando Valley, California], and she helps me with the, the Heroes and Legends, the HAL Awards [Heroes and Legends Scholarship Fund].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you got a thirteen year old grandson, and we met me--
Speaker 2: Well, twelve.  He wants--
Speaker 1: Twelve, all right.
Speaker 2: --to be thirteen.  Yes, these are my daughter's, daughter's children.  And here in Beverly Hills [California] they have naturally better schools and better everything, so it's for the schooling, so forth, it's better they live here.  And you have to live at that address, 'cause Beverly Hills is very strict.  You can't live in the Valley with the mother and come over here and visit and then go.  You know, you have to be at that address, 'cause so many people did that just to go to the Beverly Hills schools, so they be on you now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 638920
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I can't think of anything.  If so, I'll wake you up at two in the morning and say yeah (laughter).  No, I can't think of anything right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you for your, for your--for the interview.  And the last question is--it's similar to legacy. Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a loyal friend, as a loving mother, and naturally a loving grandmother and the perfect wife (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're very welcome.
Story_ID: 638921
Speaker 1: Okay, that's, from left to right, that's me, [HistoryMaker] Janie Bradford, and [HistoryMaker] Mary Wilson.  We're at, we call it Detroiters picnic.  After we've came out from Detroit [Michigan] to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] we start having annual picnics.  And the year--when we come out, '72 [1972]?  So that's gotta be like maybe '75 [1975], '76 [1976], and we were at a Detroiters picnic out at Griffith Park [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Okay, left to right, that's me again, Janie Bradford.  In the center is Mums Gordy, Bertha Gordy [Bertha Fuller Gordy], Berry Gordy's mother, and Tommy Gordy, Berry Gordy's nephew.  And the baby in the corner is Nicole, who was born in 1972.  So from the looks of that picture, she's about two.  That's 1974, I would guess.  And again, that was at another Detroiters picnic.
Speaker 1: We're looking at, left to right, me, Janie Bradford, and Bobby Taylor at a Detroiters picnic, probably '75 [1975].
Speaker 2: That's Bobby Taylor of Bobby (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Bobby Taylor of Bobby Taylor and The Vancouvers, 'Does Your Mama Know About Me.'
Speaker 2: This picture is a much later day picture at the Heroes and Legends Awards [Heroes and Legends Scholarship Fund].  From left to right--it was a songwriters we honored that year.  And from left you have Eddie Holland of the Holland Dozier Holland team; you have Stoller of Leiber and Stoller [Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller] and you have me, Janie Bradford in the center; and you have Leiber next to me; and Brian Holland on the end of Holland Dozier Holland.
Speaker 1: That was in the late '70s [1970s] when Fran Heard [HistoryMaker Frances Maclin], who was our librarian, left the company, and we were giving her a going away party.  She got married.  And that's Mr. Gordy [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] standing, and that's me sitting, Janie Bradford.  And he's giving me a big hug.
Speaker 2: That, again, is at a picnic for who, I don't recall (laughter).  But that is my son, Lance Finney, and my daughter, Nicole Hobbs.
Speaker 1: Again, this is a photo from a Heroes and Legends Awards.  That was eight years ago, so that must have been 2004.  That's, through the left, my oldest grandson, my husband, Dean Hobbs, me, Janie Bradford, and my youngest grandson, Austin Merville [ph.].
Speaker 2: That is the year that Mr. Gordy got the star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, don't remember the year.  But that's, from left, me, Janie Bradford, center, Rebecca Jowls [ph.], who was his assistant at the time, and Mable John [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Mable John].
Speaker 1: That is my father, Reverend Richard Henry Bradford [Richard Bradford], oh, god, and the year, probably before I was born.
Speaker 2: That is at Jack the Rapper Convention.  Left to right, left, [HistoryMaker] Claudette Robinson.  Next to her is a famous deejay that was at the convention at the time, then Harvey Fuqua, and me, Janie Bradford, on the end.
Speaker 1: That was shortly after we came out to L.A. from Detroit, after the company moved out, and we were up in the Hollywood Hills [Los Angeles, California] at a party at Jim Brown's house.  That's my husband, Dean Hobbs, and me, Janie Bradford.
Speaker 2: That was at a record promotion party given by A&M [A&M Records] for Janet Jackson, and that's me, Janie Bradford.
Speaker 1: That picture is 1974, when I won the first prize for inspirational gospel at American songwriters contest.  That's me, left, Janie Bradford, and next to me is my husband, Dean Hobbs.
Speaker 2: That is about the year--I'm trying to think--Archie Levington worked for the company.  That's early '70s [1970s].  Standing by the files with the book, god (laughter), his name just left my mind.  I know him well.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You can come back to it.
Speaker 2: Okay--that, Robert Gordy is talking to Archie Levington, who would commute from New York.  He was over Jobete [Jobete Music Company, Inc.] at that time.  Archie Levington was the husband of 'Kukla, Fran and Ollie.'
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: The lady that played 'Kukla, Fran and Ollie,' Fran--
Speaker 1: Fran Allison.
Speaker 2: Fran Allison, yes.  And that's me at the board with the BMI certificates that we had accumulated at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Again, that's in '74 [1974].  Well, that says kickoff.  Oh, yeah, that's after.  That's for the next year.  That's '75 [1975].  Because I had one in '74 [1974], I was taking pictures with Paul Williams for the kickoff of the 1975 festival.
Speaker 1: American Music Festival [sic. American Song Festival].
Speaker 2: American Music.
Speaker 1: And that is in '74 [1974] in New York when I had won the American music songwriting festival with the Oak Ridge Boys.
Speaker 2: And that's me, Janie Bradford, at seventeen years old.  See, I told you I was young once (laughter).
