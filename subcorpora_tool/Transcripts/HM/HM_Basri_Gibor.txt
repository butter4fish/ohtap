Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm an interviewer today for the HistoryMakers archives.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My full name is Gibor Broitman Basri.  Actually, to be really correct, it's Gibor Saul Broitman Basri.  Gibor is G-I-B-O-R, Saul, S-A-U-L, Broitman, B-R-O-I-T-M-A-N, Basri, B-A-S-R-I.
Speaker 1: Alright, now is there a story behind your name?  It's unusual in the African-American life, so?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father was an Iraqi Jew, so my name has that derivation, really.  His name was Saul, so that's where that name came from.  Actually, Shaool (ph.) in Hebrew, and Gibor is a Hebrew word.  It means something like "strong hero."  The equivalent in Arabic is actually "Jabaar", so Kareem Abdul Jabbar is the same kind of a name.  It wasn't really being used as a name so much when he gave it to me, so he was a little bit ahead of the curve, but I gather that they do use it in Israel sometimes now.  So, Saul was his name, Broitman is my wife's maiden name, and Basri is related to the city of Basra in Iraq, so it sort of means "from Basra."
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, well thank you.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: May 3rd, 1951, and New York City, Manhattan.
Speaker 1: Okay, and sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a professor of astrophysics at [University of California], Berkeley, and I'm also the Vice Chancellor for Equity and Inclusion at Berkeley.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: (laughter) Good question.  Looks like today's date is March 9th, 2011.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in Oakland [California], Jack Lemmon Square.
Story_ID: 30450
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now before we go into depth, there are five People Magazinish type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone, and they only require short answers.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Ah, not totally.  I like ethnic foods.  I like Thai, Indian, Chinese, those kinds of foods as long as they're spicy enough.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: These days it's kind of forest green. It used to be blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Ah, I think summer is my favorite time of the year.  You know, when I was just a faculty member, summer meant I could dive into research, could go on vacation--so, yeah.  Of course, here in California we don't have real seasons, so it doesn't matter as much exactly what time of year it is here.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Ah, beaches actually.  I love beaches, especially in the Caribbean [Sea].
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, on my e-mail signature, I say "Live long and prosper", so perhaps that's it. (laughter).
Story_ID: 30451
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family, separately.  Now we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Phyllis Claire Whyte, P-H-Y-L-L-I-S, C-L-A-I-R-E, W-H-Y-T-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know if she wants me to tell you that. (laughter).  But she was born March 3rd, 1917 in Kingston, Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about her side of the family?  How far back can they be traced and what's the story?
Speaker 2: Well, the interesting thing is, I participated in the National Geographic [Magazine] DNA test thing that they--I guess they're still doing it, and I did my mother's [Phyllis Claire Whyte] side because I thought I knew more about my father's [Saul Abraham Basri] side.  And it came back with a very strange result.  I have, and I should say she has, none of the mitochondrial mutations associated with any of the human migrations, which means that she should be from East Africa, where Eve was, which is a little unusual, because most of the slaves came from West Africa.  But apparently she's from East Africa.  She doesn't know that, she knows her Jamaican heritage, so clearly she was brought over, her ancestors were brought over as slaves to Jamaica.  What I do know is her maternal grandfather [Joshua Whyte] was Scottish, and most of the other side was African also.  So, that makes me one-eighth Scottish three-eighths African and I have relatives who have blue eyes but they all have fairly dark skin.  She was one of the darker skinned members of her family, and her father was African, and was, he was a kind of a lawyer in Jamaica, and had a stroke fairly early on.  So, she didn't know him very well.  He couldn't speak most of her childhood.  So, she had a very strong mother, who I did know, my grandmother [Hulda Whyte].  And they were kind of--I think because of the Scottish side, they were, I'd say, upper middle class in Jamaica, which was relatively affluent.  So, they had a big house and a number of people that worked for them.  They lived in Kingston [Jamaica] most of the time, but they lived in Mandeville [Jamaica] and a couple of other places a little bit.  She had a very kind of English upbringing, you know, boarding school, governess, that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 30452
Speaker 1: Okay, so they were doing fairly well in Jamaica?
Speaker 2: They were doing fairly well.  Her mother [Hulda Whyte] bought a number of properties and rented them out to folks and then they--the way Jamaican law worked, they eventually lost most of those, because if people lived in the house long enough, they sort of let them have it, and so most of the, almost all the family is not in Jamaica anymore, actually.  Most of them are in the U.S., either in Miami [Florida] or Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a story about how she came?  Did she come at an early age to the U.S., or did she come...?
Speaker 2: No, she grew up in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, her family viewed her as sort of the least promising of the girls, so her sisters went to England for their college education, and her father [Joshua Whyte] said he wasn't going to pay for her to go to college, and she, she was fairly rebellious.  She said, "Well, I'm gonna go to college" and she took off.  She went, she actually went to England and I found out recently that she was there during the blitz, actually.  She was in London [England].  She went with a couple of friends and then came over to New York, where she went to Columbia University [New York, New York], and she put herself through Columbia with both a bachelor's degree and a master's doing secretarial work and working as a child caregiver.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did she study at Columbia?
Speaker 2: It was really related to dance.  It was physical education and physical, things like that.  She wanted to be a dancer, and she actually did dance professionally for awhile.  She danced with Martha Graham, and did a lot of, you know, she was one of these dancers--you know, the dancers worked really hard, so she would either be working to earn money, going to school, or--and then as she got into dance more, she would have dance--I guess, lessons or rehearsals several hours a day, and was quite a dancer at that point.
Speaker 1: Dancing with Martha Graham is challenging...
Speaker 2: Yes, it was chal- she said it was challenging, she said it was challenging.
Speaker 1: Prestigious, too, to get to dance with Martha Graham.  She's one of the...
Speaker 2: She knew Merce Cunningham, also.
Speaker 1: Yeah, these are some of the giants of dance.
Speaker 2: So, I think she really enjoyed that phase of her life.
Story_ID: 30453
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, now let me go to your father's side of the family.  How far back can you--well, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is Saul Abraham Basri, S-A-U-L, A-B-R-A-H-A-M, B-A-S-R-I.
Speaker 1: What is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Let's see, his date of birth is February 15th, 1924.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so what can you tell us about that side?  How far back can you go with his side?
Speaker 2: So, that side is--goes much further back, because the Iraqi Jews were actually the longest contiguous Jewish community in the world.  They trace back to biblical times.  If you read the Bible, the Jews were defeated and captured by Nebakanezer.  I think it's 2500 B.C., maybe it's 2500 years ago, but a very long time ago.
Speaker 1: Yes, it was 2500 years ago, I think.
Speaker 2: And he was taken to Babylon.  He actually took the sort of upper crust of the Israeli's back to Babylon with him, you know, the people who had crafts and so on.  And then seventy years later, King Cyrus of Persia conquered Babylon and he told the Jews they could go back to Israel, and about half of them did, and the more accomplished ones who had been, already gotten settled in Babylon, and you know, were already doing well, stayed in Babylon and they sent support to the ones in Israel.  And that community in Babylon was almost continuous since that time until the present, or actually until 1948.
Speaker 1: In those biblical passages, we wept by the shores of Babylon.
Speaker 2: Well, right, that's right.  Babylon--it figures in, it figures into Jamaican religion, too.
Speaker 1: [inaudible]
Speaker 2: Right.  Bob Marley has a song.  Anyway, so the Jewish community was there and it was very well entrenched.  There were about 150,000 Jews in Iraq at the time that Israel, the state of Israel, was formed, and then the circle completed, you know.  The Iraqi government kicked all the Jews out around 1950, and they--so the remainder of them returned 2500 years later to Israel.
Story_ID: 30454
Speaker 1: Now my father [Saul Basri] had left Iraq earlier, so he, when he was growing up, the government had started towards a Fascist bent, and when he was in middle school, they kicked the Jews out of the public schools, and so he actually went to high school with an American Jesuit school in Baghdad [Iraq].  And this was right at the time World War II started.  So, he graduated high school in 1942, you know.  It was in the middle of a war, there were bad things happening in Iraq to Jews.  He was kind of holed up in the American Jesuit School.  He was a, he liked science and he wanted to be an engineer.  So, he asked the Jesuits where should he study engineering.  So, it's very hard for me to picture this, you know, this Jewish kid kind of hiding in Baghdad, saying, "Where should I go for engineering?"  But the Jesuits said, "Well, you should go to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]."  (laughter).  And he said, "Yeah, okay, I'll apply to MIT."  You know, this is 1942 (laughter).  So, MIT didn't actually have that many students.  Most of the American students were now off at war, too.  So, they said, "We have absolutely no clue how you would ever get here, but if you get here, we'll accept you."  So, his father [Abraham Basri], he was also a kind of a lawyer in Baghdad, and had some connections, and they kind of bribed their way over to Suez and he hopped a Liberty ship going back to the U.S. after he crossed the Atlantic [Ocean].  So, he crossed the Atlantic in a Liberty ship.  You know, there were still U boats around.
Speaker 2: Can you kind of expand on what a Liberty ship would be?
Speaker 1: This was a big fleet of supply ships that the United States had built to bring supplies over to England and Europe to support the war.  So, they traveled in convoys, and you know, the U boats preyed on them somewhat, but--.  And he had studied, I mean, he spoke Arabic, and some Hebrew and he had studied French and he had studied some English in school as well.  And, he says on the way over, the sailors spoke English, so he kind of honed up his English, and by the time he got to the U.S., he could make his way.  And when he got to MIT, I think he had fifty dollars, and very little way to get money from Iraq at that time, but he started in engineering and decided he wanted to be a physicist, so he got a physics degree from MIT.
Speaker 2: He started in 1942?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '42 [1942] or '43 [1943], so he finished in something like '47 [1947].  My mother [Phyllis Claire Whyte] was at Columbia [University, New York, New York], and he went to Columbia for graduate school, and she was still there to get her aster's.  They both lived in the international house at Columbia, and that's how they met.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was kind of an American melting pot sort of story.
Story_ID: 30455
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's quite a story.  Now, so they [Basri's parents] met in the international house.  Is there a story they tell about how they met?
Speaker 2: Ah, you know, they just--you know, my father [Saul Basri] said he saw this pretty woman, and she seemed to like him.  She was a little older than him, and she was a dancer, and he liked to dance.  And yeah, I don't know, they just got--and they were both living there, so they somehow got together and then moved out and got married.  So, they got married in probably '49 [1949], and I was born in 1951.  He was still working on his PhD thesis at that time.  He finished it the next year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they discuss their different backgrounds being an obstacle or anything to getting together, or was it--how did they approach that?
Speaker 2: They both, you know, had left their families, left their countries.  They were pretty open-minded.  I think probably both their families were a little bit surprised by this marriage.  You know, it was interracial, it was inter-religious.  She was raised Anglican, so I think neither family thought this was a very traditional thing to do, but they were also far away from their families, and my mother [Phyllis Claire Whyte] converted to Judaism, so I was raised Jewish.  And, you know, they didn't, they never spent a lot of time back with their families, you know, they visited very occasionally back to Israel or Jamaica, but every two or three years we might spend a little bit of time in one of those places.  So they were really independent in becoming Americans, and they did their own thing.
Story_ID: 30456
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, you were born in New York City [New York].  Now, your father [Saul Basri] went on to complete his studies at--did he finish at Columbia [University, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he finished at Columbia, and got his PhD there and then he got an offer of a faculty position at Colorado.  It wasn't Colorado State at the time.  I think it was Colorado Agriculture and Mining, or something, the Aggies in Fort Collins, Colorado, but now it's Colorado State.  It turned into Colorado State University [Fort Collins, Colorado] a few years after he came.
Speaker 1: Okay.  About what year was it when he...?
Speaker 2: Well, I think we went out to Colorado in '52, maybe--'52 [1952] or '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have a brother, and he was born in '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was born in Colorado?
Speaker 2: Actually, my mom went back to New York, and he was born in New York as well, just sort of for that.
Speaker 1: And then came back out.
Speaker 2: We had some family, there were Jamaican relatives that lived in New York also.  In fact, I found out that this Aunt Evelyn, who had a house in Brooklyn [New York], she died a number of years ago, and Spike Lee bought her house and filmed one of his movies in this house that I played in as a kid (laughter), so there was a little bit of a Jamaican branch up there.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's an interesting story.  Tell us, now you all are out in Colorado, and there are no relatives out there at all?
Speaker 2: No, we were very isolated, and Fort Collins [Colorado] was a town of twenty thousand at that time.  It was a college town, but it was a fairly small college, and it was, it wasn't rural, you know, but it wasn't a big town either.  There were maybe thirty Jewish families in the whole town, and practically no African-Americans.  There were some Hispanic people who worked, you know, farm workers and stuff.  But it was pretty white, pretty Christian.  So yes, we were anomalous in Fort Collins.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have an earliest memory growing up?
Speaker 2: I do remember when we first came to Fort Collins, we lived in the faculty apartments, and I remember being like three or four, and my memory is a spider, about this big, you know, that was in the basement that scared me a lot. (laughter). That's one of my early memories.  I remember playing outside in the sandbox with my mom [Phyllis Claire Whyte].  There were Quonset huts near these apartments, and those old aluminum Quonset huts--I remember we had a couple of friends over there, and I would go play with their children.  So, those are all memories from about maybe two or three, when I was two or three.
Story_ID: 30457
Speaker 1: Okay, can you describe the neighborhood you grew up in?  Now, did you grow up in Fort Collins [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I grew up in Fort Collins.
Speaker 1: Can you describe the neighborhood or neighborhoods that you grew up in, and tell us what were the sights and sounds and smells when growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, so we lived in the faculty apartments, which were about five story brick buildings right on campus.  So, really that was my first neighborhood, and they had these Quonset huts next to it, so that was the first neighborhood.  There was a big, open field right next to them.  There was a playground and sandboxes and stuff right outside the apartments, and then just this big, open field.  I mean Fort Collins, it was, it had farms right up, practically right up to campus at that time.  My mom [Phyllis Claire Whyte] would go over to a farm about three-quarters of a mile away and get fresh milk, you know, right from the cow, basically.  For a fair amount of time when we were growing up, she had these big gallon jars, and she'd go the farmer would fill them up with milk and she'd set them out at home and the cream would separate.  There would be about this much cream on top.  She'd skim that off, and then we'd have the milk and the cream.  So, it was a little farm-like in that sense, but it was, we were right on campus, too, so there were lots of kids, you know, graduate students and faculty kids around that I would play with.  I think I did go to pre-school.  And then we built a house, so that must have been in 1957.  So actually, I'm a little confused about whether--I think we must have built it right after we came back.
Story_ID: 30458
Speaker 1: So, when I was five, my father [Saul Basri] decided to apply for a Fulbright Lectureship.  He wanted to travel, and so he got a Fulbright Lectureship to Burma [later called Myanmar].  He was going to go as a physics professor, and we were going to go live in Burma for a year.  This was before Burma had become a dictatorship.   So, it was a British colony still, basically.  It was independent, but very British in some sense.
Speaker 2: Burma changed names?
Speaker 1: Yeah, now it's called--well, some people still call it Burma, some people call it Myanmar.
Speaker 2: Myanmar, that's right.
Speaker 1: This will happen again later in my life, too.  There will be a place that will change it's name (laughter).  So, it was a funny trip.  He needed to stay longer, I think, in the U.S. and then get there more quickly.  My mother wanted to travel through Asia, so my brother [David Basri] was two and a half, or one and a half--no, two and a half, so he was two and a half, and I was five.  We went up to Seattle [Washington] and got on a slow boat to China, literally.  We took a freighter out of Seattle and went up the west coast to Alaska, and then over to Japan and then down to Hong Kong [China].  It took several weeks.
Speaker 2: What a memory that must have been.  Did you get a chance, were you fascinated by the ocean?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I mean, you know, and there weren't many passengers on this thing.  They had like ten or fifteen passengers.  They just carried a few passengers when they made this trip, for people who wanted to do it that way.  I guess--my parents weren't well off, you know, they didn't really have any assets except my father's [Saul Basri] salary, so they wanted to do it cheap, so I guess this freighter was cheap.  And yeah, I have memories of Alaska, you know.  We stopped in Ketchikan [Alaska] and my brother almost fell overboard.  It wasn't really a boat for a little kid like that.  We were in Japan--er, Korea, we stopped in Korea, and he kicked his shoe off the side, and then he was going after it (laughter) and one of the sailors grabbed him, so that was a little scary.  I remember my mother was not happy about that.  But, we saw Korea and Japan and Hong Kong.  I remember when we got to Hong Kong we stayed in a hotel that was much fancier than we were normally used to.  For one night, they just let us stay there.  And then we traveled over to Burma and met up with my father and we lived there for nine months.  So, I went to kindergarten in Burma, and they were on the British system, so they were already teaching arithmetic and things like that, which Americans weren't doing in kindergarten at that time.  And, being a five year old, I also picked up enough Burmese to kind of talk to the kids and get by, so I was the most Burmese adept in my family.
Story_ID: 30459
Speaker 1: Okay, did you catch up with the kids that were there pretty easily, or did...?
Speaker 2: I don't, I think I did okay.  You know, I'm pretty smart, I'm good in school, but it was strange.  But I hadn't been in an American school yet, so this was my first experience with school.  So, I think I did okay, yeah, and learned some Burmese and learned some arithmetic.  And my mother [Phyllis Claire Basri], you know, had this real affinity for the British system of education anyway because that's what she had done in Jamaica.  So then when we came back to the U.S.--well, let me finish that part of the story.  So, we stayed in Burma for nine months, and then we traveled, we continued in that direction, you know, going west.  So, we then traveled through Southeast Asia, and you know, India, and the Middle East, and then stopped in Israel and saw my father's [Saul Basri] family, and then up through Europe.  And then my father went on back home and my mother--actually, we stayed in London [England] for six months.  So, then I went to the first part of first grade in an English school in London as well.  So, I had a, by the time I came back home for second grade, I was kind of a cosmopolitan guy for Fort Collins [Colorado] (laughter).  I'd had quite a set of experiences at that point.
Speaker 1: You'd seen the world.  You went all the way around the world, basically.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, we did it again when I was fifteen.  I'll get to that, but...  So, then, I was kind of ahead in school, having done this English stuff.  So, I was about a year ahead in math and reading, and my mother tried to get me skipped a grade, and they wouldn't do it.  So then she said, "Alright, well you're just going to stay a year ahead anyway."  So, she would get the books for the next year, and make me study those at home, and I'd go to school and kind of be bored in class because I already knew most of what they were talking about.  But, it did enable me to seem really smart to the other kids.  So, I think that helped, you know.  I was like the only black kid in the school, but you know, I could help people with their homework and so on, so I didn't get much hazing or anything.  People kind of, I think, saw me as an asset for the most part.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, because I wondered how you all were treated.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there wasn't much overt racism.  There was--you know, kids occasionally would do stuff, but I had a, I was confident enough, if they started calling me stuff, I'd just kind of look at them, like, "You must be nuts." (laughter).  And it wasn't the virulent stuff that they had to deal with in a lot of other places then.  We did travel through the South once.  On one of our trips to Jamaica, the parents decided to drive there.  So, from Colorado we drove all the way to Miami [Florida], and we went through the Deep South.
Story_ID: 30460
Speaker 1: I'm going to cut this computer off because it's making so much noise, clanging.  Alright, you were telling us about a trip through the South.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, my father [Saul Basri] was, he wasn't too tuned in to this whole business of racism and so on, but my mother [Phyllis Claire Whyte] was.  And so, he says, "We're going to drive down to Miami [Florida], and we'll go to Jamaica from there, it'll be cheaper."  And the route he picked, you know, we drove south from Colorado down to Texas, and then across that way, and this was about 1960, maybe '60 [1960] or '61 [1961], something like that.  So, my mother didn't like the idea much, and as we got into the South, she got more and more nervous.  And we were camping also, we were, you know, we weren't going to stay in hotels or motels, we were going to camp.  So, we go to these campgrounds, and they'd all, they'd say, "Well, there's no room."  And my father would look around and he'd say, "What do you mean, there's no room." (laughter).  "Well, how about right there."  And they'd say, "That's taken."  My mom would say, "Let's move on here."  So, there was a lot of tension through that trip, nothing beyond that happened, but I came to understand that it was very uncomfortable.
Speaker 1: Others have told me that students that were in the black colleges said that if they wanted to get into a movie theater sometime, they would pretend to be of another ethnicity, not from the United States, and wrap their head up with something...
Speaker 2: And they'd let them in?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'd let them in.  It seemed like it was particularly this thing for American blacks...
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: And confusion when it came to people from some other place.  Did you notice any of that when you...?
Speaker 2: What I did notice, was my mother viewed herself as a little different from American blacks.  You know, she was a Caribbean black and, you know, that tension still exists today to a certain extent.  Plus, she had grown up kind of British, so she spoke with a refined accent.  You know, she didn't sound like regular Jamaicans, she sounded kind of like a refined Jamaican.  And she, she really didn't view herself as American black, but she did think everybody else did, until they talked to her, and then they realized, well, she's not from the South.  But, she wasn't comfortable, and she would keep warning me about, you know, you need to watch this stuff.
Speaker 1: What did your father make of American race attitudes?
Speaker 2: He tried to ignore it, I think.  Of course, he's not--so, my father looks Middle Eastern.  He doesn't look African-American.  If you remember what King Hussein of Jordan looks like, that's close to what my father looks like.  He's the kind of guy who likes to ignore stuff if he can, so, I mean, this would happen socially a lot, too.  You know, my mother would say, we wouldn't get invited to stuff or whatever, and she would say, "That's because they don't think we belong there."  And he'd say, "Oh no, it's just they forgot", or whatever.  He wanted to gloss it over as much as possible, and she was more tuned into it.  And so he--she didn't want to drive through the South, and he didn't think it was going to be a problem, so that was typical, actually.
Speaker 1: When he encountered, something blatant like when he knew there was room and they told him it wasn't...
Speaker 2: He came to see that that was what was going on, and in fact, then he started getting nervous.  When I saw 'Easy Rider' later in my life, I thought, you know, that was really dumb, what we were doing there.  You know, we'd camp in these campgrounds and we'd be by ourself and stay there all night, and no clue about what the local deal was.  It wasn't that smart, frankly.  So, he saw it then but, you know, he put it aside as much as he could, even after that.
Story_ID: 30461
Speaker 1: Did he [Basri's father] experience any prejudice from the Jews here?
Speaker 2: From the Jews or the Christians?
Speaker 1: From the American Jews.
Speaker 2: You know, I'm actually not sure.  I've encountered it many times.  People are surprised, you know, it's like, when I go to the temple, it's like, "Oh, it's great you came, what's your name?"  And I'll say, "Gibor."  And if they know Hebrew, they're like, "Gibor?" (laughter).  "You know that's a Hebrew word."  And I say, "Yeah, I know that."  In fact, this happened a week or two ago to me.  This woman said, she says, "How'd you get that name?"  And I said, "Well, my father gave it to me."  And she said, "Oh, where's he from?"  And I said, "Iraq"
Speaker 1: And that really threw her.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she said, "Wow, really, Iraq?  What are Jews doing in Iraq?"  And I said, "Maam, as it happens, the main Jewish community, the most continuous one in the world, was in Iraq, and they actually wrote most of the Talmud."  And, she's like, "Really?"  (laughter).  You know, somehow the European self-absorption, I don't know what to call it, happens with Jews as well as--happens on that line as well as racial lines.  So, yes, I've seen that quite a bit.  I don't know whether my father got that or not, because he wasn't dark, so.
Speaker 1: Well, this is America, that's why I asked.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I didn't know it, and I'm guessing he would have interpreted it more benignly if he possibly could.
Speaker 1: I'm supposing he wouldn't look much different from some of the Jews from other countries who were immigrating?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, well, you know, he's Semitic.  So, there's Middle Eastern Jews, there were Jews all around the Middle East, Jews in Iran and Turkey, you know.  So, the Polish and you know, Eastern European Jews don't always remember that.
Speaker 1: Right.  They kind of predominate in the U.S. and German Jews and Polish Jews....  So, you were talking about school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was talking about that trip, but we were talking about school.
Story_ID: 30462
Speaker 1: What was the name of your school there in Fort Collins [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I went to Dunn Elementary [Fort Collins, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, I was starting to tell you, but you asked about my neighborhood.  So, after we got back from Burma, my dad [Saul Basri] says, "We can build our own house now."  So, we built a house, you know, to his design.  It was at that time, it was only about half a mile away from where we were before, but it was kind of on the edge of town then.  Now, it's in the middle of town.  Fort Collins has gotten much bigger, but it was kind of on the edge of town, right off campus [Colorado State University], a new neighborhood, very suburban, you know, kind of houses, one story ranch-style houses.  So, we built that and we moved there, and that's where I grew up after that.  And for a while it was just our little street there and then slowly neighborhoods grew up around there.  But I remember there was an irrigation ditch, you know, it was a farm down at the end of the street where it started being farms again.  There was an irrigation ditch, and we used to go down and play in the ditch, and it would freeze over in the winter, and we'd skate on it.  So, that was a neighborhood that was sort of right at the edge of town, originally, and then by the time I was in high school, it was, you know, the suburbs had gone out three or four more miles that way, so now it was kind of in the middle.
Story_ID: 30463
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm tempted to ask this question.  You seemed to have spent some time in Colorado.  The sky looks a little different.  Were you aware of, you know, were you fascinated by the sky as a child?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Well, what happened--I mean, yes.  The stars were much more visible and they were especially more visible then, you know.  The town wasn't real big and didn't have a ton of lights, and the air is very clear, and you're up at five thousand feet...
Speaker 1: I'm even thinking about the trip, too, on a boat being out on the ocean, out there being so clear.
Speaker 2: It was, and in Burma [later called Myanmar], there weren't that many city lights at night, either.  So, yeah, I was used to dark skies--that's right, not like here in the Bay Area [California].
Speaker 1: It is such a big difference.  If you live in a big city, you really don't see the sky.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, the Milky Way was very familiar to me.  A lot of people who grew up around here have never seen it at all.
Speaker 1: Did your father [Saul Basri] and mother [Phyllis Claire Whyte] ever discuss the sky with you?
Speaker 2: You know, the way I got interested in astronomy was actually when I started reading.  So, when I came back from that first trip, I picked up a science fiction book pretty early, kid's science fiction book.  It was like 'Zip Zip and his Flying Saucer' or something like that. (laughter).  In fact, that was the name of it.  And right away, I got fascinated by the idea of space.  So, that plus the stars--so, pretty soon after that, I started expressing more interest in the sky, and my father bought me a little telescope, a lot like the one Galileo had.  It was like two lenses, you know, and like this, and it was about the same magnification Galileo had.  I could just keep that by my bed.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: I was probably eight then, eight or nine.  So, I had it by my bed and yeah, now that you mention it, I'd go to bed and I could just open the curtain and stick my telescope up against the window.  I remember I would look at the orion nebula.  The sky was nice and crisp and dark.  That was good stuff, right from my bed.  I didn't even go outside, I just looked out from my bed.  So, he [father, Saul Basri] encouraged my interest in it.  Well, yeah, I said he was a physicist, so he thought it was great that I was interested in the physical world, so he certainly encouraged me to be interested.
Story_ID: 30464
Speaker 1: What kind of physics did your father [Saul Basri] study?
Speaker 2: It's a very different kind.  He was a mathematical physicist.  So, it was all theoretical.  He just had a pencil and paper.  He actually was a bit of a sort of logician and philosopher as well.  So, he wrote a book during my childhood that was based on something Bertrand Russell had said should be doable.  He said you should be able to figure out what the basic axioms of science are, if you like, and from those, derive your way all the way up through some branch of physics.  So, my father set out to derive from basic axioms the special theory of relativity, using only symbolic logic.  So, this book is, you know, it's not readable, it's in symbolic logic, it's not really in English.  And my mother [Phyllis Claire Whyte], who had been a secretary, typed for him and she had to get all these special symbols for the typewriter, and it was, you know, a year's long project that he had, very esoteric.  And the other thing he worked on was sort of the mathematics of the fundamental particle theory.  Now, he was not on the right track, so when Murray Gell-Mann developed what's now the standard theory using a particular kind of algebra, it was what my father was also trying to use in algebra to develop a particle theory, but he was using a different one, and so he stuck with it for a long time, but it didn't really ever fly.  And he didn't care, he was very clear that he wanted to work on extremely basic problems.  He didn't really care whether other people thought that was worthwhile or not.  I think he cared whether he succeeded or not, but it was mostly in the twine.  He thought that was the noble effort to make.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He was a true research scientist in that sense?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but actually really more of a mathematician almost.  His department didn't actually appreciate that so much, because he didn't publish that often, and when he did publish, it was very difficult material.  Only a few people were sophisticated enough to really understand it, and none of them were, I don't think.  So, he didn't do that well in terms of advancement in the faculty arena, but he was a good teacher and he liked teaching.  So, he did a lot, you know, he did that well.
Story_ID: 30465
Speaker 1: Okay, now was the temple a big part of life?  Did you all go to the temple?
Speaker 2: There wasn't actually even a temple in Fort Collins [Colorado], so the holidays were celebrated by gathering in somebody's house or after awhile, the community was big enough, they'd rent a hall or something, but a synagogue actually didn't get built while I was growing up in Fort Collins.
Speaker 1: What did your father [Saul Basri], did he consider himself an Orthodox, or...?
Speaker 2: You know, he grew up Orthodox, pretty religious.  When he left Iraq and studied physics, he decided he wasn't really religious, he was a scientist.  So, although we had the Jewish culture, and I went to Hebrew school, you know, and I learned the usual things, he wasn't, he didn't really push that.  He didn't really believe in the details of it, and he conveyed that.
Speaker 1: I know when you mentioned Bertrand Russell, I was thinking that when people get into a deep mathematical philosophy which may be hard to maintain in an Orthodox religion.
Speaker 2: Yes, I think that my father found it impossible.  He couldn't square what was in the Bible with what he knew about the physical world and physics, and he decided he was a rational empiricist.
Speaker 1: Okay, but like a lot of Jewish people, they maintain their people-hood around the culture.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'A', you know, we maintain the culture, and 'B', of course, his whole family was in Israel.  So, we maintained that connection.
Speaker 1: Did he ever consider moving the family to Israel?
Speaker 2: No, he never did.  He liked the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  Now, he goes, he wins another Fulbright Lectureship while you're still in grade school?
Speaker 2: No, that one was when I was in ninth grade.  I would have been in ninth grade.
Story_ID: 30466
Speaker 1: Okay, let me finish grade school [Dunn Elementary School, Fort Collins, Colorado] first, and I'll just ask you some questions.  Did you have any, were there any special teachers or mentors that you remember in your grade school?
Speaker 2: I remember Mrs. Mason in fourth grade.  I liked most of my teachers.  I liked school.  So, actually I have fond memories of grade school.  I remember there were some twins, Kathy and Karen Kaza (ph.), I think.  They were in my class, so we were together for awhile.  The teachers liked me, I was a very good student, I guess.  I already knew what they were teaching, because my mom [Phyllis Claire Whyte] was actually my teacher at home (laughter).  She was the one making me do the homework and stay ahead and so on.  So, when I'd come to class, you know, I could answer the questions.  I was kind of bored, but I wasn't acting up, so I would use my boredom to do more work or to answer the questions or just--I enjoyed studying, I guess.
Speaker 1: I suppose it's all a functional personality, training at home, you know, we were talking to someone else earlier in the week who was way ahead, and they acted up in class.  They just--
Speaker 2: Oh, you could have done that.  High school was a little different, but I never acted up.  But what I did in high school was, I'd ask to be excused so I could do something that I considered more worthwhile, and they would let me sometimes.  But yeah, so I just kind of coasted.  I remember in fifth grade, I had basically straight 'A's except my handwriting wasn't very good.  So, they had a contest.  You'd get baseball tickets if had straight 'A's, and so I had a 'C' in handwriting, but I had 'A's in everything else for all the grades, and so they sort of said, "We're going to give you a ticket anyway.  Maybe the handwriting thing is not really what we were concentrating on here."
Speaker 1: To what do you attribute the bad handwriting? [sound of train passing].
Speaker 2: I moved back to my home town about 2006 and sounds I hadn't heard since I was a kid, the train coming back at a certain time of day.  It just seemed like, so right, there it is, there's the sound of the train.
Speaker 1: Well, I hear them at night here too, and I used to hear them in Fort Collins [Colorado], and I'd be in bed and it'd be late at night, and I'd hear the whistle blow.
Speaker 2: I didn't hear them in Chicago [Illinois], where I lived, I never heard them.  When I got back and heard the sound of the train, it just brought back all these memories.
Speaker 1: Right, it still does that for me.
Speaker 2: Okay, let's see.  I forgot what we were talking about.  Okay, we were talking about grade school, and you said--I was asking you about your handwriting.
Speaker 1: Oh, my handwriting, right.  You know, I'm not artistic.  Art was another issue for me.  I think I just didn't have great fine motor skills, and that was the problem.  Eventually, I worked on it enough to have decent handwriting, but it just wasn't great.
Story_ID: 30467
Speaker 1: Now, were you athletic at all?  Did you play sports?
Speaker 2: I played sports.  I was never super fond of sports, but I did, I played little league baseball, and we played touch football and that kind of stuff, you know.  Actually, tether ball was, that was my sport in grade school [Dunn Elementary School, Fort Collins, Colorado] (laughter).  We had some vicious tether ball games, you know, because we played, if you got hit by the ball, then you lost.  So, we'd be trying to wrap on the pole, but then you'd suddenly hit it the other way and try to hit the person.  So, one of the few almost fights I got into, we were having like the tether ball championship and I smoked this guy, you know.  He thought I was going to wrap the final bit, and I hit it the other way, and it hit him right in the face and broke his glasses.  And he came after me and we almost fought, but we decided we weren't going to get in trouble (laughter).  He did something to me later on, but...
Speaker 1: It was just embarrassing, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I mean, and it surprised him and I broke his glasses (laughter).  So, I was competitive, I was competitive.  People--I was fast.  I wasn't that great, actually, a hitter for example.  In baseball, what I would do, people had a tendency to think, "Oh, here comes the black kid, he's going to knock it out of the park."  So, they all back up, and I hit these grounders to third, and I was fast enough I could beat--you know, by the time they'd get the ball to first, I'm already there.  Then I'd steal bases, and that was my game.  Of course, eventually they got wise and stayed up, but I could still beat it.  You hit a slow grounder, and by the time anybody could get to it, I was already there.  So, I enjoyed that but I really didn't take to sports as something I really wanted to do.
Speaker 1: I read that you were really interested in science fiction books, maybe the movies, I don't know.  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I had gotten the bug early and so yes, I read a lot of--When I'd come home from school, typically, and one or two things would happen.  We would--so, the neighborhood [Fort Collins, Colorado], you know, got a little bigger.  There were a number of kids between my age and my brother's [David Basri] age, a number of boys.  So, we would often play war.  We had our toy guns and we would break up into two teams and go to the opposite ends of the street and then we'd sort of have guerilla warfare down the street.  And another thing we would do-so the campus [Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado] was building up rapidly during this time period, so we'd go over to the construction sites, and we'd go in the basement and whatever.  We weren't supposed to be there.  That was very exciting, and ride our bikes around town a lot, that kind of stuff.  Or, I'd go home and I'd read.  I intended to read like four books a week.
Speaker 1: That's a pretty good pace.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were easy books and, you know, if I wasn't going to go out and play, I'd come home, I'd get a pack of saltines, I'd get my book, get in my bedroom and just read the book until I finished it.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite author, science fiction author?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Arthur [C.] Clarke, Asimov, and Heinlein.  I mean, it was all the big sci fi guys back then.  I loved all that, so I ate all that up.  Then there's lots of other lesser known--what I really liked was the imaginative worlds people would come up with.  And also, good science fiction has social commentary in it as well, so I really liked all those aspects of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were about, you were in high school when 'Star Trek' came out, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 30468
Speaker 1: Well, let's take you to high school.  Did you go to high school at Fort Collins [Colorado], too?
Speaker 2: What we have to do now, we have to go to ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, ninth grade, alright.
Speaker 2: In ninth grade, my father [Saul Basri] got another Fulbright Lectureship, and this one was actually for Pakistan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, this time we traveled together.  Again we traveled on the cheap, so we'd stay in these, you know, flea bitten hotels, and we'd take buses and third class trains and stuff.  But we went, this time we went around the world the other way, so we went to Europe first.  We worked our way through Europe.  My dad [Saul Basri] really wanted to see everything, so he had everyday planned out completely.  You know, we would see this church, that church, that museum, this exhibit, that church (laughter), and we'd be exhausted by the end of the day.  You know, we'd stay in a city two or three days, and we'd move on.  So, I got a very enriched tour of Europe, eventually working our way down to Israel again.  stayed with his family for a couple of weeks and then we went from there to Iran where he had some relatives also in Tehran [Iran], and from there to Pakistan.  This was 1965.  And we get to Pakistan and we're stationed in Lahore [Pakistan] which is right on the Indo-Pakistani border.  We'd been there about a week, and the Indo-Pakistani war breaks out, and Lahore is kind of on the front line, so we can hear artillery in the distance, and there is actually a machine gun round up, up and down our street one night.  It turns out the Pakistanis were shooting at each other, but they thought they were being invaded.  And the American government got very concerned about all this, and evacuated dependents after about a week.  So, my mother [Phyllis Claire Whyte] and brother [David Basri] and I flew out on a C1-30 out of Lahore.
Speaker 1: That's a big cargo.
Speaker 2: A big cargo plane, back to Tehran, which was at that time--you know, the Shah was still in power, and we'd just been there, we'd just stayed with these relatives, so they took us back in.  They were quite well off.  Actually they had a very nice villa in a nice part of Tehran.  My dad, though, got left in Lahore, and he was supposed to make his way from Lahore back to Tehran on his own.  You know, nowadays, that would be nuts (laughter).  But he spoke Arabic, and it took him about a month to get back joined up with us.  And I actually keep meaning to ask him the details of that trip.
Speaker 1: It must have been interesting.
Speaker 2: So, I went to this American school in Tehran for a month while we were waiting for him to catch up.  Then, the question was now what were we going to do?  And the Fulbright Foundation said, "We're going to reassign you to Ceylon."  It was called Ceylon [later called Sri Lanka] at that time.  I remember, I heard that, and I said "Where is Ceylon, I've never really heard of Ceylon."  I remember going into the library at the American school and looking it up.  "So, it's a big island just south of India.  Great, we're kind of in the neighborhood anyway."  So, then we flew down to Ceylon and I went to school, to ninth grade, in Ceylon in a public school.
Speaker 1: Is that what we now call Sri Lanka?
Speaker 2: Sri Lanka.  It was not Sri Lanka then, but there were rumblings about that, and there also rumblings about the conflict between the Ceylonese and the Tamils, which then developed into a civil war which lasted almost twenty years, but...
Speaker 1: The Tamil tigers are still out there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're still there, right.  So, this was brewing when I was there.  But the school I went to had three tracks.  It was English, Tamil, and Ceylonese, and everybody was together and I had Tamil friends and Ceylonese friends, and it was an all-boys' school and it was an English system again, so that was pretty interesting.  So, I had stayed ahead in the American system, but I was not on the English system.  So, I get to this school and they say, "Well which track do you want to be in?  Obviously English, but you know, is it arts or science or what?"  So, I said "science."  They said, "Okay, here's your classes."  Calculus, trigonometry, statics, mechanics, all these subjects I really never heard of.  "And the exam's in a month," they said.  I said, "What exam?"  They said, "You have one exam per term, at the end of the term, and it comes from England, and everybody takes it."  And I said, "Oh, well that's not going to be so good, I don't even know what calculus is." (laughter).
Story_ID: 30469
Speaker 1: So, it turns out this school is a bit of a travesty.  The students are there, most of the teachers are there.  They're not teaching or learning, though.  It's kind of a joke.  So, they're on this British system, and they get their exams from Britain, but they haven't done any homework and most of the teachers weren't any good, and the students weren't very serious.  They all get serious, it turns out, the next year.  After ninth grade, they're going to have to take their o levels in a year or two, then they try to learn everything they were supposed to have learned all this time, so this was like the last goof-off year.  And it's an all boys' school.  So, I took the exams in a month.  I remember I got six, six out of one hundred on the calculus exam.  I'm like, "I'm a straight 'A' student, I've never seen anything remotely like this."  It turns out that six is not too bad, actually (laughter).  I'm like in the middle of the class with a six, because nobody's taking it seriously.  So, my father [Saul Basri] quickly figured out that this is something of a sham.  So he starts--he says, "It's a good idea to learn these things anyway."  So, he starts teaching me basically at home again.  So, I had a lot of home schooling, kind of like on the side, if you like.  So, I went to school everyday, and we goofed around.  This class was like these classic movies, you know, where everybody sits at their desk like this.  The teacher is at the front, nobody has a book, he has a book.  He opens it, we all have these blue books.  He starts reading the textbook, we write it down.  That's class (laughter).  So, this is pretty boring for teenage boys, right.  So, he's there, and then this spitball goes by him, and he's like "Who did that?"  And everybody's looking very serious.  And if he catches them, then they have to stand up, and he like punches them and knocks them across a couple of desks, or he sends them to the prefect's office and they get caned.  So, it's just, for me, it was a phenomenally amazing you know year, just kind of a huge entertainment, and you know, like wow, things are very different here.  But, you know, I learned at home some of these things.
Speaker 2: Was it easy being tutored by a theoretical mathematical philosopher?
Speaker 1: Well, he [father, Saul Basri] was a good teacher, as I said.  So, yes, it was good.  He could tell--what I didn't understand, he could explain it, and show me how to do it, and I could learn it, so that was good.
Story_ID: 30470
Speaker 1: Through all of this, did you and your brother [David Basri] get along?
Speaker 2: My brother is a lot more emotional, risk taking, energetic kind of guy than I am.  I was kind of the good kid.  You know, I just did what I was told.  If I didn't like it, I kept it to myself and went and read my books whatever.  My brother would rebel much more often.  He'd get into more trouble.  He was more social, had more friends, and so on.  He went to an American school there.  I was in the Ceylonese school, but he was in an American school.  There were a couple other Americans in this school, too that I was at.  He was doing fine.  He wasn't as into academics as I was at that time, but he was smart and later he got into it, so he was okay, but he'd also get in trouble.  He was more of a--and he and my parents [Saul Basri and Phyllis Claire Whyte] would have more conflicts.  He'd stand up to them, and he'd say, "I'm not doing that."  They'd say, "Really?" (laughter).  We had spanking in my family, but it was very formalized, so they wouldn't haul off and hit you or anything, it was like--they'd said, you know, "If you do that, you'll be spanked." And if you did it, then you had to hold your hand out, and my dad [Saul Basri] would get a ruler or sometimes a belt, and he'd hit your hand.  It would hurt, but it was very controlled, so it didn't feel out of control at all.  They were disciplinarians, but in a, I would say, a pretty healthy way if you're going to be doing that kind of thing, and we totally understood what the deal was, and it was always very consistent.  So, you didn't have to guess about any of this.
Story_ID: 30471
Speaker 1: Okay, this is, you're in Sri Lanka, and this is 19...?
Speaker 2: This is 1965, '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: How long did--you all stayed there until 66' [1966]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we stayed there basically the school year, so September of 65' [1965] to May of 66' [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay, here comes the good part, at least, for me anyway.  You had a chance to meet Arthur C. Clarke.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  So, we belonged to Otter's Swim Club [Ceylon] and, of course, I was already a huge science fiction fan.  I'd read a number of his books, and one day somebody points him out to me at the club, and they said, "Do you know that's a famous author."  I said, "Really, who?"  They said, "It's Arthur C. Clark."  I said, "You're kidding."  But it was.  He lived in Sri Lanka.  For awhile, he lived there for sort of six months, but then he started living there full time, basically.  So, he was there.  So, I went up to him, and I said, "Wow, I'm a huge fan of yours."  And, we got to know each other, and he got to know my father and, you know, we became family friends.  My mother [Phyllis Claire Whyte] liked him a lot, too.  She liked that he was British.  And we had dinner with him a number of times and we'd swim and talk, and he was working on a movie with Stanley Kubrick (laughter).  So he's telling me about this movie, and it's going to be great, so I was really looking forward to it.  It wasn't finished by the time we left, so when I came back to the U.S., I couldn't wait for '2001: [A Space Odyssey]' to come out.
Speaker 1: It came out in '67 [1967] or '68 [1968], I think.
Speaker 2: Maybe '67 [1967], I don't think I had to wait that long, but, yeah, so I had a chance to-- And, then he actually, he came out for a couple of the moon shots to give a commentary on CBS [Columbia Broadcasting System] television, and he actually visited us in Colorado, you know.  Since he was in the U.S., he actually came out.  So I have pictures of him in Fort Collins [Colorado], he just came by to see us.
Speaker 1: He's an interesting figure because he--I was surprised when I found this out, and I must have found it out I guess when I was early in my adult life, right after I saw the movie, that he actually was a scientist and a science fiction writer.
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.  He was kind of an engineer scientist.  So, he came up with the idea of communications satellites.  Something he always said, he said, "I didn't patent it, I should have patented it."  Then he says, "But actually it wouldn't have worked because the patent would have run out before we actually had communication satellites." (laughter).  But, it was his idea to have satellites and geosynchronous orbit around the earth that could, especially if you have three of them, you could kind of cover the earth and send signals anywhere.  So, when you make a cell phone call to Europe, that's what's happening.  So, yeah, and he had a lot of other interesting science ideas.  There's another one that obviously hasn't happened yet, but it's the space elevator idea.  And he writes that book, 'The Anchor of the Space Elevator' in Sri Lanka.
Speaker 1: Explain what the space elevators are?  I've read about it in the 'Discover [Magazine]', or 'Scientific American [Magazine]', or something, but it's actually a thread or a, almost like a...?
Speaker 2: A cable.  What you need is, it's the same starting idea, so during the geosynchronous orbit, which is about twenty-three thousand miles out, the orbital period is the same as the rotation period of the earth.  So, the thing that's orbiting will stay over the same spot on the earth the whole time.  So, what you have to do is, you have to go there and you start unreeling a cable in both directions, so part of the cable unreels towards the earth, and the other part unreels away from the earth.  So, the part going away wants to orbit more slowly, but the part going towards wants to orbit more quickly, and so they'll balance each other.  But, they'll pull, you know, one wants to go behind, and one wants to go in front, so it turns out you have to have an extraordinarily strong material, stronger than any material we currently have.  But, in theory you could have a cable that's strong enough to withstand that pull that's due to centrifugal forces, basically of orbit.  Then you have to unreel all twenty-three thousand miles down to the earth, and twenty-three thousand miles out the other way, so this is a rather ambitious idea.  And then anchor it at the earth.  And it's better to anchor it near the equator, so Sri Lanka is actually well positioned for that.  Once you have it in place, then you can run an elevator up and down the cable, just in a normal elevator kind of way.  It'll crawl up the cable, basically.  Much, much more energy efficient than trying to launch something, so once you have that in place it would be easy, energetically easy to go up and down into space on this cable.
Speaker 1: Now, this is an idea that if you explained it to most people without really explaining the science of it, they'd say, "Oh, that's crazy."
Speaker 2: Yeah, well it would be very ambitious (laughter).  But, it's not theoretically crazy, and others have worked out more details about how you would do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, hopefully that explains it.  Did you discover anything surprising about Arthur C. Clarke that you...?
Speaker 2: He was just a very nice guy.  I mean, I wasn't surprised to find that he had a lot of amazing ideas about the future, and you know, thought very sort of deeply about where humanity was going.  That wasn't really a surprise to me, but it was very interesting.  I was more surprised about how friendly he was.  You know, he was just like a regular guy.  He didn't make a deal about his fame, really at all.  You know, as I said, he came and visited us on his way to Cape Canaveral and Walter Cronkite, and dropped by to say hi.  So, that was fun.  Then I lost touch with him for a very long time, and then about eight years ago, I had a post doc at [University of California] Berkeley who was from Sri Lanka, who knew him quite well and gave me his email address, and we got back in touch, and then we corresponded again until he died.
Speaker 1: He died about three years ago?
Speaker 2: Yes, something like that.
Story_ID: 30472
Speaker 1: When you got back, I'm sort of jumping ahead a few years, so we'll go back to high school.  What did you think of the movie ['2001: A Space Odyssey'], since we're on the subject?
Speaker 2: I thought it was amazing.  The special effects were amazing.  The ending puzzled me, even though I heard his--the way it came out in the movie was really not the way it comes out in the book.  And, the movie was more perplexing, I think.  So, I was a little surprised by that, but all the imagery and so on, that was very new then.  It was kind of a breakthrough, the way 'Star Wars' was a breakthrough in special effects.  So, it was huge.  I went and saw it several times.
Speaker 1: I and probably other people thought about 'HAL 9000' [Heuristically programmed Algorithmic computer 9000] when Watson [IBM supercomputer] played 'Jeopardy' a couple weeks ago.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Watson, the super computer that can speak perfect English and...
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, the thing about Watson was it understood puns and so on, which is--on the way to HAL [9000] (laughter), that's right.  Yeah, I mean, that's a trope that [Arthur C.] Clarke put out there that I still--it's still a pretty powerful trope--I hear, "Open the pod bay doors, HAL."  That gets used regularly in conversation that I hear.  Yeah, that made a big impact on our culture, too.  I think maybe that was the biggest impact of '2001: A Space Odyssey', was this idea of the intelligent computer, but it's a little dangerous.  You know, it's not the first time that it had been done that way, but it was done very effectively.
Speaker 1: I think when you think about how the future is portrayed in science fiction, and how they were projecting what 2001 would be...
Speaker 2: Yeah, well we didn't quite get there.
Speaker 1: Well, we didn't set a mission on Jupiter, but at the same time, I mean, in some ways we're beyond what was going on through that.  HAL was a great big main frame, and...
Speaker 2: That's true, that's true.  Yeah, they didn't have I Phones in 2001.  Those are much more amazing than anything they had going.  That's right, so in some ways we have, but we don't have regular space tourism, but I guess it's approaching.
Speaker 1: Can you think of a Starship Enterprise [from 'Star Trek']with the whirring blinking lights, you know, you just wonder what's going on, when you watch the old series, you say, "What were they doing?"
Speaker 2: You know, the best thing I liked about one of the later Star Trek movies--and my theory is, keyboards are something we're not going have around for too much longer, although I'm not completely sure that's true.  But, the ability of computers to understand speech and what you want, you should be able to ask for it--so there's this great scene in one of those 'Star Trek' movies where they travel back to the 20th century, I forget if it's 'Star Trek 4' or something like that, and [Leonard H. "Bones" McCoy] wants to get on the computer and the mouse is sitting next to it, and he picks up the mouse and he says, "Computer on." (laughter).  And he talks at it all kinds of ways, and the computer doesn't pay any attention.  I thought yeah, that was thinking ahead, why should we all be keyboards, when computers can just understand us?
Story_ID: 30473
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Okay, now you went back to high school at Fort Collins [High School, Fort Collins, Colorado]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, just to finish the Sri Lanka story, then when we left Sri Lanka, we traveled through Asia again, and actually while we were in Sri Lanka we did a couple of big tours of India, and then we went back through Asia, Thailand, and the Philippines, and back up to Hong Kong [China] and Japan, Hawaii, home.  So, that was kind of like the other trip that we'd taken, but it was in the opposite direction.
Speaker 1: You were older by this time?
Speaker 2: Right, so then I was fifteen, so that made a much bigger lasting impression on me than it had the first time, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I went to high school back in Fort Collins [Colorado].  So, one problem I had was the grades that I had from Sri Lanka. They didn't have anything to do with anything, and they were in weird courses.  And then I had a very checkered set of grades because some teachers gave you a grade based on this English exam that you took that they hadn't been teaching to, and some just made up a grade.  So I had basically straight 'A's up through grade school and junior high, then this mish mosh of grades in ninth grade and then basically straight 'A's in high school.  And so then for you know valedictorian and for college admissions, I had to explain what was going on in ninth grade (laughter).  Why does my record look so strange?  So, I always had to write letters and explain that you should discount these grades entirely--this wasn't real school at all, basically.
Speaker 1: Okay, so had you decided in high school that you were going to be a physicist, that you were going to purse physics?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had.  What actually happened just before we went to Sri Lanka in eighth grade, we had to do a project on--a career report, and at that time I was still hot on astronomy as a career.  So, I did a career report on astronomy, I researched it and found out that it was a very small field, that there were less than a thousand astronomers in the U.S., and not a lot of job opportunities, and it didn't seem like a very practical career to me.  And so, I kind of abandoned it at that point, at least from a practical point of view.  My father [Saul Basri] told me, he says "I don't know whether that career would work or not, but if you study physics, you'll leave the door open to that."  He said, "I know you like astronomy a lot.  Study physics.  Physics opens a variety of options, but astronomy is one of them, so you should do that."  So, that was my intent then, to do that.  So, I kept up with my physics.  I again had gotten ahead in Sri Lanka mostly through the home schooling, so I sort of kept that up in high school.  So, I was fairly well-positioned, at least coming from Fort Collins High School.  I knew when I left high school and went to some big university, I was going to be in with a different crowd of folks, some of whom would have even better preparations than I did, and that certainly proved to be true.  But in Fort Collins, I was quite well prepared.
Speaker 1: So, did you have very good teachers in Fort Collins?  Were they still kind of behind you in Fort Collins?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, my father was the best scientist I knew.  The high school teachers were not up to his level, and I knew some of the other university scientists.  I didn't take courses from them, but...
Story_ID: 30474
Speaker 1: Did you have a chance to do any apprenticeships or anything at the university [Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado] when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: The summer before I went to college, I did, but not before that.
Speaker 1: So, what did you do that summer?
Speaker 2: That summer, I worked at the, I worked with an engineer who was a friend of the family's at a hydraulics lab that was associated with the university [Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado].  It was a dumb job, okay.  He wanted river flow data.  The USGS [U.S. Geological Survey] printed all this river flow data in these books, and computers were now being used really for the first time in the last few years than to do scientific analysis.  He want all these numbers translated onto Fortran coding sheets, so somebody could type them up onto punch cards, so he could run computer programs.  So, he hired me to write all these numbers down in all these books into the coding sheets, but he said, "If you do that, I'll teach you computer programming."  So, I said "Alright, that sounds good."  I hadn't learned computer programming at that point.  So, that summer I spent a lot of time copying numbers, which you know was so boring that I kind of got into a Zen state.  I could think about all kinds of other stuff and get the numbers down right.  But then I learned how to code in Fortran, which turned out to be, I really liked.  That's kind of, the rest of my career regardless of what I've been doing, I've been doing it with a real element of computer programming in it.  So, that's where I started that.
Speaker 1: Fortran they say is like learning a different language.
Speaker 2: You know, all computer languages are actually pretty similar.  So, it's certainly not English, but it's a computer language like most of the other computer languages, in the sense that it has certain features, dew loops, and four statements, and so on.  There's a certain syntax to essentially all computer languages, and I learned it through Fortran, but it served me well through the rest of my career.
Story_ID: 30475
Speaker 1: Let me just ask you, going back to high school [Fort Collins High School, Fort Collins, Colorado] for a minute.  So, when you graduated from high school, you were saying you couldn't be the valedictorian and such because you weren't there all four years, and you had a confused kind of...
Speaker 2: Yeah, it didn't really matter.  You know this was the time when the civil right movement had happened and this was '69 [1969] when I went to college so, '68 [1968] - '69 [1969] was my senior year.
Speaker 1: So, when you were in high school, it was after the assassination of Dr. [Martin Luther] King...
Speaker 2: Well, during.  Yeah, I mean, that's the year he was assassinated, right.  A lot happened that year, you know.
Speaker 1: How did your family feel about that?  Were they following the civil rights movement?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Closely?
Speaker 2: Closely, right.  You know, I saw it as opening doors for me.  The question of where I was going to be going to school and so, on.  It seemed that things had changed, and they had.  So, that year, I took the National Merit Test and I was a National Merit Scholar, and they also had something called the National Achievement Scholar, which was African-Americans who did well on the National Merit Scholarship test.  And that clued in colleges that here's an African American who has done very well on this test.  So, I got solicitations.  Three a day would come in my senior year, "Please apply to our college", which was pretty unexpected, from my point of view.  But, I think it was the sign of the times, basically.  People were just saying, "Now that this has happened, we really need to start having college educated African-Americans" and they were looking for good ones.  So, I had this very pleasant experience of all these people saying, "Oh, you got to come to our college."
Speaker 1: I think some people don't realize that before that time, some colleges actually had quotas.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, or they just wouldn't take you, period.  A lot of colleges were like that.  Say, ten years ago it was an entirely different story.
Speaker 1: I think that some people nowadays think for some reason that it was neutral then, and then something happened in favor of black people, but...
Speaker 2: Right.  No, it wasn't neutral.  It was a door opening, and I felt lucky that I was there at that time.
Speaker 1: On a similar vein, did you have any African-American friends or acquaintances in high school by this time?
Speaker 2: No.  There really were almost no African-American families in Fort Collins [Colorado].  There was a big community in Denver [Colorado], but that was about sixty miles away.  So, I really didn't.
Story_ID: 30476
Speaker 1: Alright, so how did you manage to choose--now, you've got all of these colleges after you, so how did you choose the one you wanted to go to?
Speaker 2: Well, I asked my dad [Saul Basri], "What are the best five out of these?"  And then I much preferred to go to the West Coast than the East Coast, and most of them were on the East Coast.  So, Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California] and Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California] were my choices on the West Coast, and Cal Tech was stronger in physics maybe.  I think it was at that time, [Murray] Gell-Mann was there, and [Richard] Feynman and so on.  But it was an all boys' school (laughter) and I'd been in an all boys' school in ninth grade, and I said, "You know what, no thanks."  So, I went to Stanford.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is 1969?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so well, Stanford--this has nothing to do with it, but Stanford had a good football team, I think (laughter), right?
Speaker 2: Well, it had something to do with it.  So, I had been in the--we didn't talk about sports in high school.  In high school, I had been on the swim team and I'd been on the tennis team, and I'd been in the marching band.  And, so, I didn't intend to pursue sports in college, but the marching band sounded good.  And I don't know, the reputation of the Stanford band is known nationally, but you know, this was about three years after the Stanford band had kind of gone crazy.  You know, they just abandoned the traditional marching band routine.  They wore these kind of gangster hats with the red ribbon and red blazer, and didn't march (laughter), they ran from formation to formation and they were all about anarchy and fun and so on.  So, I thought, that looks real good (laughter).   So, I joined the band, and the reason I mention that is because being in the band, of course, I went to all the football games, and we did have a good team.  My freshman year was pretty good, but then my sophomore and junior years we went to the Rose Bowl [college football game] and won.
Speaker 1: Was that the year of Jim Plunkett?
Speaker 2: Jim Plunkett.  So, the year Jim Plunkett won the Rose Bowl, I marched in the Rose Bowl Parade, because I was in the band.  So, that did actually figure into my Stanford experience fairly strongly.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you liked the campus pretty much?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I liked the campus a lot.  At that point there were maybe fifty or a hundred black students there, and it was increasing, but you know this was during the Vietnam War, and the moratorium, and people were trashing the place, you know, there was a lot going on.  Those were very active years.   And then civil rights, it was very active.
Speaker 1: When you think about the life of a science student, from what I've heard from a lot of people, a lot of science students get kind of isolated in the science.  They spend a lot of time in the lab and they're not...
Speaker 2: Well, you didn't have time--I didn't spend time in the lab, but I didn't have time to do all that stuff because you got to get your problem sets in if you're going to get a degree in science.  There's no fooling around.  You get homework every week, you got to solve these problems.  There's a right answer and a lot of wrong answers, and there's no fooling around.  So, I was kind of on the edge of a lot of this activity, but it was going on around me.  But, I could devote a little bit of time to it, but not a lot of time to it.  Physics was a pretty tough road at Stanford.
Story_ID: 30477
Speaker 1: Now your freshman year, I guess the summer of your freshman year, the summer of 1969, July the 20th, Neil Armstrong walks on the moon.
Speaker 2: That's right, walks on the moon.
Speaker 1: "One small step for...
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, that blew my mind.  Being attached to science fiction and astronomy and everything else, that was a huge--I can remember that really well.  I was home with my dad [Saul Basri] and watched it on TV.  Yeah, I couldn't believe that.  It was so amazing.
Speaker 1: Could you picture yourself working for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought about doing that, and I kept it on the plate for a while, eventually realizing being an astronaut wasn't quite what I wanted--I knew astronauts here at [University of California] Berkeley, one guy in particular.  He ended up not flying, but he was back-up on one of those space lab missions, and he would have gone on the next one, except he got sick all of a sudden.  But he had to kind of give up his research career in large piece to be an astronaut and train for years.  At the end of the day, I actually valued the research more than I valued that kind of an experience.  But, that's all way down the road here.
Speaker 1: To a lot of people can envision the physical exhilaration of going to outer space and that sort of thing more than they can picture the exhilaration of research.
Speaker 2: Right.  But the truth is, we travel, I travel into space in my mind all the time, and it's a real experience, you know.  When I study a star, I'm getting the starlight, I'm understanding it on a physical basis.  If I tell you this star is rotating at six kilometers per second, it is.  You know, so it's a little bit like being there.  And we learn quite a bit about some of these systems.  To me, I'm probing these places with my mind and my instruments, even though I'm not physically there, and that's an enterprise which I can participate in my whole life, whereas astronaut is much more exciting, but it's limited to the earth orbiting the moon, and it's only something you're going to do a few times in your life, at best.  I had a graduate student who became an astronaut--she wasn't my graduate student, she took a class from me, and she was in the department.  And she flew about four or five times to the space station, and I've seen her kind of home movies about it, and it's like, it's a really cool thing to do, but actually most of the time, they were on the station screwing panels in and kind of building this thing (laughter).
Story_ID: 30478
Speaker 1: Okay, where are we?
Speaker 2: Alright, so Stanford.  In 1969 we're talking about the moon landing and...
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: ...and how exhilarating that was to see that, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.  Yeah, and then the later landings, too. I mean, each one of them was exhilarating to me, and especially when they started really doing the science, you know.  That was outrageous, that was great.
Speaker 2: So, at times you thought about maybe being an astronaut, but then you...
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did.  I mean, I kept it in mind.  I realized I wasn't pursuing a test pilot type of career, and I actually thought I probably wasn't going to be a good test pilot, because amusement park rides tended to make me a little sick, so I knew I probably wasn't astronaut material anyway from that point of view.  But, you know, yeah, I kept it in mind for a long time until I understood it well enough to understand I'd rather be an astrophysicist than an astronaut.
Story_ID: 30479
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm probably wrong here, but was Condoleezza Rice at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California] when you were there?
Speaker 2: She was later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I had to take a stab at it (laughter).  Okay.
Speaker 2: On the other hand, I should mention Sally Ride, who was in my physics class.  She was in my year when there were about twenty or twenty-five of us taking physics, and she was one of them.  So, she was the first American female astronaut.  So I've been in the neighborhood with astronauts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any special teachers or mentors at Stanford that really stand out, that you...?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's one guy that stands out.  So, I went to Stanford, I knew I was going to be in with a different crowd of folks.  You know, freshman year, first quarter, I hit it, like everyone does.  You're used to being top of your class, everything's easy, you get to a place like that, and all of a sudden that's not how it is. (laughter).  So, you've got to work a lot harder, and there are plenty of people who are smarter than you are, or better prepared or whatever.  So, I started off in honor's physics and then I quickly decided I'd better just stick with regular physics.  And then I had a really bad advisor, beginning of my sophomore year.  So, I ended up with four physics, two maths, and a music class.  And that was a nutty load, it was just completely out of the question.  And, so, the guy I'm thinking of, his name is Melvin Schwartz.  He was my electro-magnetism teacher.  He gave us a very creative mid-term problem, and I did well on that.  Essentially, you have to think up your problem and solve it.  And the problem had to be hard enough to be interesting to him, you know, but then you have to solve it.  So, I came up with a good one, and I was doing well in the class, but by the second part of the quarter I was really floundering.  I just had way too much going on, and E&M [electricity and magnetism] was hard.  And so when it came time for the final, the one thing that makes me remember him a lot, he gives us this problem set near the end of the term, and he says "So, I'm going to give you a whole week to do this, just take your best crack at it."  So, we all beat our heads against the wall for a week.  Nobody could solve this problem, it was just really hard.  We all turned in what we had, you know, and he said, "Well, you all took a good crack at it.  Nobody got it."  He says, "If you had gotten it, you would have won the Nobel Prize in 1935."  And he won the Nobel Prize later on, so I remember him for that.  But at the end of the term, I went to him and I said, "Professor, I can't take the final now.  I'm not ready for it, and I haven't had the time to study, here's why."  He looked at my schedule and he said "What idiot let you take this schedule?"  He says, "Alright, go home and take the final when you come back from Christmas vacation."  So, I went home and I said, "Dad [Saul Basri], I need to learn the rest of this E&M within the next two weeks."  And he helped me, and I came back and got an 'A', and [Melvin] Schwartz was encouraging to me.  He says, "You know what, that's good.  You should go on, but just don't be so crazy."  (laughter).  So, because I had started with honor's physics--so I started to relax, that, but I still ended up sort of--halfway through senior year I was kind of done, so I got to take a bunch of fun courses the last part.
Story_ID: 30480
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Well, I took some astronomy.  So, there wasn't an astronomy department at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California].  In fact, there still really isn't.  But they had a couple of outside people who came in, and I took a course in solar physics from a guy who's, he was in the applied physics department, but it turns out--that's another sort of funny thing.  What I learned from him in that class in 1973 still applies today.  I just had a PhD qualifying student who's working on solar flares, and the first graph they showed was a graph he showed us, you know, back in '73 [1973].  So, I said, I think this is how flares work.  We actually haven't made much progress since then, which I pointed out to the student.  I said, "You know, I saw that graph thirty years ago, it looks kind of the same.  Are you going to solve this problem?" (laughter).  So, anyway, that was fun.  And I took a course on nuclear power, the same kind of thing.  The question of how to solve the nuclear waste issue, the answer was known when I took this course.  I gave a report on it.  We've known the answer all along, we just don't have the political will to implement it.  So, we're going to have to come back to that now that we have all the greenhouse gases and all that stuff.  Nuclear is going to need to be faced more closely, and the answer is, we do know what to do with nuclear waste, you just have to do it.  They do it in Europe, we just don't do it here.  Everybody's tangled up in politics.
Story_ID: 30481
Speaker 1: But for the laymen out here like me.  What do we do with nuclear waste?
Speaker 2: You can let the, the short term waste can just burn out, essentially, in pools and things of that sort.  The heavy-duty waste is going to last a long time.  You glassify it, so you bake it into glasses, and then you put it in a salt mine, and the salt melts down around it, and you've got salt for a thousand feet in every direction.  Water can't get to it, and besides that, it's glass.  And that'll last you--hundred thousand years--not a problem.  So, that's what should happen.  I mean, if you glassify on site, you're transporting something that's pretty safe, too.  But, you got to put all that in place, and wherever that salt mine is, that state has to say okay, we'll allow the waste to be here.
Speaker 1: Is there any danger in having that waste there?
Speaker 2: Not if it's a thousand feet in the salt mine, no.  There's no danger of anything.  It's completely gone, as far as people are concerned.  Or groundwater or anything.  So, yeah, that's what should happen.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I was surprised the other night when you mentioned nuclear, you know, because most people tend to avoid talking about it as an alternative source.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I mean, nuclear does have other disadvantages, like you got to be careful about proliferation.  If you're going to be using breeder reactors and you're going to be making plutonium, you don't want that out there where people can make bombs out of it.  So, there are issues, but it is an energy source which is very energy intensive.  I mean, apparently, we make 20 percent of our energy now from nuclear, and people don't quite recognize that.  As we said the other night, for low intensity distributed power, wind and solar and all those things are good.  But for kind of concentrated industrial power, nuclear is really one of the best choices.  We need safe reactors and safe disposal of waste, both of which the world knows how to do.  We just have shied away from it here in the United States.
Story_ID: 30482
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, any other stories about instructors at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], or fellow students?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  A visiting professor came from Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], Tommy Gold, when I was a junior, and he was an astronomer.  So, I did a project with him, and that is what made me realize, I'm studying physics, but I really only really love it if it's astrophysics.  I mean, the project he had me do wasn't that difficult.  He wanted to make a set of diagrams about something, and I had to learn what it was, and so on.  But, it showed me that I was on fire when I worked on that kind of problem, and the other kinds of physics problems were, "I just got to get through this."  So that was what actually made me decide to pursue astrophysics.  But I did do an interesting project with another physics professor there.  The last couple years, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is a big particle physics machine, and so that was my sojourn into instrumental physics.  So, he wanted to build these big multi-wired chambers that could detect particles, and so it was basically a yard on a side.  It needs to have several hundred wires that are about the thickness of a human hair strung across in two directions.  It has to be absolutely flat, they have to be near each other, but they can't touch.  And he had a couple, he had a grad student, and a post doc, and a couple undergrads working on this, and I was one of the undergrads.  And we came up with some very clever ideas for this thing.  We used just fiber-glass slats with honeycomb in between them, and you just fill the honeycomb with epoxy, put it on an absolutely flat granite table, put plastic over it, pump down that with a vacuum, and press this thing down onto the flat granite table until the epoxy dried and then you had this light, perfect flat frame, and then this German technician strung these wires.  And then the question was how do you clean them?  And, he was going to get an ultrasonic tank, it cost ten thousand dollars and all this, and I said, "What if we just spray it with a weed sprayer and use some kind of a solvent thing?"  And he said, "Well, yeah, that would be worth a try, and that would be way cheaper." (laughter).  So, we did that, and it turned out that that worked just fine.  So, I was proud of my little solution there.  But I didn't stick with the particle physics or the instrumentation side of things when I went off to graduate school.  And then I thought I really wanted to travel again.  As you know, I've traveled in my life, so I thought, "Before I go to graduate school, I should travel again."
Story_ID: 30483
Speaker 1: Okay, you graduated when?
Speaker 2: In 73' [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I ended up not traveling.  What I did was I said, "I'm only going to apply to a couple of places for grad school, and I probably won't get in and I'll take a year off and travel, and then I'll get serious about it."  So, I only applied to two places.  One was Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], which was where this guy Tommy Gold was that I'd worked with, and the other was Boulder, Colorado, because I knew I liked Colorado.  So, it's the University of Colorado, not where my father [Saul Basri] was, but he had friends there, and I knew I loved Boulder, so I thought I'd apply to Boulder.  Boulder and Cornell.  And I didn't get into Cornell, and I got into Boulder, and I thought--and I wasn't smart enough to know I could have asked them for a year's leave, so I just went, I just went into astrophysics at Boulder at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  University of Colorado and Boulder have beautiful campuses.
Speaker 2: It is, it's a beautiful campus, and a great place to live, and of course, I was sixty miles away from home.   My parents [Saul Basri and Phyllis Claire Whyte] got divorced at that time, also, though, but they both stayed in Fort Collins [Colorado].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 30484
Speaker 1: And my brother [David Basri] went to Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California].  We actually overlapped my last year.  He was a freshman and I was a senior at Stanford.
Speaker 2: Was it good having your brother on campus?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.  That was fun.  By then, he had become a serious student.  So, actually--he'd never shown much interest in math, but he started off in honor's math, and he's taking these courses.  I mean, I couldn't understand them, and I couldn't understand why he was taking them, either. (laughter).  But he was doing okay.  But then he decided he didn't really want to do that.  He, actually, the thing that he did at Stanford that he really liked, was he was a student fireman.  You know, he stayed at the firehouse, and he got trained, and he liked this outdoor kind of job.  He got his major in human biology and then went up to Portland [Oregon] to be with his high school girlfriend.
Speaker 2: Okay, so he's a biologist?
Speaker 1: No, he's not.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He went up to Portland to be with his girlfriend.  He didn't know what he wanted to do.  He thought he didn't want to work indoors, he wanted to work outdoors, so he took a job as a courier for a bank, driving stuff around.  That lasted two days.  The second day, they were like handing him a package, and he overhears these guys and they've got some kind of software problem with one of the systems.  And, he's listening to them, and he says, "Why don't you just 'dada dada dada'." (laughter).  And he fixes the problem for them, and they're like "Who are you?"  And he said, "Well, I'm the driver."  And they said, "Well, you're not the driver anymore."  They pulled him into the IT part of the bank, and then they said, "You're management material."  And he became a vice president.  He's in banking software, he has a banking software company.
Story_ID: 30485
Speaker 1: Okay, so now the University of Colorado at Boulder [Boulder, Colorado], right?  So, who's the teacher there?  I guess that's of the most important things.
Speaker 2: You know, that's where I have my thesis advisor, so he's obvious a crucial person in my career.  Jeff Linsky is his name.  That's also where I met my wife [Jessica Broitman].  My first year, at the end of my first year, I picked my thesis advisor and met my wife, so that was a big year, the summer of 74' [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell us how you met your wife.
Speaker 2: She was an undergraduate and just settling down.  She kind of wanted to be an artist, and she took religion, and she made up her mind she was going to be a psychologist.  She was, I think, a junior then, and she had to take a science breadth requirement, so she took astronomy.  She also liked science fiction, and this professor she took it from was kind of a cool guy.  You know, he didn't do a traditional course, he told stories, he brought science fiction in, he was cool.  I was TAing for the other guy, who was very boring.  But, so, she's taking this course, and of course, all the grad students were the teaching assistants, so her teaching assistant was a friend of mine, and he introduced us.  While she was taking the course, we didn't really get together then, but I kind of knew about her.  He eventually moved in with her and then that summer, I got to know her, through him first and then we got together, and so that's how that happened.
Speaker 1: Okay, the summer of 74' [1974]?
Speaker 2: The summer of '74 [1974], right.  And, I didn't know what I wanted to do in astrophysics, either, so I kind of went around to the different professors, you know, "Who's got a summer job?"--basically, and Dr. Linsky did.  He had a bit of a reputation as being hard to work with, but I'm a very easygoing guy, and I figured that's not going to be a problem, and it wasn't.  And he's Jewish, so we hit it off pretty fast.  And that kind of defined my research direction.  He was working on the sun and on magnetic activity on stars, and he was involved in what was going to be launched before I was done with graduate school, the first ultraviolet satellite that would take the spectra of stars in the ultraviolet, which would be very good for studying magnetic activity, and so I hooked up with him and that was very productive.
Story_ID: 30486
Speaker 1: Okay.  I have a note here.  Your first paper that you published was in '77 [1977].  It was?
Speaker 2: So that was on the Sun, it was on the sun, and it was ultraviolet.  And there's another black astrophysicist on that paper, George Carruthers, who worked at the [United States Naval Research Laboratories, Washington D.C.].  So, they built this instrument and flew it on a rocket, and observed the sun and the ultraviolet--you have to get above the atmosphere to see this ultraviolet light, so you have to do it from space.  So, this was a short sojourn observing the sun, and Jeff Linsky was collaborating with the lead guy there, and so they sent us some of the data, and so I wrote my first paper on that.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's called "High Resolution Vidicon Spectrophotometry."
Speaker 2: Was that my first paper?
Speaker 1: That's what it says...
Speaker 2: That's not, that one actually was, that's not on the sun.  That was on, that was using the solar telescope at Kitt Peak [Arizona], but it was on stars.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That paper was, my first important paper was on the sun, I should say.  It was right in that same time period.  That paper, the Vidicon one--so there's this new kind of light detector that other friends of Dr. Linksy were trying to use.  And it was pretty experimental, and you really wanted to be able to have the telescope for a large amount of time, and it's hard to get that.  And because Linksy...
Speaker 1: You're talking about a big telescope?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a big telescope.  You needed a big telescope because you wanted to do high resolution spectroscopy.
Speaker 1: You'd have to get on a schedule to use...
Speaker 2: Yeah, you had to get on a schedule, but they had this clever idea, let's use the Kitt Peak solar telescope, but we used it at night.  Like, nobody uses it at night, so we could have as much time as we want.  So, that was great, actually.  That whole project allowed me to, I spent weeks down there in Arizona, you know, on top of Kitt Peak, using the solar telescope at night.  And what was great about that was the solar astronomers would turn it over to us about 4:00 in the afternoon because the sun was too low.  And it's huge, this telescope has a three hundred foot focal length, because to study the sun you want a huge image.  So, the image of sun was a yard across.  And you could just lay down a big piece of white cardboard in the focal plan, and there was the sun, you know, you could touch it.  So, we would watch the sun set.  We would get our instruments calibrated and stuff, and we'd watch the sun set, you know, with a one meter image of the sun, as it would set.  It was so great that you could actually see that the red image of the sun and the blue image of the sun were slightly separated by atmospheric refraction.  And, if there were any green flashes, which there were with some regularity out there in the desert--you know it was this thing the size of your hand, you could watch the green flash.  So, I'm probably one of the few people who've seen green flashes in exquisite detail many times.  That was just an opportunity that we had, then we'd do astronomy at night.
Story_ID: 30487
Speaker 1: What does a green flash signify?
Speaker 2: All it really is, the earth's atmosphere has to be layered so that images of the sun start actually really separating.  You get, you can see the top of the sun here, but you can also see the top of the sun here.  There's actually like a separation where you can see two suns, or parts of two suns for a little while, and then as the sun sets, one of them kind of pinches off.  So, you get the main image down here, and the sort of ghost image up here is getting fainter and fainter.  And, as I said, the blue light and the red light refract differently, so as this image starts to disappear, the red part of it goes first, then it kind of turns green.  You got sort of yellow and blue, and it turns green for just a second or two, and then it disappears, so that's what a green flash is.  You know, people out in the Bay Area [California] will be up on the hill, and they'll be watching the sun set, and everybody will look for the green flash.  Occasionally, it happens.  There's a much more common phenomena, which is just that your retina--you're looking at this bright thing, and when it disappears, it's a yellow thing--and your retina, sort of back reacts, you see this green after-image.  That's not the green flash, so I know that for sure because I had this incredible telescopic view of real green flashes.  And occasionally the sun was setting in the west, San Diego [California] was way out there somewhere, and occasionally there would be Air Force jets that would actually cross the disk of the sun.  They must have been hundred miles away.  You'd see these jets just kind of shoot across the sun (laughter).  It was great.  That wasn't the astronomy part, but it was a real experience, it was the fun part.
Speaker 1: Sounds great.
Speaker 2: It was the fun part, yeah, right.  And then we'd have the telescope to ourselves all night, with this really big image.  So, occasionally, we'd point it at Saturn.  Saturn would be the size of a quarter on the paper there.  It was good.  The science that came out of that particular project never amounted to a lot, but that Vidicon detector just wasn't very good, actually, it turns out (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was wrong?
Speaker 2: It just, it was noisy and it was inconsistent, so it would show changes in intensity that weren't real.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, we were looking for changes in intensity with wavelengths, so that was not good.
Speaker 1: So, it was an observational tool, it wasn't that...
Speaker 2: Yes, later on, much better detectors came along.
Story_ID: 30488
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your dissertation was about the chromospheres of supergiant stars.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so the chromosphere is the part of the sun just above the visible surface that is kind of magnetically activated.  It's, as you go from the inside of a star out, it's hottest at the center and it gets cooler as you get towards the edge, and then most of the light escapes at that surface.  But then above that, it actually starts getting hotter again, and that's because of magnetic heating, or magnetic fields.
Speaker 1: Is that something like a halo?
Speaker 2: Yeah, although the real halo is called the corona, so when you see a solar eclipse, you see this pearly white halo around the sun, that's the corona.  The chromosphere, "chromo" means color--the chromosphere is this thin layer right above the photosphere, which is the visible surface of the sun, which looks red.  It looks red to the eye because hydrogen is being activated.  It's hotter there, and there's a spectra line of hydrogen that's red, and so your eye sees a brief, red rim on the sun during an eclipse.  That's called the chromosphere.  I don't think it's worth explaining what the thesis topic was about.  It was about half sort of theoretical with respect to how spectra are formed.  So, if you divide, take the light from a star and you split it up into a lot of component wavelengths, we call that a spectrum, and then all the atomic features--then each feature like hydrogen or calcium or iron or whatever, they'll produce absorption lines at certain wavelengths in that spectrum.  And then if you study them at high resolution, which is mostly what I do, you can actually study the profile of that line.  That contains a lot of physical information about what's happening at the surface of the star.  So, that's kind of one of the foundations of my science.  So, this thesis is about--super giants are stars that have huge atmospheres, you know.  If you put a super giant in place of the sun, the earth would be inside of it.  These are huge distended stars, and the gas is much sort of thinner, less dense and low gravity in the atmosphere of those stars, and that makes changes in the spectrum.  So, I was studying that.
Story_ID: 30489
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I actually changed fields when I got to [University of California] Berkeley.
Speaker 1: Okay, Jeff Linsky was your advisor?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, what about Len Kuhi?
Speaker 2: Len Kuhi, he was at Berkeley.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Frank Shu, was he at Berkeley, too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was at Berkeley.
Speaker 1: Well, when you earned your PhD, was it difficult to get a PhD?
Speaker 2: I didn't find it difficult.  Actually, working with Jeff [Linsky], I worked on this solar project with the NRL [Naval Research Laboratory] rocket, and that would have been a thesis.  We wrote this paper, Lyman-Alpha Spectrums, or whatever it's called.  And I could have left at that point. That was about four years in, and I could have left, but, A: I was having a good time in graduate school.  You know, I was in Colorado, I ski, I hike, we were having fun, and B: I didn't feel ready.  I felt like although I done what you needed to do to get a doctorate, I hadn't really accumulated the amount of experience I wanted when I would go out as an independent scientist.  And besides that, I didn't want to be a solar astronomer, I actually wanted to be a stellar astronomer.  So, I told Jeff, "I'm not writing my thesis on this solar thing, I want to do a stellar project, too."  So, I took six years instead of four.  And that was good, because this spacecraft he'd been working with launched the last year, and it started getting stellar data on chromospheres of other stars in the ultraviolet, and that was very exciting.  And actually that satellite, that was another big fun thing, so that was the only real astronomical satellite where you, the astronomer, really ran it.  It was obviously a NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] mission and so on, but you would go to Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland into a control room where the technical operators were.  You'd sit down with them, you'd say, "Okay, I want to point at this star, here's the coordinates."  This satellite's up at geosynchronous orbit, you know.  It was a little telescope, a forty centimeter telescope or something.  It would then slew to that target and take a picture, send it back down, you'd look at the picture, you'd say, "Yeah, it's this star here."  And they would center up the telescope on that, and you'd take the spectrum and send that down, and you'd look at it, and you'd say "Ah, we got to take another one."  And you were operating a telescope, and it was up in space.  And that was very cool.  And the only kind of weather that happened-
Story_ID: 30490
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I was just talking about the space weather.  You didn't have to worry about day or night, and you didn't have to worry about clouds.  What you did have to worry about was the radiation belts around the earth.  It turns out the satellite was just kind of at the edge of one of the outer radiation belts.  So, if the sun was active, it would compress the radiation belts on the earth and the satellite would be above them, and things would be very clean, and if the sun was not active, the belts would expand and the satellite would be in them, and you would get a lot of radiation hits on the detector, and your spectrum would be noisy, so that was the only weather we had to worry about.  But, it really felt like you were operating a spacecraft, and I really enjoyed those years of using the--it's called the International Ultraviolet Explorer Satellite.
Story_ID: 30491
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I think maybe it's time to ask you this question.  It's a simple question, but for a lot of people in the general public, they're confused still about the difference between an astronomer and an astrologer.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: It seems silly, on some level, but people do get them confused.
Speaker 2: They do, yes, they absolutely do.
Speaker 1: So, can you explain for our public... Sure.  Of course, I taught astronomy at [University of California] Berkeley for years, and I always devoted about a half a lecture to the question of what's the difference between astronomy and astrology.  They started similar, you know, twenty-five hundred years ago people were just looking up at the sky, studying the stars and they ascribed all kinds of explanations to the motions that they saw and so on.  And of course, they had myths about the stars and so on.  So, astronomy and astrology at that time were closely related.  When the scientific revolution happened, then astronomers diverged from astrology, although some of the early famous astronomers were astrologers, like [Johannes] Kepler, for example, was an astrologer. But, astrologer is about a belief system that is based on the stars and the motions of the stars and so on, that's been constructed.  And you have to take it on faith.  Astronomy is an empirical science, so you can't make assertions in astronomy without backing them up with empirical proof or evidence, or following a theory with empirical support.  So, astronomy is a science, and astrology is a belief system.  Now, people ask me, well, do I believe in astrology?  And I don't.  But, while I'll point it out to them, you know, I also am careful about this.  So, I can point out to them, for example, if the stars were really influencing you at birth, how would they be influencing you?  You can calculate the gravity from the stars or the light from the stars or whatever, or you can show that earthly influences would be much larger.  Even the planets, which of course, are much closer to us than the stars, the gravity due to the nurse that delivers you is larger than the gravity due to the planet Jupiter.  So, it couldn't be a physical connection, but of course, it doesn't have to be, because astrology is a belief system.  But then, and this has come on the internet recently, which is funny to me, because I've pointed this out every year I've taught the course.  There's the issue that the whole astrological system is not aligned anymore with the stars.  So, astrology was based, originally on where the sun was at different times of the year, which constellation it appears in.  From an astronomical point of view, we even understand that the constellations are completely human constructs.  They have nothing to do with the actual stars.  The stars that are in a given constellation are at very different distances, and if you move somewhere in the galaxy, you wouldn't see that constellation at all.  So, they're just local constructs, basically.
Speaker 2: So what we might imagine as being Sagittarius, or Leo or something, it doesn't really have... It has no physical meaning, it's just what we see from the earth, and stars have brightnesses, they have intrinsic luminosities that are different by a factor of a million.  So, needless to say, one star that's a million times brighter than another star, you can put it a lot further away and it'll look just as bright.  And so when you look at a constellation and you see a bunch of bright stars, it turns out you can't be sure at all which ones are close and which ones are far, which ones are giant stars, which ones are dwarfs, and so on.  But beyond that, of course, then it's the human brain which ascribes patterns to the constellations and that's cultural, actually.  So, you can go to China and say, "What are the constellations?" and they will have picked out different patterns in the sky.  So, we can understand this is all very just sort of cultural and human.  But even beyond that, the astrological system that was devolved from the West used a certain set of constellations and the sun was in that constellation. Like, I'm a Taurus, so the sun is supposed to be in Taurus when I'm born, which is how it was when astrology was developed.  Meanwhile, the earth spins around its axis, but its axis is slowly wobbling through space as well.  It takes twenty-six thousand years for one wobble to occur.  But it's been twenty-five hundred years since astrology was developed, so that's ten percent of that time and there's twelve astrological signs, so you can see, you would have moved by at least a sign or so, in ten percent of the time, which has indeed happened.  So, the sun was not in fact in Taurus when I was born, even though I'm a Taurus.  Now, this suddenly became clear to a lot of people on the internet a couple of months ago.  (laughter).  It wasn't new information, and the astrologers say, "Well, actually, we're not really talking about the real stars, this is a construct."  And I'm like, that's interesting, you know.  But, it's curious that the sun actually was in Taurus when astrology was developed, and now it's not, so you can make excuses if you like.  The other part of my lecture has to do with, does it have any predictive value?  That's actually something you can test scientifically.  You can take people who are Tauruses, and people who are Pisces and so on, and if you do a proper statistical analysis on a large sample of people that are born at different times of the year, you'll find there's no difference.  So, as an empirical fact, there's nothing to it, either.  Now, can people believe in it anyway?  Absolutely.  You know, it's a free country, you can believe whatever you want, my only insistence in my lecture is that you not confuse the two.  Don't confuse an astrological belief system with an astronomical science system.
Story_ID: 30492
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do astronomers measure and, I guess, examine the stars?
Speaker 2: You know, a variety of ways.  Old astronomy was mostly just about position and brightness, so you made maps of the sky, you plotted exactly where each star appeared to be, how bright they were, things of that sort.  And then you'd plot the planets and try to understand the different cycles that you see in the sky, and so on.  That was original astronomy.  Very few people do that anymore these days, it's mostly all astrophysics.  So, I'm really an astrophysicist.  So, I, for example, collect the light from the stars, split it up into a lot of wavelengths and analyze the spectrum and apply physics to an understanding of as light comes up through the atmosphere of the star and gets into space and travels to the earth.  What happens to it as it's passing through the atmosphere of the star, that's what determines the details of the spectrum, and I can infer physical properties of the atmosphere of the star from the spectrum, so that's one thing that we do.  We do that for stars, we do that for galaxies, planets.  Then there's another thing that's happened in the last, I guess, the last century, let's say, but mostly in the last fifty years, is that we've come to understand the human eye only samples a very small slice of the electromagnetic spectrum.   So, in other words, stars just don't emit visible light.  They emit radio waves, they emit ultraviolet, they emit x-rays, they emit infrared, they emit microwaves.  The whole spectrum of light that we don't see with our eyes is out there, emitted by all kinds of different astronomical objects.  We now have the capability of studying them in those different forms of light, and each form of light tells you something quite different about the object.  So, x-rays, for example, only come from really hot parts of the star.  So the solar corona, for example, that halo we were talking about, the visible halo is really just sunlight, visible sunlight, bouncing off of electrons in the corona and coming to your eyes, so you see this haze of electrons, basically.  The actual light emitted by the corona is x-rays, because the corona, as it turns out, is very hot, it's a million degrees.  So, it's much hotter than the surface of the sun.  This is, again, magnetic heating effect.  So, when you take a picture of the sun and x-rays, it looks entirely different.  You see mostly the corona, and you see these fantastic magnetic loops and all kinds of stuff going on that you don't see when you take a visible picture of the sun.  So, astronomy has also expanded out in that way.  And then, since computers have been around, we've expanded it another way, which is to run computer models of astronomical systems, put in the physics, and try to infer what's really going on in the system, and test the model against the observations.  If they don't agree, you adjust the model until they agree, and then you've learned what it is you need to put in the model to agree with observations, so you can study the model now.
Story_ID: 30493
Speaker 1: My other simple question, I guess--A lot of people--you can correct me if I'm wrong or just give us a fix on this, but when we see the pictures on the internet or on television, of the galaxies, the constellations in color from the Hubble [Space] Telescope [HST] and that sort of thing, are we really seeing the actual, the way this would actually look if we were out in space looking at it?
Speaker 2: No, usually you're not.  You are seeing real things, and the colors are used to bring out different features of the actual astronomical object, and sometimes they are true colors, but your eyes still wouldn't see them.  So, it turns out most things in astronomy are faint, especially things which are extended.  So, all the nebulas and the galaxies and so on, which are big diffuse-extended objects for reasons that take a little physics to explain, it doesn't help if you go near it.  It's going to have the same surface brightness whether you look at it through a telescope or you actually go up close to it.  Because it's a distended object, when you get closer it will look bigger, but any particular patch of it won't look any brighter.  So, that's one thing.  The next thing is our eyes are not great detectors, actually.  So, your eyes need enough light on them before the color cones really get activated, and a lot of these objects don't actually put out that much light.  So, your eye would not see those colors even though those colors are really there.  So, these pictures are taken with electronic detectors which are much better detectors than our eyes, and the big secret is you can do a time exposure on the detector, and you can't in your eye.  So, your eye is basically taking in exposure every thirtieth of a second or so, and that's all you get to do.  If you could make your eye collect light for five minutes and then see it, then you'd see these things, but we can't.  So, they're not--I mean, the ones which are supposed to be true color are true color, but you wouldn't actually see that with your eye, because your eye is a lousy detector.  Then, there are a lot of pictures which are false colored.  So, for example, if you take a picture in the infrared, obviously your eye doesn't see that, but just like in the visible spectrum, there are you know infrared colors that are more infrared and less infrared, and you can assign them to visible colors, and then you get a picture which is what it would look like if your eye worked in the infrared, but it doesn't.  So, it's called a false color picture.  It's truth, but it's a shifted spectrum, so you, yourself would not experience that if you were there and looked at it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know because people have looked through 'National Geographic [Magazine]' and they look at a picture of a horse head nebula or something, and say, "Ooh, look at the colors, you know, they're bright."
Speaker 2: Well, those colors are typically true color, but you wouldn't see it, unfortunately, even if you went near the horse head nebula.  It would still look faint and white, basically.  Your rods and cones would not be stimulated enough to see those colors, but they're real.  Now, the way they take those pictures, they take a time exposure with a red filter, a time exposure with a green filter, a time exposure with a blue filter.  They can calibrate those filters so that they give a true color picture, and then they combine them, and so you get a true color picture.  It's just that your eye wouldn't pick that up.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a pretty good explanation.
Speaker 2: So, they're good and they're beautiful and they are true color, but they're not what you would see.
Story_ID: 30494
Speaker 1: Okay, that makes sense.  Now, in the physics department at the University of California in Berkeley.  You joined the astronomy department in what, 1979? Let me tell you the story.  This is an interesting story.  This is a story I tell students a lot, because it shows how random things are, how you need to be ready for opportunities, how you need to be, put yourself out a little bit.  So, what happened was I came to the end of my graduate career and my advisor said "Gibor, I think you have real potential.  I think you've got a career in astronomy, and the only way that's going to happen is if you leave here."  He said, "If you stay in Colorado, you'll be seen as under my wing, and people won't credit you for your own ideas and so on, so I'm kicking you out, as much as I like working with you."  I said, "No, no, really, I could at least stay for a few years of a post doc or something.  My wife's [Jessica Broitman] got a great job, she's running a clinic for chronic schizophrenics, we really love Boulder [Colorado], and we want to stay."  He said, "Sorry, not happening.  I want your career to go well, you've got to leave."  So, we said, alright, where are we going to go?  She had a good job.  It is what is very common now, what we call the two body problems, that you've got to satisfy both partners.  So, we sat down and made a list, and it was pretty short, of places we were both willing to go to, and a friend of ours' father was a professor at [University of California] Berkeley, a psychiatrist, and he recommended that Jess[ica Broitman] could get her doctorate at the Wright Institute [clinical psychology graduate school], which is just off the Berkeley campus.  Got her all excited about that.  Berkeley was, Bay Area was definitely on our list because I'd been at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California].  So, she says, "Well, you've got to get a job at Berkeley."  I said, "Yeah, that's easy, I'll just walk in there and get an astronomy job at Berkeley, right." (laughter).  So, we're out visiting, and we're at the Lawrence Hall of Science [public science museum and research center], which is up the hill behind the campus there, where our friend worked for the summer.  And, we're sitting there talking about this, and I said "I'll apply to the department, but that's a very elite department, I don't know about this.  And the friend says, "Well, the building up the hill from here is the Space Sciences Laboratory.  They do astronomy up there.  Why don't you go up there and see if they have jobs?"  And I said, "You don't just walk up and walk in and say, 'You got any jobs?'  And they said, "No, go, try, try."  They like ganged up on me, so I said, "Alright fine, I'll go try.  I know how this is going to go, but I'll go do it."  So, I walk up the hill, it's only a five minute walk.  I walk in the door, the place is empty.  It turns out that there's a retirement party and everybody's gone except for one professor.  He's working hard on a proposal, so he's still there.  So, I knocked on his door and I said, "I'm getting my doctorate at the end of this year in astrophysics, and I'm just inquiring what kind of job opportunities there are here at the Space Science Lab."  He laughs, and he says, "Well, that's not how it works."  I said, "I know, I know, they made me do this."  He says "Well, come on in.  So, what do you do?"   So, I told him what I did.  He says, "Whoa, you mean you studied chromospheres on stars?"  I said, "Yeah."  And he says, "That's very interesting.  Last month we had a seminar from a guy who turns out to have been my thesis advisor's [Jeff Linsky] previous student, about stellar chromospheres. And the fact that this satellite that I want to launch, Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer, about half the things it's going to see are going to be stellar chromospheres, which I don't know anything about," he said.  "So I was thinking, I need somebody here who knows stellar chromospheres, so actually maybe there is a job for you.  I'll call your advisor, we'll talk, we'll see."  And so that's how it started, so he did, and he says, "You know what, I'd like you to come out and work here." Then he said, "So, I'm happy to pay you.  I have money, I'll pay you as a post doc.  However, the campus has just started a new post doctoral fellowship, Chancellor's Post Doctoral Fellowship, and this is aimed at bringing in minority scholars who seem like they're high enough quality that they could be faculty members, and I think you should apply for that, and then I won't have to pay you."  (laughter).  I said, "No problem, I'll apply, but just make sure you pay me anyway, if I don't get this."  He said, "That's fine."  So, I applied for the Chancellor's Post Doctoral Fellowship, and I got it.  And I didn't recognize that it was a faculty opportunity, I just thought, great, I've got the Chancellor's Post Doctoral Fellowship, I had my own money now.  It turned out that was very good, because he was kind of a, not a great boss.  If he was paying you, he made you do whatever he wanted to make you do, and a lot of people didn't like it that way.  But, if he wasn't paying you, he was very nice.  So, he wasn't actually paying me, so he was very nice. (laughter).  And, the department, the astronomy department, I was officially with them.  I mean, he was a member of the astronomy department, but he had his lab at the Space Sciences Lab.   And they were looking at me as a potential faculty member, which I didn't actually realize.  And then the second year, they asked me to teach a course, a graduate course.  And I thought, that's a little weird, but I can teach it, so I taught it.  And then they just came to me one day and they say, "You know, how would you like to be a faculty member here?"  And I was just completely flabbergasted.  I hadn't applied really.  I didn't realize I was applying essentially when I applied for the post doc.  The full circle of this is, that post doc program is still in existence, and it's in my portfolio now as the Vice Chancellor for Equity and Inclusion, so now I choose people in that program.  But, at any rate that's how I ended up as a faculty member in the astronomy department at Berkeley.  And I like to tell students this story because I had no clue, and if I had resisted my wife and her friend, it might not have happened.  So you know it's partly preparation.  I was obviously prepared, but I took the opportunity when it seemed to be there.  It didn't really even seem to be there, but I took it anyway (laughter).  So I think that's a kind of crucial story in my life.  That, obviously, kind of set the rest of my career.
Story_ID: 30495
Speaker 1: You know I hear a lot of career stories that people tell, and surprisingly a lot of them turn out where people take a chance and something happens...
Speaker 2: You know, I just heard another one like it last night.  And, actually, the guy who hired me, he had a story similar, it turned out.  I found out later he came into University of California] Berkeley through a funny way, and actually a number of faculty members got there in odd ways like this.  Last night I had the opportunity to meet my best friend from high school again after thirty, thirty-five years, and I hadn't really known what had happened to him, but something similar happened to him.  He had an opportunity that arose in a very strange way, and he grabbed it, and that set his future career.  So, yes, I think it is more common than we think.  That's why I tell students, you know, don't try to think it through too much.  Just do good work, be as prepared as you can be, keep your eyes open, and don't be afraid to try stuff.  You just have no clue whether things are going to work out or not.  You need to keep trying.
Speaker 1: Preparation, I guess....
Speaker 2: Preparation is, of course, essential.  When these opportunities arise, you won't get them if you're not prepared.  With my friend's case, it was the same thing.  The person who was giving him this offer needed somebody good, and he was.  But, he never would have gotten the offer if it hadn't been for an odd set of circumstances.
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people think that, they have in their mind that it's going to be a long process of screenings and things before they get a job.
Speaker 2: Sometimes, is the way it is, but there's a lot of other ways, too.
Speaker 1: That's right.  There is proximity and timing.
Speaker 2: Proximity, timing, luck, connections, you know, connections especially.  A surprising number of people get where they are through connections, connections they may not even recognize are present.
Story_ID: 30496
Speaker 1: I would imagine that if you get in a world like astronomy, as you said there were a thousand astronomers...
Speaker 2: Now, there's more like ten thousand. That was true at the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you would think that...
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's--a lot of people know a lot of people, that's true.
Speaker 1: Once you get in that profession...
Speaker 2: And frankly, the upper part of astronomy where you're really going to get a faculty position at a research institution, that's pretty small.  Right, so, yeah, a lot of people know a lot of people.  This is something I have to worry about as vice chancellor for equity and inclusion, because there's a danger there that the old boy network is the main thing that's operating, and people who aren't in the old boy network are put at a real disadvantage.  So, one has to be careful of that.  But, there's no question, you know, so we try to create new boy networks, but it's still about networks, that's always a big component.
Speaker 1: In this job, interviewing people, you find that the black people in various professions undoubtedly know a lot of the other people or have heard of them.
Speaker 2: And it's important that they do.
Speaker 1: So, let's see here.  Okay, you're an assistant research astronomer at first.  That's the...
Speaker 2: Yeah, after I was a post doc fellow.  For one year I was an assistant research astronomer.  So that was when I was still at the Space Science Lab [Berkeley, California], and then I got the faculty offer.
Story_ID: 30497
Speaker 1: Okay, this is 1982, and you become an assistant professor [at University of California, Berkeley]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, did you enjoy teaching?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I enjoyed teaching.  I taught two courses, mainly, very disparate.  I really enjoyed the undergraduate non-majors introductory astronomy class.  You know, it's a big, big class--a few hundred students, a couple hundred students, wide-eyed, not scientists.  For me, that was really a lot of fun.  And then the other course I taught a lot was that specialized graduate course that they had me teach.  I was kind of the department expert on radiative transfer, so that was a pretty technical course, and there I'd have five students, graduate students, who want to know how do you really do--how do you infer physical properties of objects through spectroscopy?  So, those were the two main courses that I taught.  I taught a bunch of freshman seminars on other topics.  Those were a lot of fun as well.  Getting back to my science fiction roots, I taught the science and science fiction for a number of years, and that was a ton of fun.  And then, actually, I have a big interest in time, as a philosophical and physical subject, too, so I've taught the nature of time two or three times as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 30498
Speaker 1: Are you aware of the professor at the University of Connecticut [Storrs, Mansfield, Connecticut]?  There's a black professor there...
Speaker 2: Yes, I've met him, actually, I...
Speaker 1: Mallard, Ronald Mallard.
Speaker 2: Right.  I read his book, and I thought, I should meet this guy.  So, I just e-mailed him and he responded, and then I was in Boston [Massachusetts] for a meeting, and he came down and we had lunch.
Speaker 1: Do you think it's feasible?  You know...
Speaker 2: No. (laughter).  Sorry, Ron[ald Mallard].  Don't get me started on time, but real time travel is so paradoxical that it's highly unlikely to be possible, I would say.  The only way you can kind of make it work is if you also posit multi universes, you know, the multi-verse, then you have kind of an excuse for the paradox, because you know, you can go back and kill your grandmother.  How'd you do that?  Well, you killed her in an alternate universe.  That becomes possible, otherwise it's really not possible, right.  If you killed your actual grandmother, then how did you ever appear, to do that?  So, there are these fundamental causal paradoxes which arise from time travel which make it unlikely that you can actually do it, I would say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I'm even more radical than that.  If you read [Albert] Einstein carefully, you come to the conclusion that time doesn't actually pass.  That's also an illusion, you know.  The universe is a four-dimensional structure.  It's the space time continuum, notice time is in there.  So, here it is--at one end of it, it's small, hot dense, and time has a low value, and at the other end it's huge, diffuse, cold, and time has a high value, and it's a structure that looks like that.  So, you could go to any particular time coordinate and see what the state of the universe is at that time coordinate, much like you know the CD [compact disc] that we're making here.  After we make it, you'll have a file with me talking for awhile.  You can take that file, and you know, in this part of the file I'm saying this and in that part of the file I'm saying that.  It's just like that, it doesn't change and all moments co-exist in that file.  It may well be that the universe is like that.  That's of course, a deep philosophical issue.  That would mean that there's not really consciousness or free will, or destiny or anything.  It's just this big frozen structure, which is a difficult concept for people to get their heads around, which is why I love it as a subject.  We have very good, deep discussions in a freshman seminar when I put that out.
Speaker 1: What would it be, like a CD without a rewind?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the illusion of time passing would be like when you play the CD, right.  That makes it appear that events are happening.  You know, full well that they're not, you're just sampling them, one after- in a sequence, but they're all there the whole time on the CD.  So, you could say that the illusion of time passing is why a little bit like some kind of reader moving along the structure, but people have trouble with that one, too, and I don't know what that would mean, either.  I mean, now to go further, I'd have to get a lot more philosophical and detailed.  There's a set of logical arguments you can go to to try to explain why this illusion would arise, but that's not easy.
Story_ID: 30499
Speaker 1: I was asking off camera, if, so the C- the universe is a CD [compact disc], I was asking, does it get bigger, and you said, "No, no it's the same."
Speaker 2: It's small at one end and big at the other end, but that's what it is, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and if you go back?
Speaker 2: If you go back, you just find the small end again.  Going back for real, for proper time travel, you simply replay an earlier moment, but it looks exactly the same as when you played it the first time.  You cannot bring future information back to the past, and leave the past untouched, right?  So, if it is a static structure, that's not allowed.  So if you do it, you would presumably you would do it to a copy of the CD, where now I've altered something, so it's not the same CD.  It looks--and a lot of it's the same, but now I've changed something, I have a different CD.  So that's the multi-universe explanation for time travel.  That's pretty extravagant, you know.  That says every time somebody time travels, they create a whole new universe.  That sounds to me a little contrived.  But, it's worth talking about.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  I know that actually, Dr. [Ronald] Mallard is actually working on it, and it's of significant interest to scientists.  I know he came out to Ohio, and Central State's [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and Wright State's [Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio] science departments just emptied out, so they heard he was there, and they....
Speaker 2: Part of what he's working on is legitimate.  It may be possible at a quantum level to do a little bit of time travel, because things are so uncertain in the quantum.  When you get down to the quantum level, it is possible that information travels backwards and forwards in time a little bit, because things are kind of uncertain, anyway.  So, there are experiments, which I keep hoping to hear the results of, where you can essentially--you have a, it's a little bit like you send a photon through a filter, and then you detect it over here, and the filter can be this way or that way, and you detect it here and you decide what the filter should have been, and you change it.  I can't explain it quickly here, but there are experiments that you can actually conduct in principle, which would essentially require the filter to know what the result was before the result happened, and that feels a little bit like information traveling a little bit back in time at a quantum level.  That is allowed, actually, but it wouldn't ever yield going back and meeting your father, or anything macroscopic.  As soon as you get past a few quanta, you lose the possibility that this can happen.  So, yeah some of his work really is well-based in physics and would be a good start down the path, but I just don't think the path is going to lead where he'd like it to lead, that's all.
Story_ID: 30500
Speaker 1: Okay, well the biggest popular culture event at the time that you started at UC Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley], was a tv series 'Cosmos.'  I think he was trained at U.C. Berkeley, but he was teaching at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], Carl Sagan.
Speaker 2: Cornell, right.
Speaker 1: What did you think of that series at the time?
Speaker 2: I made use of some of it in my astronomy classes.  I liked it a lot.  I mean, I wouldn't have presented everything the same way, but I just thought it was clearly hitting a real chord with the public, and that was great.  So, I liked it.  I liked him, and I liked the series.  And actually, his writings are quite serious, 'The Demon Haunted World', and 'Contact' was a great science fiction book.  So, yeah, I liked Carl Sagan a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay, now 'Contact,' you were telling me when it came in, the character that Jodie Foster played was based on Jill Tarter, an astronomer who first named brown dwarf stars...
Speaker 2: Yes, she did her thesis on brown dwarfs, and called them that.  They've been called black stars, and a couple of other things before that.
Story_ID: 30501
Speaker 1: Now you are recognized as a person, as one of the experts on brown dwarfs.
Speaker 2: Yes, I am.
Speaker 1: So, how did you get involved in studying the brown dwarf phenomenon?
Speaker 2: Well, for the first decade or so that I was at [University of California] Berkeley, I studied star formation--star formation, star and planet formation.  So we can come back and talk about that.  But, in the early '90s [1990s], the University of California [Berkeley] and Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California] got together and invented a new kind of telescope that could be made bigger than any telescope before, and built them.  So, the two Keck telescopes on the summit of Mauna Kai have ten meter diameters, and the biggest telescope before that was the five meter diameter and telescope on Palomar.
Speaker 1: Where are they now?
Speaker 2: They're on the Summit of Mauna Kai a big island in Hawaii.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, they were, the methodology for doing that was developed in the late '80s [1980s], and then there was construction, and then they came online in '93 [1993].  And because--UC [University of California] basically had come up the design and Cal Tech had come up with the money, and so we owned most of the time on the telescopes.  So, this was clearly a career enhancing opportunity for those of us who were in the U.C. and the Cal Tech systems.  We had first crack at these new telescopes that were much bigger than, twice as big as anything that been around before.  And there were actually two of them.  And so I think all of us sat down and said, "What's something I can do now that I couldn't do before with this new tool that would make a real difference or be very significant?"  And for me, I decided to look for brown dwarfs.  Brown dwarfs are objects which are more massive than planets, but less massive than stars.  There's a gap of between about thirteen Jupiter masses and seventy-five Jupiter masses.  We didn't know any objects in there, but we knew what they ought to be like, and we called them brown dwarfs.  But they would be very faint, and hard to find, and they would cool off and when they were easier to find, they would look a lot like low mass stars, so how could you tell the difference?  And then when they were so cold that they couldn't be low mass stars, they'd be really, really faint, and really hard to find.  So, some people went that route, looking for the really cold objects, and I went the route of looking for a way to distinguish young hot brown dwarfs, "hot" being relative from very cool, low mass stars, which would be the same temperature.  And so and I went to high resolution spectroscopy because that's what I do, and someone had developed a theory saying that a brown dwarf, they all, they still have fusion, that's why they're not planets, basically, or one reason they're not planets.  But they burn heavy hydrogen, or deuterium, and that happens fairly quickly, a few million years.  And then a star would go on to burn regular hydrogen, but in the process of doing that, first it would burn up all of its supply of the element lithium.  And lithium is an element that you ought to be able to see in a brown dwarf if it's there, but if it's a low mass star of the same temperature and brightness, it would have destroyed the lithium.  So, if I go looking for lithium in high resolution spectra of the right kind of temperature and brightness objects, and I see lithium, then I'm looking at a brown dwarf, and if I don't see lithium, I'm looking at a star.  That was the method that I then applied.  But in order to do a high resolution spectrum of these faint red objects, you needed a big telescope, so that was the reasoning that lead me to that project.  And we were successful in 1995.
Speaker 1: Now, you pursued that project after you were a full professor?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (whispering) No, actually, I think I was an associate professor then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I became a full professor in '95 [1995] or 6 [1996] or something like that.
Speaker 1: It says '94 [1994] here.
Speaker 2: '94 [1994], okay.  But I was pursuing the project right during that time.
Story_ID: 30502
Speaker 1: Now, you said you want to go back to, do you want to talk about the accretion disk or any of the T...?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so my career has always had something to do with stars, and something to do with magnetic fields, even the brown dwarfs.  I quickly got back on to the topic of magnetic fields with them.  But when I came to [University of California] Berkeley, I'd been studying magnetically active stars, super giants, and so on.  One of the professors here, Len Kuhi [Leonard Kuhi], was studying the stars, which everybody thought were probably very young or maybe newly forming stars, called T Tauri stars, but nobody really understood them.  They had very strange spectra, but the spectra looked reminiscent of the solar chromosphere, actually, so this is how I got into this.  So, one question was well, are these just stars with incredibly active chromospheres, and if so, why?  Is it that the young stars are very magnetically active?  Or, is actually these spectra that look like chromospheres are not actually chromospheres, it's something else?  So, that was the line of research I took on for a while, and we were also--I've had a few significant discoveries in my career.  One of them was--I think it was actually my most cited paper, we realized that the emission lines that we were seeing in the spectrum both implied that yes, these stars are very magnetically active and have strong chromospheres, but that's not it.  There's something else happening.  Material is actually accreting on to the star from a disk of gas and dust around it, which is fascinating, because that's exactly the scenario one imagines you need to make planets, and so these disks turned out to be very common.  So, that kind of gave us an early clue that planets are probably very common as well.  And, then this accretion is actually mediated onto the star by the star's magnetic field.  So, my expertise in that particular area came in very handy.  So, for a number of years we inferred the properties of these T Tauri stars, which really was like looking at our own solar system when it was being born.  These are solar type stars at very young ages, and so we, through that period it was very exciting because we actually were finally able to take pictures of newly forming solar systems and could say with pretty good confidence what happened here when the earth was formed and the sun was formed, so that was a pretty exciting line of research.  And then I moved on the brown dwarfs, but then I quickly came back to the question of "And are those magnetically active, and how do they form, do they form the same way as stars, or do they form another way?" And I tied it all back together, and did that a number of years as well.
Story_ID: 30503
Speaker 1: In between the time of that project and the brown dwarfs, you worked on something called "Project Astro" connecting astronomers to school teachers, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, yeah we haven't talked about that side of my life at all, really.  After I became a faculty member at [University of California] Berkeley, I kind of right away starting getting involved in using astronomy as a hook to engage the public with science, and particular underrepresented minorities.  So, Project Astro was one of those efforts, but I was involved with programs on campus as well, where we used, we were trying to encourage participation in science.  So, yeah, that was one of a number of things I was doing, sort of in the public outreach arena, public outreach.  And also for students of color on campus, we had several programs that I was involved with that tried to foster their success.  You know, they'd gotten to Berkeley, they were interested in science, now let's make sure they graduate successfully and well, and go on to grad schools, if they want to.  So, I was involved even in 1982, and '83 [1983] in programs that were aimed at that.
Speaker 1: Were they pretty successful in terms of....?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they are.  What we found was the minority students were studying by themselves, they were isolated, they didn't know what other people were doing, they didn't get help when they needed help.  And the Asian students, for example, they'd always study together, and they'd help each other, and if somebody didn't get it, somebody else would explain it to them, and they'd all get their problems all done, and so on.  So, the model in this program was to bring students together with some expert tutoring and even create a discussion section in a calculus class that was kind of an honor's section, in the sense that you were going to do more work in that section, but you would study as a group and you would have this extra help, but you would do more problems and really get it down.  And that immediately changed people's performance remarkably.  Those programs are still going on today.  They're also in my portfolio now.  But I was actually faculty lead on one of these programs in the mid-'80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: You're right.  I've observed this on college campuses, too.  Asian students do work together.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it's the right thing to do.  I mean, we want everybody to work together.  Now we've built it into our astronomy class, for example.  We tell them, you should work together, and when we're having the discussion session, we're going to work in groups, and we just totally try to encourage that.
Speaker 1: Okay, that makes perfect sense.  And, okay, in 1996, you received a Chabot Observatory Achievement in Science citation.
Speaker 2: 'Chabow'.
Speaker 1: 'Chabow.' Okay, I'm sorry.  The Chabot Observatory is here in Oakland [California], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's here in Oakland, right.  Yeah, I mean, Chabot [Observatory] is another one of these efforts where we're trying to get science out to the Oakland community and so on.  So, they recognized me there and then I went on to the Board of Chabot [Observatory] in, I think, '99 [1999] or so, and I was on it for ten years.  They built a whole new big center up on skyline ridge here in Oakland. They moved the telescopes.  The telescopes had been there since the 1800s.  Mr. Chabot, you know, put them for Oaklanders.  But they were right on the fault, right on the Hayward Fault.  So, I guess it was in the '80s [1980s].  The state said, "You know, you can't have school kids come to these telescopes, because they're right on the Fault, so then we need to move them."  So, I've been involved with that science center for a long time, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I saw on-line where school kids, they have like programs in the summer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a whole--and a lot of school visits during the year, and so on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now we already talked about the lithium brown dwarf.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 30504
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now do you, have you gone after funding, research funding that's outside of the University [University of California, Berkeley]?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  All astronomers have to do that really, if you want to do research.   So, I've had a steady stream of NSF [National Science Foundation] and NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] funding, actually, since I came to Berkeley.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I don't, you don't seem to be--I don't know, but some of the politics about--we were talking to a biologist, and he was telling us about some of the problems...
Speaker 2: Well I did, I have one political story to tell.  It was right at the time I was discovering brown dwarfs.  So, I wrote an NSF proposal that said, "We're going to use the lithium test, and we're going to find brown dwarfs."  And I got four "Excellents", and one kind of "Okay".  And the guy that--and, you have to get all "Excellent" to get funded, so the guy, okay, said he didn't really think it was going to work.  Actually, he didn't have very good reasons, but he didn't think it was going to work.  So, I didn't, I wasn't funded for that project that year.  I of cour-The way it actually works is you forge ahead, you know, kind of on your prior funding.  You satisfy all of the things you needed to do for that funding, but then you need to start the next thing, because by the time it comes around to get that funded, you really need to really already show that it works.  It's a little backwards, but anyway, so then, we did discover the first lithium brown dwarf.  The year after that was rejected, so I sent the proposal in again.  I said, "Here it is again," and by the way, it worked.  Of course, everybody knew that at that point.  There was a big announcement, and so on.  Again, I got four "Excellents" and an "Uh" and the "Uh" said, "It worked once, but how do we know it's going to work again?"  And I thought, somebody's got it in for me here, you know (laughter).  So, I picked myself up--I went to Washington [D.C.], I went to NSF, and I said "What is this?" (laughter).  "I just discovered brown dwarfs and you got some reviewer here saying, "How do we know it's going to work?"  And I said, "What is that?"  And they said "Yeah, that's kind of weird.  We'll send it out to three other reviewers and see what they say."  They all said it was excellent, so then I got funding.  And, I've never figured out who that was, but it was kind of strange. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Somebody clearly was just..
Speaker 2: Somebody was just, they didn't want me to get funded.  But, I got over that hump.
Speaker 1: You really don't have to, I'm thinking that you really don't have to deal with some of the commercial interests and stuff like that, being an astronomer
Speaker 2: No, that's right. That's a good thing.
Speaker 1: People that make chemicals and things of that nature.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  There's no money to be made here.  It's much less cut-throat than biology, absolutely.  There are little arenas of cut-throatness.  For example, x-ray astronomers, they can only do x-ray astronomy if they have a spacecraft.  There's just no other option.  X-rays don't make it through our atmosphere.  You've got to be in space, and the opportunity in the x-ray experiments are very expensive, so there are very few opportunities.  So, they're pretty cut-throat about who's going to get the next spacecraft built, and so on.  But then the data all becomes public, so it's not that bad.
Story_ID: 30505
Speaker 1: Okay, you've also been involved in the search for planets, new planets.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Kepler Mission.
Speaker 1: Kepler Mission, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I should mention, one of my colleagues is Geoff Marcy, who's the premier planet hunter, he and I, so he actually did his thesis on magnetic fields on stars.  And he and I collaborated prior to him becoming very famous for this (laughter).  He was at San Francisco State [University, San Francisco, California] and working on the search for planets, and came over to [University of California] Berkeley as my visitor for a number of years, developing his techniques, basically.  So, I was kind of engaged on the edge of that.  One of my graduate students worked with him as well.  I was very interested in the search for planets, but it was, I didn't have quite the good taste he did to just pursue that.  It seemed more speculative to me, and I had more solid things I could go after.  Brown dwarfs even were more likely to succeed than--we didn't know about planets, although, as I said, the discoveries we made about star formation indicated that there should be a lot of planets.  So, then Jeff--actually the same year I found brown dwarfs, first extra solar planets were found.  So, that really took off, and Jeff moved over to Berkeley, and we're still goods friends and work together.  But I got involved in this Kepler Project, so that was an idea that somebody had in NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Ames, the principle investigator, Bill Borucki, he had this idea.  He actually had it early on, before planets were found, that one way to find planets would be through transits, which just means you watch stars very, very carefully.  If a planet crosses in front of the star, it's going to block a little bit of light, just while it's in front.  And you could measure that, you can't actually see it, but you can measure the drop in brightness.  And actually, it was Jill Tarter, was engaged by NASA AIMS to run a blue ribbon committee about whether this idea A: made sense, and B: whether it would be defeated by the fact that stars have a lot of magnetic activity on them, and the star sparks could cause fluctuations in brightness that were bigger than planets could cause, and would this prevent that from happening. And she engaged me as the stellar activity expert to help think about that.  And so that's how I became aware of the project.  And I decided that that wasn't going to be a killer for it, that you could deal with that, so I got involved that way.  There were a couple of unsuccessful attempts to get that proposal funded, but then extra solar planets were discovered, and then transiting extra solar planets were discovered, and suddenly it became apparent to a lot more people that this was a good idea.  And then the project was funded, and I was on the proposal that time as a co-investigator, so that was another piece of luck.  And my timing was, you know, at first I was just sort of a referee, then I was kind of a consultant for the project, and then I actually got on the project just when it got funded.  So, that project is now producing great results, you know.  We had an announcement at the beginning of February, of twelve hundred planet candidates, which is three times as many were known.  And some of them can be earth-sized, so that was the other point of this project.  It was about the only way we could, these days, find earth-sized planets in any numbers through transits.  You have to have very precise photometry, but they were able to show that we can achieve that.  So, I've been involved in that project, and obviously, from my science fiction point of view and my star formation point of view, was very interested in the question of planets and what their distribution is.  But my actual science with the projects is still related to the stars and their stellar activity.  You know, we'll have maybe a couple thousand planets drop out of this data set, but we're looking at a hundred and fifty thousand stars, all of which are generating these high precision light curves for several years, and there's a lot of stellar activity information in that.  So, that's actually--the papers that I write in this project are related to that, rather than the planets, although obviously I have a huge interest in the planets, as well.
Story_ID: 30506
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think the general public imagines when they see on CNN [Cable News Network] that a new planet has been discovered, that you were actually looking at a planet through...(inaudible)
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you're not.  Well, we have about three actual pictures of the planets, and you know, they look like a little dot of light.  So, it's not going to be that exciting for quite some time anyway, even if you have a picture, so astronomers are happy with the evidence of the planet.  Right now, we're just trying to figure out how often does nature make planets, what sizes, where, and that's what this experiment will be telling us.
Speaker 1: There's been some discussion lately of what is a planet, and poor Pluto has been demoted, and...
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: I've heard Neil DeGrasse Tyson talk about it on 'Nova' or 'Science Now' and --and there is a lot of backlash from people that love Pluto.  I don't know, they think about the dog when they...
Speaker 2: What they think about is the fact that they learned there were nine planets, and Pluto was the last one, and now somebody's saying that's not true, which kind of shakes their understanding of science.  Science, to most of the public, is a bunch of facts that you have to learn.  And now the scientists are saying, "Oh, one of these very basic facts that you learned actually that's not right."  So, that's disturbing, I think to a lot of people. Yeah, I've been heavily involved in the 'what is a planet' debate, and actually, Neil [Degrasse Tyson] called me back on his--he had a tenth anniversary panel on this subject, I think it was last year.  So, I was one of four experts brought in to discuss the question.  You know the guy who, and now there's this book out called 'How I Killed Pluto, and why it Had it Coming' (laughter) from one of our former [University of California] Berkeley graduate students, who was the guy who discovered the Eris, the larger than Pluto, Kuiper Belt object.  And you know, the only lengthy technical article on this subject is co-authored by me and him.  And the annual reviews of 'Earth and Planetary Science' asked me to write a review on the subject of what is a planet, and I said I kind of came at it from the high mass end, through brown dwarfs, and I should get somebody who came at it from the other end.  Mike [Brown] hadn't actually discovered Eris yet, but I knew he was going to, this was pretty obvious.  So, I said, "Let me ask Mike to join me on this paper."  So, we wrote this paper and we disagreed about Pluto.  So I think Pluto is a planet.  I think it's a dwarf planet, but it's a planet, and Mike has made himself clear on this subject. (laughter).  But, what I am proud of is that I spent three or four years very critically picking apart--what is all of this about, anyway?  And actually I had the great pleasure of getting a book a couple months ago in the mail.  Some couple of professors in Georgia, I think it was, writing a book on critical thinking, and used that article as an example of critical thinking.   So, that made me very happy.  I thought it through very carefully.  So, the planet debate actually occurs in four different arenas, that aren't that connected to each other.  People don't realize that, and this person argues in this arena, and that person argues in that arena, and they just talk past each other.  And so in order to come to a resolution, you need to understand which arena you're talking in, and what your position on that is.  And then you can decide.  Now, you may disagree because you disagree about the arenas, but you can at least understand why you're having a problem.  So, my fundamental position is planets should be defined by their physical characteristics.  Planet's a certain kind of thing, and that's true for most astronomical objects.  So, the dividing line between planets and brown dwarfs is where you get fusion or you don't get fusion.  So, if you get fusion it's not a planet anymore.  So, you know, stars have fusion, so that's not a planetary kind of characteristic.
Story_ID: 30507
Speaker 1: I was going to ask you, can you give us a definition...?
Speaker 2: I'll go through it.  So, I like to define the planets by their physical characteristics.  So, the upper mass end of the planets, I think, is where fusion begins.  That's about thirteen Jupiter masses.  The lower mass end of planets, I think, should be where the object is got enough mass that gravity will pull it into a spherical shape.  You know, no internal forces can stop that.  That's a little squishy, because it depends on what it's made of, you know.  If it's a rocky thing or an icy thing, that means it's a different size and mass, but you know, it's a clear enough criterion.  It's round by its own virtue, or it's not.  So, by that criterion, Pluto is a planet, so is Ceres, the largest asteroid, and so are some other number of Kuiper Belt objects, but that's fine.  That's a clear-cut physical definition of a planet.  The next arena, which is unrelated more or less, is what I call circumstances.  So, orbits-- what's it orbiting, who's orbiting with it, what kind of orbits, this kind of stuff, so it's a circumstantial thing.  This is what they used against Pluto.  So, you know, Pluto is orbiting, and the Kuiper Belt, and there's a bunch of other objects with similar orbits, so we're not going to call it a planet.  It turns out that if you take the earth and you put it out in the Kuiper Belt, it won't clear objects around it either, so if earth were there, it wouldn't be a planet.  I don't like that (laughter).  I don't like that way of defining things, you know.  It depends on where you put it, whether it's a planet or not.  But the IAU [International Astronomical Union], when they voted Pluto out, that was the criterion on which they voted it out.  It has to clear its neighborhood.  But that depends on the mass of the planet and where it is with respect to the star, and the mass of stars.  But that's a choice you can make.  The third criterion is how you made it, cosmogony.  People think a planet like the earth gets made by building it up from small objects all coming together and making this big thing.  Stars, you make by having a big cloud of gas which collapses under its own gravity and makes the object.  So, astronomers, where there's actually the main split in astronomers, is between people who think that if you made it by direct colapse, it's not a planet, it's some kind of star or sub-star, or whatever, and that that should be the criterion.  The trouble there is, we find these systems with an eight Jupiter mass object which is so far from the star that it's very hard to believe you put it together with little objects, but it's an eight Jupiter masses, so it doesn't have fusion either, and it's orbiting a star, so they would say that's not a planet anyway, because I don't think you made it like you should make planets.  So, you can see how these arenas are talking past each other, right.  You know, you have to decide what you want to do with that.  The fourth arena is just culture, what are our expectations about planets, and that's kind of where Mike [Brown] lives.  He's like, "Well, if I took your definition of planets, we'd have like fifty planets, or a hundred planets in our solar system, and I don't think we should have that."  Well, why not? "Well, that's not what we have. That's a cultural argument basically.  You should only have a few planets, they should be significant."  Okay, that's a cultural argument.  It's easy to ding that one, because the earth only became a planet, you know, four hundred years ago.  Before that, the planets were the lights, that moved in the sky, and the earth was the earth.  As we came to understand more astronomy, we said "Oh, actually the earth is a planet, too."  So, that shows that the definition of a planet is somewhat mutable, and it depends on what you're trying to do with it.  My point of view is, let's be astrophysicists, let's have a physical definition, and call it a day.  But, as you can see, there are these other arguments, and people use them, so that's why it's really not settled, actually.  Many astronomers would argue that Pluto is a planet, despite what some people have said, so it's not really a settled issue.
Story_ID: 30508
Speaker 1: The struggle between science and culture, in terms of cultural convention, is still there.
Speaker 2: Right. Well that's right.  That's the fourth arena.
Speaker 1: Even in the scientific community.
Speaker 2: And I do point out to my scientific colleagues, that culture is always there, you know.  We can come up with the scientific definition, and if people don't accept it, it's not going to fly.  So, I actually came up with my own definition, and I used, I deliberately used a slightly different word.  So, I said, let's define what I called planemos, which are planetary mass objects, that will define what planetary mass means by those physical criteria.  And so, Jupiter's moon Ganymede is bigger than Mercury (laughter), so that would be a planemo.  But, it's orbiting, and not the sun.  That's a circumstantial argument against it.  So, I'd claim, you know if I took it away from Jupiter, all of a sudden it's a planet, that's not a good kind of definition to have, so, I've tried that argument.  So, I said the planet is a planemo that is orbiting a fusing object, but a planemo is defined by these physical criteria.  Some people like that, and that's what I proposed in that article, but it hasn't caught on exactly, either, so we're still struggling with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you think, We consider all of these new planets that are being discovered--we were talking earlier before we started about looking out at the sky and seeing all the stars, and when you discovered, as you said, the earth wasn't a planet four hundred years ago, and the stars were stars, but they weren't suns, and now they're suns.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So, the imagination starts to...
Speaker 2: Well, the same is true of our galaxy, you know.  First, we didn't know anything about our galaxy.  There was just the Milky Way, which was some mysterious band of light in the sky.  Then for a while, people understood the Milky Way as this tremendous number of distant stars and they're concentrated in a plain, but thought that's the whole universe.  And you know, we saw these little spiral nebulae and things but we thought that those were just little spiral things in our galaxy, and then in the early 20th Century, we came to realize, "Oh, actually, we're in one galaxy and then these are all a whole bunch of other galaxies that are way beyond our galaxy."  So, we've had these conceptual leaps and the universe has gotten bigger and bigger and more complicated and interesting, as we've understood more, and I don't know if we're done.
Story_ID: 30509
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you imagine there's life on other planets or elsewhere in the universe?
Speaker 2: I certainly do, and I think the Kepler Mission is showing that there are a lot of rocky planets out there, and other kinds of planets.  And frankly, we don't know that you can't have life on gas giants, either.  That's just not what we're used to. And there've been science fiction books about life on Jupiter or whatever. and what we know about life is that A: It's based on organic chemistry, and organic chemistry is based on four of the five most common elements in the universe.  So, that doesn't make it sound like it's going to very rare.  And, secondly, on the earth, almost as soon as the earth had cooled off to the point where it could have life on it, it did have life on it.  So, that's an argument that maybe life likes to form as soon as the conditions get at all reasonable, it forms somehow, we don't know exactly how.  But then, the earth was you know populated only by one-celled creatures for the next three billion years, so that's a bit of argument that maybe life is common, but maybe complex life isn't so common.  Maybe that's a much more rare phenomenon.  We don't know.  We have one example, so, it's very hard to say.  So, my take--the other thing is, during that three billion years, the earth suffered any number of insults to its climate and asteroids striking and so on,  and the biosphere survived all that.  So, I think life is probably robust, and long-lasting and probably common, so that would imply that are probably billions of planets in our galaxy that have at least one cell of life on them.  It's still speculation, but the evidence for it keeps growing, and we haven't found anything yet that would make us change our minds about that.  Complex life, on the other hand, that's a much more speculative subject.
Story_ID: 30510
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm going to go to politics again, in a sense.  In 2006, you served as acting chair of the astronomy department [at University of California, Berkeley].  Did you enjoy being the acting chair of the astronomy department?
Speaker 2: I did, yeah, I enjoyed that.  It was a good year, it turned out, although it was also a year that my wife [Jessica Broitman] was going through cancer treatment, so I had to juggle--actually, I didn't juggle, I always put her first, but that job was flexible enough that you could do it, you could kind of pick your time for a lot of things, so I was able to do that.  We had a fairly stable staff situation that year.  I felt like I enjoyed it and did a reasonable job of it.  I was only doing it for one year because the chair, the then chair, wanted to take a sabbatical.  He was working on an experiment, and then he was going to come back and finish his term.  And then I would have taken over, except that I became vice chancellor instead.  You know, we haven't talked at all about sort of all the diversity work I was doing all through my career, which positioned me for that to happen.  But, at the time I became chair, that was sort of the last piece that allowed me to become vice chancellor.  But, I actually didn't think I would, because that was essentially my only administrative experience, that one year's chair.  But it was a pretty successful year, but vice chancellor, of course, was a high administrative position.  So, although I had had a lot to do with the progress, especially on the faculty front, at [University of California] Berkeley I didn't really think I was going to be in danger of being picked for that position, which I also actually also helped create, because I didn't have much administrative experience.  But, they decided to risk it. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  How's it been?  Have you enjoyed it?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have enjoyed it, and I guess it turned out that administration was not a big mystery to me.  I'm actually, I'm always amazed when I go to these leadership forums.  You know, you hear of change in management and all this stuff, and I'm thinking "Oh, yeah, of course, you do it that way."  Somehow, it's intuitive to me, so that's been very helpful.  But, yes, because I was working on all these diversity issues for a long time, from a position that was not near the top, it was always a struggle to convince the top leaders to do this or that, or even get their attention, or whatever.  So, it's a very different proposition when I'm the top guy, and all of a sudden I don't have to ask anybody whether we're going to do this or not, I'm going to initiate it and try to make it work.  So, yes, that has been enjoyable.  But still, it's an impossible job, and you can only just expect to make some progress, you can't solve the problem.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a problem that's been going on for a long time.  It's a problem that's persistent, and it needs a persistent...
Speaker 2: Yeah, it'll be around for a while longer.
Speaker 1: Okay, now have you been able to continue your research in astrophysics?
Speaker 2: Well, now that's become my night and weekend activity, as opposed to my day job, but yes.  Because the Kepler Mission is returning all this fantastic data, daily, I'm not in a position where I have to go looking for data or conceiving experiments or anything.  It's purely a matter of analysis, and it's all cutting edge data, so I'm happy to be in good shape on that.  I just don't have enough time.  I would be producing much more astrophysics if I weren't doing the other job, but that's okay, I will get back to that.  You know, I only took this position for a few years, so I'll come back to full time astrophysics.
Story_ID: 30511
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about some of the professional organizations you're a member of, as a physicist.
Speaker 2: Well, there's the American Astronomical Society.  That's probably the main one.  And then there's the International Astronomical Union, and the National Society of Black Physicists.  Those are the three main ones that I belong to.
Speaker 1: Have you ever served as an officer in any of those?
Speaker 2: I was the first chairman of the American Astronomical Society's Committee on the Status of Minorities in Astronomy, and then my protege became the chair after that for a number of years.  But, other than that, I haven't served in those capacities.  My service has been primarily at the campus and the UC [University of California] system-wide level.  I've served on a number of high level committees for the system, the President's Task Force on Faculty Diversity, the Region Study Group on Diversity, and things of that sort.
Speaker 1: Okay, what's the Association of Black...?
Speaker 2: Physicists.
Speaker 1: That organization has always impressed me, I mean, the people I've met who are in it, and the fact that when I found out there were some black physicists, I was even more impressed to find out that they had an association.  You go to a website, and you see "Physicists of the African Diaspora".  You know, there's Larry Gladney and Carl Spike, and, you know.
Speaker 2: Actually, there are a number of us, especially if you get beyond astrophysics to all of physics.  There's more than a thousand, I think.
Speaker 1: There's some physics pioneers that go back to the 19th Century that were black.
Speaker 2: On, absolutely.  And how they did it, I have no idea (laughter).  Talk about swimming upstream, it must have been amazing.
Speaker 1: That's something that's really impressive, too, that so many.  You had really an advantage over a lot of people, having a scientist at home
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a big help, having a role model right in your family.  I think that's part of, that's one of the big keys that the minority community is missing, is role models.  People in the inner-city, they just don't see any black scientists.  They don't know anyone who's a black scientist.  They just don't--that whole enterprise is invisible to them, and they can't see what the opportunity is there, you know, and they don't know how to get there.  So, that's a big problem.
Speaker 1: It really takes a lot of determination.
Speaker 2: It does, and then the schools aren't teaching them good science, either.  So, that it makes it pretty tough.
Speaker 1: I remember when I interviewed Larry Gladney, and he was--I've only interviewed a couple of physicists, but Larry Gladney was talking about growing up in Evansville, Indiana, and his people taking him to church and sitting long hours.  You know, he just didn't have anybody to talk about science with, nobody was...
Speaker 2: That's why I really appreciated the HistoryMakers event last week that was in the black church and with the black community.  That's a community that we don't see enough of.
Story_ID: 30512
Speaker 1: I guess it leads to a question we always ask, and you've kind of answered it in some ways, but what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I really do, I would like to see the community engage in science and technology much more than it does, because the jobs of the future are increasingly in that arena, and not that that's something everybody should be doing, but we should be having our fair share of that.  So, my hope starts though, with our educational system, that we would start serving our K-12 students better than, a lot better, than we serve them now, especially in the black community.  I mean, some folks have gotten out and live in the suburbs, and so on, but there's a lot of folks who are being very ill-served by urban schools, so I would like to see that changed.  That's sort of what has to change first.  And then, I would like to see them see the rest of the opportunity, but if they're not prepared in K-12, then the rest of it becomes very difficult.  So, that's the place I'd like to see the most change happen the earliest.
Story_ID: 30513
Speaker 1: Okay, when you look back at everything you've done at this point, is there any major move that you would make differently, if you could?
Speaker 2: You know, it's not like I planned this all out, but I wouldn't change anything.  I think I have, exceeded my expectations for myself somehow.  Probably that just means that I didn't set them high enough, I guess.  But [University of California] Berkeley has been a really fantastic place to be, it's been for a variety of reasons, but the astrophysics has been great, the culture has been great, the opportunity has been great, the positioning of me to be able to do good has been great, and my colleagues are outstanding, and Barry is pretty nice, too.  So, I really wouldn't change anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Likewise, I guess when you look back at everything you've done at this point, and I know you've got more to do, but what today would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, because I'm doing two things, basically, I'd like to leave a legacy in each.  I mean, I've left a pretty reasonable legacy in astrophysics already, but I would like to continue that work for another twenty years, and make a few more interesting discoveries. And I also want to start some new things, like maybe write a little science fiction, and then on the diversity front, I would like to have left the institution [University of California, Berkeley] a changed place, which is what I was hired to do, and what I think we're in the process of doing.  There are a lot of other forces for change right now. (side discussion)  So, one train that's coming is, this is becoming a very diverse place, and higher ed needs to get on that train, or it'll be in trouble.  But the other train, I don't like so much, which is for public institutions--it seems like the public is walking away from them, and I think that will be particularly damaging to under-served communities, and that makes me worry a lot.  So, while I'm working to change [University of California] Berkeley in a positive way to make it more inclusion and so on, I also worry that the character of Berkeley is under attack because the state is dis-investing from this whole enterprise.  The state already dis-invested from the K-12 enterprise, and we can see what resulted, and now it seems they want the same result in higher ed, and the University of California system is the finest public university system in the world.  Do we really want to take that apart and not have it serve its public purpose?  So, that makes me worry.  That's not a legacy I want to leave, it's not a result I want to see, and it's not something I can change so much, but it does give me a lot of worry.  But, I like to act locally where I can make a difference, and so I would like to leave Berkeley with some institutional changes that I think we have a good start on, that will make Berkeley a better place.
Story_ID: 30514
Speaker 1: What is the value of a research institution like [University of California] Berkeley, as opposed to a technical school or something?
Speaker 2: Well, the particular value of Berkeley itself, I think, is that you have a faculty there which is the equal of any faculty-Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], whatever.  And, but, they serve a broad public, so one of the statistics we're very proud of is, we have more low-income undergraduates at Berkeley than all of the Ivy's [Ivy League schools] and Stanford put together.  So, we really--and all these folks are getting an education from a very fine faculty, and Berkeley carries that reputation with it, so it's opening doors for them.  So, we're serving people who really need it, with the finest education.  That's what I'm worried could be lost. You know, I think Berkeley will remain a great institution, but will it continue serving a public purpose in such a strong way, that's really the question.  That worries me, and of course, my job is to try to make Berkeley do an even better job of that, both with the undergraduate at the graduate student level, and also the faculty level.  We should have a more diverse faculty who are of this quality, and that serves the public good as well.  So, yeah, I think Berkeley and some of the other top publics are really serving a particular role that no one else can serve, because of the students they have as well as the quality of the research and the faculty that they do.  It's putting those two together that's so important.

Speaker 1: Okay, you said you'd like to write some science fiction in the future?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd like to try, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's a lot of good literature coming out of UC [University of California] Berkeley, I mean a lot of good writers associated with the Bay Area here.
Speaker 2: There are, but actually the people I'm watching--there are a few other astrophysicists who are writing science fiction, who I enjoy a lot, so I'd sort of like to try to join that group, because they have real hard science in their books, but they're also very interesting books.  So, I don't know that I'm a good writer, so we'll see about that, but I certainly have ideas about some of the things I've learned and how you can turn those into interesting stories.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have an opinion about the black science fiction writer, the woman that wrote 'Kindred' and--oh God, I can't think of her name now.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure I know her work.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know, I'm blocking out--I'm getting old (laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm not sure I've read her.
Speaker 1: She passed away not long ago, but she wrote quite a bit of science fiction.
Speaker 2: Well, one of my regrets for the last twenty years or so, is I've done a lot less pleasure reading.  So, I haven't read that much science fiction or anything else, other than technical stuff for quite awhile now, so I'm looking forward to quasi-retirement where I can spend some more time reading for pleasure, and I'll get caught up on all those folks then.

Speaker 1: Now, well, tell us a little bit about your family.
Speaker 2: My current family, you mean?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, my wife [Jessica Broitman] was born in New York and is a psychologist and psychoanalyst.  She has a private practice, she also runs a low fee clinic in the city, in the Presidio [San Francisco], and she is the former president of a group that promotes a particular theory of psychotherapy that's I think very good--and she just finished writing a book and is writing another one on certain kinds of learning disabilities.  So, she's pretty busy and professional as well.  My son [Jacob Basri] is twenty and a theater major, and very intent on being an actor and director, so that's been his passion for about as long as I had astronomy for my passion.  We've always told him, "You should follow your passion."  So, he's doing that, and I think enjoying himself.
Speaker 1: Okay, are your parents still alive?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're both still alive.  My father [Saul Basri] still lives in Boulder [Colorado]. He actually retired early, so he's been retired for more than thirty years.  He kept doing physics for awhile, then stopped.  And he plays tennis and chess and he's very active, very healthy.  My mom [Phyllis Claire Whyte] is actually here in Oakland, now.  She's over ninety, but she's still active.  She plays bridge and she gets on buses and goes all around the East Bay [Calfornia] looking for bridge games.  She's got like five a week she goes to, so she's--you know, people at her living center say, "Well, where were you?"  She says, "Well, I'm not here during the day, I've got things to do."  (laughter). So, she's pretty active, too.
Speaker 1: Did she go on to teach dance after she...?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's after they moved to Colorado.  She taught dance for years.  She had a studio in our basement and after school there'd be girls of various ages in there for several hours a day.  And she also, when we lived overseas she learned Indian dance, and Thai dance, and belly dance, and so she taught those things.  She taught ballroom dance, she taught 'dancercise'.  She was a very dance oriented person until she was about eighty, and then she stopped doing that.
Speaker 1: You said your brother [David Basri] is in banking now?
Speaker 2: Banking software.
Speaker 1: Banking software, okay.
Speaker 2: He has his own company.

Speaker 1: Now, is there anything we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I think we've covered a good range of things.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a highly productive scientist who also left the world a better place.  And in a sort of legacy sort of way, I'd like my family to remember me as a great father and husband, and I think, my, most of the people who know me find me pretty flexible, easy-going and open-minded.  I value those things as well.  But from a legacy point of view, I'd like to leave a mark on science and a mark on the world.  That really sums it up well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you very much for sharing your story.
Speaker 2: Alright.
