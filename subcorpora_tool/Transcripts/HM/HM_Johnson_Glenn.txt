Story_ID: 76104
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, tell me about your family history.  Do you know very much about where your ancestors came from or what your family was doing in the 19th century or beyond that?
Speaker 2: Well, as far back as I heard, my family was in Arkansas.  I don't have any record of their being any other place.  In 1854, my grandfather [Richard Johnson] was born on the Stewart Plantation near Columbus, Arkansas.  And in 1950--1850, his master gave him as a wedding present to his daughter when she married a Mr. Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, let's backtrack a minute, because I think the dates are probably a little confusing.  But he was born in 18--
Speaker 2: Fifty.
Speaker 1: Fifty.  Okay, and in 1854, he was given--is that what you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was--1854 he was given to his daughter at the time when she married a Mr. Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So that's how he took the name Johnson.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  See when--1861 when the Emancipation [Proclamation] was slaves all took the names of their masters and that's why--that's how we got the name Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But the family, I guess, was associated with the Stewarts before, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is your grandfather on your mother's side or--
Speaker 2: Father's side.
Speaker 1: --Father's side, father's side.  Yeah, because of his name, right?  What about your ancestors on your mother's side, do you know much about them?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandmother, on my mother's side was named Carpenter, Mary Carpenter.  And she married Thompson then she married somebody else whose name I can't remember.  But anyway, all that was done before I was four years old.
Speaker 1: Now, did they pass down any stories to you about what life was like during slavery or any stories, songs or anything to give you any idea what life was like then?
Speaker 2: No
Speaker 1: They didn't talk about it much?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Do you know what kind of work they did?
Speaker 2: They all farmed.
Speaker 1: So on the plantation they--
Speaker 2: They never lived on a plantation.  They owned their own farms.
Speaker 1: --I mean during--I'm talking about during the 19th century, before slavery was over?
Speaker 2: They didn't talk much about--before slavery.
Speaker 1: But by the time you came around they owned their own farms?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And, see, my grandfather owned his own farm on both sides.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about he acquired it, you know after--
Speaker 2: Bought it.
Speaker 1: --Okay, all right.  Did he talk about the difficulties of trying to acquire land during reconstruction?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Story_ID: 76105
Speaker 1: So, well tell me about your parents.  Can you give us the name of your father and his date of birth and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Floyd Johnson was my father, son of Richard Johnson, and he married Reola Thompson.  Reola Thompson's daddy had left a 100-acre farm.
Speaker 1: Can you spell her name for us, sir?
Speaker 2: Reola, R-E-O-L-A.  It's in the "Who's Who".
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The correct spelling of it is in "Who's Who".
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--so when my mother and grandmother died, her brother sued my daddy to get control of me and the 100-acre farm (unclear).  So, of course, my daddy won the suit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he sued for control, not only of the farm, but of you too?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  It was really the farm that they were after, but it included me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Under what grounds were they suing to get you?  I mean what was the case for that?
Speaker 2: The suit really wasn't about me it was about--to get control over 100-acre farm that my mother had inherited from her daddy.  So naturally my daddy won the suit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Including me and the farm.  Now, I never lived on the farm, but my daddy did, he died on the farm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where did you live?
Speaker 2: I lived in Washington [Arkansas] where my daddy's grandfather lived.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Did you tell us when your father was born, I don't know if I caught that or not?
Speaker 2: I don't remember when my father was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was in the eighties somewhere.
Speaker 1: Okay, in 1880s?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And his name was Floyd you said?
Speaker 2: Floyd, yes.  He was his daddy's baby son.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather had ten children.
Speaker 1: Now what kind of person was your father?  Could you help us understand?
Speaker 2: He farmed.  He started off raising cotton.  Then he abandoned that and raised turkeys, he abandoned that and raised cattle.
Speaker 1: He kept getting to bigger and bigger livestock I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Had he gone to school.  Did he get a chance to go to school during his lifetime?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He went to a place called Haygood Seminary in Washington.  It was merely a high school, but that's where he met his wife--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --There.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that's your mother?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Now tell us about her, where was she born and what was her name?
Speaker 2: Columbus.
Speaker 1: She was born in--
Speaker 2: In Columbus.  That's eight miles away.
Speaker 1: --Columbus, Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was her name again?
Speaker 2: Reola.
Speaker 1: Okay, Reola.
Speaker 2: Her name is correctly spelled in the "Who's Who".
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, I'm asking for the tape, because people that listen to the tape won't have access.  And so she was born in Columbus, Arkansas.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And she was attending school at the same place that your father was going to school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And they met in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And that was ten miles away from--Washington is ten miles from Columbus.
Speaker 1: Now did they tell you--did they have a story that they told about how they met?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't--didn't tell, it's just that he met her and they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I probably was on the way at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did your mother do, what was she like?
Speaker 2: Oh, she was house wife.  She was 20 years old when I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did she--are there any particular things that she did in the community or any things that she made or anything like that that stand out that you remember?
Speaker 2: No.  See she died when I was two years old.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay. Alright.
Story_ID: 76106

Speaker 2: Gertrude Johnson France.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you spell that for us just for the record?

Story_ID: 76107
Speaker 1: Tell us about growing up in Washington [Arkansas], tell us about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up, what was it like?
Speaker 2: Well, I stayed in Washington until I was--finished the eighth grade, and then I moved to Hope [Arkansas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about Washington when you were a little kid, what it was like when you were little?  What kind of things did you like to do and what do you remember seeing--
Speaker 2: I played baseball.
Speaker 1: --What did it look like, you know, in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, Washington was a place about 500 people, and the place where I grew up is now--the house where I grew up is now in a museum in Washington.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Is it because you lived there, or is it--
Speaker 2: No.  Washington was the county seat at those days and the county business was transacted in Washington.  Hope is now the county seat, but when I lived there, Washington was the county seat.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  So the house that you lived in, why did they make that a historic site?
Speaker 2: Well, a fellow by the name of James Pilkinton, who also was born there, went to Virginia and he saw how the Rockefellers had restored old--old--well anyway, the Rockefeller restoration was in--incidentally, I've been there and seen that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They restored some homes and things?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they rebuilt--the Rockefeller people rebuilt old--Jamestown, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Rebuilt it like it was in the colonial days.  And so this fellow saw that and he decided that it would be nice if he made such a development out of old Washington.
Speaker 1: So he tried to redevelop, I mean, develop the old part of the town to the way it originally looked?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, the way it was during the Civil War.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my granddaddy's old house where I grew up at was selected to be a part of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And incidentally I've been back and I've seen the restoration.
Speaker 1: Does it look better than it did when you lived there?
Speaker 2: Yep, they improved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you like to do when you were a little fellow?
Speaker 2: Play baseball.
Speaker 1: Play baseball, okay?
Speaker 2: And go to school.
Story_ID: 76108
Speaker 1: Well what do you remember about school?
Speaker 2: I was good in school.  I graduated the eighth grade head of the class.
Speaker 1: Did you like to read?
Speaker 2: Three.
Speaker 1: There were three eighth graders?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were the top anyway?
Speaker 2: Yep, I was top of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Only place I've been in top anyplace in life.
Speaker 1: That's good.  So how many students were in the school?
Speaker 2: Oh, fifty.
Speaker 1: Fifty.  They're all the grades?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So how many teachers did you have?
Speaker 2: One.
Speaker 1: Okay, one teacher for fifty students?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no.  One for--who taught the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  One that taught the upper grades or just the eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was the principal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you learn a lot from him?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: George L. Tyus.  He was a teacher and a preacher.
Speaker 1: How did you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: T-Y-U-S.
Speaker 1: Did you have a regular school building or was it shared with a church or something?
Speaker 2: No.  We had a regular school building.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Story_ID: 76109
Speaker 1: So, after the eighth grade, you said you went to Hope, Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Hope.
Speaker 1: And that's the famous birth place of ex-president Bill Clinton, right?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Hope, Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So what was Hope, Arkansas like?  Was it different from Washington [Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  It was 15,000 people, and we had a big high school in Hope.  And so I entered the ninth grade in Hope.  I stayed there one year and my cousins, who lived in Hot Springs [Arkansas], decided that I should come over to Hot Springs and--because the high school [Langston High School] there was better.  So they didn't have to ask me but once.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well was it better?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Now these are both segregated schools, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, total segregation.
Speaker 1: So the school in Hot Springs was better than--
Speaker 2: Than Hope.
Speaker 1: --Yeah.  In what way was it better?
Speaker 2: Well they had a commercial department, one thing, I remember that.  See because I learned to type in Hot Springs.  In fact, I was a good typist in Hot Springs.  My commercial teacher in Hot Springs was also the pastor's wife of the Baptist Church, and so part of her duties was to prepare the church bulletin.  I was also supposed to be taking shorthand, but she excused me from shorthand to work on her church bulletin, and her name was Miss Woods.  She was the wife of the pastor of the Roanoke Baptist Church, and she supervised the bulletins.
Speaker 1: She got her work done by (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, but I never learned short hand, even though the record said that I did, I only learned to type.  I learned to type and cut stencils.  You know what a stencil is?
Speaker 1: --Yes, sir, I believe I do.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Stencils for--big stencils or--
Speaker 2: Stencil was a--you ran it on a mimeograph machine and so--
Speaker 1: --That kind of stencil, okay.
Speaker 2: --Yeah.  You ran them on the mimeograph machine.  And of course that's how you run the bulletins, you cut stencils--incidentally, when I got into the [U.S.] Army, I cut stencils and typed.  And so they offered me a chance to go to OCS [Officer Candidate School] or to be appointed a warrant officer, so I took the warrant officer instead, see because, I wasn't interested in going out on the field, firing any aircraft guns, be 90mm, the 40mm and the .50 caliber machine guns.  I loved to--I found my (unclear) in the army.  So I went all through the army a warrant officer.  I wasn't promoted any further.
Story_ID: 76110
Speaker 1: Let's go back to school, though.  In high school [Langston High School, Hot Springs, Arkansas], what other activity were you involved in in high school?
Speaker 2: Played football.
Speaker 1: Well how did you do as a football player?
Speaker 2: Well, I never learned to throw a pass, I never learned to catch a pass.  I played on the line.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was tackle and wasn't too good at that.
Speaker 1: You were down in the trenches?
Speaker 2: I used get down low and catch the man, tackle the man when he attempted to run over me.
Speaker 1: So how was it playing football in those days?  I've heard that some of the equipment that people have now they didn't have when they played?
Speaker 2: Nope.  I never saw a helmet, I mean, that with a face mask or any of that stuff.
Speaker 1: What were your helmets made of?
Speaker 2: Plastic.
Speaker 1: Were they hard?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I saw a boy get killed on the football field in Hot Springs [Arkansas].  We had no medical facilities or anything like that and he broke his neck and died 'cause he didn't have adequate medical care.  So we named a stadium after him.
Speaker 1: Was it common that people got hurt a lot playing football?
Speaker 2: Not too much. He's the only one that got killed.  But--oh, there's a lot of injuries, you know, leg, shoulders, stuff like that.
Speaker 1: What else did you do in high school?
Speaker 2: That's all.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What kind of a student were you in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was a good student in high school.
Story_ID: 76111
Speaker 1: Sir, so who were some of your high school teachers that inspired you.  Were there any particular teachers that took an interest in you that you really remember?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a Mr. Hicks, French Hicks, who's the principal [of Langston High School, Hot Springs, Arkansas] and who played football at Philander [Smith College] in Little Rock [Arkansas].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Philander Smith?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.  And so he wanted to develop me into a football player, but I wasn't for it.  When I played my last game in 1935 at Manassas High School in Memphis [Tennessee], I was ready to throw in the towel.  I didn't go out for any football at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  When I looked at those boys that were out there, they were all 250 pounders and what not, and so I didn't let it--and incidentally, I worked at Wilberforce.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I don't want to get you to Wilberforce yet.  But tell me about high school graduation, what was that like, do you remember it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was about fifteen of us in the high school class.  One boy got a full scholarship to Arkansas State at Pine Bluff, I didn't want that.  But the pastor of my church got me a scholarship, and he got it at Wilberforce.  So I says, well yeah, I'll go up there.
Speaker 1: Now, it must have been an A.M.E. pastor, right?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Thomas Primm(ph.), who later became Bishop.  He'd gone to Wilberforce.
Story_ID: 76112
Speaker 1: Okay. So how did you feel about going all the way up to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I was excited about going.
Speaker 1: Had you ever been away from Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Nope.  And when I changed trains in St. Louis [Missouri] to go to Ohio, that was a great feeling, no Jim Crow trains and there never been any slaves living there.  All that I could feel, it was a great feeling.  My aunt [Gertrude Johnson France], the one who raised me, accompanied me on the trip up to Wilberforce.
Speaker 1: Did she have any children?
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: No, okay.  So you were the only child, I guess, in the household?
Speaker 2: Oh, she had raised two others.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you were very special to her--
Speaker 2: Yep, yep. Yep, yep.
Speaker 1: --I guess, to take that trip.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So what was it like, you know, when you first got there, what was Wilberforce like?
Speaker 2: Well, I got a job.  At least they had a job for me, heating the hot water in the men's dormitory.  So I was known as Hot Water Johnson.
Speaker 1: Now explain how that works, because nowadays, I think people that listen to this are not going to understand, what does he mean by heat the hot water.  What did you have to do?
Speaker 2: Fire furnace to heat the hot water.
Speaker 1: Was it a wood furnace or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --Cold furnace.
Speaker 2: Cold furnace.  And when the football players come in, they all taking showers the water turn cold, and so they would--all the football players would be hollering at me, get the hot water on.
Speaker 1: So you were Hot Water Johnson?
Speaker 2: Hot Water Johnson.
Story_ID: 76113
Speaker 1: Well, what was campus life like at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was highly structured, fraternities and sororities and they dominated the world.  McGee and I were Alphas.
Speaker 1: What's his full name?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What's his full name?
Speaker 2: James McGee, who later became mayor of Dayton.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who later became mayor of Dayton, Ohio?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was a classmate of yours?
Speaker 2: A class behind me.  And he worked for a man name J. Aubrey Lane, a teacher there.  J. Aubrey Lane was Dean of men so we all called McGhee, Dean McGhee.
Speaker 1: So Hot Water Johnson and Dean McGhee.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep.
Speaker 1: So you all pledged Alpha?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Alpha Phi Alpha?
Speaker 2: Alpha Phi Alpha.
Speaker 1: Now what was that like, this was in 1936 or something?  What did they make you do to join, you know?  What did you have to do to pledge?
Speaker 2: Well you had to apply and be interested, so in order to be initiated, you had to have a "C" average.  I didn't have a "C" average.  I had pneumonia my second year there, so my grades fell off.  So I had to wait till next year, '39 [1939] when I made up the grades and was initiated into the Alphas.
Speaker 1: So who were some of the other classmates there that you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, John Litz(ph.), he later became a judge in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  And incidentally his niece worked for me as a law clerk after I got on Appellate Court.  She came in and said Uncle John sent me and so I said Uncle John who and she said Uncle John Litz.  So I hired her.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the professors at Wilberforce when you were there you know and who were some of the outstanding ones, and did you have any that really took an interest in you?
Speaker 2: Old McMillan(ph.), he was a German Ph.D.
Speaker 1: This is a German man, a black person who got--
Speaker 2: He got his Ph.D. in Germany.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  What did he teach?
Speaker 2: History.  I was a history major.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they talk much about the history of that area there, about Wilberforce and Xenia [Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You graduated in 1940, right?
Speaker 2: I was in the class of '40 (1940), but I didn't receive my degree until '41 (1941).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well what was graduation like and what were you thinking about in terms of a career, you know, at the time of graduation, were you thinking that you would teach history?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 76114
Speaker 1: While I was at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], I used to go to Asbury Park, New Jersey, to work and in Asbury Park the boys would line up and they say--and the person interviewing would say what can you do?  One boy says oh, I'm a chauffeur, he says, all right, and a lady up in Deal [New Jersey] who needs a chauffeur.  Next boy says I'm a salad maker, I can make twenty salads.  And he describe what he'd do to make twenty salads, so then he said, well go over to such and such a hotel, they need a salad man over there.  So the third boy says, oh I can do anything.  So the man said, well, we not hiring boys who can do anything today, says we want boys who could do something special.  I heard that and so.
Speaker 2: So what did you say that you could do?
Speaker 1: I was a dishwasher, so I got a job at the Berkeley Conrad Hotel operating a dishwashing machine.
Story_ID: 76115
Speaker 1: Now how did you end up working in New Jersey and going to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and you're from Arkansas?
Speaker 2: I never wanted to go back to Arkansas.  That was the reason I went to Wilberforce.
Speaker 1: Why didn't you ever want to go back to Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Well, my uncle that I lived with and who lived with my aunt [Gertrude Johnson France], they lived together, wanted me to come back and help him on the farm.  I was determined that I'd be too far away and never get back to working--working on a farm.
Speaker 1: And so you went the opposite way (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --You went to New Jersey.
Speaker 2: That's right.  See I figured that if I had gotten this scholarship to [University of Arkansas at] Pine Bluff that'll be close enough to come home on the weekends and work this eighty-five miles down to Washington [Arkansas].  Sure enough I only went home Christmas of '37 [1937] and Christmas of '39 [1939].  I went back twice and that was in the winter time, and they weren't working on the farm at Christmas time.
Speaker 1: So you didn't like farm life?
Speaker 2: I despised farm work.
Speaker 1: Determined not to do it anymore?
Speaker 2: I was determined not to do it anymore.
Story_ID: 76116
Speaker 1: So after graduation from Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Arkansas], now the war [World War II] is going on, right?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So what happened?
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't--one thing you didn't--you forgot to mention about Wilberforce was ROTC because you had an interesting instructor there, didn't you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who was your instructor?
Speaker 2: B.O. Davis.
Speaker 1: Benjamin O. Davis?
Speaker 2: Benjamin O. Davis, Sr.  We went on the field one day and we had federal inspection.  So the inspector called out Private Glenn Johnson, strip the B-A-R.  Well, I didn't want to be no soldier, I never practiced stripping the B-A-R, so I went through the motion of trying to strip the B-A-R.
Speaker 1: Now what is that anyway, trying to strip the B-A-R?
Speaker 2: Browning Automatic Rifle.
Speaker 1: Oh.  So they wanted you to disassemble it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, disassemble operation.  So the chief warrant officer Fisher who was in charge, turned to me he says, Private Johnson, isn't that the rifle that's waiting to go to ordinance for repair, I said, yes, sir.  He says take the rifle back to the arsenal where we stored rifles.  So I put it over my head and ran.  So they called another person, John Robert the Fox.  Old Fox could strip the rifle blind-folded and of course he did a marvelous job of stripping the rifle.  Fox was killed in North Italy in the mountains.
Speaker 1: So, I think you're implying that his skill with the rifle basically got him in combat and got him killed, right?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, and he aspired to be a rifle--to be a senior ROTC student and he was, and all he wanted to do was be in the [U.S.] Army.
Story_ID: 76117
Speaker 1: You said early that you tried your best to avoid being in the situation yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.  When we were signing up for the draft, there was a boy named Tom Harris, who was also from Hope [Arkansas].  He was looking for me and says now when you sign up for the draft, tell them your draft board is Hope, Arkansas.  Don't let 'em sign up in Xenia [Arkansas].  So I did.
Speaker 1: Now what was the reason for this?
Speaker 2: He said that nobody would remember you and me in Hope, Arkansas.  I says well the draft board down there will forget about us say 'cause we don't--they don't know us.  So I did what he told me to do.  When the Hope Star came out, the head of the draft list was Glenn Johnson and Tom Harris.  So I was sharp on--I was sharp on regulations, draft board regulations.  So I studied--I learned that if you're still in school, you could ask for--for a deferment.  So I wrote and told 'em that I was still in school at Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio].  So they wrote and asked me, the draft board did, when does Ohio State close?  I wrote to 'em and said it closes June the 18th, 1941.  So June the 16th, I had a notice from the draft board, I report for induction.  So I wrote 'em back transfer all my records to the local board from Mammoth County, Asbury Park, New Jersey.  So they did.  And while I was at Asbury Park, I got my first physical.  But then I wrote the draft board again, transfer all my records for local board for transfers, Washington, D.C.  So then came Pearl Harbor.  I was in Washington, D.C. when Pearl Harbor came.  So then I forget my number was up then.  So I didn't apply for anymore transfers.
Story_ID: 76118
Speaker 1: So immediately soon after that you were shipped out to North Africa?
Speaker 2: Well, I was inducted in Washington, D.C. and sent to Fort Meade, Maryland and at Fort Meade, Maryland is where they tested us, gave us shots and new clothes, army clothes.  And then I went to Fort Eustis, Virginia and stayed there for basic training and then went to Camp Stewart, Georgia.
Speaker 1: And then from Camp Stewart you--
Speaker 2: Came to Camp Dix [New Jersey] and sailed from Camp Dix.  Pier twelve Staten Island on the tenth of--on the first of May--on the first of April and on the twelfth of April, I landed in Casablanca [Morocco].
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was going on in Casablanca when you got there, did you stay there long or did you move on?
Speaker 2: Three months.
Speaker 1: How were black soldiers treated in the places where you served?
Speaker 2: Oh, Camp Stewart Georgia was rough, but I learned to (unclear) manipulate, get by.  It was totally rigid segregation in the [U.S.] Army so I decided we didn't have--to be competing with white boys so our promotions were rapid and then I was in the army six months and I'd a made a warrant officer.  Fellows were going OCS right and left.
Speaker 1: What's OCS?
Speaker 2: Officer's Candidate School.  You stayed in Officer's Candidate School ninety days and you come out a second lieutenant and they called you a ninety-day wonder.
Speaker 1: So you didn't opt for OCS at all?
Speaker 2: No.  I bluffed my colonel.  See I knew the colonel would come back from the officer's club at 9:30 and so I'd come back and I'd have a stack of books on my desk that high and he'd say--he asked another officer what's the sergeant doing with all those books.  He says oh the sergeant is preparing to go to OCS.  So then the same officers that he talked to approached me the next day and said we gon' appoint a warrant officer and you know, I'm chairman of the warrant officer board and if you took it, I suspect you'd pass.  So I says I got the hint, so I took the warrant officer's exam and passed it and became a warrant officer and I never got another promotion thereafter.
Speaker 1: You didn't get another because you weren't seeking one or you just didn't want one?
Speaker 2: Oh, I liked being a warrant officer.  There was nothing attractive out there in the shooting--out there where they shooting, in North Africa and up in Italy.  When another boy got shot, I stamped his record the Purple Heart or something.  I had stamps made and put in records.  So that's the way I went through the war as a warrant officer.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you figured it was a lot better to stamp a paper than actually being out there getting shot at?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
Story_ID: 76119
Speaker 1: So what are the most memorable, I guess, incidents of the war [World War II] for you.  I mean I know that--did you spend the whole war in North Africa?
Speaker 2: No, fifteen months in North Africa.
Speaker 1: Where did you go next?
Speaker 2: Oran.
Speaker 1: Oran?
Speaker 2: Algeria.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I went up as far as Algiers [Algeria].  That's where [Dwight D.] Eisenhower was stationed up there.  But I never lived in Algiers.  At Oran--I lived in Oran and Casablanca [Morocco], but I was permanently stationed in there.  One incident I remember at Christmas on New Year's Eve--on New Year's Eve night they (unclear) out on--out on the batteries took the 90mm guns and shot 'em off on New Year's Eve.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: I remember that.
Speaker 1: Did you get in trouble?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The colonel said down where he came from, meaning Alabama, says well, they always shot their guns at New Years' Eve, so it wasn't their fault because they had bigger guns this year than they had last year, other years.  They reduced the sergeants and things and--
Speaker 1: And so they got demotion for that?
Speaker 2: --Yeah, a demotion for that.  But they got their ranks back because they were good on the guns.
Speaker 1: So this was a temporary--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Loss.  So what's the most memorable thing about the war that you remember, I mean, your own personal reflection, something that happened to you?
Speaker 2: The pretty women in Italy.
Speaker 1: The war was different for you, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So there a lot of women stationed around where you were?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Civilians.
Speaker 1: Oh, civilians.  Oh, in Algeria and--
Speaker 2: Naples, Florence, Milan, I was in all the principal cities of Italy except Venice.  And Venice was off limits to us because [Josip Broz] Tito was threatening to take Venice back, you know, the Yugoslavians had originally owned that section of Italy and so they were threatening to take it back.  So we sent the first army division in there to be stationed up there to discourage Tito from taking it back.
Speaker 1: This is Marshal Tito--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Of Yugoslavia?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Spelled T-I-T-O.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 76120
Speaker 1: So how long were you in the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: Three years.  Oh, while I was in the army?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Three years--(unclear)--Forty-eight months.
Speaker 1: Forty-eight months?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: That's it.  Okay.  That's four years?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So you were in through '45 (1945)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.  I went in February the 17th, 1942 to January the 8th, 1946.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, I wasn't actually in the army that long.  I left the army October the 15th but they give you the days--when I got home I had eighty-five days accumulated (unclear), so they let me come home October and give me eighty-five days, paid me in cash for eighty-five days.  See the army had a system, you didn't use furlough time overseas, you got recreation time, R and R, rest and recreation.  So all the places that I went, I was on R and R, rest and recreation.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to meet any of the, since you were like--working in the warrant office, did you meet any of the general, like [General George S.] Patton or any of those people?
Speaker 2: No, I heard of them.
Speaker 1: He was in Italy.
Speaker 2: Well, Mark Clark, didn't really meet him, although I worked under him all through Italy, Truscott, who succeeded Marshall Clark, I never met him. I never met anybody above the grade of colonel.  Other folks I just read about 'em.
Story_ID: 76121
Speaker 1: During that time period did you think about going to law school?  When did law school come in, when did you start thinking about that?
Speaker 2: When I originally went to law school, well, I originally went to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], I enrolled in pre-law, but I discovered that graduating in pre-law I wouldn't have anything specific, I could do.  That experience in New Jersey cause me to changed and get in high school teachers.  But when I come back out of the [U.S.] Army with forty-eight months of GI time coming, I say well, this is--I go back to my original thinking.
Speaker 1: So what was the process of getting into school, after the war, did you get a GI Bill right after the war?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And was it hard to get into school?
Speaker 2: Well some places it's hard, some were the--I was turned down at Columbia [University, New York, New York], University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], but I was accepted at John Marshall [Law School, Chicago, Illinois], so I went to John Marshall.
Speaker 1: Well how did you like Chicago [Illinois]?  What was Chicago like, was it different from other places that you lived in?
Speaker 2: Well I left Arkansas feeling that I would go into practice where I lived, so that's--I got in John Marshall, so I stayed in Chicago.
Speaker 1: What about the law school (unclear), what was John Marshall like?
Speaker 2: Well I married my classmate [Evelyn Johnson] at John Marshall, so.
Speaker 1: How many black classmates did you have or were there many, you know, black students?
Speaker 2: That's my John Marshall graduation picture there.
Speaker 1: People can't see it.
Speaker 2: There's three women and about seven black students in the class of graduation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there any particular focus that John Marshall had, you know, was preparing students for--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Dean said only focus was to prepare lawyers to practice law in Illinois.  Those who went into the State's Attorney's office come out and be criminal lawyers, those who went into corporation counsel office, came out and become civil lawyers and that was the thing.
Story_ID: 76122
Speaker 1: So from John Marshall [Law School, Chicago, Illinois] I eventually went into the Attorney General's Office and I stayed there until I went with the [Metropolitan] Sanitary District [of Greater Chicago].  I stayed over there three years and then I was elected judge in 1966.
Speaker 2: --Now you mentioned that you were in the State's Attorney's Office, who was state's attorney?
Speaker 1: Attorney general.
Speaker 2: Attorney general, I'm sorry, attorney general, yeah--
Speaker 1: Latham Castle.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I served under four attorney generals, Latham Castle, Grenville Beardsley, I've forgotten the--
Speaker 2: So you moved on to--you were just saying you were elected judge in '66 [1966]?
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: Was that difficult?
Speaker 1: Nope.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Who were some of your mentors or people that--
Speaker 1: Claude Holman.
Speaker 2: --Okay.  Now he was an alderman?
Speaker 1: Alderman.
Speaker 2: Of the fourth ward?
Speaker 1: Fourth ward.
Speaker 2: All right.  How do you spell his name?
Speaker 1: Holman, H-O-L-M-A--M-O-N.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Claude Wiley Bell Holman and he would cuss you out if you called his full name.  Claude W.B.
Speaker 2: He didn't like his full name?
Speaker 1: Didn't like his full name.
Speaker 2: All right.  Now he was a mentor to Tim[othy] Evans too?
Speaker 1: Yep.  He worked under Richard Westbrook.  Have you ever heard of Richard Westbrook?
Speaker 2: No.  Tell us who Richard Westbrook was?
Speaker 1: He was the greatest black appellate judge in the state and he was a trustee at John Marshall.  And Claude Holman succeeded him on the trustee board.  I succeeded Claude Holman on the trustee board at John Marshall.  Tim Evans succeeded me on the trustee board 'cause Tim Evans is there now.
Story_ID: 76123
Speaker 1: So you were involved in--now these were--Claude Holman was really involved in politics in the city [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: All of us were.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It was a real political group.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And Holman was the first black--well you got like, I can't think of his name now.  His name slipped out of my mind.  But Holman was--they were--he was part of that Silent Six, was he, back in the old days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but Holman would get out of his grave and come back and choke you if he heard you say he was part of the Silent Six.
Speaker 1: I wasn't around here in those days, but I heard the stories, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I heard that--I heard that and anybody who says Holman was part of the Silent Six, if they had political ambitions, that was the end of them.  I heard that many times, but I never used it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Smart enough not to ever use it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You been here a long time.
Speaker 1: In a way of speaking, I guess.  I hear stories, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 76124
Speaker 1: So what were the black--what was the black political position versus [Mayor Richard J.] Daley in those days?  I know you may think it's self-evident to people, anybody watching this, but people in the future are going to be watching this who don't know.  So I just want you to kind of tell us, you know, what things were like?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll give you my history.  I was a Claude Holman protege and every promotion that I got came from Claude Holman and was approved by Richard [J.] Daley, the other Daley, so that's how I feel.  Now there are others who feel differently.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're saying, basically, that Claude Holman was a friend to you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Definitely.
Speaker 2: Definitely.
Speaker 1: What were the issues in the black community in those days, the key issues that people were working with?  What were the issues and what were the most important issues in the black community, say 1966 through '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure I can define the issues in those days, because I stood with Claude Holman, I stood with Daley and that's why I retired from the Appellate Court.  Now, there are others who didn't stand with them and they have held no further public offices and that was--
Speaker 1: Okay, so one of the keys to be in public office was to be connected, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: --Yep.
Speaker 1: Now tell me about your career as a judge.  What was it like in your career as a judge?
Speaker 2: Well, I was judge from '66 [1966] until I retired in '94 [1994].  I won all elections during that time, so because--and I might say if [Claude] Holman and [Mayor Richard J.] Daley had lived, I'd a been on the [Illinois] Supreme Court rather than [Justice Charles E.] Freeman today.  But they died on me, so.
Speaker 1: When did Claude Holman die?
Speaker 2: Seventy-three [1973].
Speaker 1: And of course Daley died in '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, something like that.
Speaker 1: Towards the end of the mid, I guess the late '60s [1960s] through the time that Richard J. Daley died is quite a bit of controversy in the black community over civil rights, housing and education, what was the--did any of it come across to you to, you know, in the form of cases that you had to make decisions on?
Speaker 2: I never had but one conversation with Daley in my life and that was to ask him to let Tim[othy] Evans succeed Claude Holman on the council.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he did it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes. Alright.
Story_ID: 76125
Speaker 1: Now, did you know [Mayor] Harold Washington in those days?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: What was your impression of him?
Speaker 2: I succeeded Harold Washington at the Sanitary District and Harold Washington was a congressman before he was elected mayor.  I don't think I ever had my picture made with Harold Washington.  I believe it was once, once an African judge was here visiting and I was with him, but that's the only time that Harold and I had our picture made together.  See because the white boys on the bench was suggesting that I recuse myself of hearing any cases with Harold Washington.  So I would always say, well, Harold Washington had never been to my house, I never been to his house 'cause I'm no friend of Harold Washington, he's no friend of mine, so.  That's the way the other boys played it, so that's the way I played it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So eventually though a lot of the court cases that were filed on behalf of the Washington administration would win, you know, further up the ladder, right?  Is this true?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sometimes they'd be knocked down at the lower level then they would end up winning at the higher level.
Speaker 2: Most all of those cases were two to three, or two to one.  One and two Italian boys went the other way.
Speaker 1: We only have three members of the appellate court, I mean three votes?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Appellate Court sits in threes, so.
Story_ID: 76126
Speaker 1: Well, what are some of the highlights of your career on the bench?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What are some of the highlights of your career on the bench, you know, as a judge--as an appellate judge during all that time.  What were the most memorable decisions you've been involved in?
Speaker 2: Well, I had set 115 opinions and I can't think of--I don't have one that stands out any more than the other.
Speaker 1: Is there nothing that came across that you felt that was absolutely critical, I mean, it's always critical I guess that you make the right decision, but I just wondered if there was something that you thought was more important than maybe something else, nothing?
Speaker 2: No, I can't think of anything, anything that's more important than the other, I set (unclear) opinions that I participated in.
Speaker 1: When you form an opinion, do you consider yourself a strict constructionist or more of a liberal with it or what?  What is your judicial philosophy, do you have one?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would say I was--I'd say I was a liberal.  Now the other folks would say I was conservative.
Story_ID: 76127
Speaker 1: Who are the six black alderman in the [Chicago] city council back in '66 [1966], [Claude] Holman was one?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Bob [Robert] Miller.
Speaker 1: Ralph Metcalfe, right?
Speaker 2: Ralph Metcalfe, [William] Campbell.  How many is that, six?
Speaker 1: That's five, I think.  If you can't think of it, that's all right.  It's close.  Those six and William Dawson, you know, at one point formed like the--that was the black formal representation in the city, basically, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So you retired in '94 [1994], right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So you were there through the entire [Mayor Harold] Washington administration?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.  What was your assessment of the Washington administration, what it meant for the black community?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a great administration.  Washington, like all the other folks, when he got in office, he hired his friends and most of his friends are black.
Speaker 1: Did you think the black community was better off?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm expected to say yes.
Speaker 1: I don't know now, you be honest.
Speaker 2: Well, I'll say yes, whether I want to or not.
Speaker 1: Now if you were to say no, what would be the reason?  You've already said yes, but if you were to say no, what would be the reason for saying no?
Speaker 2: I can't think of any.
Speaker 1: Can't think of any reason?
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.
Speaker 1: But if somebody else were to say no, what would be their reason?
Speaker 2: Well, you'd have to go ask them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You certainly been to law school, so.  I can't touch it, so.
Story_ID: 76128
Speaker 1: Well, I'm going to ask you a couple of philosophical questions.  It's about life in general.  The first one is what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure that I have any.  I think we get in a better post.  We hold more important positions today than we ever did.  The other people who, I'm sure, would say we're not, but I feel that we do.  For instance, John Stroger is in a powerful position.  Nobody else has been president of the [Cook] county board before, nobody have been all of the positions that he holds.  Jesse White [HM], who's Secretary of State, my wife who is assistant Secretary of State would love to have that--got that position.  There's Darcy Brown who's clerk of the court, there are three congressmen now where they only had one for a long time.  Bobby Rush [HM], Jesse Jackson [HM] and Danny Davis [HM], I say black people are all over the country.  Course, I differ with those who say that we're worse off today than we've ever been.  We have a black mayor in Dallas [Texas], New Orleans [Louisiana] and a host of other little towns, Detroit [Michigan].  We had three blacks in Detroit, mayors, consecutively.  Coleman Young, Dennis Archer and a young fellow that's--
Speaker 1: Kwami Kilpatrick.
Speaker 2: Yes, Kwami Kilpatrick.  He was our speaker for the Cook County Bar Association last year.
Story_ID: 76129
Speaker 1: Now you participated once in an international conference [World Conference on World Peace through Law and World Assembly of Judges] for judges in Ivory Coast.  When was that, can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was 1973.  Earl Warren was there, Thurgood Marshall was there, and I thought that was a wonderful organization [World Association of Judges], but they had a self-perpetuating hierarchy and so the chief,  I don't know whether he's dead now, but he got too old to function and so he never let anybody else succeed him, so the organization died.  I thought that was a wonderful organization.  I went with 'em to Abidjan [Ivory Coast], Manila in the Philippines, Seoul, Korea, San Paulo, Brazil.  They met every two years and on the opposite--in a different continent.
Story_ID: 76130
Speaker 1: Sir, so what would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not sure what my legacy is.  As one who certainly made good in this time, but what my legacy is, I haven't defined it yet.
Story_ID: 76131
Speaker 1: Another question would be how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, I wish to be remembered as a judge who served on the Appellate Court longer than anybody else and who never lost an election and--those two things I'd like to be remember by.
Speaker 1: Why do you suppose you never lost an election?
Speaker 2: I voted straight democratic party.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but why did, you know, why did you keep winning.  There were other candidates?
Speaker 2: Claude Holman and [Mayor] Richard [J.] Daley were with me.  If they said don't run, I didn't run, and if they said run and we're with you, I ran, and I always won.
Story_ID: 76132
Speaker 1: Now did your aunt [Gertrude Johnson France] and your father Floyd Johnson] live long enough to see you become a judge?
Speaker 2: No.  They died before--they both died before I was elected judge.  My aunt said before she died that I had exceeded her wildest dreams and I was then only attorney general--assistant attorney general.  She came here [Chicago, Illinois] to my wedding and she died before my father, but neither of them ever saw me become a judge.
Story_ID: 76133
Speaker 1: If you had to give advice for young people now who are thinking about getting into law, what would be that advice?
Speaker 2: Well I tell 'em go in and incidentally a lot of people ask me for advice.  I'd tell 'em go into be a general practitioner and once you're experienced little sheep, you'll--which way to go.  But the law isn't a general thing, you have to study it all.  You can't study, okay I'm gonna be an entertainment lawyer.  Well, you got to get it all, and once you get it all then you can--your experiences will direct you any which way to go.  It will direct you into politics, it will direct you into criminal law, it will direct you into personal injury law and all those kind of things. Incidentally, I mentioned Tim[othy] Evans, he's the first Afro American to be chief judge of the circuit court [of Cook County, Illinois] and has 300 judges working under him.  Tim Evans says I'm his mentor.  He says that publicly all the time.  I'm very proud of that.  Tim, you know, came from Hot Springs [Arkansas] where I grew up.

Speaker 1: That's me and that's my wife, Judge Evelyn Johnson.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER:  When was this shot and where?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I never seen it before.
Speaker 2: You never seen it before?
Speaker 1: Uh-uh.
Speaker 2: How old are you about then do you think, you look like you're maybe, that's in the '60s [1960s], I think, because of the three-button suits.  Could that be about '61 [1961]?
Speaker 1: No, no.  I didn't become a judge until '66 [1966] and she didn't become a judge until '80 [1980] something.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Okay, go ahead, sir.

Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Do you know approximately what year, Sir?
Speaker 2: It was in my late years, '90 [1990] . OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  In a naive question, but if there are three judges who sit on the [Illinois] Appellate Court, why were there four of you there?
Speaker 1: One is off every day we sit.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER: I see, okay.
Speaker 1: See, it's a matter of three and one--
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Okay, how about this one?
Speaker 1: That's students at John Marshall Law School [Chicago, Illinois], students or employees.
Speaker 2: That's recently though, that's 199-, that's 2003, right, I believe it's a recent photo?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: John Marshall Law School when you received an award in this the year or late last year?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's the chief warrant officer.  That's a fifth army patch that I wore and Mark Clark commanded the fifth army.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Okay.
Speaker 1: That was snapped in London [England].  I was in London with the Illinois State Bar Association and that's a wig, the garb that the British judges wore.
Speaker 2: Those were all people who attended the World Peace, a world of association of judges, doctors, let's say.  That's William Thompson in the middle, he was Secretary General of the conference and that's his wife.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Here?
Speaker 2: No, that's his wife.  And those were just participants of the conference.
Speaker 1: Those were pictures taken during my campaign in '66 [1966] of us, my wife.
Speaker 2: Who's this on the end?
Speaker 1: William Stark, he was my classmate at John Marshall Law School.  That's (unclear), she's a lawyer in Chicago [Illinois] now.  That's Helen (unclear).
