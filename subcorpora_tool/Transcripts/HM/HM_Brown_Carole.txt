Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history first.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side and your father's [Garland Brown, Sr.] side.  But we'll start with your mother's side first, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Addie A-D-D-I-E, Estella E-S-T-E-L-L-A, Cobb C-O-B-B, Brown, B-R-O-W-N [Addie Cobb Brown].

Speaker 1: Okay, well, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Not very far I know, her immediate siblings and I knew my grandfather [Howard Cobb], her father, her--and--her two of her aunts and various cousins, but that's as far back.
Speaker 1: Is there a ha- a family history or tra- tradition as they passed down, you could show us?
Speaker 2: History? Well my, my mother grew up very poor and she--in fact, I remember my mom buying her family their first indoor plumbing, so she grew up very poor.  My grandmother [Alnonie Sessums] was kind of a day worker, did whatever they could--they all picked in North Carolina was cotton and tobacco, so all of the kids did that growing up and her aunts and--did that as well her--she had an aunt that took a liking--my mother was the oldest of four kids and she had an aunt that took a liking to her and thought that my mother--and my mother went to live with her and my ma- and my aunt put her though schools and that's kind of how my mother got out of the--got educated and was able to go college.
Speaker 1: Okay, now are there, there any stories about your great-grandparents or about the end of slavery or Reconstruction or that sort of thing that are passed down?
Speaker 2: Not on--not really on my mom's side, they didn't really talk about it very much, no.
Speaker 1: Do you know--did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I knew my grandfather.  My grandmother passed when I was less than one year old, so I didn't really know her very well.  I knew her sisters, my Aunt Ruth [ph.] and my Aunt Hazel [ph.], but I never knew--really knew my mother's mother.
Speaker 1: So, as far as you know, they were, they were like involved in agriculture stuff, farming and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes. My Aunt Hazel was a teacher.
Speaker 1: Oh Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But, everyone else was involved in farming, and did day work, cleaning people's houses and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now--so your mother had a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mom went to college, she went to NCCU [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina].  My gre- my Aunt Hazel--my Great Aunt Hazel put her through school and my mother was a math teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she, so she taught in--did she teach in Bal- I guess she taught in Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: She taught in both, they--she taught in North Carolina when my parents were first out of school.  Then we moved to Fredericksburg, Virginia and they taught there for two years and then they went to Baltimore and that's where we grew up.
Speaker 1: So you said your mother's aunt kind of helped her to get--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my Aunt Hazel, for whatever reason--my mom--like I said my mom was the oldest and my Aunt Hazel kind of took--had no kids of her own and kind of took my mom in and put her through school.  And my mom lived with her in Roanoke Rapids [North Carolina] actually for her senior year of high school and then she put her through college.
Speaker 1: Was you your mom, mom from a large family?
Speaker 2: My mother had two sisters, my Aunt Georgia May [Georgia Cobb (ph.)] and my Aunt Shirley Jean [Shirley Cobb (ph.)].
Story_ID: 633116
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name was--is Garland Allen Brown Sr. [Garland Brown, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is January 26th, 1932.
Speaker 1: And he was born in Halifax (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was born in Halifax County, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--well what, what do you know about his side of the family or what can you tell us about them?
Speaker 2: My, my grandfather [Nelson Brown]--his father was a--my father describes it a hustler.  They don't really know his--he never knew his date of birth or where he was born.  He married my grandmother [Velvie Parker Brown] who was a nurse.  And they had twelve children.  Not all of the children survived and my, my father's side of the family was much larger.
Speaker 1: Okay. So your, it's your, your, grandmother's side that's really--I mean is that one you might know more about I guess?
Speaker 2: Right, my grandmother her maiden name was Parker.  And we still have family reunions and it's Ivy Parker.  And she--that was her family and, and the Ivy Parkers are kind of the family that we identify more with.  And keep in contact more with.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She was a nurse?
Speaker 2: She was a nurse.
Speaker 1: Did, did she work--I mean where did she work, was it in a black hospital?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she worked in the black hospital in Halifax County.  She worked really doing all of the general nursing but, spent a lot of time with the infants, with the babies.
Speaker 1: Now was the hospital connected to a black university or school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just supported by the county or something?
Speaker 2: It was supported by the county.
Speaker 1: Okay. You remember the name of it?
Speaker 2: I don't, I can find it though. It was where I was born.  But I can get the name.
Speaker 1: And you said your grandfather was kind of a hustler?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he died before I was born so I never knew him.  But, that's how my father always described him (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did he have any stories about what he hustled?
Speaker 2: According to my father he hustled everything.  But, you know, you know, they'd wake up that's how they got food.  They'd wake up that's, you know, there would be clothes sitting on the table.  And they never really questioned, you know, where they came from.  That's just how they--
Speaker 1: This was the Great Depression?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Written about a lot and people had to hustle.  You know, a lot pe- people had--especially, you know, on the economic level where you didn't have ownership of things.
Speaker 2: Well it's interesting because he sounds like a--again I didn't know him, but he sounds like he was very--as much of a hustler as he was, he was a disciplinarian. He was very strict about his kids getting education and he thought that was important because it was important to my grandmother.  And so all of my aunts and uncles were educated.  All of them went on to college except for my Uncle Fred [Fred Brown] who died in the war.  But, it was pretty impressive giving that time for them all to have done that.
Speaker 1: Yeah so, did they have pretty good local schools there as you--as far as you know?
Speaker 2: As far as I know the school--they had a good local school.  They obviously--in North Carolina especially there were a lot of historically black colleges [HBCUs] where--that supported educated--young educated people at that time.
Speaker 1: That county--was, was the school associated with the church or do, do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Story_ID: 633117
Speaker 1: Your father's [Garland Brown, Sr.]--all his brothers and sisters were able to get an education?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That--I mean that's remarkable.
Speaker 2: Yeah my, my father's younger brother, my Uncle Calvin [Calvin L. Brown] was one of the first African Americans to graduate from North Carolina--University North Carolina's law school [University of North Carolina School of Law, Chapel Hill, North Carolina].  He's an attorney.
Speaker 1: When did he come out of that?
Speaker 2: I don't have--I don't know what date it was.
Speaker 1: Well not exact date but say in the '50s [1950s] or '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: It would have to be '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: In the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, and I have a--my uncle--my Aunt Margaret [Margaret Brown] was nurse as well.  My Aunt Jo [Josephine Brown] was a teacher, and a nurse.  My Uncle Nelson [Nelson Brown] was a--worked in a factory in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me go back I'm a little slow to react, I'm trying to wake up to this.
Speaker 2: Sorry.
Speaker 1: But, you say your uncle went to University of North Carolina law school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that, that's the Chapel Hill [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That probably didn't happen 'til--I don't think they had in black students 'til the--had to be late '60s [1960s] early '70s [1970s] I guess [sic.], I would think--I think that's the segregated school up until they were force to bring people in--I guess.  I mean what do, what do you think?
Speaker 2: I can call him and ask him 'cause don't really know.  But, I know that they--he--my par- everyone went to NCCU for undergrad, North Carolina Central [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: North Carolina Central?
Speaker 2: For undergrad. And he went on to the University of North Carolina for law school.  But, it could've been that he was out of school for--out of undergrad for a while and then went back to law school.
Speaker 1: They had big law school, you know, in the '50s [1950s] the-that--the Sweatt v. Painter case [Sweatt v. Painter, 1950], NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] case to try to get He- Heman Sweatt [Heman Marion Sweatt] into the University of Texas law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas] and--I mean most law schools in the South would not admit black students.  They, they pay your way to go to another school, you know, rather than admit you.  So I just wonder then they started in North Carolina.  That's interesting so who's ever watching this I guess they can do some--do research.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You don't have to do it?
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm just (unclear) right now, so I wonder when that did take place.  But, so was he--did he practice law in a black community or did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He practiced law in Charlotte [North Carolina] and still practices law in Charlotte?  And primarily I think among African Americans.
Speaker 1: Now, what's his name?
Speaker 2: Calvin Brown.
Speaker 1: Calvin Brown, okay.  We interviewed [HistoryMaker] Julius Chambers in Charlotte about five, six years ago.  You know he was a big NAACP lawyer and such--but Cal- Calvin Brown.
Speaker 2: Calvin Brown.
Story_ID: 633118
Speaker 1: What stories did your father [Garland Brown, Sr.] tell of growing up?
Speaker 2: He talk--I mean my father probably was more colorful and he talks about how they dug a Olympics size swimming pool one weekend, you know, (laughter) whether you believe it or not and they--
Speaker 1: Wait at school or, or at home?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he and his brothers supposedly which is like one the--
Speaker 1: Just out in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  Whether we believe it or not and he talked about how my grandmother [Velvie Parker Brown] use to always say my father took very much after his father [Nelson Brown] and so he, he was somewhat of a hustler himself.  And somewhere he got a car, and my grandmother would just say, "Every couple of days just drive by the house and blow your horn so I know you're alive."  They talked about how they were--my grandmother's house there was church that was--for years and I thought it was her church because it was the church we went to that was right behind her house and they talk about how they were trying to get rid of the then minister and he wouldn't leave and so my father and his brothers went and physically removed him (laughter) from the church and carried him out.  He had a colorful growing up, my dad did.
Speaker 1: It was a Baptist church I would guess (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes (laughter) yes it was, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So yeah it sound like--now did, did they swim in this pool?
Speaker 2: Supposedly they dug an Olympic size swimming pool that they then--
Speaker 1: Filled it in with concrete or, or--
Speaker 2: I don't know (laughter).  The story changes every time they tell it.  But, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, does he, he talk about what race relations where like down in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: You know, they were challenging--my father went to Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina] as well as NCCU [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina].  He--I remember when I was growing up we used to like the show 'Happy Days.'  And he would say how things were not happy days and he did desegregate the lunch counter, you know, went down town and tried to desegregate lunch counters.  He did--was active in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] when was in--I guess must've been grad school.  You know, went to the March on Washington.  So my father was always very politically engaged.  And talked about what a difficult time it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's, that's good to know.  'Cause it--'cause that's when, you know, it was real crisis in the country.
Speaker 2: Right, so.
Speaker 1: so, so he was involved in SNCC at Shaw University?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, did he go to Shaw first or NCC?
Speaker 2: He went to--my father went to so many different schools.  He went to--had to be NCC--no in Shaw first and then NCCU.  And then he went to Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Got a doctorate--master's [degree] from Indiana.
Speaker 1: He's a teacher?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was--all right--so he--all right.
Speaker 2: Shaw and then NCCU.  'Cause he really identifies more with Shaw.  He's still active in the trustees, he pledged at Shaw, so.
Story_ID: 633119
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities and their talents and dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My dad [Garland Brown, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: I just do, I always have.  I think the political act- political activity, the interest in politics.  I think my father--I use to always say in our house debate was a sport.  So we always would sit around and talk issues and my father would take the opposing view just for the interesting discussion.  Whether he believed it or not.  And I enjoyed doing that.  And we're both stubborn, headstrong so.  My dad.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a, a--what's your mother's [Addie Cobb Brown] personality like?
Speaker 2: My mother's very smart.  Very much a homebody.  A lot more creative than I am and, you know, like decorating and things like that so.
Speaker 1: Okay but different?
Speaker 2: Yeah different, different personality.  Definitely was the mom.
Speaker 1: Now do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have an older sister, older brother, younger brother.
Speaker 1: Okay, what are their names and where do you fall?
Speaker 2: The oldest is my sister Vanel [Vanel Brown].  She is forty-seven, forty-seven.  Next is my brother, Garland [Garland Brown, Jr.] and he's forty-six, then me and then my younger brother Howard [Howard Brown] who is thirty-eight.
Story_ID: 633120
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest childhood memory?  My earliest childhood memory is we were living in Fredericksburg [Virginia], I had to be two and my mom [Addie Cobb Brown] was leaving for work and my Aunt Shirley Jean [Shirley Cobb (ph.)] was babysitting us and I remember crying as she was leaving.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your memories start really in Fredericksburg?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a, that's a suburb in Washington, D.C. basically, or, or Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: It's closer to Richmond than--Richmond, Virginia than D.C.  I never considered--not--unlike Arlington [Virginia] I never considered it a suburb of--
Speaker 1: I know I get them mixed up with Fredrick- I get Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg mixed up.
Speaker 2: Yeah Fredericksburg is a little closer to Richmond and so.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was, was the neighborhood like growing up--I mean did you stay there long in Fredericksburg?
Speaker 2: No, we moved to Baltimore I want to say in 1967.  So I was three and we first moved into Baltimore City and we lived in an apartment.  I think it was called Beacon Hill, Beacon Hill apartments [ph.].  And my memory of that was that it was one of the apartment complexes in Baltimore that was just starting to be desegregated.  And the way that they desegregated is that they sold or rented the apartments to black families lived at the bottom of the hill on those apartment and white families lived in the top of the hill on those apartments.  So--and the reason I remember that is that to use the pool and the, the center--the common center you had to live on the top of the hill.  So it didn't say that you weren't like blacks weren't allowed at the pool but in order to use it you had to live in one of the apartments at the top of the hill.  And I can remember my father [Garland Brown, Sr.] taking it--taking us and organizing a protest.  I can remember picketing and I had to be three, the pool (laughter) and just going round and round and picketing the pool.
Speaker 1: So what happened?  What was the result?
Speaker 2: You know that part I, I don't remember ever getting to use the pool, so I don't know--I don't think the result was successful, but I do remember the protest, and then I think about a year later we moved into the house that my parents live now out in Baltimore County [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay, so did your dad teach in the Baltimore public school system?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, they taught in the county school system.  My dad taught social studies and history and my mom taught math.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father also taught at Community College of Baltimore [Community College of Baltimore County, Baltimore, Maryland], taught classes at Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and classes at Coppin [Coppin State College; Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland] as well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 633121
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds and smells, sights and sounds.  I, I can always remember, we would--when I was much younger, probably until about high school age.  We always had Sunday dinners, then it got less frequently--frequent so I can always remember--yeah things cooking Saturday night.  My mother [Addie Cobb Brown] would start Sunday dinner, you know, Saturday night.  I can remember those smells and I can remember my sis- she would take turns--my sister [Venel Brown] and I would take turns with who got their hair washed first, because whoever got their hair--one of us would get it straighten because we would--my mother would straighten our hair with a hot comb and I can remember sitting in the kitchen either Saturday night or Sunday after Sunday dinner getting my hair straightened and that smell of the hair burning--I don't know we always had--we would spend summers in North Carolina.  My parents would ship us off and we stayed with cousins or with my grandmother and it always smelled like pine.  My Aunt Hazel [ph.] lived in front of, of some woods and we would always go exploring there and it was a lot of pine trees and don't know what else.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how was your--well you were only about six when you moved down to the, to--
Speaker 2: Suburbs.
Speaker 1: Suburbs so, so what kind of house did you all move into?
Speaker 2: Same one we live in now, it's like one of those general--Cape Cod, you know, it was four bedrooms, two baths--two and a half bath, Cape Cod, standard suburban track house (laughter).
Story_ID: 633122
Speaker 1: Tell us about school now.  What--do you have an earliest school memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest school memory I have is being--after moving to the suburbs, being dropped off for my first day of kindergarten [at Woodmoor Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland].  My dad [Garland Brown, Sr.] actually dropped me off and I don't remember why he did and not my mom [Addie Cobb Brown].  And I remember there was one other black girl in my class Charrisse Sullivan [ph.], I don't know why I remember her name, (laughter) but Charrisse Sullivan and she was much taller than I was, but that's my earliest memory.
Speaker 1: Were the only--were you the only two?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, so.
Speaker 1: So, all right, so you were basically integrated?
Speaker 2: Yeah we integrated, I remember we were all very smart and I remember when my mom took my brother [Garland Brown, Jr.] and my sister [Venel Brown] up to register them for school.  It was public school and they would have three different classes so they'd have the higher class, the faster moving grade--class in the grade and then average and then below average.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the tracking system.
Speaker 2: Right, they would track the kids and without taking--giving them any kind of a test or anything the principal just put my brother and my sister in the lower--the lowest classes because they were the only--I think the only African--black kids in there--I know my sister was in her grade and I remember my mother having to argue and, you know, perform if you will to get them to at least test her to show her that she was above average because there was the assumption that because we were black we were not as smart as the other kids.
Speaker 1: I imagine your mother could be persuasive.  She was a teacher, and educator herself (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right, yeah and I think, you know, she was always sensitive to that and education was such a big deal at my house that--I remember we started reading very early, we always played kind of word games and things like that so, she knew her kids were probably above average.
Speaker 1: So were you reading before you went to school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I actually taught my, my older brother how to read.  He's 'gonna hate that I (laughter)--
Speaker 1: You taught your older brother--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I was always kind of running after my sister and my sister loved to read so she had taught me how to read, so I taught my older brother how read.  I also taught him how to tie his shoes.
Speaker 1: And he was in the middle between you two?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I see, so girls, they say they develop faster, (laughter) and I, I believe it, you know, that's probably true.  He probably wouldn't mind that much.
Speaker 2: Okay, anymore (laughter).
Speaker 1: But okay so, do you remember your first teacher?
Speaker 2: No.  The first teacher who I remember her name was my fourth grade teacher, Mrs. Pevner [ph.], but I don't remember my other teachers.
Speaker 1: Do, do you have a--what was it about Ms. Pevner that--did you remember the rest of the names after her or just, you know, basically her?
Speaker 2: I'm sitting here thinking, I remember fifth grade, Mrs. Molden [ph.], sixth grade Mr. Ware [ph.], so I think fourth grade is just the one I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, you know, junior high school, you had a bunch of teacher so.
Speaker 1: Did--I mean since there're only two black girls in class, you know, when you first started school I mean--do you have, have a sense now of how you were treated, or you?
Speaker 2: I don't recall not being treated like everyone else.  I don't remember that.  I remember, I remember probably being a little bit precocious and obnoxious 'cause I was probably so much smarter than everybody else so--I'm sure I got on everybody's nerves not--(laughter) but I don't recall being treated differently because of skin color, probably just 'cause I was obnoxious.
Story_ID: 633123
Speaker 1: We're talking about school and--so just a few teachers you really remember but--and you were talking about that you didn't really recall being mistreated.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Are there, are there any stories from school? Apparently you were a good student?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a good student and I really--I didn't find school particularly challenging probably until college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], so I was disruptive, I was--I used to talk a lot in class cause--and I remember when I had gone on to junior high school, my parents [Addie Cobb Brown and Garland Brown, Sr.] had to go a--my--when I was in seventh grade to go to a teacher conference because I got straight A's and I pretty much got straight A's all through school, but I also got straight twos which was you got a one if your--for perform- behavior or two (laughter) and I got straight A's and straight twos and so my parents had to go up to school and talk about why I was always talking in class and disrupting.
Speaker 1: Was it talking pretty much?
Speaker 2: It was pretty much talking, but you know, you'd--we'd sit in the back of the classroom and joke and, and I wasn't always friends with the smartest kids and so, they needed to be listening and so I was--it was disruptive, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you got A's?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But the--some of the other--the, the kids that wanna listen they couldn't focus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so.
Speaker 1: What kind of--what were you interested in?
Speaker 2: Growing up I played the flute.  So I was in band all through school.  And in high school [Milford Mill High School; Milford Mill Academy, Baltimore, Maryland] I was on the track team, and yearbook editor and class government things like that.
Speaker 1: So, so were you interested more in the arts than the sciences?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was never big on math and science through my high school years and even through college I just--it wasn't--I was--I liked--if I had a favorite class it was probably lang- in high school, it was Latin and I liked history and social studies and English more than I liked math and science.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any favorite teachers or mentors in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my favorite--I had a--my Latin and French teacher Mr. Rifkin [ph.]. He's probably one of my favorites. He was--I had him all through high school and he's very demanding and very smart and just made class fun so he's probably my favorite teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's in high school?
Speaker 2: That's in high school.  And junior high cause I went--so the first year of junior high was in Woodlawn [Woodlawn Junior High School, Baltimore, Maryland] and I was disruptive so my parents pulled me out that school and I went to a school not--I'll say not in my neighborhood called Pikesville [ph.] which was--my father thought it might be a better influence on me and he was teaching at that high school.  But, it was school that was like 98 percent Jewish.  And during the course of the time from when we started in kindergarten and growing up the neighborhood had started to se- desegregate a lot.  And so the number of black families that were moving into the neighborhood were growing and so by the time I graduated from high school--I mean I'm sorry from elementary school [Woodmoor Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland] on to--go on to junior high school the classes were more like 40 percent black or things like that and so my father took me out of that environment and put me in a junior high school that was 98 percent Jewish and I was the only black student in any of my classes.  And I think--and they thought well she won't be as much of a behavior problem so.
Speaker 1: So--well--so-now did--
Speaker 2: And I hated it (laughter). All my friends were back at the other school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the idea was to get you away from your friends?
Speaker 2: Right it was a much different culture, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--well how did you do there academically?
Speaker 2: Academically, I did well.  The same, you know, it was different it was I had less to do.  Less to distract me so I think in that sense they were correct 'cause I didn't really have--I didn't really have friends at first 'cause I didn't know anybody so I had less to distract me and so--but academically it was the same.

Speaker 1: What's the most trouble you ever got into?  Can you--do you have a story about that?
Speaker 2: The most trouble I ever got into?  (Laughter) The most trouble I ever got into was my junior prom.  I can't believe I'm about to tell this story on tape.  But, I was a runner and I had had a district track meet or something like that at--that night--the day before my junior prom.  And then a bunch of us were meeting before the prom and as kids do--and I hadn't eaten--and as kids do they drink and so we drank before the prom and I went to the prom just almost ready to pass out and I actually did pass out at my junior prom (laughter) and not funny at all and they called the ambulance and a hook and ladder and so I was taken out of my junior prom in like an ambulance with a hook and ladder in front of the school [Milford Mill High School; Milford Mill Academy, Baltimore, Maryland] and so of course they had to call my parents [Addie Cobb Brown and Garland Brown, Sr.] and I wake up in like the emergency room, you know, having--so that's was the most trouble I ever got into.
Speaker 1: Did your parents know why that you passed out?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah (laughter) oh yeah, so.  I was in trouble for a little while.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, all right well that's a way to make an impression (laughter) okay so what did you run?
Speaker 2: I ran the quarter, the half and I was a high jumper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the quarter mile is a grueling race?
Speaker 2: I think it's the hardest race to run because it's--you run it like a sprint but it's pretty long, so.
Speaker 1: So, it sound like you were pretty determined person to run a quarter 'cause we--I know when I was in high school they lined us up to see who could do it first to be able to pick somebody (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we were--my high school we had really--I don't know what it's like now but we had a lot of participation in all the sports and so it was fun and we were good we won, you know, the state champions on indoor and outdoor and so it was fun.
Speaker 1: Track?  Okay.
Story_ID: 633125
Speaker 1: What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Milford Mill [Milford Mill High School; Milford Mill Academy, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is that per- predominately white school or?
Speaker 2: It was changing so it started out--it was predominately white, predominately Jewish and then by the time I graduated I'd say my class was about 35 to 40 percent black.  But, the school was probably 60 to 70 percent black by the time my younger brother [Howard Brown] went there it was a 100 percent black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you were in a couple situations where you had a lot of Jewish classmates.  Did, did you learn anything special from, from the Jewish people?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well my, my best friends really from high school were all Jewish and we would--in junior high school especially you learned all about the Jewish holidays and Jewish traditions because on certain--of the high holidays there'd literally be five people in the whole school because everyone was gone so, you know, you learned a lot about their history.  A lot about their holidays and traditions we would spend Thanksgiving--my best friend Allison [ph.] and I we would split Thanksgivings and so she would come to my house for--and then we'd go to her grandmother's and, you know, so that was the first time I ever had kugel and it was the first time she had probably ever had greens and, so yeah.
Story_ID: 633126
Speaker 1: But in ter- terms of black history and culture did your father [Garland Brown, Sr.] talk about that at all?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Like you want examples of--
Speaker 1: Well he's--since he was civics te- teacher and a history, te- teacher I was wondering if he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Black history as it relates to Jewish people or just in general?
Speaker 1: No, just in general.
Speaker 2: Oh in general, yes of course.  My father--we would--history in general my father was very into.  You mentioned Harpers Ferry [West Virginia]. I could probably give you tours of Harpers Ferry because we went there not only for school field trips but family trips.  We went down to Harpers Ferry, we went to the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.].  My father was--I remember we went to Boston [Massachusetts] one year and--to do the Freedom Trail in Boston so our family trips were a lot of times historically based and very much about education.  And then the history at the black experience--I think I mentioned that my dad went to--he was at the March on Washington and so he very much wanted us to know the history know it didn't just start the Civil Rights Movement, it didn't start with Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and where it had started and that there was march before that was organized by A. Philip Randolph and, you know, he wanted us to know who Marcus Garvey was those things so he very much talked about it.
Speaker 1: Sound like you had a pretty well rounded--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father actually did a Fulbright in Liberia.  Because he wanted to study more how this culture of African Americans who had gone back to Africa to start a country.  How it was working and the challenges that they were facing.  And kind of how their culture had been impacted and influenced by the African American experience so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know we interviewed a gentlemen that teaches French at Morgan State [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] who is in charge of the Fulbright--Sandye Jean McIntyre [HistoryMaker Sandye Jean McIntyre, II]. I think that's him.  It was--it, you know, he's the one that shepherds over most of the Fulbright scholars in black schools [HBCUs] and it's--so it's probably--I, I'm guessing that's probably when it was in--(unclear) but at Shaw [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina] but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, actually he did it 'cause he did it--I was out of school.  So he did it in the last fifteen, twenty years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh okay. Okay.  All right.  He might know Sandye Jean McIntyre at Morgan.  That might've been how it was hooked up I'm speculating.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's, that's exciting, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 633127
Speaker 1: When you were a senior in high school [Milford Mill High School; Milford Mill Academy, Baltimore, Maryland], what was your career aspiration when you think--what were you thinking about a career?
Speaker 2: I didn't know I, I--when I--as a senior in high school, I was editor of the yearbook and I loved to write and I think I wanted to do something in that kind of realm like magazine or--that was kind of where I was headed but it wasn't this--it wasn't a strong pull.  But, I think that's what I wanted to do--I wanted to be like a magazine feature writer, reporter something like that.
Speaker 1: I read I think some material I was given that you wanted to be a singer at one time?
Speaker 2: No, no, not me (laughter). I could never sing, so yeah.
Speaker 1: But, magazine editor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I wanted to do something kind on the creative side. I wanted to write, whether write for a magazine or write books or write movies. I wanted to--I thought I wanted to be writer.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, this is, this is late '70s [1970s] it was '82 [1982] now?
Speaker 2: Eighty-two [1982] is when I graduated from college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: So were you familiar--did your family read a lot of the black magazines, like Essence and (unclear), Ebony (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, mostly Ebony and Jet were the magazines that we got and we also--my parents [Addie Cobb Brown and Garland Brown, Sr.]--they probably still do subscribe to the Afro-American [Baltimore Afro-American; Afro-American Newspapers] which was a black music--paper in Baltimore [Maryland] and my sister [Venel Brown] read Essence.  My sister--I think, I wanna say I got introduced to Essence when my sister went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and started reading Essence, but it was Ebony and Jet were the magazines.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was--in terms of popular culture, was television and music a big deal in your house (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, very much so, very much so.  Like most--I think we watched TV all the--TV in every room practically, and watched TV a lot.  Parents--my parents would have card parties on Friday nights and--yeah their friends would come over and the kids would play in the basement and music would be playing so, very much.
Story_ID: 633128
Speaker 1: Was there anything in your upbringing that would make you think about business or finance?
Speaker 2: No, no my parents [Addie Cobb Brown and Garland Brown, Sr.]--like I said my parents were teachers.  I didn't really have an understanding or concept of what business people did or finance and I hated and--I didn't think my strength was numbers, was math or science.  I didn't feel like I was practically technical when I was growing up, I've always kind of erred on the creative side or was directed toward the creative side so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now--so we had to figure out how--
Speaker 2: How did I get there?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: So--wow when you were a senior, you must've had exceptional grades.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had great grades, I did well on my SATs.
Speaker 1: Were you a member of the National Honor Society?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Great grades, did well on my SATs and knew I was going to college.
Speaker 1: What were you SAT scores?
Speaker 2: Oh god, who remembers that--well it was one before they were cal- recalibrated, so they won't--but they were in the high 1400s so like 1430 or something.
Speaker 1: It was a high, high score.  Did, did you--what, what was your class range when you graduated high school [Milford Mill High School; Milford Mill Academy, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: I was third, third in the class so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you get a chance to say anything in graduation or?
Speaker 2: I'm sure I did, I was vice president of the class, editor of the year book.  One of the more popular people, so I'm sure I spoke at graduation--I don't--or senior day, but I don't--I was not valedictorian or salutatorian, so I know I didn't have like a formal speech, but I'm sure I spoke but it's blur (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. All right. So--
Story_ID: 633129
Speaker 1: Now you went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: How did--not everybody goes to Harvard and usually it's the number one person in the class that goes and very few in any high school goes to Harvard but, how many--were you, were you the only person?
Speaker 2: I was the only one in my class that went but not the only one from my school [Milford Mill High School; Milford Mill Academy, Baltimore, Maryland].  But, the only one in my class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how did--you just applied and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually my father [Garland Brown, Sr.] picked every one of our schools, every one of the schools that we went to my father picked them for us (laughter).  And the way--I wanted to go to--my first choice was Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] and I don't know why other than it's a beautiful campus and I just wanted to go to Cornell.  And my father made me do my Harvard application. I remember we got into a big fight 'cause I wanted--I waited until the last day to do it and didn't want to go--I'm not going to Harvard and I remember he read my first draft of my essay and he was like. "You can do better than that. You're not--," you know, so we had this struggle to get me to do it, and then once I got in I was like--I was still hell bent on going to Cornell and Harvard had this thing called pre-freshman weekend where the minority pre-freshman that are in--that are accept- accepted go up for the weekend meet and stay with other minority students and meet some of the faculty and it's a way to get, you know, basically to recruit minority students because even now--even with the blow- blowing up of college applications, it's still hard to sometimes attract minority--or a diverse student population.  So I went up for pre-freshman weekend and had a great time and when I got home I was like I'm going to Harvard (laughter) and so that's how I ended up at Harvard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they--you didn't--you kind of felt that you were gonna get in anyway--I mean--
Speaker 2: Well this was after I had been accepted.
Speaker 1: Oh after you had been accepted?
Speaker 2: But, the pre-freshman weekend was after I had been accepted so I knew--so it was still my decision.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right well it's, it's--so, you know after some resistance you decided to go to Harvard (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And so what was it like? It's 1982 fall, right?
Story_ID: 633130
Speaker 1: Started in the fall of 1982.  It was great. Going to school in Boston [Massachusetts] I think is an incredible experience because there are so many schools in that area, and so you just get to meet people from all different schools and so even though at any particular school the black population might not be small [sic.], when you aggregate it all together.  We had a pretty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts], Tufts [Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts], Northeastern [Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tufts, MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Wellesley [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts], Bentley [Bentley College; Bentley University, Waltham, Massachusetts], Brad- Brandeis [Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts], Babson [Babson College, Wellesley, Massachusetts], BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], BC, Northeastern, and I'm missing a lot and then everybody would come down like--so if there was big weekend on Harvard's campus [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], folks would drive down from Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] and UMass Amherst [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts] and up from Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island], so it was--it was just a great environment in which to go to school so--and then Harvard was, you know, you become spoiled as Harvard student because so many people come to your campus.  And you have just access to so much and you're so plugged into everything that's going in the world.
Speaker 2: For instance?
Speaker 1: For instance, Desmond Tutu I heard him speak and met him at least three times in my Harvard time I was here.  I remember Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] coming.  We had a thing called the African American Cultural Center and we would do Malcolm X weekend which would be the end of Black History Month and--
Speaker 2: Is this the Henry Louis Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.]--I mean the Du Bois center [W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research; W.E.B. Du Bois Research Institute]?
Speaker 1: No, this is before the Du Bois center was--but it was, it was kind of--it was--the compromise when Harvard's students had wanted an African American center--like a physical center on campus and there was resistance to that and I think a lawsuit and so this was born of that.  And we didn't have a center but it was kind of like the black student organization.  But, we had this thing called Malcolm X weekend and we used to do a film festival and I remember Spike Lee coming one year to--and he was showing his movie before 'She's Gotta Have It' called 'Joe's Bed Stuy Barbershop:  We Cut Heads.'  But, Spike was there and then Reggie [HistoryMaker Reginald Hudlin] and Warren Hudlin [sic. Warrington Hudlin]. 'House Party' was Reggie's senior thesis.  And so he was show--and the original 'House Party' before the Kid 'n Play [Christopher Reid and Christopher Martin] version.
Speaker 2: It's a little different isn't it?
Speaker 1: It's very different (laughter), very different but so just having access to that at such a--I don't know that we appreciated it then.  But, you know, you appreciate it now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: You did have some sense that it was little bit different then?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was, it was pretty special--I mean there's not much you couldn't do there.
Speaker 2: What was your major at, at Harvard?
Speaker 1: I was a government major.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was a government major so.
Speaker 2: Who were the teachers that you had in government and why--just generally--what teachers impressed you?
Speaker 1: My international relations teacher was Joseph Nye.  My favorite government class when I was there, was political philosophy and it was taught by a man called Harvey Mansfield.  He was just incredible.  Those were probably the two that stuck out the most for me.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Those two?
Story_ID: 633131
Speaker 1: As a government major what were you looking, toward, toward being a city official or?
Speaker 2: No, then I thought I was gonna go to law school.  I thought I'm gonna go to law school.  And what happened was, my freshman year, Pepsi was starting a minority internship program and my roommate from college, her mother--one of her mother's good friends was, was doing HR [human resources] at Pepsi and was in charge of putting together this internship program and so we were all hired as minority interns--like the first minority interns at PepsiCo and that was how I kind of got introduced to the business world and that's kind of what shifted my interest from law to business.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was it about PepsiCo then?
Speaker 2: Well it was just, you know, you're eighteen and you're in this big corporate environment and my first summer I worked at Pepsi international and they were just introducing aspartame into soda 'cause before it had been saccharin, and they were doing it first and--
Speaker 1: That's right, this about 1984 or '83 [1983], '84 [1984]?
Speaker 2: Yeah and they were doing it first in Canada and so they had all these prototype cans of where--and at the time it was owned--aspartame usage was owned by a company called NutraSweet [NutraSweet Company; NutraSweet Property Holdings, Inc.] and so you had to put their logo someplace on the can and so my project the first year was the placement of the NutraSweet logo and I thought that was so cool that I'm gonna get to impact this and then people in Canada anyway were gonna see my, my Diet Pepsi can yeah and I just thought that was so cool, so I sought after that.
Speaker 1: I often wondered who did that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, this had to happen to, to see your own impact on something that's in the mass marketplace.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  After that my interest shifted from law to business, that's kind of what had happened.
Speaker 1: Did you take more business courses?
Speaker 2: Well Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] is liberal arts and so you can kind of major in economics if you want that bent, but it was more difficult to do any kind of pre-professional major at Harvard because it was--they very much wanted you to have this broad liberal arts education so I stayed in--on as a government major but just knew that I wanted to go to business school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did you take some economics courses?
Speaker 2: I had taken economics classes 'cause I started out thinking I might wanna be in ec- so I did have some of like the basics economics classes.
Story_ID: 633132
Speaker 1: So what else happened? Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] is such an exciting place. I don't wanna leave there without having-- talking about, you know, is there any good Harvard stories you could tell about the--?
Speaker 2: After my junior prom story, I'm not telling any more (laughter). No, it was just, it was a great experience, you know, they always say college is the best four years of your life and it really was, made some of the best friends that I still have today.  I pledged at Harvard.
Speaker 1: Yeah what, what?
Speaker 2: Delta.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Pledged Delta.
Speaker 1: Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority].
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's just a great experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't if we should leave this alone or explore it further, I don't know, but you had a good time?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I had a good time.
Speaker 1: Did, did--made good grades I take it?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm, I made good grades, I wasn't--like I have a friend, actually he's a doctor here now who won the Hoopes Prize [Thomas Temple Hoopes Prize] at Harvard, which is the highest economic prize you can win at Harvard, so I wasn't on that level at all.
Speaker 1: But, aca- academics, it, it seems as you described your experiences in school, it seems like the academics are easy for you.
Speaker 2: Yes, and I think at Harvard the difference is, is that to--I think to ex- really be at the top top, you have to make--unless you're and I wouldn't--a genius, which I'm, I'm not.  You'd have to make certain sacrifices on the social side, which I didn't wanna do there and so--but I did well yeah. Graduated (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Harvard's a place where, you know, black people are probably at the bottom of ownership, you know, list in America and Harvard is a place where you meet people who at the top of it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you I mean--was--did you experience some kind of, I guess surprise or economic surp- or culture surprises, some of the lifestyles of the people you were at school with, you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I, I think in college, in a lot of ways, is a great equalizer because the economic differences don't seem as important in college or it didn't--my experience wasn't--so I had friends who, you know, got picked up on private planes and things like that.  But I also had a friend who--I remember doi- we had this thing called intercession [sic. wintersession] because our, our finals were after Christmas, so we would have a break in between first and second semester and they were all going to his parents' house in Vail [Colorado] to ski and I said, "Oh well, I can't afford that."  He was like, "No, we're gonna take our plane and so just come." So and, you know, it was something that I had never experienced before, but I didn't feel ostracized or I didn't feel uncomfortable taking advantage of his--
Speaker 1: Well you come from a middle class family, but not, you know, I'm just saying that the super rich or some of the super rich are there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean they were super rich, but middle class is so different.  Middle class is--you know I always say I didn't--growing up didn't know that there was a difference between being a teacher and being a doctor or being a lawyer and in terms of kind of the economic benefits of that.
Story_ID: 633133
Speaker 1: We were just talking about the range of people you meet at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in terms of the economy and stuff, you know, I don't think there's another school you can meet as many rich people as (laughter)--you know, maybe Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] or something but, you, you didn't (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Maybe Tufts [Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think--I think as a college student you're just not as--at least I wasn't as conscious of the difference and the disparity in wealth, not as conscious as you might be of it today so it was just--these were your friends and some 'em, you know, had summer homes and some 'em traveled differently from you, but it didn't really seem to make that big a difference.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So did you think about the economics--you know--I mean did it, did experience make you think about economy in a different way than you did in high school [Milford Mill High School; Milford Mill Academy, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 1: I think it's--one of the things I said you become more conscious of economic differences.  I don't think it made me think of it in a different way.  I did, did understand for the first time that, that term middle class describes a very broad spectrum of economic situations.  So I think I was--it was most brought--it was brought home to me that, you know, my parents [Addie Cobb Brown and Garland Brown, Sr.] did a remarkable thing, raising four kids, sending them all to school and never making us feel like we wanted for much on teachers' salaries and--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah you were saying just before the break that you didn't realize that when you were growing up the difference between the salary of a teacher and a doctor.
Speaker 1: I didn't have a concept of the fact that my friends whose parents were doctors had an economic situation different from my own because, you know, my parent--we went on vacation every year.  We got cars when we were sixteen.  She--they (laughter) sent us all to school and they did it--I don't know how they did it, but they did it all on teachers' salary, so I didn't have this, this concept of kind of the divide or disparity in middle class.
Story_ID: 633134
Speaker 1: Should be something else about Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] before we get out of here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I don't know--well you said you had pretty good social life.  You were a Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority].
Speaker 2: Yeah, great friends, good social life.  Like I said going--I think if Harvard were for example where Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] is, where if we were dropped in the middle of nowhere, I think it might be a difficult place for African Americans to go to school, but because of the uniqueness of where Harvard is and that experience, you were able to--like some of my closest friends from college went to Tufts [Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts] not Harvard and so I never had the sense of being isolated or--and then also, it was the first time where, when I went to school where I was with other African American students who were more like me, so who didn't tease me for talking white or didn't put me down for being in the high classes or things like that, so it was just a great experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, that, that makes, that makes some sense.  So you're dealing with the top black students probably?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Some of the top ones in the country.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: In a situation like Harvard or even college environment in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, so, so it really was one of my best experiences.
Speaker 1: Now do you maintain relationships with a lot of these people?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, kind of look out for each other across the country?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it's nice--I mean it's a network--yeah that's, that's now really international 'cause we're all over the place and some of the best friends and some of 'em are doing some really interesting things and being able to--you know, I think just like everybody else you lose touch over time and then you can reconnect when, when it makes sense, but it's been good.
Story_ID: 633135
Speaker 1: From the time that you were an intern at PepsiCo, you kind of--you were thinking more about business?
Speaker 2: Right.  I think the Pepsi--'cause we did--I worked there for the next three summers and by the time I graduated I knew I wanted to pursue business versus law.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did you do?  What, what--did you apply to graduate school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I applied to graduate school right away.  I got into Northwestern's full time program [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois] right out of undergrad and (laughter) I remember.
Speaker 1: This was '86 [1986] I guess?
Speaker 2: Eighty, I graduated in '86 [1986] and I was gonna go, just go straight to Northwestern and I remember calling my father [Garland Brown, Sr.] and telling him how excited I was--actually I was gonna go to Columbia [Columbia Business School, New York, New York] 'cause I'd also gotten into Columbia and I wanted to go--be in New York [New York] and my father said, "Well you know we just finished paying for four years of Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  We're not gonna pay for your grad school," which it had never occurred to me up until that moment that my parents wouldn't pay for my grad school and they--a friend of mine had a--one of her best friends were going through a program in Chicago [Illinois] called the First Scholar Program, where you worked at first, the First National Bank of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] during the day and then you went to scho- school at night at either Northwestern or U of C [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and they paid for your school, so she said you should look into this program.  I called First Chicago, got an interview, they flew me out here, was accepted to their program and then I transferred--I called Northwestern and asked to be transferred out of the full time program to the part time program and that's how I ended up in Chicago.
Speaker 1: So you were working for the bank for?
Speaker 2: You worked for the bank, and you go school and then you're--
Speaker 1: Which, which bank is that?
Speaker 2: First National Bank of Chicago.
Speaker 1: First National.  Okay, all right so First Scholar (laughter).
Speaker 2: First Scholar yeah.
Speaker 1: That's appropriate.
Speaker 2: And your schooling is part of your job description, so they are supportive of--and you kind of rotate through different areas of the bank while you're at school--while you're in school and so I did that and that's how I got my M.B.A. and--
Speaker 1: So, what, what did you do at First National?
Speaker 2: I did a lot.  I did--I started out in private banking and then I did equity--well equity analyst, but it was really industry analyst so you--instead of looking at a speci- a specific company, you look at a whole industry so whether it would be telecommunications and this is what's going on at--in issue reports investor reports and.
Speaker 1: That's a big picture report on telecommunications.
Speaker 2: On telecommunications in growth areas and telecommunications and they would--it would be used as product for the bank as its marketing to a) either, companies within that industry or inves- potential investors as a way of saying this is where you should be focused on.  So I did that.  And then I did corporate finance training and then I did corporate finance as a--equivalent of a corporate finance associate and I did public finance, and as a public finance associate and that, ended up being offered a job in public finance to go permanent and that's what I did.  I've being doing that ever since.

Speaker 1: Did you like Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: When I first moved here, no.  I did not like it.
Speaker 1: What is it about, about it you didn't like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It, it, it's very midwestern and so if you've only grown up in the East, it takes some getting used to.  And it was very cold and that took some getting used to.
Speaker 1: Is there a midwestern temperament?
Speaker 2: There's a midwestern temperament.  Midwesterners are way friendlier, but it's a little disarming if you're not used to it so like if you're--I always use the example.  I was walking down the street with my then boyfriend and if you link eye, eye contact with the Chi- midwesterners, they will say hello to you and so you're walking.  I'm like, "Why are all these people keep saying hello to me," (laughter) you know, and it just--it just take some getting used to so.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, yeah, yeah I guess it is like that somewhat.
Speaker 2: Yeah, very small townie.  Very cliquey, so all of that took some time.
Speaker 1: Now, where did you live when you moved to Chicago?
Speaker 2: When I first moved to Chicago I lived in Hyde Park so.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's by the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and that's more of an integrated community, lot of people (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) More integrated, it's still--Chi- Chicago is still somewhat of a very segregated city and so neighborhoods are very reflective of different things and so, still south and still where a lot of African American live so.
Speaker 1: But since it's part of the University of Chicago--
Speaker 2: It is more integrated, so when I first moved here that's where I lived.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So how did you like a--well you had to commute from Hyde Park to--well you worked downtown?
Speaker 2: I was in downtown campus and going downtown.
Speaker 1: So did you go to the downtown campus of Northwestern?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Kellogg School's [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois] or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they have a downtown campus right on Chicago Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --easy.
Story_ID: 633137
Speaker 1: What was--did you have any favorite courses or teachers at Kellogg [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't really--business school was different, it was more just get through it so that was really kind of my attitude all throughout business school so I, I--it was just get it done, get through it and so it didn't have the same impression on me that my undergrad experience did.  It was more drudgery than undergrad [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  It was like I just need this degree, and let's just get it done.
Speaker 1: Now, this is the kind of thing you shouldn't tell me 'cause I, I've always seen business schools, I see this, you know, I--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, you know, I always tell people and if I counsel people now, I say get a different degree, get any degree other than that degree.  Because I have never--I, I just didn't see--I saw the value of how it helps after you obtain it, how it helps you professionally, but I think that a lot of the cognitive thinking and a lot of the problem solving and writing and all that, you could achieve with another degree and just take an accounting class or finance class.
Speaker 1: Really, that's your--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so and then--and one that you might like better so.
Speaker 1: This, this is in description of the M.B.A. program?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what do they really teach you in M.B.A. program that you would need that you could learn, just taking another course you like better?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't kno- I really don't--like I think a lot of the marketing concepts they, they package them as marketing concepts, but they're psych, right? And a lot of--so the only thing I could think of is like accounting or finance you know that's, that you--that are really strictly business, but case analysis, things like that, it's problem solving and, you know, so I think that you could take, you could take another--go for another graduate degree and get some of this--much of the same things that you get out of business school.  The whole group dynamic thing that you get through group because you do a lot of cases that's in groups and things like that.  It's psych but (laughter) so, but that's just me.  A lot of people get a lot out of their M.B.A., I just.
Speaker 1: So what I hear you saying is that getting a M.B.A. is like getting the car keys mainly.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I really believe that.  I think in a lot of ways an M.B.A. is like what an undergraduate degree used to be able to do for professionals I'll say forty years ago. The M.B.A. is and so it's not, it's not a pre-professional degree like med school or law school in that there are certain disciplines that you walk out of having to know in order to function as a doctor or function as a lawyer.  I think the M.B.A. is--teaches you a broader range of things and that you could pick those things up in other places and probably get more out of the degree.
Speaker 1: A couple days ago someone was describing a degree they got as really hazing more than anything else.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did, did you feel that way about?
Speaker 2: No I didn't feel hazed, but I, I felt--again it wasn't the same as my undergraduate experience where I fel- where it felt like drudgery.  It, it wasn't like I was excited to go to school and I felt like this is really gonna teach me on how to be a businessperson.  I never felt that way it was just more something I needed to get through.
Speaker 1: Was the bank work exciting [at First National Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: It was interesting and I liked--I think it's a shame that they don't really do that First Scholar Program anymore because you had six month rotations so you got to see a lot of different areas of finance.  And it was a great way for a first job to learn about the different potential careers that you could have in financial services.
Story_ID: 633138
Speaker 1: Was it before you finished--when, when did you finish your--was it eighty--
Speaker 2: Eighty-nine [1989].
Speaker 1: Eighty-nine [1989] okay.  All right you started working for--I'm sorry, Mesirow Financial [Chicago, Illinois] in--
Speaker 2: Ninety-two [1992] I believe.
Speaker 1: Ninety-two [1992]? Okay.  They had the wrong date, I had it mixed up here.  1992 so you started working for Mesirow 'round '92 [1992].  Now don't, don't let me get ahead of the story so in '89 [1989] what did you do after you finished your--
Speaker 2: So, I was doing First Scholar.  I left the First Scholar Program probably I think in '88 [1988] and I went permanent in public finance at First Chicago [First National Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and was basically a public finance associate.  And worked there for a couple of years and was working on a deal and met a woman, her name is Sid Walters [ph.], who was starting her own consulting company and asked me to join her.  So, I joined her company end of '89 [1989] as a principal.
Speaker 1: What was the name of her company?
Speaker 2: It was called Midwest Management Consultants.  And we did kind of f- financial advisory, business and management consulting.  And I did that for a couple years.  And then an old boss of mine at First Chicago was leaving First Chicago to go to Mesirow to start up their public finance business and he asked me to join them, so I did.  And I went to Mesirow--
Story_ID: 633139
Speaker 1: Tell us something about Mesirow [Mesirow Financial, Chicago, Illinois].  I think James Tyree [James C. Tyree] I was told had something to do--is the founder?
Speaker 2: He's not the founder.  Jim is the current chair and CEO of Mesirow.  It's a financial services company, started out as an insurance company and he really grew it into kind of the form that it is now.  They do asset management, they have a really successful hedge fund and then they also do insurance and sales trading and banking.  And it's a local company, I think now they have about a thousand employees.  When I was there they had about four hundred and fifty so it's growing.  They have offices in various parts of the country and it's privately held.  But, really great local firm.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I was also told to ask you about mezzanine financing. Is that something that Mesirow does or?
Speaker 2: Mesirow does it, Lehman Brothers [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.] where I currently work does it.  And it's financing--in today's market you probably won't see as many mezzanine financing deals done, especially on the real estate side.  But on the real estate side where it's not quite debt, it's not quite equity meaning that the mezzanine lender gets paid probably after the debt is paid.  But, before the equity is paid so you're right there in the middle and you, you get higher.  And it's usually kind of used as either anchor financing meaning someone has a project and they get the mezzanine level in first and that helps them to attract lenders on the debt side or investors on the equity side or it's used as plugged financing meaning they've got the, you know, it's used to fill the gap and for somebody who doesn't necessarily want to be an equity holder who doesn't want to take the risk--the high risk that an equity holder takes and therefore, doesn't get paid the same return.  But, is willing to take a little bit more risk than a traditional debt provider will, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So somewhere in the middle of the two?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are the size of those kind of deals?
Speaker 2: Depends, I mean they can be huge or they can be--and everything relative right so when I'm saying huge they can be in the hundreds of millions or they can be smaller which is like a million dollars of mezzanine financing so.  It just depends on the overall size of the project.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what's the--what are the size of the deals that, I don't know that Mesirow deals with--I mean how big a deal is it?
Speaker 2: Mesirow--again it depends on whether you're talking on asset management side or on the corporate or public finance side.  But, you know, Mesirow will raise and has raised billions of dollars to invest for clients.  And they financed ten million dollar projects.  So it just depends on what, you know, what area of the business you're looking at.
Story_ID: 633140
Speaker 1: You were at Mesirow [Mesirow Financial, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: And then I went to Lehman [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.]?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then you went to Lehman but--okay, so any, any highlights of Mesirow?  Start, starts in '92 [1992] right?
Speaker 2: Right, starts in '92 [1992], you know, it was a great experience like I said we really were--went in and built that business for the firm.  By the time I left I ran public finance which was a big milestone for me to--
Speaker 1: So, so your title was in?
Speaker 2: It was managing director head of public finance.  So that was big milestone for me.  The other highlight was kind of--probably the ongoing relationship that I still have with Jim [James C. Tyree].  He's a friend and a mentor and has been a great resource, you know, going forward.  And I got to work with some great people and meet some great people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you consider yourself lucky you found a mentor?
Speaker 2: Yeah I've always been lucky, I've always had really good mentors.  And been able to keep and maintain those relationships and they've been helpful to me as I move on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay so, so how long were you at, at Mesirow?
Speaker 2: I think from '92 [1992] from '92 [1992] to--no 'cause it wasn't five years.  So from '94 [1994] I think to '99 [1999] I was at Mesirow.
Speaker 1: Ninety-four [1994] to '99 [1999]
Speaker 2: No, that's not right.  It's on the sheet, the sheet I gave you.  I get the dates all mixed up, so.  It's on the third sheet I gave you.  But, I had a sheet that had employment on it.  I--but, I was here for a little over five years, so.
Speaker 1: Now, you were involved in public finance in two places what--
Speaker 2: Three places actually.
Speaker 1: Three?  Okay.
Speaker 2: First Chicago [First National Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], Mesirow and Lehman Brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What does a director of public finance do?
Speaker 2: We help public sector borrowers.  So cities, states, colleges, universities, public hospitals access the capital markets.  So we will put together transactions for them to help them borrow money for projects.  And then we will place those bonds--'cause they usually issue bonds with investors.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: That's what I do.
Speaker 1: I have to ask because (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's what I do.
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm an economics dunce myself.  I'm not proud of it, but I am.
Story_ID: 633141
Speaker 1: How did you come to leave Mesirow [Mesirow Financial, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I was recruited by Lehman Brothers [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.] away from Mesirow and I was intrigued by working for a major Wall Street firm and what that platform would be like.  I had never done it before, so they recruited me and I accepted the job.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they just saw you around and said--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's, you know, you work on deals and you meet people from other firms with those deals and they were looking to enhance their Chicago [Illinois] office, so.
Speaker 1: They offered you a whole lot more money?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah, they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You're so honest with me.
Speaker 2: I know (laughter).
Speaker 1: So that's okay--so did, did you basically do the same thing at Lehman Brothers?
Speaker 2: It was a little bit different.  It's a different platform so, you know, you covered different cities.  You can sell different products that they didn't have at Mesirow.  But, pretty much the same thing.  Same basic client base. I wasn't running--I didn't run or do not run Lehman's public finance department so I have fewer people reporting to me which I like actually (laughter), so.
Speaker 1: Well, can you describe for us a couple of the deals I guess?
Speaker 2: Sure, the--right now for example the City of Chicago [Illinois] is working on a major expansion project out at O'Hare [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois] and a portion of that project is finance with bonds.  We sold a little under a billion of those structure and sold a little under a billion of those bonds in January of this year.  And that was deal that I worked on.  District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] is working on doing some infrastructure projects through securitizing their income--personal income tax.  That--we're working on that deal right now.  We have sold bonds for State of Illinois, for park district [Chicago Park District], for Northwestern Hospital [Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago, Illinois] and those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: What are some of the--I guess nuances of doing this?  I mean I, I don't know it, so I have to kind of try to get a little deeper.
Speaker 2: I think it's always the pow- the, the difference--it's a different dynamic of--political dynamic that you deal with, with public sector clients.  There's a different level of scrutiny that you receive because of the public nature of the work that you're doing.  And most cities and states are very resource constrained.  So, there's never enough money to do the projects and pay for all of the projects that need to be done.  And so those are the challenges that you help your clients work through.  It's also incredibly competitive business and right now today it's been challenging because a lot of the players in the business are being impacted by the larger mortgage crises that's going on and so that has impacted our business as well.
Speaker 1: So, they don't have the money to spend?
Speaker 2: Well, don't have money--it's harder to--you don't have as much investor interest because investors are skittish so even if they have deals that they'd like to see get done they are--the client, the city or the state, they're being done at a more expensive rate, higher rate.  Because there's less investor interest because there's less money flowing through the market right now.  People are pulling their money out and putting it in other things.  And so there's less potential investors out there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now have you--I mean what's your position at Lehman Brothers now?
Speaker 2: I'm managing director and I head our central region so, I'm in charge of public finance business municipal finance business in the central part of the country.
Story_ID: 633142
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you something about the culture of the workplace. Like you started off at First Chicago [First National Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], then Mesirow [Mesirow Financial, Chicago, Illinois], then Lehman Brothers [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.].  Black woman, well educated come in, you know, you're obviously prepared to do the work and how--what was the culture when you arrived?
Speaker 2: I think it's changed over times, over time and it's changed as I've changed when I first started at First Chicago--because I was in the specialized trainee program, you're insulated from a lot I think of certain prejudices that I think you might face as a woman or as a person of color because there--it's a tracked program and anybody who's in that track program is going to get the same kind of level of opportunity and, and the same exposure.  So, it felt like an extension of college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], my first job at First Chicago. I think at Mesirow first and then at Lehman you are a lot more cognizant of the fact that you're a woman, that you are a person of color, and how that's impacting what you do and, you know, the deal teams you work on and, and what you're exposed to and kind of meetings you're invited to, things like that.
Speaker 1: Now, how many for instance well, how big a min- how small of a minority are you at Lehman Brothers?
Speaker 2: Among--I'll say it this way at Lehman the highest level that you can achieve, the highest title you can achieve is managing director.  I was the second African American woman to ever be named managing director and Lehman has about twenty-six thousand employees.  There're now three managing--African American female managing directors in the entire firm.
Speaker 1: How many managing directors, do you have any idea?
Speaker 2: About 12 percent of that num--of twenty-six thousand are managing directors so about three thousand.
Speaker 1: So you're less than a percent of?
Speaker 2: Right.  So, puts it in perspective (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, and is it getting--so in terms of being able to function in a business environment, being a severe minority, you know, I mean how do you, how do you cope with--I mean you have to--what do you have to be able to do to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think--I'm personally lucky that I have a business--I have a specialized business that I've been doing for some time now.  I have a reputation as a professional in that business that kind of transcends or supersedes whatever firm I'm working at.  So it makes it a lot easier to maneuver through kind of what I need to do from a day to day basis.  I think it still becomes a challenge if in trying to get greater responsibility or move within the firm and deal with the firm politics because the internal supports aren't always there for people of color.
Story_ID: 633143
Speaker 1: Was there, was there ever a time that you felt that it was like glass ceiling you weren't gonna be able to crack?
Speaker 2: I think I'm a little challenged because I'm in a regional office since I'm not at headquarters and so opportunity is gonna be kind of geographically constrained as well.  But, I think that it is still--investment banking in general and Lehman Brother [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.]--when we were talking about Lehman or other firms it still has yet to figure out how to attract and retain more talented minorities and I think that a lot of times the politics and the--and the challenges of maneuvering as a minority within these firms 'causes a lot of the talent to go to smaller platforms or start--or more entrepreneurial platforms.  Because they can be equally lucrative without a lot of the crap (laughter).
Speaker 1: And what is some of the crap?
Speaker 2: What is some of the crap?  I mean some of it is, you know, just the mundane crap of, you know, someone walking into your office and assuming because you are a woman and of color that you are the assistant and could you please go get them coffee.  I mean that's the--and the other is always the assumption that you are there to speak on all issues black and pulling--and people see you first as a person of color and then as a woman and then as the professional expert, so.
Speaker 1: So, they have to peel apart those layers before you get to what you're actually there to do?
Speaker 2: Exactly, so.
Speaker 1: That wouldn't be true for a white male in that position?
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You don't have to speak for all white men. They wouldn't ask you to go get the coffee.
Speaker 2: They wouldn't ask him to go get the coffee. They wouldn't ask him--they wouldn't make certain assumptions about his ability to do things, so.
Speaker 1: Have you been on, have you ever wondered how some of the white men you met got in those positions? I mean in terms--have you ever seen people that really weren't qualified to do what their actually hired to do or?
Speaker 2: Have I met people who--where I knew somebody who was more qualified to do the job they have?  Yes.  I have I met people that shouldn't--that aren't qualified to do their job not, not really--I mean most of the people--most of the people that I've encountered are qualified to do it but are they the best?  No, not necessarily.  But, most of the people I've met are--been qualified.
Story_ID: 633144
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So is it--at this stage of history would you say that minorities and black women in specific have a--still have a harder route towards success in finance?
Speaker 2: I think it's still hard.  I think--I don't think I had it probably as hard as my mother [Addie Cobb Brown] had it.  And you just look at kind of the profession that my mother chose.  I don't think it would ever--had it occurred to her that she could go work on Wall Street.  I think it's still difficult because there are still so few of us who function and can function as role models that a lot of times we're still viewed as the exception as opposed to the rule.  And because regardless of your color or your sex your--the challenges of investment banking are still the challenges of investment banking and so you as a person who could be a potential role model don't necessarily have the time or the energy to mentor others in a way that would give them the kind of access that they need.  And that can be frustrating.
Speaker 1: Do you try to do that on some level?
Speaker 2: On some level you try to do it.  But, I think I recognize that I probably don't do it as well as I should.
Speaker 1: Now I've heard stories and I've even been in situations myself where black pe- people are in majority white situations and they see another black person across a room (laughter) at a conference or a training or something, you know, and every--but, they're both--both of the people are afraid to go talk to each other for--
Speaker 2: Yeah I, I've never been like that, no.  I've never been like that. I would probably make a beeline to the person, so I've not encountered that I don't know if somebody has seen me and looked the other way or something but.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you're saying there is a--
Speaker 2: I think in--
Speaker 1: --culture of--
Speaker 2: There's a culture of support and--that I think is really nice and refreshing.  I just don't feel like--that because we still have to compete with our majority counterparts and we still want to do well and we still have to perform that as professionals once you do all that, the time that you have to nurture and develop others that you have to seek out and find it becomes challenging if they work on your team and you--it's easier but, in a firm like my firm where there's so few of us anyway, chances of them actually working directly with me on a day to day basis are smaller.  And so it just makes it--it just means that I can't be as effective as I might like in helping them develop their careers and their professional networks and things like that.
Story_ID: 633145
Speaker 1: In terms of finance where do you--right now--where do you go next or where would you like to be next?
Speaker 2: I'm tired (laughter). No, seriously I don't--I think from a--from this job standpoint it's just to continue to develop my clients and develop the business and get greater market share.  But, I--there isn't like another promotion that I'm looking for or that would make sense within Lehman [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.], so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now can you tell us a story about what your greatest triumph has been at Lehman?
Speaker 2: My greatest triumph?
Speaker 1: Or, or in your professional life, you know, what's the biggest moment you think you've had or one of the biggest moments?
Speaker 2: I think being named--because it is a pretty big deal within investment banking to be named a managing director was a pretty big deal for me.  That promotion.
Speaker 1: Did you expect it?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you think you deserved it? At the time said, "Wow, why don't they promote me?"
Speaker 2: Yes, I expected it. I thought I deserved it.  But, it was a pretty big deal just 'cause there aren't a whole lot and there're not--in general there're not a lot and then--certainly not a lot of women and certainly not a lot black women, so it was a pretty big deal for me.  I think being able to consistently compete and get business as always been something that I'm proud of 'cause it's very competitive and to be able to lead deal teams that pursue and then get the business is something that I've always been proud of.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a collegial relationship between the black people involved in finances like say Jonathan Rogers [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, very much so.  Very supportive, friend, you know, I'd say we're friendly competitors but, especially someone like John, he's just always so helpful, always provides access, counsel, just--I mean he's probably the standard of how we all need to be, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there any kind of a formal association of--
Speaker 2: There's a, a organization called the National Association of Securities Professionals, which is a national organization but of people of color who work in the securities industry, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, that's good to know I didn't know that before.
Story_ID: 633146
Speaker 1: How did you get involved with--are we ready to go to CTA, you think?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You sure now?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (Unclear). But, okay so how did you get involved with CTA?
Speaker 2: The mayor [Richard M. Daley] appointed me chair.  It was that simple.  He--the mayor appoints the chairman of Chicago Transit Authority and four out of the seven board members including the chair and I had gotten to know the mayor over the years and members of his staff and working on various projects over the years and-
Speaker 1: Such as O'Hare [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, well more on the civic side.
Speaker 1: Civics?
Speaker 2: I did a program called Leadership Greater Chicago and in--as one of the outcomes of that program-
Speaker 1: Yeah we should probably spend some time on that.  Now, now what is Leadership?
Speaker 2: Leadership Greater Chicago is a yearlong fellowship program where they bring together people from diverse backgrounds public and private sector to take a yearlong look at issues impacting the city and the surrounding areas so Chicago [Illinois] metro land really.  So--and the thought is that, that--or the hope really is that these are future leaders of this city--civic leaders of the city and once they have a better understanding of issues and challenges can become more engaged in that.  And--in those particular issues and challenges and so I did that for a year and one of the outcomes--the mayor spoke at one of--a breakfast or something and wanted to know what tangible outcomes come from Leadership Greater Chicago and none really do, meaning you don't--at the end of the year, you're not suddenly addressing--have deliverables and education or anything. It's just really to talk about issues.  And he wanted to start a group that was given a task and came up with recommendations and then started implementing, executing on those recommendations for any problem in the city.  And so I became a part of that group and the task we were given for that year was early childhood education and what kind of what are the problems, what kind of tangible solutions can we recommend that the city implement to help improve early childhood education in the city--help to better prepare parents who aren't aware of what their--how--where their children should be when they enter kindergarten, things like that.  And in doing that I got to know a lot of people who worked in the city and got to know the mayor better and when [HistoryMaker] Valerie Jarrett, my predecessor, resigned from the board he was looking for someone to take her place and he tapped me to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it just--did you expect--
Speaker 2: No, it was a complete shock and surprise (laughter), so.  Complete and shock and--
Speaker 1: You, you received a phone call?
Speaker 2: Yeah, literally received a phone call that the mayor was interviewing candidates to take Valerie's place would I--one, would I be interested in interviewing for the job and two, would the--would my firm, Lehman Brothers [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.], allow me to do it.  And once I determined that Lehman would allow me to do it and I said, yes I'd be interested, and literally a week later I was named--less than a week actually I was named chair of the CTA.
Story_ID: 633147
Speaker 1: Chair of the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] gets, gets paid.  But, it's not like a job or anything?
Speaker 2: No, it's a part time job. I think compensation is like twenty-five thousand dollars a year.  So it's more like an honorarium.  But--
Speaker 1: To some.
Speaker 2: To some.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) We live in a diverse--
Speaker 2: To some that's true.
Speaker 1: So, yes.  And--so it requires how, how much of your time does it require?
Speaker 2: I always make a joke when people ask me that question that it's a good thing my full time boss is in New York [New York] so he has no clue.  But, it, you know, it can be time consuming.  When we were in the throes of our funding issue, it was like having another full time job so, you know, I was spending a good thirty hours a week on CTA.  The minimum that is required is we have monthly board meetings but, it can be very time--depending on what's going on with us, it can be quite time consuming.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what does a chair of CTA do? What do are you responsible for?
Speaker 2: I'm responsible for chairing the board and the board is responsible for setting the policy of the organization and the strategic direction of the organization and so--and then we approve, you know contracts, budget, provide operating oversight to the president and staff, and the president reports to the--and we also appoint the president and the president really is charged with the day to day running of the organization and the board is to provide the oversight for the agency.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you spend a lot of time trying to find financing for the CTA or?
Speaker 2: I have been working--because that's my strength.  I do probably delve a lot into the numbers and the funding and those issues with CTA.  We are funded--roughly 50 percent of our budget comes from our fare box revenue and the other 50 percent comes from government subsidy.  Government subsidy's never really been adequate and then 100 percent really right now of our capital dollars come from either the federal government or the state and local government.  And, and the state hasn't passed a new capital bill in nine years and had no new capital funding for five and so CTA really is in a very challenging position right now because we've just not had adequate capital funding to make the infrastructure investment that we should be making in our system.
Speaker 1: So as a, as result can we--I mean are--
Speaker 2: It's safe. The system is safe.  And we obviously wouldn't put any of our riders at risk.  But, if you look at the system it's one of the oldest in the country.  Second largest in the country and we need to be really making--given everything that--else that's going on in the world right now with the rise in fuel cost and our ridership is exploding and we really should be making a greater capital investment so that we can put more people on public transportation and get them out of the cars and off the roads.
Speaker 1: So public transportation in Chicago [Illinois] gets a lot of use but it's not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not nearly what it should. I mean we carry--we, CTA, carry about 1.8 million people a day, and the system itself carries about 2.1 million so if you add Metra and Pace there're about--we're about 1.8. They're combined about 350, 400 pe- thousand people a day.  If you compare that to New York.  New York carries about 7 million people a day. A little less than 7 million people a day.  Now that's a bigger region, but still on a per capita basis, we just don't have the same penetration that a system like New York has in terms of people choosing public transportation versus choosing to drive.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  What are some of the, the--with fuel costs going up and a lot of discussion around the country about how to better transport people around, rather than cars, you know improving car but also, that's why I'm talking about public transportation again.  I think--is the city rethinking public transportation what it needs to be about?
Speaker 2: I think one of the things that people need to understand is we're funded by the state, not the city.  So our funding comes from the State of Illinois, not the City of Chicago.  And I think if it--if were ci--
Speaker 1: But you're appointed by the mayor?
Speaker 2: I'm appointed by the mayor, but then there are three--
Speaker 1: Funding comes from the city--
Speaker 2: But, there are three people on our board who are appointed by the governor and then there's a Regional Transportation Authority that pro- provides the budget and really expanded oversights since the passing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So RTA.
Speaker 2: RTA.
Speaker 1: Regional Transit Authority
Speaker 2: And that is a state agency (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Provides the funding for CTA, the Chicago Transit Authority?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And, and that's created by state legislator and the oversight is, is provided by RTA.  They appro- have to approve all of budgets for us, Metra and Pace and that's a total state agency and so that has its own set of challenges.
Story_ID: 633148
Speaker 1: How would you access, I guess, how the black community is being served by CTA [Chicago Transit Authority]?
Speaker 2: I think from a service delivery standpoint, I think the goal of--well I know the goal of CTA is to make sure that we provide access, connections throughout the city and are especially sensitive to their--those areas of the city where there is no transportation alternative.  So I hope that they would say that they're being served well. That, that they've seen the service improvements, and that we continue to not strand anybody, very sensitive to not stranding anybody as we get resource constrained.  From a business standpoint, we try to provide opportunity to minority owned firms to do bu- business with CTA and again are very sensitive to providing those kind of opportunities and where we fall short.  We hope one that the community lets us know we're falling short, but we remain committed to doing that.  From an employment standpoint, our workforce is largely African American and where--the minority group where we need to increase our numbers is on the Hispanic side.  We don't have the appropriate Hispanic representation among our workforce reflective of our riders and we're trying to address that.
Speaker 1: You know, what you say rings true there.  That, that is true.  I never thought about that before, but probably in the City of Chicago [Illinois], the one public--I mean occupation you can have--I mean that--you, you see more blacks representing the CTA than say--
Speaker 2: Actually our union--
Speaker 1: Proportionally than you do with the police department [Chicago Police Department], fire department [Chicago Fire Department] or--
Speaker 2: Our union--our largest union is also the largest African American union in the country, 241 [Amalgamated Transit Union Local 241] and--so we do have representation on the employment side from African Americans that I think people would say is fair and reasonable and reflective of our riders.
Speaker 1: Yeah, significant too--I don't think a lot of people think about it like that, you know.  We talk about how we, we don't have the numbers in--the other sectors I mentioned.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But CTA probably, amongst teachers probably was highly--was well represented.  So, what, now you go to neighborhood meetings right?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: Like public meetings.  What, what are the primary concerns?
Speaker 2: You know, service right.  You know, we always get earfuls on service and as the as--people struggle with the economy, they are concerned about fares going up, but primarily its service.  Last year we were--had to talk about because we weren't sure about our funding situation, we had to talk about potentially cutting service, and what a lot of people don't realize is that when we cut service it was kind of thing I was talking about before where there's no public transportation alternative to CTA.  When we cut service, it's like we cut off people's access to their job, to education, to their healthcare.  And a lot of times people tend to look at CTA in a vacuum and not give it the respect it should get as a vital part of the infrastructure at--of the city and, and something that really connects people to jobs, to education and is critical for the economic viability of the region.  I don't always think we get our due where that's concerned.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I don't--I read somewhere that the rates were hiked in the last year for the handicapped shuttles I guess.
Speaker 2: Well for Paratransit.
Speaker 1: For Paratransit yeah.
Speaker 2: We don't, we no longer are the provider of Paratransit, it was taken over about three years ago by RTA [Regional Transportation Authority] and then RTA contracted with Pace and so Pace does all of the Paratransit for the ci- the northeast Illinois region now.
Story_ID: 633149
Speaker 1: Oh, I wanted to ask you about a situation where--as you alluded to before, you offered to ask a major corporation to speak for all black women and all black people, and that sort of thing.  And that leads me to a little--a bit of a controversy in the news over the reparations committee and city council [Chicago City Council], Alderman Tillman [HistoryMaker Dorothy Tillman] set up a commission to research reparations for corporations and in the city who had actually profited from the slave trade back in the 19th century and Lehman Brothers [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.] is named as one of the corporation that did--so, so what, what happened?  How did you get drug into this?
Speaker 2: Well it was interesting.  What happened was probably a full two or three years before I was ever named CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] chair.  The city had started--anyone who did business with the city had to fill out an economic di- disclosure form and included on that form was a question asking whether or not your firm to its knowledge had ever participated or profited from business born out of the slave trade and Lehman Brothers had always answered that question in the affirmative and it was never an issue and then I was named--
Speaker 1: So, so they, they actually would answer yes?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They did.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was then named CTA chair and a lot of the local press didn't know much about me and started doing some digging and one of the reporters for the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times] uncovered that Lehman Brothers was the first firm to ever answer that question in the affirmative and in doing--and she actually wrote a story to that effect and it kind of let off somewhat of a firestorm of attention.  And one of the aldermanic sponsors of that legislation in, in the city wanted more information, raised more issue about just the specifics of what Lehman knew and didn't because I was at the time the face of Lehman in Chicago [Illinois], I kind of was the face of that issue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because of you being CTA chair--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right
Speaker 1: That put you up front so.  So what did you say about it and what was the reaction?
Speaker 2: It was interesting I (laughter) tried to say as little as possible (laughter) about it and I thought that Lehman did a good job and was very forthcoming in what information it had at the time in its archives.
Story_ID: 633150
Speaker 1: What did Lehman [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.] know?
Speaker 2: At the time because they had not done extensive researches that they had in papers of some of the original Lehman Brothers.  In one of the original Lehman Brothers they had one bill of sale for one slave and that's what they disclosed, but the history of Lehman is that it said it started as cotton traders in Birmingham, Alabama in the 1800s and so the notion that there had to have been certain participation or, or activity also around the slave trade, I think it was always acknowledged.  What happened was that other firms started delving more into their history at the request of the city and filling out this disclosure and actually hired researchers and historians to assist them in that Lehman Brothers ultimately did the same thing and has put together and pulled together for this economic disclosure more extensive information related to kind of activities during that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think what some of this research has disclosed, lots of corporations were involved or that the older ones were involved in the--some way or another with profiting from slave trade in 19th century.  Stuff we've heard, you know, black historians have said for a long time.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So you were seen--I think from what I've read as defending the--Alderman Tillman [HistoryMaker Dorothy Tillman] saw you as defending Lehman Brothers (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I made a--I--what angered--what I think angered the alderman--you have to speak to the alderman was, the reporter asked me if--something if I was embarrassed to work for Lehman because this information had come out and I said well, I would just have to answer that question by saying Lehman isn't the same firm that it was back then. If it were I obviously wouldn't be a managing director there, and for whatever reason I think the alderman took some--offense to this and felt like I was trying to defend Lehman's activities during that time, which I was not.  I was just saying it was--clearly had a different view of people of color today than it did in the 1800s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, did it die (unclear)?
Speaker 2: You know, everything, you know, in the press dies down eventually and I think, I think that what, what--my understanding of what the alderman was trying to do, which was to enhance and bring together a lot more data and to use these firms to assist her in doing that I think.  And that since--that she was successful in doing that because it did require Lehman and other firms to do a level--a deeper level of research to make sure that they were disclosing as much information as they had access to and I think in doing that it was successful for what she was trying to achieve.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Di- do you yourself have any thoughts about reparations?
Speaker 2: None that I'm gonna share (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: None that I'm gonna share.  I, you know, I think that, and now I'm gonna go share 'em.  I think that what I will say about reparations is there are a bunch of--I'll say groups in this country that have been compensated for--whether you wanna call them crimes or that have been perpetrated against those groups by this country historically and why and how slavery is viewed is different from--whether you're talking about internment during World War II [WWII] or if you're talking about other things--why it's so different.  I've never understood.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, I guess it would be safe to say that if others can be repaired for damages historically against various peoples, groups of people then black people should be seen in the same way?
Speaker 2: I think that part of the challenge that people of color have always felt is that there's a different set of rules for us than others in this country.  And I just would think that at some point the rules should be consistently applied.
Story_ID: 633151
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I think that the biggest challenge for our community is how woefully unprepared we are for the next century.  I, I feel like our schools are inadequate and they're allowed to remain inadequate and therefore, we turn out people who are not prepared to compete on--to complete, compete globally.  I feel that economic opportunity is still applied to a very small or offered to a very small percentage of this country and I think that we are still a people that can be appeased and comforted by symbols as opposed to--by actual action and I--and that scares me 'cause we have allowed ourselves to accept a lot based on a symbol versus based on real, real concrete change.
Speaker 1: Are you excited about the presidential campaign?
Speaker 2: I am very excited about the presidential campaign.  I think that--I think he's smart, I think he's talented, and I think that he is exactly what this country needs now, he being Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] (laughter).  If anybody was confused, yes, yes.  And I think the historical nature of it--even if you put that aside that there's so much about who he is that--and the ideas that he has that I think is exactly what we need to pull this country out of the economic morass that it--we're in.
Story_ID: 633152
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything that you've done at this point, what today would you--well is there any ma- major thing you--that you would do different first of all?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, you know, I, I should have, would have, could have, right?  So, no there's nothing major that I would've done differently.  I think that everything happens for a reason and I think every experience makes you the person that you are so, no.
Speaker 1: What today would you consider to be your legacy?  I know you probably haven't thought about that much, but--
Speaker 2: I don't think I have one yet.  I, I, I feel like I've been really, really, lucky in my life and, and so, I don't--it's gonna sound weird, I don't really feel like I've done anything worthy of legacy yet.  So if had to write a legacy today would be hopefully good daughter, good sister, good friend, yeah, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do your parents [Addie Cobb Brown and Garland Brown, Sr.] feel, feel about, about you and--
Speaker 2: I think they're proud of me.  I think they're proud of all their kids, I think they should be proud of themselves given from where they came and the fact that they have four children who are making their way and, and you know, doing okay, so I think they're proud of that.
Story_ID: 633153
Speaker 1: So do you think it's--for those who--young pe- people who are watching this or even old people who want to get involved in finance or business in that segment of society and the economy we definitely need what, what advice would you give 'em?
Speaker 2: I would say school is still important.  And networking, making those contacts, reaching out to people who are there already.  That's probably the best way to break into this business.  But, it's still one where, you know, really young people continue to do well in school.  Understand that economically lucrative careers are not just in entertainment and sports, that you can be successful in the business or finance arena as well.  But, in order to do that you gotta get good grades.  You gotta go to college and work hard, apply yourself and know how to write and communicate, that's the most important thing.
Speaker 1: That's, that's has that--how essential has that been?
Speaker 2: I think it's very essential because if you can't get your ideas across through written and speaking, then the impression you make is not a good one.  And doing business is a large part about the, the impression you make until people are comfortable doing business with you.  Understand what you want to do and how you're gonna get it done.  And so it's very, very important.
Speaker 1: So, so communication skills, writing skills is not just important in terms of liberal arts pursuits but in business (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not--it's very important in business, very important.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 633154
Speaker 1: Tell me about your volunteer life.  You have, you're a number--your, you're a member of a number of organizations (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, member of number organizations--I had to scale 'em back a little bit because of CTA [Chicago Transit Authority].  But, I work with the, the UCAN organization [Chicago, Illinois], which is a social service organization for at risk teens.  Helps train, educate, gives them places to stay.  Very good organization. I work with children more--Children's Museum [Chicago Children's Museum, Chicago, Illinois]. I'm on that board.  The Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence which is has become even more important given the resent Su- [U.S.] Supreme Court ruling and that really is to promote responsible gun ownership and responsible gun ownership legislation.  So it's not--the concept is not to take away people's right to bear arms but, it's to manage the responsible ownership of guns, so that people who shouldn't own--have guns in their possessions don't have them.  And to make sure we know and limit the expanse of guns in this country.  What else?  I know there are more (laughter) but, those are my biggies.
Story_ID: 633155
Speaker 1: We always ask people about their family-now you don't have any children now, right?
Speaker 2: I have no children, I have a dog.
Speaker 1: You have a dog?  Okay.  Yeah well you're single?
Speaker 2: Single, no kids.
Speaker 1: No, kids okay.  Now who, who do you consider your family in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I have great friends.  Most of my, my immediate family--my siblings [Venel Brown, Garland Brown, Jr. and Howard Brown] and my parents [Addie Cobb Brown and Garland Brown, Sr.] don't live in Chicago, so really the network of friends that I've made over the years they're my family here, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your parents are still alive?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my parents are still living.  They live in Baltimore [Maryland]. I'm very lucky, very blessed that I still have two healthy, vibrant parents that come and visit.  And I go see them and--
Speaker 1: Is there anything that I should ask you before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Man, no you (laugher) you've run the gambit. I don't--I can't think of anything?
Speaker 1: We'll have to come back in forty years I'll ask you some more questions. But--
Story_ID: 633156
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Ma'am how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think the same: good daughter, good sister, good friend and also, you know, that I tried to do what I could to leave this place better than I found it, that I took on responsibilities and did the best that I could to help people.
