Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Deborah A. Batts, D-E-B-O-R-A-H, middle initial A, last name Batts, B, as in boy, A-T, T as in Tom, S as in Sam.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us your date of birth and the location of your birth?
Speaker 2: I was born April 13th, 1947 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: And today's date is August 15th--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Two thousand and seven [2007].  And what is the location of this interview and the address?
Speaker 2: We are in the United States courthouse for the Southern District of New York [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York].  It's at 500 Pearl Street.  We're in my chambers, Room 2510, New York, New York.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a federal district court judge for the Southern District of New York.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Story_ID: 467844
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask you five People magazine-ish type, type questions.  You just answer with whatever comes to mind.  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Probably, probably sushi.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Disney World [Walt Disney World Resort, Orlando, Florida].
Speaker 1: What's your favorite phrase or saying, if you have one?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure that I do.  I don't think that there's anything that I say an awful lot.  I know that with my children [Alexandra McCown and James McCown] I would sort of follow what they would say and, you know, "Awesome," or, or something like that.  And, of course, they move on and I don't, which is a problem.  And my son has some expressions that at least I had the sense to ask him what they meant before I adopted them.  But I don't, I think I'm, I'm not original in that way.  That's one of the advantages of having children.
Story_ID: 467845
Speaker 1: We'd like to start by talking about your family.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: And we'd like to start with your mother.  If you could tell me her name and spell it.  I'm gonna ask you throughout, if possible, to spell people's names.
Speaker 2: Fine.  No problem.
Speaker 1: So if you can tell me your, your mother's name and where she was born?
Speaker 2: All right.  My mother's name is Ruth Violet Batts [Ruth Silas Batts]. Her maiden was Silas, R-U-T-H, Violet, V-I-O-L-E-T, maiden name Silas, S-I-L-A-S, married name Batts, B-A-T-T-S. She was born in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: And did she grow up in New York?
Speaker 2: She grew up in New York.
Speaker 1: And did she tell you anything about her childhood?  Did she ever share any stories with you or are you aware just about perhaps some anecdotes about when she was raised?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I don't know any anecdotes per se of, of, her--well there is one or two, but they were mostly later as, as a sort of teenager, she was a member of a social club called Noiserelles [ph.], I believe, and please don't ask me to spell that.  And she had good friends in that organization that actually maintained throughout her adult life even though she left New York, and, and went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  She was an only child.  And I think that most of the stories that are, I know about my mom aside from the Noiserelles would involve when she met my dad [James A. Batts].
Speaker 1: What was the Noiserelles?
Speaker 2: It was, I think sort of like a, a club that of, of I believe it was young ladies who had a, a sponsor and I believe his name was Buddy [ph.], his first name was Buddy I don't know what his last name was, but they'd put on shows.  They, they had dances.  They enjoyed life in a very appropriate and civilized way.
Speaker 1: And what do you know about your mother's parents?  Did you meet them?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was fortunate, I met both of my mother's parents.  We called my mother's mother, Nana [Louise Petgrave Silas] and we called her father Pop [Alfred Silas].  So it was Nana and Pop.
Story_ID: 467846
Speaker 1: So let's talk about Nana first.  What was Nana's name and where was she from?
Speaker 2: Nana's name, Louise Peta- L-O-U-I-S-E, Petgrave, P-E-T-G-R-A-V-E, Silas, married name, S-I-L-A-S [Louise Petgrave Silas].  She was born in Kingston, Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Did she tell you anything about her childhood or her teen years just about before--
Speaker 2: Not really.  And the part of the problem was, is that we lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and Nana and Pop lived in New York [New York].  So that we didn't see them as such as we would like and it was always around some event.  So we, we, you know, we would come over for Thanksgiving and we would come over for, for something like that.  I know that when we were babies she, and I keep saying we because I have an identical twin sister [Diane Batts Morrow], but I know that when we were babies she came over and visited in Philadelphia.  But I, I don't--we didn't have an opportunity to spend time with our grandparents when our parents [Ruth Silas Batts and James A. Batts] were not there.  Now whether or not had we had that opportunity we would have heard things, I don't know.  I know that my, (laughter) my grandmother taught us the song, 'On Moonlight Bay' ['Moonlight Bay'].  And we loved to sing it, and she would sing it and we would sing it.  We were like three, four, five, something like that.  And it's amazing because I actually to this day, remember quite a few of the words.  And it was nothing that had anything to do with anything other than my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Next I'm gonna ask you about your grandfather.  But first I was wondering where in New York did your grandparents live?
Speaker 2: My, the, the place that we went to visit that we remember the most was 289 Convent Avenue.  And I know that they, my mother, they lived on St. Nicholas [Avenue] as well.  And I, excuse me, I don't remember other addresses but 289 Convent Avenue was the last place that my grandparents lived and was the only place that we knew.  That was the last place they lived.
Speaker 1: Now your grandfather, can you, do you, you said you met him.  But what, what was he doing and what was he like, did you know any stories about his raising and where was he from?
Speaker 2: All right.  Pop was, his name is Alfred,    A-L-F-R-E-D, Charles, C-H-A-R-L-E-S, Silas, S-I-L-A-S [Alfred Silas].  I believe that his family may have come from Guatemala but I think he was born and raised in New Orleans [Louisiana].  We, when we met him obviously, he, he was older and he actually had been in World War I [WWI] and he had an old German helmet with a spike.  And I, I distinctly remember seeing him wear that in a picture.  He worked for the postal service [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].  And he was a lot of fun, but in a quiet way.  I mean, I think that I have more vivid memories of my grandmother.  I think that my grandfather let her share the, not share the stage but be the stage.
Speaker 1: Did your grandmother work?
Speaker 2: She did and I am embarrassed to say I don't know what she did.  I don't know what position, I'm, I know I've been told but I don't remember.  My mother will be very angry with me but I don't remember (laughter).
Story_ID: 467847
Speaker 1: You said about your mother [Ruth Silas Batts] that the other stories that you knew about her had to do with her meeting your father [James A. Batts]?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: What, where did she meet your father?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother left New York [New York] and went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to go to Mercy-Douglass Hospital in Philadelphia School of Nursing [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And my dad was an intern at that hospital.  And so she met him in, in that capacity.  I think that he taught some of the classes that they took.  And, you know, he--she always described him as being very, you know, sort of earnest and very businesslike, almost taciturn but not quite.  But, but all of the nurses thought he was incredibly, you know, good looking and dashing.  And I have seen pictures of, of my dad in his intern coat and I have to agree he, he was (laughter).  So, they got married and then my father went overseas, World War II [WWII].  And so they were--my mom actually I think came back to New York for part of that time, and, and lived with her parents [Louise Petgrave Silas and Alfred Silas].  And I know that she worked some place in terms of the war effort near the Empire State Building [New York, New York] and I think that may be also where my, my Nana worked as well.  But I remember her mentioning that that they would work either in the Empire State Building or near the Empire State Building.
Story_ID: 467848
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother [Ruth Silas Batts]?
Speaker 2: My mother is, is probably very much like her mother [Louise Petgrave Silas].  She is incredibly, a real presence.  She is gracious.  She is charming.  She is hospitable.  She has an incredible sense of humor.  And she is very passionate about things.  And growing up she had, I would say a slight temper.  Now, of course, I'm telling tales out of school because were you to talk with either of my children [Alexandra McCown and James McCown], they would say, "Slight?  You know, you have a huge temper."  So I think that I inherited this, if possible.  But my mom was, was really wonderful.  She was there, she was a homemaker.  She, she, was responsible for raising all of, excuse me, her daughters.  And she was always there when we came home from school making sure we did, you know, our homework, not that that was much of an effort because we were goody two shoes and we did our homework without any trouble.  But she was always there ready to, to help, to come up with ideas, to, you know, sort of sympathize, to suggest things, and to be supportive.  She was a, she was a fabulous mother.  She is a fabulous mother and a great role model.  Let's put it that way.
Story_ID: 467849
Speaker 1: Now let's talk a little bit about your father.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Do you have any tales about his childhood and where was he from?  And if you could tell us his name and spell it?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) my father's name is James, J-A-M-E-S, Alexander Batts, B-A-T-T-S, Jr. [James A. Batts]. He was born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.  He moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] with his parents [Hattie Eady Batts and James A. Batts, Sr.] very early.  And he would tell us these apocryphal stories about how he was, would go to the store by himself to buy bread at the age of two, you know.  In other words, always the responsible, in charge, mature person.  And, you know, first we would take it just straight out 'cause that was what our father would say.  But then I think as we got older we began to say, "Where could he have lived that he could go to the store by himself at the age of two?"  Now, do not misunderstand, we might have talked about this between ourselves or among ourselves but do you think that we were foolish enough to actually confront him with this?  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  So it's a mystery.  My father passed in 1992 and that among other mysteries went with him to the grave.  But he was very industrious, excuse me.  He worked while he was in, in high school.  He worked, he went to Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  He worked while he was in college.  He went to Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  He just was very focused, a high achiever.  And a great role model in that way as well.
Story_ID: 467850
Speaker 1: What would you say your parents' [Ruth Silas Batts and James A. Batts] relationship was like from your childhood perspective?
Speaker 2: Well, well it was, it was, it was great.  My, my mother, we, we categorized them or pigeonholed them.  My mother was a good--the social one, was the one who would, you know, invite people over or would, you know, remain in contact with people.  And my father was dutifully there when, you know, he was supposed to be.  He worked very hard.  And he was an obstetrician gynecologist so a lot of times he was not home or would leave very early in the morning, excuse me.  And I have to tell you that growing up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] when we became--going around by ourselves, "Oh, your father delivered my son or delivered my daughter," or something like that.  And, you know, or people just thought the world of him outside.  And we would say, he's kind of like quiet at home or, you know, no nonsense at home and everybody says, describing this, this, this wonderful, almost godlike creature.  We said, you know, we would just look at each other and say, "What is this?"  But he got back at us because one of the things that he did when it was time for us to go to dances at school, in high school, my father would go to his list of people that he had delivered who were age appropriate.  He would call the mother and say that he would like her son to take one of his daughters to the dance.  We, of course, are standing in the back in horror.  But actually people thought so highly of my father that, we, we, we never had a problem in terms of having somebody to go to--not that we knew them.  In many instances we actually after the dance got to know them and liked them.  But my father's favorite expression in terms of describing a young man, "He's clean cut," (laughter).  And if we, we, we, actually--clean cut actually had a very negative connotation for us because if that was the first thing my father would say about somebody you began to wonder you know, clean cut what else is there?  You know, is he tall?  Is he--you know, my father wouldn't know, he hadn't seen him since he, the person had been, been born, you know.  But it was this amazing--and, and he never asked us if this was what we wanted or--no, this was his decision about how he did not have to worry about his daughters when they were going out.  Whoa (laughter).  My children [Alexandra McCown and James McCown], I think, do appreciate that I did nothing like that to them.
Story_ID: 467851
Speaker 1: Now what about your father's [James A. Batts] parents?  Did you travel to Rocky Mountain, North Carolina [sic. Rocky Mount, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, they moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: They moved to Philadelphia.  And--
Speaker 1: So they were close?
Speaker 2: They were close but unfortunately my father's mother, Hattie, I believe, H-A-T-T-I-E, Eady, E-A-D-Y [Hattie Eady Batts], died before my twin sister [Diane Batts Morrow] and I were born, so we never knew her.  An interesting family story is that she predicted to my mother [Ruth Silas Batts], and I'm not even sure that at the time my mother knew that she was pregnant, but my paternal grandmother said to my mother that she was going to have twins.  She was wrong, 'cause it was twin boys in her prediction but, you know, twins are twins.  And indeed my twin sister and I were born.  So we never knew our paternal grandmother.  And to be quite honest I don't really feel that I knew my paternal grandfather [James A. Batts, Sr.] because I believe that he died when we were two or three and I don't, or closer to two than three, and I, I don't really have much of a memory except sitting on his knee.  Other than that, I don't really have much.  So I, am very fortunate that I had my maternal grandparents [Louise Petgrave Silas and Alfred Silas] but did not have any knowledge or relationship with my paternal grandparents.
Speaker 1: The way you're describing it, it sounds like your paternal grandmother died just as you were being born?
Speaker 2: Very close thereto, within a year I think.  Because as I say, I, I don't, my mother was just pregnant or not even aware that she was pregnant, I'm not sure about that.  And my, grandmother predicted twins.  And obviously it wasn't at the point where she was carrying so that anybody could see that she was having twins but this was a prediction and she was right.
Story_ID: 467852
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: (Pause) My earliest actual memory of, of growing up I think involves my twin sister.  I, I, it is, it is an awareness of my twin sister.  My parents [Ruth Silas Batts and James A. Batts] said that we had separate cribs and at the time that we were old enough to do it, no matter what happened, they would put us in separate cribs at night, and in the morning, we were both in the same crib.  I don't know that, which one of us got up and got into the other or whether both of us did on occasion, but the, my twin sister is, is probably my first childhood memory.  And it, it, it maintains, you know, even to today.  People will say, "What was it like growing up as a twin?"  And I will say to them, "What was it like growing up like a singleton?"  I said, "I know nothing else."  I, and what am I to compare it too?  But I feel extremely fortunate and lucky that I had a twin sister and I had the twin sister that I had.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you to state her name, right--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at this point.
Speaker 2: My sister is Diane, D-I-A-N-E, maiden name Batts, B-A-T-T-S, married name Morrow, M-O-R-R-O-W [Diane Batts Morrow].
Story_ID: 467853
Speaker 1: How long were your parents [Ruth Silas Batts and James A. Batts] married before the two of you came along?
Speaker 2: Well, the war [World War II, WWII] intervened so they had been married five years before we were born.
Speaker 1: And, I forgot to ask, what was, what did your father do while he, was he practicing medicine while he was away?
Speaker 2: You mean overseas (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, overseas?
Speaker 2: He, actually I think, I know that he was a major and I know that he was on the ship and went to Italy.  And whether he, I don't, I should know this, but I don't know whether he went in combat as well as being a doctor but he did his time in Italy.  He left the [U.S. military] service at the end of the war as a major.  And there's a very funny story because his discharge papers list him as white and my father is not white and anyone seeing him would never mistake him for being white.  But I, I believe the discharge happened some place in the South and my father credits it to the white soldier who was preparing the papers perhaps not being able to bring himself to acknowledge that a black man had achieved the rank of major.  So, clear as day, it's got the X in white.
Story_ID: 467854
Speaker 1: Before we leave your sister [Diane Batts Morrow], I wanna ask you to tell me the names of your other siblings--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --in, in order.
Speaker 2: All right.  The first child is Mercedes [HistoryMaker Mercedes Ellington],    M-E-R-C-E-D-E-S.  Then despite the fact that we're twins I have always beaten my sister down by telling her that I am five minutes older, that I was born first, and so therefore in birth order I am, you know, first.  And she has the good sense to let me get away with that all these years.  And then my baby sister, Denise, D-E-N-I-S-E, Batts, B-A-T-T-S [Denise Batts].
Speaker 1: What was your family like life?  What was your family life like?
Speaker 2: Wow.  It was, it was, we thought it was great.  For the longest time there, there, there are nine years between Diane [Diane Batts Morrow] and me and my sister, Denise [Denise Batts].  So we had a period of time where we were, you know, the babies, if you will.  And I grew up with dogs.  My mother [Ruth Silas Batts]--I remember my mother had dogs, Daisy May [ph.] was the name of one.  Teddy [ph.] was the name of another.  My [maternal] grandmother had a Cocker Spaniel named Penny [ph.].  And I, I don't know why I remember, I love dogs.  At, at some point in our household, my sister, Merc [HistoryMaker Mercedes Ellington] brought a Yorkshire terrier who had four puppies.  At that time we had two dogs so that it was wonderful.  Getting organized, it was like an army mobilization to get those dogs to take them out.  It was hysterical and it was a, a lot of fun.  But we had dogs and very responsible.  My, my, father [James A. Batts] actually was discharged from the [U.S.] military but I think certain military practices he maintained throughout his life.  When we were nine years old, just about the time that my baby sister was born, my father came up with the plan of dividing up household responsibilities.  Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I cooked breakfast and helped cleanup and do the dishes after dinner.  Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and I'll get back to Saturday, I was responsible for walking the dog or dogs however many we had.  In the morning before school, came home from school.  And then later as we were older, we would actually, if my father wasn't home yet we would do the, the, the evening, you know, ten o'clock walk before we went to bed.  My sister, Diane, obviously, oh, I'm sorry.  And, and then in addition too, it was dog and baby day.  Because, in addition to walking the dog Tuesday, Thursday--
Speaker 1: Saturday (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Saturday.  Yes I had to get up every Saturday.  My father in his infinite wisdom alternated Sundays.  I said you could have alternated Saturdays too, you know, no, no.  Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday I walked the dog.  And I was in charge of helping take care of, of our little sister.  If, you know, she wanted to--my mother would think it would be good for her to get, go outside in a stroller, and dutifully we, I would, you know, roll her around the block in the stroller, all seasons of the year.  If she wanted to be read to or whatever, it was my day, I would do it.  And Diane obviously had baby and dog duty on Monday, Wednesday, Friday when I was in the kitchen (laughter).  And this was, a system that worked for, for quite a few years actually.
Speaker 1: And what about your eldest sister?  What were her responsibilities?
Speaker 2: Well, my older sister actually did not live with us full time.  She lived with my [maternal] grandparents [Louise Petgrave Silas and Alfred Silas] here in New York [New York].  She, we have the same mother but we do not have the same father.  Although, for all intents and purposes she was a full member of our family.  Highlights would be when Mercedes, and we called her Merc, would come over from New York for school vacations, for the holidays, it was great.  So she escaped this and at one point I'm sure I tried to convince my father that when Merc was there she should take on some of these but my father, of course, you know, routine, this is the way it is, consistency, this is it.  But the truth is, is that Merc was several years older than we were.  So she was like, I don't know a model, a, a movie star or whatever.  She really is and was in, she's a choreographer.  She took ballet from obviously way before we were born.  And she was, went to Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York], got her Bachelor of Science in Dance [sic. Bachelor of Fine Arts].  Was on, went to, she has been in various Broadway productions, traveling companies.  Her, her, last name is Ellington.
Story_ID: 467855
Speaker 1: So you were talking about your older sister.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Who you said had the same mother but a different father.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Had your mother [Ruth Silas Batts] been married before?
Speaker 2: She had a relationship with Mercer Ellington who was Duke Ellington's son.  And they gave the gift of my sister to this world.  My dad [James A. Batts] wanted to adopt Merc [HistoryMaker Mercedes Ellington] but she did have a father and so that didn't happen legally.  But as I said earlier, Merc was a full-fledged member of our family.  She's a few years older, so I mean you can imagine what my father's like when he's going to his Rolodex to get dates for his daughters for dances and stuff.  I, I will say quite protective.  But it was wonderful because when we were like fourteen or fifteen and Merc was working in New York [New York] as a dancer, they, my parents, would let us come over to New York and stay with Merc.  Oh, my god.  Merc introduced us to pizza.  She introduced us to fountain cherry Cokes [Coca-Cola].  She took us to shows.  When she was in the shows we used to go back--I mean it was oh, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Merc is a movie star.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  My, my sister is something else.  And it was just heaven.  She would get us like clothes that, if we would had gone shopping with our parents, we would not have gotten.  Not that they were risque or anything, but that they were, they made statements.  She always had exotic gifts.  She's something else (laughter).
Story_ID: 467856
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit more about holidays at your house.  Which were the most important ones, perhaps you could start there and then describe what they were like.
Speaker 2: All right.  I think in my estimation Christmas was the most important holiday because it was interesting.  We didn't actually tell our parents [Ruth Silas Batts and James A. Batts] what we wanted for Christmas but somehow they would always manage to give us stuff that really, we liked.  And while we were identical twins they knew our personalities so that we didn't get identical toys.  I would get for instance, a train set and my sister would get a, a little sewing machine.  When I got dolls, they were gimmicky.  For instance, this is way before your time, but there was a show called 'Beat the Clock' on television sponsored by Sylvania [Sylvania Electric Products, Inc.].  And this platinum blonde woman named Roxanne [Dolores Rosedale] would come out and take a picture of the contestants.  And so one year they came out with a Roxanne doll.  And it didn't really look like the real person but it had the very long platinum blonde hair and had a little red camera on a plastic strap around her neck.  Now the camera was about this big.  And, but it was, it wasn't a real camera but if you would press the, the button--
Speaker 1: Shutter.
Speaker 2: --the shutter.  Thank you very much.  It was a flashlight.  And so I loved that doll because I loved the flashlight and the whole idea of it.  And there were other things that we got that were, were quite different.  I know one thing that my, my Nana [Batts' maternal grandmother, Louise Petgrave Silas] did that was totally ridiculous and inappropriate, I say that as a, as a parent now, was that she bought me a bright red English racer three speed bicycle when I had just learned to ride a bike and it was like I wanted this thing.  I saw when we came over to visit her once, a young lady in her building had a baby blue one and I just coveted that.  And lo and behold, I get this bicycle, and I'm thinking, you know, even I know I didn't deserve this bicycle but that's the kind of thing that happened.  And we would get other things too that were all, you know, useful, they didn't do too badly.  I mean we did have one set of fake aunts, since both of my parent were only children we didn't have real aunts, so very close friends would be called Aunt So and So.  Well one, (laughter) aunt, without fail would give us underwear for Christmas.  And so even before, you know, you, you, you opened it you knew what it was.  And my mother was a stickler for, for form and we had to write thank you notes.  And Diane [Diane Batts Morrow] and I would just, you know, crack up and say all sorts of things to each other that we would like to say in the thank you note, but that we didn't.  So we vented, that wasn't the word at the time, and then we wrote the appropriate thank you note for the underwear.  But it was a holiday time, family was there.  We knew Merc [HistoryMaker Mercedes Ellington] was always gonna come over for Christmas.
Story_ID: 467857
Speaker 1: And my mother [Ruth Silas Batts] is a fabulous cook.
Speaker 2: What did she cook?
Speaker 1: Ah.  We always had a ham and a turkey.  My mother would make sometimes sweet potato pudding.  My mother makes rice and beans.  My mother makes sweet potato pie, which she learned to make because my father [James A. Batts] loved sweet potato pies and so she--and, of course, that is the pie to have.  And so we would have--she also made fruitcakes.  Now, I'm sure that they were delicious but I was, you know, if there was sweet potato pie why, why, fill yourself up with fruitcake, you know, when you can have sweet potato pie.  She would make the cranberry relishes.  She, she's just a, she is just amazing.  Made Christmas cookies, baked them from scratch.  I'll go back to that in a second.  One of the other things I loved about the sweet potato pie is that she always had extra crust and she would roll them up in like, it looked like little crescent rolls and bake the crust and we'd call that dough cakes.  And there would be blood shed to get as many of those as you could.  And I think that the best sign of love that I probably every gave to my sister, Merc [HistoryMaker Mercedes Ellington], was that I remember one year she was late, there was a train, you know, a delay or something and so she didn't get there quite in time, you know, Christmas Eve or the day before, and my mother had started the baking.  And there were dough cakes left.  I didn't eat them.  I left some for Merc, and I said, "Now, you know."  And she said, "Yes, I know."  Cookies, Christmas cookies, I think it was a war time recipe actually that my mom got from her mother [Louise Petgrave Silas].  And she'd make these really, we had the cookie cutters and you make these really nice cookies and you could decorate them with, silver dares [sic. dragee] and all the other kind of things.  And I sort of was interested in that.  My sister, Diane [Diane Batts Morrow], was, was really this was her forte.  She was really into that.  And I have to tell you something, jumping ahead, I never made any Christmas cookies in my life, ever.  My sister took up the tradition, makes my mother and grandmother's recipe and her children decorate.  My children [Alexandra McCown and James McCown] have been deprived.  They don't, they don't do that because I didn't do that.  Anyway we would do, really when I was in my early teens, I would do really ridiculous things with the cookies.  For instance I would put three eyes on the snowman or, or something else like that to, to--just totally ridiculous.  And somehow they always knew which cookies I decorated.  I never quite figured that out.  But it was this wonderful anticipation.  The smells, the smells at home with all of this baking and, you know, I don't understand how my mother did it quite frankly.  I do not understand how she, you know, kept all of us from underfoot and, you know, all taken care of and did all of this cooking and it was absolutely delicious, yeah.
Speaker 2: And were the fruitcakes the kind where she would sort of make them a month before and then base them?
Speaker 1: I don't know that she made it the month before but boy was there a lot of rum going around.  And oh, you know, I thought I would like fruitcake because I like the some smell of rum, then I didn't realize there were actually were pieces of fruit in it and so, (laughter) you know.  I gave it a try and, and actually as I matured and my tastes became, you know, more subtle I actually did discover that I liked fruitcake, and my mother's fruitcake.  But still to this day, it would never be something that I would take over sweet potato pie.

Speaker 1: She [Batts' mother, Ruth Silas Batts] was a fabulous cook.  Her, her meatballs, oh, meatballs and spaghetti, good Lord.  Again when we were in that dangerous age of like eleven and twelve and on, my mother would always buy extra, extra chopped meat because the way she seasoned it, it was so good that my sister, Diane [Diane Batts Morrow], and I were eating steak tartare way before we knew we were eating steak tartare because we would go in there and grab some of that, you know, from the bowl before she--yeah, right, absolutely.  My mother just was, among other things an incredible cook.  And I--to this day I, for Christmas and Thanksgiving, I do a ham and a turkey.  I do the peas and rice or the rice and peas, I'm sorry.  I made slight variations from the way my mom did it, I'm sure she made some variations from the way her mom [Louise Petgrave Silas] did it.  Hoppin' John I think is, is the, the appropriate name.  And so I can make that.  I can make ham.  I can make turkey.  A couple of Thanksgivings ago I, I, I'm jumping all over the place, I'm sorry to do this, but, but my, we would always go to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] when we had our children.  My sister would come up from Georgia or Tennessee with her family and I, my family would, me and my kids [Alexandra McCown and James McCown] and my husband at the time would go down to Philadelphia and we'd all have Christmas there.  As we all got older what happened is, is that my parents would actually come from Philadelphia to New York [New York] because at that point three of the four of their daughters were living here in New York.  And so it just made more sense.
Speaker 2: So that's yourself, Merc [HistoryMaker Mercedes Ellington]--
Speaker 1: And Denise [Denise Batts].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And my twin sister lived in Tennessee for about seventeen years and then she moved to Athens, Georgia where she and her husband [John H. Morrow, Jr.] were on the faculty at UGA [University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia].  So I would be the one who would be preparing and fixing the dinner and so I would try and get my, my children interested but, but my children are not as, let's see handy in the kitchen or interested.  My son actually more than my daughter.  But other than making sure that I was doing the ham appropriately like overseeing, you know, I, I didn't get very much assistance.  But a couple Thanksgivings ago--but when my mother and father [James A. Batts] came over, my mom would always bring a sweet potato pie for dessert.  And also for Christmas she made mincemeat pie and I loved mincemeat pie.  Thanksgivings we would have sweet potato pie.  Christmas we would have sweet potato pie and mincemeat pie.  And that is where I learned to take, you know, slightly smaller wedges so you could have both and didn't have to choose.  So, but I never really made a pie.  I loved the dough cakes and when I got older I got to play with the dough and roll the dough cakes myself but I never did anything in terms of a real baking and a real rolling out of the dough and preparing the sweet potatoes or, or the yams.  And so a couple of Thanksgivings ago I said, "All right.  This is ridiculous."  My mom had said that she wasn't going to make them anymore and I said, "We can't let this happen."  So I said, "You have to tell us.  You have to either show us how to make it."  And we said that for years and years and years and she'd do the same old thing.  She'd say, "Well you take a bit of this and a dash of that and, a pinch of this."  And I'm saying, "Are you talking about your pinch or my pinch, whose pinch are we talking about?"  And it was just this amazing thing.  I said, "Could you just actually give me like universally known measurements?"  And, of course, she couldn't do that.  So we decided that she was going to help us and, you know, watch us and tell us what to do.  So (laughter) I did way too many yams.  I mean I had no, I had no concept, I didn't even know how many to, you know.  So I, I mean like we were eating yams for six years after this particular one.  But anyway and then we got to the crust, she said well, I think you do this and that, and it wasn't working, it wasn't working.  So finally at ten o'clock at night I was trying to follow these directions, you try--my mother got so frustrated she said, "Move (laughter)."  She made the entire pie.  It was hysterical.  She had actually tried to work with us, my daughter, and with me.  And so I have never yet even to this day made a sweet potato pie and my time is running out.  I'm getting nervous.
Story_ID: 467859
Speaker 1: What about your birthdays?  Was that a big day for you and your sister?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it was.  Again, we would get different things.  And, of course, for our birthdays we would sort of, you know, actually let it be known what we wanted.  I (laughter), for our twelfth birthday, Diane [Diane Batts Morrow] wanted to get pierced earrings, I didn't. But my father [James A. Batts] thinking, you know, just line 'em all up.  He pierced, he had pierced Merc's [HistoryMaker Mercedes Ellington] ears before and so that I think is what gave Diane the idea that she wanted to have her ears pierced.  And I didn't wanna have my ears pierced.  And my father said, "You're getting your ears pierced (laughter)."  And so not only did he say you're getting your ears pierced, he said, "You're gonna be first," and I did.  And I sat there, I mean he did an excellent job but he was a doctor and there was no, no infection or anything.  But I just did not want to have my ears pierced, I got 'em pierced.  So after the fact I realized that I had a much less chance of losing earrings or something like that and they also had I think a nicer variety of earrings for pierced ears.  So grudgingly rather than coming out and saying thank you for piercing my ears, through the years I actually really appreciated that I have pierced ears.  And jumping ahead when my daughter was born I said, "We're piercing her ears before she'll know that it'll hurt or anything else."  So at two months, my mom [Ruth Silas Batts] came over from Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and went with me to the hospital and Alex's [Alexandra McCown] ears were pierced and she looked adorable and it didn't bother her and I was, I was thinking that that's the way to do it.  So that's what Diane wanted, I begrudgingly came along and then, of course, realized it was a good thing and so I did it my, my daughter.  I wanted a guitar and they gave me a guitar.  I started taking guitar lessons, I'm very bad.  I had no talent at all.  But still loved playing.  So I loved playing but I didn't like practicing.  And mean to be quite honest my mother did the right thing by all of us, we all had piano lessons.  Never practiced until the day before the lessons, of course, then you sit like mad and, of course, there's one piano and two people who are trying to get all their practicing in, just before the lesson.  So my parents made us do that for a couple of years.  So I can, I can, I can read music.  I can with great effort pick out something on a piano with, with sheet music but I'm no great shakes, I mean nobody is worried about, you know, me taking over in terms of the piano or the guitar.  But my mother would say to us, "You will regret, if you do not take this music seriously.  You will regret that you did not practice and that we tried to do this for you and you just wouldn't do it."  And so we said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah," or whatever the equivalent was at that time.  But I have to tell this on myself, of course, when I became an adult and was working in New York [New York], I really decided, you know, I wanna take guitar lessons again.  So I started take guitar lessons again, only this time I had to pay for 'em.  And so there was slightly more practicing done, trying to fit it in with everything else.  No great musical breakthrough but I still am even today, taking guitar lessons because I just, I just love the music and I'm pretty good at sight reading.  Have a wonderfully patient guitar teacher and yes I am paying him.  And my mother is saying, "You know, I told you so."  She's right.  She's right.

Speaker 1: You mentioned that you and your sister got different gifts.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: So did you dress alike?  Did they sort of do the Bobbsey twin thing?
Speaker 2: Well, my--again very wise parents [Ruth Silas Batts and James A. Batts].  What my mother would do, we--well, first of all let me say, we went to a Catholic schools so we were all twins, all the girls wore the same uniform so that wasn't an issue.  So it was just a question of, you know, casual clothes or play clothes or whatever you would have.  And we would, you know, sort of likes, we were dressed alike when we were small, you know, children but I think about nine or ten or maybe eleven that we were not necessarily dressed alike.  And we would go shopping, Diane [Diane Batts Morrow] liked one style and I liked another style.  She got her style, I got my style.  In this interim period, however, my mother was really smart, she would buy two of everything but would say that we didn't have to wear it on the same day.  And so that worked out very nicely.  So no, she did not insist on this twin thing.
Speaker 1: And what was the relationship between the two of you as you got older and your younger sister [Denise Batts]?  I mean you were responsible for her initially--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --but, you know, how did that work?  Did she wanna be a twin also?
Speaker 2: I, I don't think, I don't think that she did.  I mean I, I think that she looked at it, "Boy there are two of 'em, you know.  I get both of them."  And so she was like a little doll, I mean we were nine years old when she was born.  So she's, she's like a live doll baby.  And, and she was, she was a few, she was and is very good natured and sort of put up with a lot of experimentation, you know, in terms of, of dressing her up and doing things to her.  She was wonderful.  She is wonderful.  But I think, I don't think she wanted to be a twin.  I don't know whether the age difference was such that she just didn't associate herself with that but I know she liked the fact that there were two of us.
Story_ID: 467861
Speaker 1: What street did you live on?
Speaker 2: I can give you a whole lot of addresses.  We were born at 5906 Girard Avenue in West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  When we were a couple of years old we moved to 1428 North 59th Street in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Then when we were about, I guess, nine, we moved to Cobbs Creek Parkway, 6209 Carpenter Street.  Then when we were about 14, 13, 14, we moved to Germantown [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], West Mount Airy [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And we lived 433 West Johnson Street.  And that's where we lived and my parents [Ruth Silas Batts and James A. Batts] continued to live after we all grew up and moved away.  And eventually my parents sold the house and they moved into an apartment.
Speaker 1: So generally asking, would you describe your homes?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: So you may choose one, but I guess really what I'm interested in is what was the setup like?  Did you and your sister [Diane Batts Morrow] have a room?  Did you all share rooms?  What was the household like?
Speaker 2: We shared rooms in, in most of the houses.  On 6209 Carpenter in Cobbs Creek [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] there, there were three floors and at one point what my parents did is they gave us a quote unquote, apartment, on the third floor.  We shared the bedroom, then there was a study and then there was a bath.  So we sort of up there, you know.  And it was cool, so, yeah.  Except my mother would come up, look at the condition of the place, have a heart attack and say, you know, "This is not acceptable."  And she probably used stronger language than that and got her point across.  But it was nice to have that feeling of, you know, sort of being alone and, and we enjoyed that but in all the other places we, at 433 in Germantown we had our own one bedroom but off of that was a den, so we had a study where our desks were and our books and, you know, and things like that.  So we sort of had a, a sort of a suite there.
Story_ID: 467862
Speaker 1: And what kind of community did you live in?  My understanding, I don't know a lot about Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] but my understanding is--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --that West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] is sort of a black area.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: You mentioned several addresses, so what kind of community did you live in?
Speaker 2: Well, we lived at--when, when we were, up until the time we moved to Germantown [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], we lived in very integrated communities.  I believe that when we moved to Germantown we were the first black family on, on that block.  And we had very cordial relationships with our neighbors (laughter).  We were in high school at this time and we, among other things, were studying Latin and, you know, there is justice but I don't know what we did to deserve this, our immediate next door neighbor was a retired Latin teacher.  And so we would be trying to just go outside in the dead of winter and, you know, to empty the trash into the garbage cans and he would be there waiting for us.  And, you know, start talking to us in, and, you know, asking us what we were studying and giving us Latin sentences and stuff.  And being the polite and well raised children, we didn't say, "We're freezing we're going inside," we would stand out there.  And so the question was, who had to take out the garbage tonight, 'cause he was waiting there for you.  I mean he wasn't really waiting outside but he could see when we were out there and he would go.  So that was, that was funny.  And he, and he I think enjoyed the fact that we were taking Latin.  Our neighbors were, you know, eventually a few other black families moved on to the, the block when we were like juniors and seniors in high school.  And they were lovely.  And, you know, at this point I think our, our life was no longer on the block.  When we were little kids, like when I got my English racer, all the kids were out on the street all the time and the parents were parents for all of the kids.  You couldn't really get away with something because your, your, your parents were inside because the other parents were seeing what you were doing.  And it wasn't that they would even tell your parents, they would just tell you, "You know you shouldn't be doing that."  So there was this, I mean there were a lot of kids on the block and we always had a lot--we played dodge ball, we did jump rope, that's where I learned to jump rope.  It was wonderful on, on 59th Street.  And then when we moved to Cobbs Creek [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] we were, I guess, in the, going into the fourth grade [at St. Carthage School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and there weren't as many kids.  I mean there weren't, in fact, there were no kids on our block, our age.  There were younger kids and there were older kids but not our age.  So we got, you know, caught up in school and homework and stuff like that.  But we never quite had that same group of, of, you know, just every house had kids approximately your age.  And it was, that was wonderful.
Story_ID: 467863
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights and sounds and smells that you encounter more presently, remind you of when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: There are times that I am walking on the street in New York [New York] or I am on the subway and I catch a, a whiff of someone's perfume, and I, and it's something that my mother [Ruth Silas Batts] wore, I almost follow this person home.  It is this--it's just immediate, it's not, it's I don't, well what is that, why is that to--no, no it's just immediate, and I know exactly that it's one of the scents that my mother wore.  That, that is really scary too because, you know, New York is a city that, you know, is very anonymous and, you know, all strangers and stuff like that.  And I can imagine somebody seeing me go like this and think, you know, think, what is wrong with that woman?  But it's that ability to smell and it makes me think of my mother that is just wonderful.  At Christmastime when they sell the Christmas trees on the street and you're half a block down and, you know, preoccupied with something else, and all of a sudden the, the evergreen aroma it's, it's intense and it just sort of takes you in.  And I think what happens is, is that every Christmas that you've ever experienced just sort of flashes through your mind and, and I find myself smiling and, you know, whatever mood I was in before, when I catch a whiff of those trees at Christmas I'm in a much better mood.  I'm trying to think of other smells.  I think that we used to take vacations, a week in Wildwood, New Jersey, and so ocean smells, I also when I, you know, go to, you know, East Hampton [New York] or any other place the, on the, on the shore when I smell these things, it again brings thoughts of, of, of childhood.  We used to love to go on the boardwalk and do the rides in Wildwood.  The smells of the pizza, which by this point of course we were quite sophisticated because our sister, Merc [HistoryMaker Mercedes Ellington], had already introduced us to this, hot Italian hoagies, sausages, sweet or, or, or hot.  Oh, and with the peppers, oh, my goodness.  And then something that had absolutely no smell at all but the frozen custard.  You know, I, I, I'm not exactly sure what chemicals were in that, and I'm not exactly sure if it really would melt I, because you never, you ate it so quickly it never gave it a chance.  That had no smell at all but that was always the way to finish off the, the, you know, the meal at the boardwalk.  And the thing I loved was the, the chocolate and vanilla twirl because this way you didn't have to choose, you got both.  And so I, I, I loved that.  There are other smells I guess, sort of autumn smells.  Like when I grew up, when people raked leaves they used to burn them.  And obviously you do not do that now, you know, environmentally but the smell of, of, of like either wet falling leaves with the various colors or if I, if I smell something that smells slightly like burning, I mean one of the things that will go through my mind is, is that, you know, if it smells like burning leaves I know it's not, but it, it does.  So I, I think that there are sort of seasonal smells that, that--and, of course, food.  Anything that smells really good and is something that my mom used to fix there's an immediate flashback, you know, to, to childhood.
Story_ID: 467864
Speaker 1: What kind of music did your parents [Ruth Silas Batts and James A. Batts] listen to?
Speaker 2: Ah.
Speaker 1: What, what did, what were you all listening to?
Speaker 2: We grew up listening to big band, to Ella Fitzgerald, to Oscar Peterson, to Lena Horne, Tony Bennett, Johnny Mathis.  We used to love Sunday afternoon when they would have Fred Astaire movies with his incredible dancing and the songs.  I know a lot about George [George Gershwin] and Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin.  These songs that I would hear often enough that even today if, if someone starts I can, I actually know the words.  I can, I can remember the words.  It was, it was wonderful.  These, these are--now I'm really going to sound ridiculously, old-fashioned but I have say that the words were clever.  That they told stories but the way they got these things to rhyme, it was just a delight to hear.  And I just, I mean I just loved the lyrics.  It was, it was just fascinating (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you have an example?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  Well, 'Night and Day' or "You say tomato, I say tomato" ['Let's Call the Whole Thing Off']. Let's see, it was just one of those things, I mean it was, I have to tell you, they really do tell stories.  And they do it in a clever way.  And you get the feeling of, you know, you feel sad for the person but not for me.  They're writing songs of love but not for me.  I mean you really, it's, it's like you, you get into the emotion of the music and it's, it's singable.  I mean, the, the, the melody it's, it's just wonderful.  And so we would listen to that.  My mother, my mother has a gorgeous singing voice, and so she would sing along.  And it was lovely.  It was just lovely to hear.  When she's cleaning, when she's, you know, ironing, the music is on and she's singing and she's got a fabulous voice.  So it was just a very positive association.  I mean this is not your mother who, you know, does everything for you and cooks your food and does this and that, this is, this is this wonderful person who can sing.  You know, it really made you look, or made us look at our mother in a different way, like, wow, why didn't you become a singer, you know.  So I have a very positive association with, with music, with music of the '20s [1920s], '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s], you know, '50s [1950s].  Then my twin sister and I discovered, discover is, is perhaps being presumptuous, we got into classical music, very, romantic, Tchaikovsky [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky], Rachmaninoff [Sergei Rachmaninoff], you know, Sibelius [Jean Sibelius], I mean, just loved to hear the classical music.  The, there was a classical music radio station that we listened to all the time.  And then when we started like getting allowances we would go and buy records and we would play them over and over and over.  And the thing that we kind of found amazing was that, we loved the same things, most of the time but then there were times that I would like something different.  I think, and Diane [Diane Batts Morrow] would say, "Well that's, that's, that's nice."  But, you know, if I weren't there she would not be listening to it.  And same thing, she would find things that she liked that, that I, would be very happy to listen to, but again if she were not there, I would not choose that to put on.  But in the median, you know we, we just loved listening--and we found, we studied, we did our homework to classical music.  I mean I guess we would have loved to have done it to, to music or pop tunes and stuff like that with words but then we would find the words are distracting, that it wouldn't work. And, of course, we got into well, Merc [HistoryMaker Mercedes Ellington], introduced us to rock and roll and 45s [45 rpm record] and stuff like that.  So we just got very much into that kind of music.
Story_ID: 467865
Speaker 1: 'Tequila' was a song.  'Cerveza' was another one.  'Watermelon Man,' Mongo Santamaria, it--she, my sister had a, my sister, Merc [HistoryMaker Mercedes Ellington], actually introduced us to more Latin music.  She's a fabulous dancer, mambo, cha-cha, she taught us how to dance.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't ask you too many questions about your mother's [Ruth Silas Batts] relationship with Duke Ellington's son [Mercer Ellington]--
Speaker 1: (Nods head).
Speaker 2: --but was, was, so was that an influence on your sister?
Speaker 1: Well, I, I don't--it's hard to say, I mean, because as I say my mom was so musical, and my sister went into a different art form with the dance.  So but I, I'm sure, I mean obviously that, that I mean we had, we, we heard Duke Ellington music at home as well.  So I'm not exactly sure (laughter).  My sister was just a, a creature, is just a creature of talent.  She was just born, my--Diane [Diane Batts Morrow] and I would, would bemoan the fact that we have no arches.  And my sister has the most gorgeous feet, the most beautiful arches, she was, she was very serious she did toe--
Speaker 2: And let me just ask what year did she attend Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York]?  I mean--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: What year, about what year did your sister attend Juilliard?
Speaker 1: In the, I think she graduated in '61 [1961] or '62 [1962], yeah.  And she just, I mean, she embodied rhythm and she was so graceful, she--you know, I was talking about what we, Diane and, and I did to my sister, Denise [Denise Batts].  I haven't told you what Merc would do to us.  Merc would make us and, you know, would dress us up with, would, would teach us how to walk in heels, would put makeup on us, and I didn't like makeup to be quite honest and I was very long-suffering in putting up with it.  Diane loved it and so, you know, I went along, because what else was I supposed to do.  But she, she really taught us how to sit, you know, how to walk.  She--I think she thought of us as little dolls too just as we thought of our, little sister as, as a doll.  But she was--and we kept getting upset and saying, "We're not Merc, we're--I'm clumsy, I can't do that."  Diane loved going to dance school.  I hated dance school.  I despised dance school.  I felt like it just wasn't me.  I didn't feel that my body was one with music.  I didn't feel that I had that same air and grace.  My sister, Diane, actually, even in adult life I was taking my guitar lessons as an adult, Diane went very seriously into modern dance and actually got her daughter very involved in it.  So obviously there were some genes that we shared with my sister, Merc, only mine never woke up.  So that there was always this, but I can't do that, I can't, you know, I don't, I just don't feel as if I can do that.  And Merc had infinite patience, I have to say.  And, but she got, she made more headway with Diane than she did with me, let's put it that way (laughter).
Story_ID: 467866
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your education.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Where'd you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: We went to Catholic school first through third grade, was at St. Rose of Lima [St. Rose of Lima School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in West Philly [West Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Then fourth through eighth grade was St. Carthage [St. Carthage School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which was at 63rd [Street] and Cedar Avenue in Philadelphia, Cobbs Creek Parkway area.  And in, in ninth grade we went to Little Flower Catholic High School for Girls [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], they separated the boys from the girls in ninth grade.  And then my father [James A. Batts] decided that he wanted to make sure that we were getting the best possible education, so what he did is he had us transfer from Little Flower for tenth grade through twelfth grade to Philadelphia High School for Girls [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or Girls' High, which was a non-district, public high school that you got into based on testing.  And so we finally went to a public school in, in tenth grade.  And I have to give incredible credit to our Catholic education because the toughest thing for Diane [Diane Batts Morrow] and me in high school?  Gym.  And remember I was just telling you about how my body and I did not, did not talk, did not communicate.  Trying to learn how to do the horse and the ropes and all that stuff and, and the rings, when we had never had to do that before, you know, some students might stay after school working on their algebra or something like that, what were we doing?  We were down in the gym trying to pass, you know.  I mean it was just amazing, humiliating experience that, that academically we were not having a problem at all, we were doing very well, beautifully, it was like we didn't, we didn't have a clue about gym.

Speaker 1: So the Catholic school education I think was, was absolutely fabulous, it was quite strict.  When you think about it we had--the smallest class we had in Catholic school from fourth grade to, through eighth grade was fifty-six in the classroom [at St. Carthage School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I specifically remember in fourth grade we had ninety kids in the classroom.  Fifth grade we had one hundred kids in the classroom and so they had to knock out a wall between classrooms so that there was this one long galley of a classroom.  One, God bless her, nun teaching ninety or a hundred kids.  So that discipline was quite important.  And, you know, no one wanted to get, to have to stay after school.  No one wanted to get their knuckles rapped with a ruler.  Well, actually I say no one, my sister and I certainly didn't, and most of the girls didn't either.  But, you know, there are always the guys who thought they could push the envelope.  And so we learned because there was absolute silence in the, I mean it's, it was, it's like--it actually reminds me of what it must have been like for my father [James A. Batts] in the [U.S.] Army.  But it was no nonsense, things got done, you did your homework, you prepared, you had to recite you, you know, penmanship.  They taught us in, in fifth grade or sixth grade, I'm not sure, to write with a fountain pen.  Did we start with fountain pens?  No.  We started with quills, ink bottle in the, little round place in desk, yep (laughter), yeah.  And so, you know, god forbid that you would smudge.  Now one thing that I haven't revealed which I think is quite significant is that Diane [Diane Batts Morrow] and I are both left-handed.  So in order to write with a quill or any fountain pen and not smear, you know, that's why a lot of times, yeah.  Well, we actually didn't do that but somehow we managed to get the hand around enough so that we weren't smearing as we went along which is, is a--I, I thought it was a real feat.  And actually to this day I use fountain pens.  When we eventually graduated to fountain pens, but the quill dipping it in and making sure you didn't splotch it, it was, it was an act of discipline.  Act of, of, self, you know, control and concentration.  And the other thing I loved about it is that you couldn't press down because the nib would split and you'd get all sorts of ink, so you had to have a light but focused touch as you wrote.  And it was so nice to actually see the, because I think fountain pen ink is just the best.  It, it just is, is solid, it's there, and I just think it's wonderful.  So as I say it's, learned to do it in fifth or sixth grade and ball point pens are just not my thing, fountain pen to this day.

Speaker 1: When you were in the elementary school phase--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --did you have any particular subjects that you enjoyed?  I mean, clearly you guys [Batts and her identical twin sister, Diane Batts Morrow] were disciplined and you were attacking each subject--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --but did you have any special interests?  Did you have any sense of where you thought you might be going as on older student?
Speaker 2: I, I think that we, we loved the reading, we loved anything that had to do with reading, we loved.  And the math maybe a slight trepidations but we had this wonderful Sister Michael Gerald [ph.], was her name, in both fourth grade and fifth grade [at St. Carthage School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  She was the one who handled the ninety and a hundred kids in the classroom.  And she had this math game where she would pit the boys against the girls and it was a question of speed.  She would have numbers up on the board in order and in a, a line.  And then she would tell you as you went up to the board, "Multiply," or she'd say, "Subtract," or she--and then, you know, you'd start at either end and whoever finished first, the boys team, one of the girls team won.  I, it, it, made math fun.  I mean this was her reward, you know, for us when the class has been good and stuff we would play this math game.  And I, I just absolutely loved it.  And I loved fractions.  I loved percentages.  I loved all of that stuff.  I think that, that I loved algebra one.  I loved actually algebra two.  My downfall, geometry.  Just not, that's just not me.  But I think that, that those kind of challenging math games I loved.  Whenever we had to read anything I loved.  I liked history.  I was leery of geography because that required (laughter) an ability to draw the shape of a country.  I wasn't very good at drawing and I wasn't very good at gym.  So we would (laughter)--I, I think at one point I, I was told that when I drew the continent of South America that it liked an amoeba.  I don't think it was supposed to look an amoeba but mine looked like an amoeba.  But I think that eventually I got, I liked South America because I could actually remember where all the countries were and I loved that.  But in terms of trying to remember the capitals of the various countries, it was, it was, it wasn't my thing really but I think most of the time I really enjoyed my studies.
Story_ID: 467869
Speaker 1: So before you switched high schools--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --did you have any sense of what you wanted to do with your long-term education?  Did you have a sense as a elementary school student, better put, that you were going to attend college?
Speaker 2: Oh, there was no question.  I mean it's not that my father [James A. Batts] said, "You will go to college," but it is that he expected us to go as far as we could academically and this just was no question.  I think that, there, there might have been an issue of what to do after college, but there was no question that we were going to college.  I think that I might have had dreams of being a doctor but I think that my father who I guess, you know, by now is a very strong presence and had his own opinions about things, at the time that I was growing up, felt that medicine was not appropriate for women.  In his view, you couldn't be a good mother and a good doctor.  Or to put it another way, he didn't know any women in medicine who were happy.  Now I only know of two women doctors anyway, and, and they seem pretty happy to me but who am I?  So fast forward to, I'm now in college [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts], my father has been for several years now on faculty at medical schools, he's stopped private practice he went into academia, and (laughter) my sister is, Denise [Denise Batts] is what about thirteen or something like this, my father had this incredible 180 degree turnaround where he thought that it was important for diversity in medical schools.  So he was on the admitting committee at Temple Medical College of Pennsylvania [Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], whichever place he was on the faculty and he insisted on recruiting women and minorities.  And he told (laughter) my sister, Denise, "You will go to medical school."  It's not like, "Well do you think you might wanna?  You will go to medical school."  So, of course, she didn't.  But the thing that I found so funny is hello, you know, if you had had that attitude a little earlier I might have gone to medical school because I, I just thought it was so wonderful being a doctor and actually having a hands-on ability to make a difference.  But I'm, I'm, I'm pretty happy in law (laughter).
Story_ID: 467870
Speaker 1: So tell me about that shift from the Catholic school [Little Flower Catholic High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] to the--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --public Girls' High School [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Girls' High School has a cachet, it's a college preparatory school--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --it's popular.  So if you could just tell us how did you feel about that move, and what was that like?  What was the difference?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think that we were very happy with the move because, are you ready for this?  We didn't have to wear uniforms.  We could wear real clothes every day to school.  That in and of itself would be, you know, the, the deal maker.  We also found that, I think, that there was a little bit more objectivity because there wasn't a particular religion being sort of, not pushed isn't the right word, but being indoctrinated.  And we met people who were not Catholic and it was wonderful.  So it was an eye-opening, freeing, experience.
Story_ID: 467871
Speaker 1: Did you attend Catholic church?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We were, Diane [Diane Batts Morrow] and I were in the choir.  It should give you some measure of, of the qualifications for being in the choir to let you know that I was in the choir 'cause I really cannot sing.  But it was almost like if you were a good student you were expected to be in the choir.  And actually Diane, who, who does have talent, was actually instructed on the organ and so she could, will play the organ sometimes.  I, of course, never reached that level.  So, and I, and I loved the, the Gregorian chant.  I loved the music part of it.  I loved the singing in Latin, loved that.  So there were aspects of it that I really found attractive.  So yes, we were very religious and even when we went to--my mother [Ruth Silas Batts] is a practicing Catholic, and so that is the impetus for our religious training.  So even though we didn't go to Catholic school after ninth grade, we still were going to church every Sunday.  And, in fact, when we went to college, I think that I was still a practicing Catholic at least through some of my sophomore year [at Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And then I got to the point where I realized if I don't go to church, the world is not going to end.  But then something that had always been under the surface with me with the church, just sort of came up to the surface, which was, I didn't understand since I thought I was as smart if not smarter than the boys, how come they can be altar boys and all I can do is be in the choir even though I can't sing?  So I was not happy with that.  I was not happy with, now this is before Pope John XXIII [Saint Pope John XXIII], we were, there was this opening up of the church to a certain extent.  Women couldn't go up into the altar area except to change the altar cloth.  We could not perform a function up there, we were, you know, I, I was upset with, I think, a holiday in the Catholic church it's in February, where the Virgin Mary had to be purified after giving birth.  I said, "What are you talking about?  She gave birth to God.  She's gotta be purified?  What is this?"  You know.  I, I just, there were just certain things that did not sit well with me but being either an intelligent person or a coward, I never really got into these things when I was in Catholic school.  But it, it, just got to me that, that there wasn't really a, a fairness here.  There was a great inequity.  Also I think that we went to some, there was some event where there were all the orders of nuns came and, you know, the school took us there I guess to see if you had a vocation or something.
Story_ID: 467872
Speaker 1: Continue telling us about your church experience.
Speaker 2: Well, I think that the seeds of, of discontent, if you will, were planted relatively early because my mother [Ruth Silas Batts] was a practicing Catholic but my father [James A. Batts] was not.  My father was very active in his church, St. Matthew's A.M.E. Church [St. Matthew African Methodist Episcopal Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Skipping ahead, one of the things that I deeply regret is that because of the rigidity of the Catholic church, the first time that I went to my father's church, was for his funeral.  And I just felt so deprived to see the high regard and love that his church had for him.  And I knew his church was very important to him but, you know, he would go off Sunday and we would go off on Sunday in separate directions and, one of the things in Catholic school obviously is the catechism.  You had catechism class, so you had religious studies every day, and it was very dogmatic.  And they were talking about if you were not Catholic, you would go to hell.  Now, obviously if everyone in your family is Catholic, this doesn't really necessarily strike you as, as particularly harsh because it doesn't really affect you.  But, my sister [Diane Batts Morrow] and I were really troubled by the fact that we knew that our father was a good man, and yet there was no way he could go to heaven because he wasn't Catholic.  And so I'd say stuff like, "Well, I don't wanna go there either, 'cause if he can't go there, I don't wanna go there."  And the, the problem for me in terms of the church was that they couldn't see how this would 'cause great pain because not everybody in the Catholic schools had either, had either a Catholic parent or both were Catholic.  So they should have thought of where is going when these kids go home?  You know, maybe we can lighten up and say, "Well, you know, if you're really, really very good I'm sure that God would want you in heaven," or something like that as opposed to saying, "No, they go to hell," you know.  It just was, it was so, I very early on was troubled by the fact that it didn't matter how good my father was, and I knew that he was a good person.  So that was one thing that bothered me and it made me, you know, obviously less upset about leaving the, the confines of the, the, Catholic education.  And then the fact that I never saw a black nun.  And I thought, you know, I don't really see, I mean there were no black statues in any, in the churches.  Everything was, was white.  Now there was this event and I can't remember the name of it, if I called my twin sister she would know immediately what it was, but anyway we went through the school and we actually saw some black nuns.  And I was like memorized--mesmerized.  My sister also, 'cause this was like a, a revelation to us.
Story_ID: 467873
Speaker 1: Fast forward to my sister [Diane Batts Morrow] and her doctoral thesis and her concentration.  She wrote on the Oblate Sisters of Mercy [sic. Oblate Sisters of Providence], an order of black nuns.  They were started in, I think, the 1700s and were based in Maryland, Baltimore.  Who knew?  You know, so my sister has devoted a lot of time, she has developed a wonderful relationship with, with the sisters and she stays in the convent for weeks at a time reading through their wonderful material. She's already written one book on it which was fabulous.
Speaker 2: Do you know the title?  Just--
Speaker 1: Yes, I do know the title or I do know most of it.  Sisters, no.  Religious ['Persons of Color and Religious at the Same Time: The Oblate Sisters of Providence, 1828-1860,' Diane Batts Morrow]--and actually, you know, I have the book right here.  I could tell you the title.  Do you want me to get it?
Speaker 2: Go ahead.  No, no.  Go ahead, we'll talk.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Perhaps later on when we look at photos--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --we'll look at your sister's book.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Excellent because it's a fabulous book.  I did read it.  She commented to me she thinks I'm the only family member who read it.  I said I don't think that that's true.  But it was, it was just wonderful.  I would never have known this.  But, but back to in, in '60s [1960s], the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s] when I'm in Catholic school, this was unheard of.  So, I, I had incredibly well-founded, well-based academic discipline, training, love for learning, ability to memorize like you wouldn't believe as a result of the Catholic school education, and I am forever grateful for that.  To this day, my poor law clerks are very upset with me because even though I understand grammatically it is acceptable to split infinitives, not with me.  And so I call them to task every time I get a draft and there's a split infinitive.  So I don't, I mean I'm rigid and indoctrinated in that way.  But I, I am very grateful for the wonderful foundation in education that I got from Catholic school.  But the Catholic church I think, excuse me, has posed problems for me because of the fact that we, from a dual religion family, because of the fact that we're black and in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] there was not a, a black nun in sight.  The fact of the way women were treated and viewed in the church.  All of this kind of did not sit easy with me.  And I think that probably, while I broke away from the church very early on, I was not going to church on my own at all by the end of college [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and out of respect for my mother [Ruth Silas Batts] when I would come home to visit, I would go to church but not on my own.  And then, of course, the church's unforgiving, unloving attitude toward homosexuality left me no choice but to say this is not the religion for me.  But getting back to going to Girls' High [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], all of those, I mean those were not all evident to me, the, the fact that my father [James A. Batts] was not going to heaven was very going back, you know, to third grade, fourth grade.  And resenting that I could not be an altar boy that was long-standing.  And also the fact that, that I never saw a black nun except at this one event. Something-rama, I forgot what's it's called.  That--then, you know, as, as going through, the, the, the late '60s [1960s] and the early '70s [1970s] and I graduated from college in '69 [1969], you know, rising awareness of, of both race and gender, there just weren't any right answers.
Story_ID: 467874
Speaker 1: So tell me a little bit about Girls' High School [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: What's the population there look like?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: And, you know, just discuss what you were doing there. What you were interested in--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --how rigorous?
Speaker 2: It was, it, it, it is, it is a wonderful school.  I loved that school.  My sister [Diane Batts Morrow] loved that school.  My sister, Denise [Denise Batts], went to that school.  Just a fabulous school.  It was incredibly, wonderfully diverse.  Significant black population.  Significant white population, included in that significant Jewish population.  Oh, my goodness, my introduction into, to, to Jewish food for instance.  Oh, I felt deprived.  I felt deprived.  It was just wonderful.  Made many new friends and in fact, it was funny because we had known some of the people who were there because they were some of the people that we met when we lived on 59th Street and we played with.  So while we never went to school with them before, now we were going to school with them, when we went to Girls' High.  So it was sort of a coming home in that respect.  And it was, we just, it was just a really nice, easy fit.  Now one thing that Little Flower [Little Flower Catholic High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] did that, probably did quite a few good things, but the one thing that they really did is that in their effort to make us have some of the social graces they decided that we had to be in the orchestra.  I mean I think that it was harder to get out of the orchestra than to get into the orchestra.  Now, no one said to us, "What instrument would you like to play?"  We were given trombones.  Did I have any more ability on the trombone than I did on the piano or the guitar?  No.  But I thought it was fun because you could use the slide to poke people who were in front of you.  And we learned the basics at, at Little Flower but then when we transferred to Girls' High, Girls' High had an orchestra and a marching band.  And we just, I loved it.  I absolutely loved it.  The band played for special events.  They had something called contest which made the hair on my, back of my neck stand up because this was a gymnastic event and we were not doing very well in gym.  However, because we were in the band that was our big thing and we had a big number where we did a marching routine in the middle of the contest.  It was great.  We were--they also had an orchestra and a wonderful, wonderful conductor, Dorothy Shaw Weir, W-E-I-R, was her name.  And she lived for the music.  She lived for the orchestra, she just, "Girls, girls, girls."  You know, we came in early in the morning to practice.  I actually did, I will have to give you this, I think I actually practiced the trombone more than I did any of the other instruments because there was an immediate period of time in which we had to perform.  The orchestra performed a lot.  The band performed a lot.  And because we played a brass instrument, we also were in the brass choir.  At Christmas we got to wear, I'm not so sure I thought of it as got to wear or had to wear, these elf outfits, tights and like, like medieval things and, and hats and stuff, and we would stand on the roof of the school and play Christmas carols as the student body left for Christmas vacation.  It was fabulous.  I mean it was just, I mean, I'm, I'm, I am a Christmas person.  I mean Christmas is, I, I, you know, I tell my season is summer, but my, my time of the year is Christmas.  So I just thought that was so cool to be standing up there.  And I actually learned the carols, I mean or  the, yeah, the carols I would learn them.  And I, it was just so wonderful and, of course, we were freezing up there because we were out there in those outfits but it was worth it.  It was just absolutely worth it.  I loved that.  I absolutely loved that.
Story_ID: 467875
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in high school?
Speaker 2: Interestingly, science, not math, but science.  I loved biology.  I loved chemistry.  I loved physics.  Had a real problem, geometry was my downfall, limped through geometry.  Most of the teachers at Girls' High [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] were absolutely inspiring.  My geometry teacher, who will remain nameless, was just downright insipid, and had no ability to, to, to, you know, instill any passion for the subject.  And I'm not necessarily a visual person so that I would get these shapes and things like that, and so that I found that very trying.  And I think that because I didn't go on to take calculus or trig [trigonometry] or any of those other things, just made it through Algebra Two and stopped, that it, it probably impeded my, you know, advancement in science because math and science really do kind of go relatively closely together and I was much more attuned to the science than I was to the math.  So, but I loved science.  Oh, and Latin, our Latin teacher, Erenias R.G. Davis [ph.] wonderful woman, wonderful woman.  She inspired, I mean actually she's the one who prepared us to go to the neighborhood.  You know, we could face the neighbor because, you know, Ms. Fischer [ph.] had really drilled us and, and we, you know, read 'The Aeneid' [Virgil].  We read Cicero.  We, you know, learned, you know, the various conjugations of the, of the, of the Latin verbs and, and, the different forms of the, of the nouns.  I mean it, it made sense to me that you would have a special word for something that's an object of a sentence and a different word for the subject because this way you knew what the objects and subject was.  I didn't quite understand why English didn't follow through with that but anyway I loved Latin and took Latin all through high school.  And then took up Spanish, and I think that the Latin definitely helped with the Spanish so, I loved languages.  I loved science.  English I enjoyed.  Didn't quite jump into Chaucer [Geoffrey Chaucer] with both feet but, you know, managed to limp along there.  When we started reading Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] I thought that was fabulous.  So I, I, I think that, that my Girls' High education was just plain inspirational and just thought you could do anything after graduating from that school.
Speaker 1: And you, graduate, you graduated from Girls' High in 1965?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 467876
Speaker 1: So can you talk to me about the racial atmosphere in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?  I mean in the national scene--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --but as it's affecting you in Philadelphia.  Are you, are you in tune with what's happening in Washington [D.C.] in terms of their being a March on Washington, in terms of there being a Civil Rights Movement?  As we're gathering along, what's your relationship to that in Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: We, well, we knew of it and, you know, my father [James A. Batts] was supportive of it but we were not actively involved in it.  My father was, was getting involved with education.  He was actually thinking about joining the school board and he was into politics.  Leon Sullivan he was very close with and active with.  And this I think was a natural offshoot of his involvement with his church [St. Matthew African Methodist Episcopal Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which I think may have been something that didn't make it so natural for us since we were not with him and of the church that he was in.  But he was very aware what was going on.  We'd have very intense discussions at the dinner table, current events and affairs.  So we were not directly affected by the, the intensity of the movement.  We were quite sheltered I think is, is the best way of describing it.  Because we were not, we were in, in Catholic school for most of the time, and then we when we went to public school [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] we were older and it was all girls and all girls who were academically oriented.  It, it was, its own world in a way.  So it, it we didn't have any direct, physical contact with some of the difficulties that were going on.
Story_ID: 467877
Speaker 1: How'd you end up at Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Well, one of our neighbors, who happened to be related to the Latin teacher but lived four doors down, went to Radcliffe and she loved it.  And she just thought, you know, that we had to go.  And so she was going to just talk us into it.  Now Diane [Diane Batts Morrow] had no interest in going far away from home.  But I listened to Sue Ellery [ph.] describe, you know, her experiences there, how wonderful it was, and I just got infected with it.  And so, it was a very interesting thing.  We each applied to four colleges and we each got into the four colleges.  Three of the colleges were the same.
Speaker 1: Tell me what they are?
Speaker 2: All right.  I applied to Radcliffe, to Smith [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts], to Mount Holyoke [Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, Massachusetts]-- was it Vassar [Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York] maybe I think, and got into all four of the schools.  Diane applied to Swarthmore [Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania], Mount Holyoke, Smith and Vassar and got into all.
Speaker 1: I feel like Swarthmore is not, but all those all also all-girls schools?
Speaker 2: No, no, Swarthmore is not an all-girls school.  All the others were all girl schools.  So Radcliffe is an all-girls school but it in, in name only since they didn't have their own faculty and we just went to school at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  But Swarthmore was a truly coed institution.  So we had ranked them, and so that it turned out my number one school was Radcliffe, her number one school was Swarthmore.  And when we got into all of them, it was like, I turned to her and said, "How could you wanna go to Swarthmore?"  And she turned me and, "How could you wanna go to Radcliffe?"  And the funny thing is that my father [James A. Batts] in his inimitable style had said, "You will go to separate colleges."  And we said, "Well, what about if we only get into one?"  And he said, "All right.  Under those circumstances you will be able to go to the same college.  But you will be going to separate colleges if you get into more, get, two of you get into more than one college."  So we, I mean we didn't like being told what was going to happen because actually what happened naturally is exactly that, our first choices were different.  So that we would go to different schools, even if my father hadn't said that.  But it kind of, sort of like, I, I kind of bristled at the fact that I was doing what he was telling me to do but for my own reasons (laughter).  He was very good about, you know, knowing what to say so he always came out, you know, in charge.  It's very funny.  I'll, I'll tell you something else about my father.  He--my sister and I did very well academically, we got all A's all the time in Catholic school and always wonderful deportment grades and everything.  And I remember some of our friends, you know, would get A's and then some Bs and some Cs.  And one of my friends said that her father said if she got all Bs that he was gonna give her something really wonderful.  And so, you know, thinking about this, you know, Diane and I said to my father, "You know, so and so you know got Bs and is getting this.  You know, we get all A's, you know, what are we going to get?"  And you know what my father said without missing a beat?  "Trying coming home with anything but all A's and you'll see what you get." (Laughter) That's my dad.
Speaker 1: And he produced two only A students?
Speaker 2: Yes he did.  Oh, it was really my mother [Ruth Silas Batts], you know.  My mother was the one who was there helping and everything but my father was the one with the expectations.
Story_ID: 467878
Speaker 1: So did your sister attend Swarthmore [Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: And you pack up and go off to Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And on the way to Radcliffe, do you have any idea what you think you are gonna major in and what you think your life's gonna look like after you--
Speaker 2: Uh--
Speaker 1: --have completed your college education?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Because I didn't go up to Radcliffe to interview.  I--the first time I saw Radcliffe was when I went up there with my luggage, my trunk, my parents [Ruth Silas Batts and James A. Batts] drove me up and that was it.
Speaker 1: Did you visit any of the other schools?
Speaker 2: No, actually no.  So it was all based on catalogs, not Internet, catalogs, hard print catalogs.  So, I, I, I'll tell you I was somewhat distracted.  First there were two things going on.  There was the realization that I actually was going to be away from Diane [Diane Batts Morrow] for a long time, because until college, I think, the most we had been separated was when I as a child would get pneumonia and I'd have to go to the hospital and the, she was fine.  So she didn't have to go to the hospital.  I did not like that.  I talked about how I had to go dance class 'cause Diane wanted it.  And I had to get my ears pierced because Diane wanted it.  It worked both ways.  I wanted to go to camp, sleep away camp, and so Diane didn't but we did both go to sleep away camp, Camp Oak Hill in Nottingham, Pennsylvania.  Wonderful camp, a all-girls camp, black camp.  I just had a ball there and Diane tolerated it.  So I just wanted to make sure that it didn't seem like I was always put upon.  I can give as well I can take.  But aside from being away from home and being away from Diane, this was just a totally new experience.  To top it off as a gesture of, of good will to my father, I decided that I was going to trim the hedges, which I had done before, but it turned out somehow I got contact dermatitis.  I think I scratched my arms on some of the branches of the hedges and developed a, a poison ivy-like reaction.  So I had other issues to deal with.  My--when I was driving up to, to Radcliffe I, I was wearing a short sleeved shirt and trying not to scratch and my arms were coated with calamine lotion and I was thinking, is this the kind of impression I wanna make?  Well, I had no choice.  So I was worried about my itching arms.  I was worried about being away from Diane.  And I, you know, was actually this is the longest we were gonna be away from home because my father had said that, "You will come home for Christmas but you will not come home for Thanksgiving."  I said, "Hm, okay."   Well, as it turned out my mother said, "You are coming home for Thanksgiving," and I did (laughter) and I came home for Christmas.  And I have to tell you I, some of my classmates from Girls' High [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] were also going to Radcliffe, two of whom were very good friends of mine, so I at least had that cushion of knowing that I went up there with people that I knew and I liked.
Story_ID: 467879
Speaker 1: And did your sister take that trip with you or she had already been dropped off (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, she had--Swarthmore [Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania] had started already.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she had been taken to Swarthmore and I didn't go.  I think my father [James A. Batts], even though he was a doctor he was judgelike in certain ways, "She can't go with you to go up to school, you won't go with her to go to school."  So and I was busy packing and stuff like that anyway.  So we did separate and she did, went to school first and then I, I went up that weekend.  And I was very lucky as, as I say.  I, I had friends from Girls' High [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] who were going to Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And we were actually two of us were in the same house even, so or dorm.  And I think the first night my friend, Gayle [ph.], told this sophomore that I was an identical twin.  And so this woman who wound up being my best friend in college and still one of my very, very closest friends had the devil in her.  And so she asked Gayle what my sister's name was.  And so Gayle told her it was Diane [Diane Batts Morrow].  So Peggy [Margaret Kemeny] comes down the hall screaming, "Diane, Diane."  And I'm thinking what the hell, and how could this be, you know, she's not--and then I said, she said, "Well, aren't you Diane?"  And so I said, "No, I'm not."  And, and Gayle is giggling in the background and, and Peggy is just being obnoxious and it was like, it was such a funny, welcoming thing.  I thought I'd escaped from being called Diane and then sure enough my first day in college I'm being called Diane.  It was very, very funny.  And I, I, I really liked Peggy's sense of humor.  I mean she was taking a chance 'cause she didn't know how I was gonna react to this.  But, and we became very fast friends.  It was wonderful.
Story_ID: 467880
Speaker 1: You're at Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] now.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Are there any other black students there?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes there are.  If I'm not mistaken there were--Radcliffe had a class, each class had three hundred students, and I believe that in my class there were eight black women.  Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] had a class of twelve hundred, and I think there were forty black men.  So, I mean not overwhelming, but for 1965 a beginning.  And there were upper classmen who were African American.  So it's not like this was the very first class.  In fact, there were generations of black women who had been at, at Radcliffe so that it's not, I'm not unique.  This was not one of the firsts, let's put it that way.
Speaker 1: Is anyone else there who we might know, either in your class or in the surrounding classes?
Speaker 2: Anyone else that--
Speaker 1: That we might know, any other black women that we might know about?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  Gail Snowden was not in my class, S-N-O-W-D-E-N, but I think she was a year or two ahead of me, and her mother Muriel Snowden had gone.  So that's one of the generational that.  Sheila Eubanks was a classmate.  Muriel Morisey, who is a professor at Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] now, was in my class.  Alma Harrington [Alma Harrington Young] was in my class.  Let me see.
Speaker 1: I found [HistoryMaker] Lani Guinier?
Speaker 2: Ahh.  Lani was not in my class.  Lani (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seventy-one [1971].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Was two years behind me but she was very, very, very good friends with two underclassmen that my senior year I roomed with.  So she was, that was Liz Wanbo Seaton [ph.] and Candace Allen [ph.].  And, and, Lani was a classmate and a very good friend.  So I knew Lani through Liz and Candy.  And then, of course, I have the pride and privilege of knowing her as this most incredible professor at a law school that just about might deserve her.  She is incredible.
Speaker 1: Which law school is she at?
Speaker 2: Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, so that was probably a stupid question (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it wasn't.  No, no, no, no.  'Cause she--I believe that she went to Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: She did go to Yale. And then--
Speaker 2: But nevertheless she has condescended to, you know, shed her light and beneficence on Harvard Law School and they are very grateful to have her.
Speaker 1: And I understand her father established the African American studies (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ewart Guinier, yes, he did.
Speaker 1: --department there [Department of Afro-American Studies; Department of African and African American Studies]?
Speaker 2: He was the first head of the, when it, when they created the department.  He was the first head.  It was an uphill battle for that man and he did valiantly.
Story_ID: 467881
Speaker 1: What did you major in at Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I majored in government.
Speaker 1: And why did you major in government?
Speaker 2: I, I think I--
Speaker 1: And also what does that mean?  In terms of a major, what were you doing?
Speaker 2: Well, government, is, is equivalent to what other schools would call political science.  I was taking policy courses.  I was taking economics courses.  I was taking government courses.  I was taking courses in international and city government, all sorts of political, it's essentially a political curriculum.  And I, I think that the ability to try and partake in, in the changes that were coming, and hopefully were coming, and I blame my father [James A. Batts] and this is so unfair I say well since I couldn't be a doctor I thought I might be a lawyer.  But in all fairness I wasn't sure what I was going to do until my junior year, 'cause that was a horrible year.  Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated in April.  Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] was assassinated in June.  And I just thought, you know, chaos, you know, law has got to, you know, be the way to do things you cannot have murder and things like that.  So I, I thought that law, if it wasn't the way it should be, could be the vehicle to be getting into a fairer society.  And so I think by default I wound up in law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] after that.
Story_ID: 467882
Speaker 1: And did you, did lawyers who proceeded you like Constance Baker Motley--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --and Thurgood Marshall, did they influence you to feel that working through the law would enable you to make changes that would affect people on the ground?
Speaker 2: Well, I have to say that they are giants in the legal field, in the civil rights field.  And I never really, really even thought of them as, as role models they were just so up there in, in, in the celestial area.  But I, I will tell you something that Connie Motley did directly.  When I was in my, I, I think my, the end of my second year, beginning of my third year, Derrick Bell [HistoryMaker Derrick A. Bell, Jr.]--
Speaker 1: This was in law school?
Speaker 2: This is in law school.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: This was in law school.  He was on the faculty at, at Harvard Law [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and he was my third year paper advisor, mentor.  And he said, "Have you thought of clerking?"  And I said, "What is that?"  I mean, that's how unprepared I was for it.  And he said, "Oh, it's a, it's a wonderful experience.  I think you really should look into it.  And why don't you apply, you know, to Connie Motley."  So I did apply to Connie Motley and I, she was gracious.  She had me come down, I had an interview.  As it turned out she selected someone else but instead of leaving it there, she went to Lawrence Pierce [Lawrence W. Pierce], who had just come on the bench a year before, and gave him my resume.  And said he--she thought he might be interested in, in meeting me.  And so he called me and I came down, and he offered me a clerkship.  So Connie Motley did that for me.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I had no idea.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause when you look at Pierce, he's so similar to you in ways.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: I mean he's from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  He's now in New York [New York].  He's in the Southern District [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York].  It seemed like (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually he, he, he even went further than that.  He was on the district court for several years but then Judge Pierce was elevated to the second circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit] so that when he retired as a federal judge, he was a second circuit judge, yeah.  And he was in my father's [James A. Batts] platoon or whatever and he said he remembered my father saying every mother's son will go.  And that was, I guess, one of the things he had in mind or was in his mind the association of the name.
Speaker 1: Absolutely (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So that's amazing that, that whole thing.
Story_ID: 467883
Speaker 1: Okay, before I get excited about your law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] years--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --let's go back to Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: So you're at Radcliffe, you're majoring in government, and these assassinations occur, does that really solidify your decision that you're gonna apply to law school?
Speaker 2: I, I think it was the, the final cap.  Now, I have to also say that I was very active in student government at Radcliffe.  I was treasurer of the Radcliffe Government Association [Radcliffe Student Government Association], and then when the government changed from the Radcliffe Government Association to the Radcliffe Union of Students, I was instrumental in that.  And then I became the first president of the Radcliffe Union of Students.  So that I was president of the student government at Radcliffe, excuse me, first, second semester junior year, first semester senior year.
Speaker 1: And what kind of governance are you participating in when you're the president?  You know, are you making changes?  What, what's involved in that?
Speaker 2: Well, this was a particularly unique thing.  It was started by other upper classmen at the time.  Ricki Radlow and others felt that the Radcliffe Government Association was not truly an effectual government of the students and it was--so the--there was a vote to change the student government and, and rather than call it the Radcliffe Government Association which had a very active involvement of the Radcliffe administration, it was more a student government, the Radcliffe Union of Students.  And we wanted more autonomy in terms of making decisions about our lives at the school.  And we also wanted an opportunity to, to have a say or inform the administration of, of how we thought things that they were interested in or wanted to change we wanted to be able to tell them how we thought it would affect students.  We didn't wanna control it but we wanted to be heard.  And so, after a lot of back and forth, we, we wound up in getting student representatives invited to the board of trustees meetings.
Speaker 1: Which you later became a trustee (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, I think, yes (laughter).  I think that, that's really very funny.  What happened was that I graduated in '69 [1969], and during my first year in law school in 1970, I don't know if they were paying me back for being such a rabble rouser or whatever, but they elected me to the board of trustees of Radcliffe College.  I was one of the youngest trustees I think that they ever had and I served in that capacity for eleven years.
Speaker 1: Not bad.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 467884
Speaker 1: So talk to me about your law school, your decision to go to law school--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --and your application process.  Was it similar to college?  Did you apply to more than Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I did.  I applied to Harvard, I applied to Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut], and I applied to University of Pennsylvania [University of Pennsylvania Law School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I got into all three schools.  Yale actually offered me money and I was thinking that that, you know, would be a determinative, determining factor.  But it's interesting because Mary Bunting [Mary Ingraham Bunting] or Polly Bunting as she was known, who was the president of Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and someone that I had a lot of, of, of contact with because of my role in the student government [Radcliffe Student Government Association; Radcliffe Union of Students], I was talking to her about this that, you know, I was thinking, you know, I loved Cambridge [Massachusetts], I love--but I think I'm going to Yale because Yale gave me money and Harvard didn't.  And she said to me, "You shouldn't make your choice of law school based on money."  And so she gave me a fellowship for the first year that would pay for my tuition at Harvard and then let--appointed me as a, a essentially dorm mother or resident tutor for my second and third year so that my room and board were taken care of.  And so, she gave me an even playing field and I am eternally grateful to her so that that made money not be the determining factor.  And so I chose to go to Harvard.
Story_ID: 467885
Speaker 1: I intended to ask, on the Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] side--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --who were you attending school with that we might wanna hear you mention?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see.  My classmates, there would be Jeff Howard who was head of the black students organization [Harvard Radcliffe Association of African and Afro-American Students] at that time.  Charles, Chuck Hamilton [Charles J. Hamilton], Lee Smith [ph.], Jim Gray [ph.].  Oh, there are many, many more whose names I can't--I, I should have been prepared for this, I'm sorry.  Really wonderful young men who were active.  Harlon Dalton [Harlon L. Dalton], he was president of the Young Dems [Harvard Radcliffe Young Democrats] at, at, at Harvard.  Just an incredible group of people who were outwardly focused, feeling that they had to do something.  That they had to make a difference.  That it was their responsibility to make a difference.
Story_ID: 467886
Speaker 1: So you liked Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved Radcliffe.  Oh, I loved it.  Oh, yes.  I had wonderful teachers.  I had people that I agreed with, I didn't agree with, I could argue with, who would listen to what you said.  Who wouldn't, who would, you know, even if they thought you were wrong or knew you were wrong, would still work with you, would try to get you, and now they wouldn't just say, "That's ridiculous," and slam you down.  The professors, the section people, it was just unbelievable.  The variety of courses that you could take.  It was, I, I was just agog.  I, I loved it.  And I think that was one of the reasons that I didn't want to leave Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I wanted to stay and go to law school.  We'll talk about that later.  But I loved Radcliffe, I loved the academics.  I loved the, the jolly ups which were the dances that were held at Radcliffe as opposed to the mixers which were the dances held down at the Harvard houses.  A lot of fun.  I, I worked at the Ellis Settlement House [Ellis Memorial Settlement House] in Boston [Massachusetts], doing volunteer work.  And remember earlier I said that I didn't bake cookies?  I lied.  Because with these kids, I baked cookies.  I, we made cookies, they weren't my mother's [Ruth Silas Batts] Christmas cookies, but we made cookies and we did other things and I'm thinking, you know, I, I would, we'd make brownies and stuff.  And I'm saying where do I, you know, how come I'm doing this?  But I could read, and so I stay a little bit ahead of them.  And the kids were wonderful.  So I really enjoyed doing that.
Speaker 1: And otherwise in the Cambridge [Massachusetts] area--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --did you enjoy that?
Speaker 2: I, you know, I, I don't think that there was much that I took advantage of in Cambridge proper as opposed to Harvard University.  And there is a, I mean Harvard is such a big part of Cambridge that I don't recall, I mean as I said when I, when I did my volunteer work I went to Boston.  And it isn't that they, I couldn't have done it in Cambridge but through Phillips Brooks House [Phillips Brooks House Association, Cambridge, Massachusetts], which was the social work organization that, that matched you up with things to do, I got to go to, to Boston and to, to cook with these kids.  So I, I, but I, anything in Cambridge that was not associated with Harvard, I really don't think I did very much, if anything.
Story_ID: 467887
Speaker 1: Now this might be a premature question but I understand that you had your first, your daughter [Alexandra McCown] in 1978--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --did you meet your husband at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My ex-husband (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or while you were at Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or perhaps (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --was a first year student at the law school when I was a senior at Radcliffe and that's where we met.
Speaker 1: Did that at all encourage you to, I guess you were looking at the Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] money so perhaps you were willing to go off to Yale--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --but did he at, at all influence you to stay--
Speaker 2: Um--
Speaker 1: --along with the fellowship?
Speaker 2: I, I, I cannot say he was without question not a factor, I'm pretty sure he certainly was in the mix there.  But it was the, the, the realities of finances I think that, that really put me in a position to be able to make a choice.
Speaker 1: And Yale's not terribly far.
Speaker 2: No, it wouldn't have been.  But--actually we, we met my senior year but by April of my, I'm sorry we met my first semester in senior year by second semester senior we had sort of parted ways.  So he really was not a factor in having me stay.  And all through law school we were, were friendly but then did not start dating again until after graduation from law school.
Story_ID: 467888
Speaker 1: --Let's talk about law school.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) (Nods head).
Speaker 1: First year.
Speaker 2: I hated it.  As I was saying, one of the things I loved about Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] was the way that I felt treated as adult who wanted to be educated.  They didn't give you reading assignments for the next day.  They gave you this is what you have to read, if you read this you will keep up with the stuff or you read it at some point.  And you could go to class, and, of course, I was a goody two shoes so most of the time I had done the reading on time but that was my choice.  But nevertheless as an undergraduate you could go to class and still get a heck of a lot out of the lectures or the section readings even if you hadn't done all of the reading.  And I had no lawyers in my, in my background.  I mean this was new territory for me.  I had no idea what it was like.  There was no one that I had really talked to who had been through this experience.  My ex-husband obviously was going through it at the time but that, he was doing, he liked it.  So when I actually got there and realized that we were seated in specific seats, that we were to sit in each class, that the professor had a face chart that had your picture with your seat number, that the professor would decide whom he or she--well, no the she at that time was Justice Ginsburg [Ruth Bader Ginsburg], which I didn't even take her class which was a big mistake on my part.  So he would decide which person he was going to call on and well, I mean it wasn't as if, if you were prepared and felt ready you could volunteer, no they would just call on you.  And even if you gave the right answer, somehow they made you feel that you were wrong or they would keep challenging and pushing and pushing you until you were backed down or something like that.  It was almost as if there were going for blood.  I did not like that.  I was disillusioned and thought, you know, I should have gone to law school after high school, it was much more like high school than college.  So, you know, I would have been better off if I had gone to college after law school.  I just thought it was humiliating, demeaning, and unnecessary.  The other problem I had was that some of the professors were in love with the law, not using it as a tool or a, a process to accomplish anything necessarily within society but were in love with the, the logic of the law, the beauty of the law.  It was like it was a three dimensional chess game and, and, and they just enthralled and fascinated by it and it was just so removed from human experience.  My, my best class my first year was criminal law with Alan Dershowitz because he related it to the impact it had on people.  And I loved that class.  I didn't cut criminal law.  I got to the point where I was thinking I'm not even gonna bother to go to class and this is where my guardian angel, my best friend from law school, her name is Gwen Alexis [Gwendolyn Alexis], took charge.  She would come by, grab me and make me go to class.  Call me up say, "Are you up?  Are you ready to go to class?"  When I got to class if there was a break in between, she'd make sure that I didn't go home or something like that so I was there.  So, you know, it, it and, and she was just this amazing and is this amazing ball of energy and, and good will and thinking the best of everybody and extremely bright.  And so Gwen got me through my first year in law school.  I did not drop out.  I was seriously thinking of dropping out, but Gwen Alexis got me through that first year.
Story_ID: 467889
Speaker 1: Did you think that that 1L experience was directly related to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Perhaps in your mind but--
Speaker 2: In, in my mind, yes.  And, and actually some friends of mine who had gone to Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] all were loving it.  And so I was thinking I made a mistake.  Fortunately for me, Gwen [Gwendolyn Alexis] was at the law school.  And Gwen and I met and we became very good friends and we still are.  And having gotten through the first year, there was some choice in the second year.  I enjoyed the classes more.  I thought that the professors were, were more focused on the applicability or, or how it impacts on people or the effect it has other than being a wonderful, little logical piece on all to itself, and I enjoyed it.  And in my third year I was, they were mostly all elective courses and I took wonderful courses.  Race, Racism in American Law, Derrick Bell [HistoryMaker Derrick A. Bell, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Derrick Bell.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, yep.  And so I decided that I could make it through law school.
Speaker 1: And he's just gotten there in 1969?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you really kind of lucked up there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, that's right.
Story_ID: 467890
Speaker 1: And you joined the law re-, the civil rights of the--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --Liberties Law Review [Harvard Civil Rights Civil Liberties Law Review]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What was that process like?
Speaker 2: It was, I joined it the second year so that I, I actually came on as an editor and got to work with a couple of people who were hitting their notes and that was intense and fun.  And also an opportunity to have back and forth, you know, the I, I loved, I don't know if it's an actually debating, but I loved, you know, listening to what to other people had to say but, but taking it and, and having it influence, you know, maybe factor it in, maybe think about it, and maybe change something that I was thinking.  But I loved the, the give and take.  And it was really good.  And, and also I, I realized that I had an opinion, I had a suggestion.  I might have been right, I might have been wrong, but I felt that I should impart and, and then final choice was the person who was writing the note, in terms of what to, to do with my suggestions.  So I got along very well, you know, with the people and I, and I enjoyed that editorial ex- experience.  It's just, I mean fortitude I guess.  I was so disillusioned I would have left.  You know, 'I Get By With a Little Help From My Friends' ['With A Little Help From My Friends'].  A song written for me. And then, you know, running to meet Derrick Bell [HistoryMaker Derrick A. Bell, Jr.], he encourages me through the clerkship so, I have a wonderful clerkship.  And I, you know, left Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] feeling that, that I'd sort of made peace with it.  I mean not loving it but I felt that I'd made peace with it.  And then I started to practice.
Speaker 1: Before you go into practice, were there many women at Harvard Law School?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see there were, I believe there were about 679 in the class, the entire class, male, female.  And I think there may have been fifty women.  And in terms of blacks, I think maybe forty or something like that.  A lot of people from undergrad [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] went to law school so I met them again and had, you know, a base.  But they, they, there were not a lot of women.  But the women were very noticeable, you know, in the classroom.  Things like that.
Story_ID: 467891
Speaker 1: An administrative question--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --on your Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] experience.  You've told us about the blacks and women.  I was just wondering if, similar to your undergraduate experience [at Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] you would tell us who was there with you.
Speaker 2: The Stimleys, Pernila Stimley [Pernila Stimley Brown], Frank Stimley [Frank D. Stimley], Marilyn Holifield, Jim Ellis, Rich Baltimore.  I should be doing better than this.  Well, well Gwen Alexis [Gwendolyn Alexis], of course.  Oh, Terry Oliver [ph.], who was actually on court in Massachusetts for a time.  Vife, Vife Figures [ph.].  And I don't know where she is practicing, did I say Marilyn Holifield?  Because she is, she's from Florida, she came, she was a classmate of my sister's [Diane Batts Morrow] at Swarthmore [Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania] then came and was a classmate of mine at Harvard Law School and is now, a partner in a, a very distinguished firm in Florida.
Speaker 1: Did she come and say, "Diane?"
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, she didn't 'cause she knew, (laughter) she knew.
Story_ID: 467892
Speaker 1: You indicated that you went to Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and then you went to Cravath [Cravath, Swaine and Moore, LLP], a law firm.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: I would very, be very interested in finding out how you found the law firm experience (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, actually some of the best friends that I have from being a practicing attorney I, I met at Cravath and I keep up with them and they keep up with me to this day.  Cravath had this ability to hire wonderful people.  It hired a lot of people, didn't expect to keep very many of them but, you know, gave us excellent training opportunities, worked us very, very hard.  And people went on to become partners in other firms, forming their own firms, doing all sort of things.  So the Cravath alumni is a very distinguished group, let's put it that way.  I, I went to Cravath because I wasn't sure what I was going to do in terms of where I was going to wind up living because at that point the children's [Alexandra McCown and James McCown] father and I were dating again.  And so I thought that if I'm the one who moves, 'cause he was living in, in Boston [Massachusetts] and sort of commuting.  If I'm the one who move, I, you know, should have, you know, a, a firm that that would resonate outside of the New York [New York] area.  And Cravath certainly would do that.  So as it turns out, after we were married my ex-husband moved down here to New York so I didn't wind up having to move.  So I stayed at Cravath and had incredibly good training, a lot of depth in terms of the, the quality of the people, the helpfulness of the people.  The intelligence of the people.  And, you know, the sense of humor of the people.  I, I loved everybody that I worked with, not only the partners, but the, you know, the senior associates, the midlevel associates, I was a beginning associate.  Great, just a lot of fun.  A lot of work.
Speaker 1: What subjects matter, what subject matters did you focus on?
Speaker 2: I was, in the litigation department and I had cases involving antitrust issues.  Cases involving the, the networks.  Cases involving First Amendment print magazine issues.  Cases involving technology.  Learning about computers, working on the antitrust case involving IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  Working for in, in, in the, I had work on some financial matters for a accounting firm that was a client of, of the firm.  I had exposure to a whole lot of different things.
Story_ID: 467893
Speaker 1: You've already indicated that it was a, a good environment.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: What was the make-up of women and black people at Cravath [Cravath, Swaine and Moore, LLP]?
Speaker 2: There were--there were not a lot of women when I, I first came.  I was there for six years.  And each year the numbers of women increased and increased.  There were very, very few black people at the firm when I started.
Speaker 1: Any black partners?
Speaker 2: No.  That is the not the case today.  The only woman partner at the time was this incredible woman who I believe didn't actually go to law school but clerked and then took the bar and was extremely fabulous as an attorney and she became a partner.
Speaker 1: Did you have an interest in becoming a partner?
Speaker 2: Let's say that I don't know that anybody would have turned it down if it had been offered to them.  Although, quite frankly they were working just as hard as the associates were.  But I think that the thing that had me consider other things was that because of the, the structure of the firm, the way they have everything so well staffed that as a, a beginning or even midlevel associate, there wasn't a lot of, of, of leeway in terms of responsibility.  And after being there for several years, I think preparing and doing depositions was about the extent of my experience, and I had gone to my fifth law school reunion and classmates [from Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] were telling me about entire cases that they were doing, things like that.  And I thought that, you know, my definition of litigation wasn't the same as their definition of litigation.  So I was very fortunate that the opportunity came up to join the U.S. Attorney's Office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York].
Story_ID: 467894
Speaker 1: Now, I've made a great faux pas in not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) the clerkship?
Speaker 1: --asking you to talk about your clerkship.
Speaker 2: Oh, please.  That, that's no, that's not a faux pas at all.  I mean, it was, well, let's put it this way.  It was a one year clerkship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: About thirteen and half months into the clerkship Judge Pierce [Lawrence W. Pierce] called me and kindly said that maybe I should consider winding up because the next person who had been hired was waiting to come on.  And I said, "Oh, oh," you know.  And then so, so I left.  It was a fabulous experience.  My co-clerk Jo Ann Harris, one of my dearest friends to this day, she took the two year clerk slot with Judge Pierce.  So after I left, she stayed on for another year.  She went directly to the U.S. Attorney's Office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York].  And kept, you know, sort of pointing out to me the real work that she was doing, even though I was making good money.
Speaker 1: Well, I had wondered what was the money like at Cravath [Cravath, Swaine and Moore, LLP]?  And what was the average time period that people were taking--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --to become partner, if you were in fact to do so?
Speaker 2: Well, at that point, it was like nine or ten years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a very long period of time.  And obviously, there would be fallout by the, you know, the way side.  I would say this, Cravath was really quite conscientious about assisting people who wanted to leave, you know, to, I mean even help find things that they would be interested, no, they were really good.  I mean they knew that, they were hiring thirty people in the class and they were only expecting to make two of them partner, or three of them partner.  So what were they going to do with the others?  What was gonna happen to the others?  And each one of the people they hired were very, very capable, well qualified people.  So they were very responsible, and I will give them that.  But because of my continued association with Jo Ann Harris who kept egging me on, when it came, there was an opportunity to apply and I got a position and so I left and became an assistant U.S. attorney.  But the clerkship was just absolutely wonderful 'cause Judge Pierce, I remember him saying to me, "If there's one thing I want you to learn, is patience."  This man was the most objective, listening to everything, intelligent, intuitive, organized, but not bombastic, not telling you, you have three minute to finish this up or that.  He was just wonderful.  He listened, he thought, he came out with wonderful decisions.  He permitted us to be in the courtroom with him, I mean there are different styles, some judges don't have their clerks down there in the courtroom with them.  Judge clerk, Judge Pierce did have his clerks down which was, was wonderful.  So we had an opportunity to observe firsthand people who were really litigating in court and the impact and effect and stuff like that.  He would talk to us afterward about it.  And it was, it was just wonderful.  He, he gave us, a lot of responsibility.  He trusted that we would, you know, work as hard as we had to, to finish what had to be done in a timely fashion.  And he was just a, a consummate gentleman.  And a, and a, a legal scholar.
Story_ID: 467895
Speaker 1: Did any of the cases interest you particularly?  Or alternatively could you give us just a smattering of the subject matter?
Speaker 2: In terms of what--
Speaker 1: What came before Judge Pierce [Lawrence W. Pierce]?
Speaker 2: Oh probably, pretty much the same kind of stuff that's coming before me now.  Maybe there were different types, but he had civil as well as criminal cases.  There were cases involving admiralty which I had never even heard of.  There were, I think there were some employment discrimination cases.  There were some civil rights cases.  There were, I mean he had--securities cases.  He, he had a, a variety of cases which probably as I said not much different from what I am, I'm having now.  I think that there might be some fads that come in and out but there was a variety.  We [Batts and Jo Ann Harris] both got to work on both the criminal and the civil cases.
Speaker 1: This court is called the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Court [Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm assuming it's--were you in this same space?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, no, no.  This courthouse--
Speaker 1: Seems like it would be later.
Speaker 2: Yes.  This courthouse opened in 1995.  So in 1972, '73 [1973] the courthouse is the one next door 40 Centre Street, Foley Square [Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, New York, New York].  Beautiful 1920 building that, they're now refurbishing.  But that's where all, all the judges were, the district court judges and the circuit court judges at, in that building.
Story_ID: 467896
Speaker 1: So you apply for the assistant U.S. attorney position--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --and how does that process work?
Speaker 2: A series of interviews with assistant U.S. attorneys who were on the hiring committee.  Then they'd get together and meet I think that, I'm trying to remember now whether or not if you made the first cut whether you came down and met with the U.S. attorney, I believe that did happen.  And then after that a final selection was made and you got an offer.  Bob Fiske, Robert Fiske [Robert B. Fiske, Jr.] was the U.S. attorney when I applied and for my first year in the U.S. Attorney's Office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York].  Wonderful man.
Speaker 1: You were on the criminal side?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What kind of cases were you working on and was it in incredibly exciting?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I have to tell anything that you actually are in charge of, I think is exciting.  Anything that you're responsible for is exciting, whether it's civil or whether it's criminal.  I had some very interesting cases, some unusual cases.  There were investigations that involved international art theft.  There were cases involving tax evasion by public officials.  Cases involving, I, I guess one of more unusual cases that I had involved cows.  The defendant owned a farm where he sold cattle internationally, cows internationally.  And in order to be sold or transported they had to pass certain health tests.  One of the test, excuse me, that they had to pass was a, called a brucellosis, B-R-U-C-E-L-L-O-S-I-S, which if they had a brucellosis, they would not be fit to be sold or transported.  Brucellosis is highly contagious.  The defendant got around the testing by substituting the blood samples of the particular cows who were being shipped with samples from two prize bulls that he had, that he knew did not have brucellosis.  And this was discovered and he was prosecuted for that.  And, and I, that was a very, very interesting case.  It was, at the time that that went to trial, I was, I guess I was about, well seven months pregnant [with James McCown].  And the defense attorney opted to have a bench trial because I believe he put it he didn't wanna have a case about cows and milk tried to a jury with me sticking out to there.  Which was a concise way of putting it, and I think it was probably a good strategy.  So we had a trial just before the judge without a jury.  Wonderful crackerjack defense attorney.  Very interesting case.  I, I, I--that was actually the last full trial that I had in the office before I left and began teaching.  I learned a lot.  It was challenging.  It was fun.
Story_ID: 467897
Speaker 1: Is it a mixed office?  Are there other women, other black people there [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York]?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: I know there are other women (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There are definitely other women.
Speaker 1: --by 1979.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And there definitely are other black people and I wasn't the first.  And it, and as through the years that I was there, more and more women and blacks came to the office and did very well.  One of the wonderful assistants who was there before me Patricia Anne Williams who is currently a judge in, in New York State in the Bronx [New York].  Fabulous.  I learned a lot from her.  And there were just wonderful people.  There was a, an ethos there, it was, it was like a, a fraternity or community, a sorority, it was like a--everybody sort of supported everybody else.  I mean no matter how busy you were, if somebody had a question you would stop and, and answer or if you didn't know the answer, you'd take them and find somebody who did know the answer.  People would help other people.  If there was a mass of exhibits that needed to be prepared for a trial, other people were in there doing it.  There wasn't any of this, that's not mine, that's not my case.  It was like all the cases belonged to all of us.  And everybody just really, you know, chipped in.  It was, it was, just a wonderfully warm feeling.
Story_ID: 467898
Speaker 1: You're pregnant with your second child [James McCown] at this point--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: And you're still married?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How long do you stay married?
Speaker 2: My ex and I divorced in 1988, so we were married about thirteen years.
Speaker 1: So we should probably let, talk about your, how you decide to move from the U.S., the assistant U.S. Attorney's Office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York]--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --and go to Fordham [Fordham University School of Law, New York, New York].  Do you know that you're interested in being an academic when you're prosecuting cases?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it didn't quite work that way.  I think that, that the, the teaching bug started when I began practicing, probably during my clerkship because I, I was so angry that I almost dropped out of law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and therefore would have missed the, the wonderful legal career that I enjoyed.  I mean if I hadn't finished law school, I would not be a lawyer.  And I would, I mean I loved my clerkship, I loved working at Cravath [Cravath, Swaine and Moore, LLP], I loved the U.S. Attorney's Office, none of that I could do if I hadn't finished law school.  And I was thinking, you know, what if other people, you know, dropped out because they just found law school so intolerable.
Speaker 1: What did you bring to your teaching that was missing from your law school education?
Speaker 2: I think that I, I brought a sense of practical application.  I had deep respect for my students.  It was an effort, it was my effort, to make sure that I never insulted or humiliated anyone in the classroom.  That if the answer was completely off-the-wall, that I would still pose additional questions to see if the student might, you know, come around a little bit or move a little bit or come up with something else.  I didn't torture the students, I would, you know, if things were not going well.  And in fact, I actually said the rule is if you're not, you can have two not prepares.  I call on you, you say not prepared, no problem.  This happens twice.  The third time, you're in trouble.  You were supposed to come up and tell me in advance, don't call on me today.  So if you don't do that and I do call on you, you get twice.  Otherwise I started giving additional points for class participation.  Which could help if you didn't do as well as you thought you should, or as well as I thought you would on the exam.  So that it was worthwhile being able to participate.  It was a positive as opposed to a negative.  Also I, I, actually found that I was learning as much as I was teaching.  That each year that I taught, I taught property which was a big hoot to me because I didn't quite see that that was my area of expertise after being a litigator.  However, I learned it perhaps for the first time, I'm not saying, and then became so attached to it that when I was initially hired and told that I would be teaching property I said, "You've got to be kidding me?"  And he said, "No, we're not kidding."  And they said, "But you can change after two years if you want to."  So true to form after two years there they came and said, "Do you wanna start teaching something else?"  And I looked at them and said, "Are you out of your mind?  I finally learn the stuff.  I'm not giving this up."  And I just loved it.  And I, also I loved the fact it was a first year course.  So that I was hoping that, I mean that's year that you're either going to, to decide that you can do it or you want to do or you can't.  So I always wanted to have first year students because--and I also think to be quite honest that the Fordham faculty in general, did not have that search and destroy mentality toward their students.  So I think that was also a, a factor that made me happy to go there.
Story_ID: 467899
Speaker 1: You said you got that academic bug right out of law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Did you feel that you started teaching before you became a faculty member at Fordham [Fordham University School of Law, New York, New York] so when you're prosecuting and when you're in your clerkship, do you feel as sort of your teaching muscles--
Speaker 2: Well, actually one of the things that happened is that while I was in the U.S. Attorney's Office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York], I started teaching at the National Institute of Trial Advocacy [sic. National Institute for Trial Advocacy, Boulder, Colorado].  So I would teach trial advocacy to either students at Hofstra [Maurice A. Deane School of Law at Hofstra University, Hempstead, New York] or Emory [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia] or to actual practicing attorneys in, in, in Boulder, Colorado or in, in other places.  It was a wonderful opportunity to, to coach, to teach, and also hone the, their motto was you do not insult or humiliate, positive, constructive criticism.  And I think that helped me to develop the way that would be my approach when I was teaching full time.  And also while I was at Fordham, I also would occasionally teach in this trial advocacy courses as well.  And I, I, I enjoyed that.  But I, I think that the, the thing was, my, my, it was important that people not be turned off, it was important that people not be turned off or turned away from law school because of the methodology that, you know, the law was not the enemy.  It, it was the way that it was being taught.  And it could be taught in a way that people found challenging, but interesting and, and something that they could use.  And I think that was definitely what I felt was missing from my first year in law school.
Speaker 1: It's my understanding that you were the first African American faculty member at Fordham [Fordham University School of Law, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: I, I think that that's right.
Speaker 1: And if that is correct, does that mean that there were blacks or there were black adjuncts and other--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --some kind of faculty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Then you simply were not a--okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Right.  Because Fordham is a fabulous school in that it has both a day division and a night division.  The night division was taught by both the full time faculty.  I was full time faculty and I taught at night as much as I taught during the day.  But in addition, at night they brought in these incredible practitioners who would teach in their area of expertise.  And George Bundy Smith who is on the Court of Appeals [New York Court of Appeals] for instance, was one of the adjunct faculty at Fordham.  No, so I was not the first faculty member, first full time perhaps.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were the first black professor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I'm not even sure that--yes.
Speaker 1: You were the first full time.  My, my notes say that you were the first black faculty member at Fordham, which after a bit of spinning I decided meant literal full time faculty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Full time (unclear) tenure track.
Speaker 1: --as opposed to an adjunct.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think that that's right.
Speaker 1: Tenure track as opposed to no black presence whatsoever.
Speaker 2: No that isn't true.  There was, there was, George Bundy Smith is the first person that comes to mind.  I didn't know that there were others.

I am standing in red to the right of, of John Kufuor [John Agyekum Kufuor], the president of, of Ghana.  And standing to his left is Professor Tracy Higgins, who is one of the individuals who was in charge of the, of the mission.
Speaker 2: This picture was taken at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts in October of 2001.  Standing on the other side of my portrait is, at that point, Dean Robert Clark who was also a classmate of mine at the law school, who accepted this beautiful portrait painted by Simmie Knox of me at the request of the alumni group of the law assoc- of the law school, the lesbian, gay, bisexual group [Harvard Law School Lambda] at the law school, which commissioned the painting.  And as I said Dean Clark is accepting it on, on behalf of the law school.
Speaker 1: This is a, another photo of the event of my unveiling at Harvard Law School.  Again, I'm in the red jacket.  Dean Clark is standing beside me and on the other side of Dean Clark is Robert Keeton who was my first year torts professor at Harvard Law School.  He is on the, on the bench at, at this time.  And at the law school he was known as the Velvet Spike [ph.].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Fine.
Speaker 1: This is a gathering of my family and friends who attended the unveiling of my portrait at Harvard Law School.  Starting on the right, my--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Best thing put camera on, camera on your left is the same one.  You, you and the camera have the same left and right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  So I would just say--

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Left, yeah, good.
Speaker 1: First at my left is my best friend from college, Peggy Kemeny [Margaret Kemeny].  Standing beside her is my sister, Denise [Denise Batts].  Standing behind Denise is Professor Gail Hollister [Gail D. Hollister] from the Fordham law school [Fordham University School of Law, New York, New York] who came up for the unveiling.  Standing beside my sister, Denise, on the other side is Dr. Deena Nelson [Deena J. Nelson] who is Peggy's partner.  Standing behind Deena is Ed Williams [Edward G. Williams] who is Gail Hollister's husband.  I'm standing in front of Deena.  My mother [Ruth Silas Batts] is standing beside me and my sister Merc [HistoryMaker Mercedes Ellington] is beside my mom.  And then behind my mother is my daughter, Alex [Alexandra McCown] and behind, behind my sister Merc is my son, James [James McCown].  This is a formal portrait of the judges on the Southern District of New York [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York] bench that was taken in the spring of 2004.  In the first row you can see Judge Constance Baker Motley and I am sitting right behind her in the second row.

Story_ID: 467902
Speaker 1: We were discussing the adjunct professors at, at Fordham [Fordham University School of Law, New York, New York] and one that I was really in awe of was George Bundy Smith who eventually became a judge on the Court of Appeals, New York's Court of Appeals [New York Court of Appeals], which is the highest state court.  Another African American adjunct professor was Cornelius Blackshear who was a federal bankruptcy judge.  And in terms of the full-time faculty, before I left Fordham to go on the bench, Fordham had hired two wonderful and very different professors.  One was Professor Terry Smith and one was Professor Nick Johnson [Nicholas Johnson].  And since that time, Fordham has hired and tenured many professors of color, not only African American but Latino as well.
Speaker 2: How did you become a judge?
Speaker 1: This is probably not the normal path to becoming a judge.  I was very happy teaching at Fordham and enjoying the camaraderie and collegiality of my fellow professors.  And one day I got a telephone call from someone who introduced themselves and said that they were on Senator Moynihan's [Daniel Patrick Moynihan] judicial screening panel.  And I thought that it was one of my fellow professors playing a joke.  So I was trying to figure out whose voice was this, you know, and I assume, I assumed that they had disguised it, and I, I just couldn't, couldn't get it.  So then I started listening to what the person was saying.  And one of the, he said that, "You have come highly recommended, that many people who have worked with you, you know, have put your name forward.  And so have you ever thought of being a judge?"  And I, I, I quipped that well, you understand as a professor that what we teach essentially are judicial opinions. Many of them are circuit court or supreme court opinions but one of the things that I always regret is that there doesn't seem to be enough factual information or background before getting into a discussion of the law.  And so I would say to myself and sometimes to my students, that I, you know, "If I were a judge I could write a better opinion than that," but that's the only context in which it, it, you know, it had crossed my mind.  And then he said, "Well would you consider it and may we send you an application?"  And the next day I got a FedEx-ed application, and so I realized this may not be the joke that I thought it was.  So I filled it out.  I was interviewed by the committee.  My name was one of several that they put forward to Senator Moynihan.  I had the opportunity to go down to Washington [D.C.] and meet with Senator Moynihan.  And I recall getting into a very lively discussion about the Westway project, the highway, and, you know, it got somewhat animated.  And Senator Moynihan was saying, "Now listen Batts [HistoryMaker Deborah A. Batts]," and I was saying, "But this and that," and then in the middle, he said, "I think that you'd make a fine federal judge."  And so then he put my name forward to then President Bush, forty-one [President George Herbert Walker Bush], and I started through the process with his [U.S.] Department of Justice being interviewed.
Story_ID: 467903
Speaker 1: I went down to be interviewed by his justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] a lot.  I probably saw everyone in the group who was involved.  I, I know for instance that I saw--one of the people who interviewed me was John Roberts who is now the chief justice of the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  Another person is currently I think a dean at Pepperdine [Pepperdine University, Malibu, California].  He was the investigator for the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], I'm having trouble remembering his name, it's, I should remember it.  He was, he is well known and hopefully his name will come to me, but he interviewed me as well and other people, and I had very enjoyable meetings or discussions with everybody that I met.  And then when I went at, when it was over I would, I would hear nothing.  And so Senator Moynihan [Daniel Patrick Moynihan] on my behalf sought, you know, to see well, what's going on here.  And I think the response that he was given, which was then conveyed to me, is that, "We think that Professor Batts [HistoryMaker Deborah A. Batts] is a very intelligent, very nice person but her idea of what a judge should be is not our idea of what a judge should be."  So the candidacy didn't go anywhere during that Bush's [President George Herbert Walker Bush] administration.  And then when President Clinton came, Senator Moynihan dutifully resubmitted my name.  This time I went down to meet with the Department of Justice of President Clinton.  And they were extremely supportive and helpful.  And I met with them several times as well but in this instance, it was because they wanted to make sure that I would feel very comfortable during my confirmation hearings in the [U.S.] Senate, and so they, you know, even helped to vet me as the expression was, to prepare me for these things.  And I'm eternally grateful to them for, for their assistance.  And it must have worked because I'm on the bench.  The interesting thing is that at the Senate confirmation hearing, the only senator who showed up was Howard Metzenbaum from Ohio and he asked very, very softball questions.  And I think perhaps the hardest question he asked me is, "Why would you want to leave your, being a professor to become a judge when, you know, it'll be so much harder in terms of work?"  And, and I, I believe I responded to him, "My, my colleagues would be very interested to know that, that you think that being a judge requires more work than being a professor."  And then we just went on from there.  And I was nominated, I was confirmed, the, the senate judiciary committee [U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary] passed me and then it went on to the full Sent- Senate.  I was confirmed in May of 1994 and I came on the bench in June of 1994.  In fact, the day I was inducted or--was the day, was a day in Gay Pride Week in New York [New York].
Story_ID: 467904
Speaker 1: What were the concerns that the [U.S.] Department of Justice had about your [U.S.] Senate confirmation hearings?  So for what issues did they prepare you?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think that they, they, the, the term activist judge was a push button, it was like a hot button term.  And what they spent a lot of time doing was to help me develop answers to questions that were dealing with this subject, even though they may be masked as other things, in a way that I felt comfortable that wouldn't offend my integrity but would be responsive in a way that would be positive, let me put it that way.  So they, I spent a lot of time doing that and, and I think obviously, that one of the reasons that the Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush] administration didn't pursue it was I, I believe that they viewed me as an activist judge.
Speaker 1: Did your sexuality become an issue during the confirmation hearings?
Speaker 2: Well, I thought that it might but it did not.  As I said, Howard Metzenbaum asked me really very safe questions.  Nothing to do--he asked me I think he commented that it was a shame that my father [James A. Batts] had, had passed and wasn't there to, to see me because he had, he was still alive at the time that the first process started under President Bush. And he was very nice about that.  I thought that it might be, and indeed I was prepared for that because it had been an issue or a subject of discussion during my clearing process.  In particular, I recall my FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] interview for clearance.  And the FBI agents, one male, one female, very nice to me, looked extremely young but I assumed that they were the appropriate age to be FBI agents with experience.  They asked me a lot of questions but didn't really touch on it and then the question which is, "Is there anything else about you that we should know?"  And I said, "Well, I don't think it's any of your business but you probably do.  I, I'm gay."  And then there was a second pause and the male FBI agent said to me, "Is there anyone who can confirm that?"  Which I just broke up in laughter.  And then he explained to me that the reason that that was important was if I were out, then the fact that I'm gay could not be used to blackmail me or to coerce me into doing something that I wouldn't do for fear of having it revealed.  So I told him "Oh, yes.  My family, my children [Alexandra McCown and James McCown], my friends, everybody knows."  And so I, I thought that was a very funny experience.  That's probably the most direct experience about my sexual orientation during the, the process.
Speaker 1: And were you pleased to be confirmed then during Gay Pride Week?  Did it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I hadn't planned on this--
Speaker 1: --have a certain resonance?
Speaker 2: In fact, the wonderful chief judge Tom Griesa [Thomas P. Griesa] at the time was so anxious for me to come on board and get started, that he set this date in in June and I happened to note that it was Gay Pride Week, and I was pretty pleased, I thought it was a great coincidence.
Story_ID: 467905
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about being deemed an activist.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Had you participated in activities?  Being gay might be just an activity of, of this type and some--that might make someone say you were an activist?  What's the concern there?
Speaker 2: Well, in, in terms of activist judge, what they were concerned with is a judge who wakes up every day and thinks I'm going to make new law.  I'm going to make the law the way it should be, as opposed to the way it is.  And feared that I would not be constrained by precedent.  That I would use it as an opportunity to change the law in many ways.  I, I, you know, in retrospect now I think it's kind of funny because this was a, a code word also for a liberal because, it appeared that only liberals were activist judges.  But I think that subsequently we have learned that conservative people can be just as active, activist, if not more.  And so they were worried about my attempts to change the law.  And, of course, activism lives on.
Story_ID: 467906
Speaker 1: So in terms of dis-, judicial discretion, what do you consider your job to be?
Speaker 2: Well, in terms of cases, it seems that there are really very few opportunities to make new law.  And the--my job is to apply the law that is appropriate.  There may be instances where this case is, is similar to one case factually and another case factually and different roads are pursued in terms of the reasoning.  And then I have to decide which one is the one that should apply on the facts of this case, and then apply it accordingly.  There are instances where there, the issue before the District Court [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York], the trial court which I am, is a case of first impression, which is the term of art.  You can't find any other case law on it.  And at that point what you then do is, is just a sort of wider sweep of what is the most analogous factually?  What is the right set of legal principles to apply here?  And to try to apply it evenhandedly.  If, if I have an ultimate goal as a judge, it's to make sure that I'm fair.  That if I have any preconceived ideas about a, a, a case or a topic that, that is set aside.  And I am conscious of it but it does not inform the opinion.  My law clerks, I have three of them, and one of the tasks that they have in working with me is to sort of, I guess, you could call it a continuing vetting, to make sure that, you know, I have applied the law as we know it.  And, of course, obviously they're the ones who do the first drafts, and I work with them and talk with them so that I have a feeling that even if I have aired my views or vented them it didn't make its way into the opinion, and the opinion is fully supportable on, on the law or on my reasoning and has nothing to do with my feelings.  And I think that trying to be fair is the most important thing that I do, the most, the highest goal that I, that I shoot for.  One of the areas, and this is particularly difficult, is in the area of the criminal cases that I have, and my job is to sentence criminals who have either pleaded guilty or been found guilty after a trial.  And trying to work the sort of tightrope between the sentencing guidelines, which I am one of the judges who find restrictive and un- unhelpful but still something that has to be addressed every time a person is sentenced.  And what, based on the circumstances of this particular person, in terms of their role in the, the crime, in terms of their prospects for rehabilitation, what is the fairest sentence to impose?  And I think that, that my goal is to be able to sleep at night knowing that the sentence that I imposed was the fairest sentence that I could impose.
Story_ID: 467907
Speaker 1: Do you think that the sentencing guidelines overly restrict you in that--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) endeavor?
Speaker 2: Yes. I think that one of the things that bothers me is that quantity matters.  As an example, if you are involved in the sale, of, of illegal drugs, if you are selling, you know, an ounce it is considered a certain level.  If you're selling a kilogram, it's considered another level, higher.  If you're selling multiple kilograms, that's all she wrote.  And well, that may be an appropriate measure for the individuals who are active, actively involved in obtaining the drugs, knowing how much it is, knowing how much they're charging and, and, you know, paying for it, that's one thing.  But the difficulty is that, in many instances if individuals are charged with narcotics conspiracy, that casts an extremely wide net and you will get someone who had very little involvement, maybe their role was to drive somebody to pick up money to deliver to somebody else, but they will be hit with the quantity of drugs involved, even though they had no control over that.  And I, and I think that, that that is, is difficult to, to swallow.  Now the sentencing guidelines provides ways of, of mitigating some circumstances.  Like depending on the role, you can have a, a minor role, a minimal role, and that will permit point reductions in the offense level.  But I, I sometimes think that that just arbitrarily applying this number, no matter how much you knew about it is, is difficult.  I, I find that unnecessary.  I think that you should go with the facts of the case and whatever quantity of drugs or--another thing bank robber.  You go into a bank, you rob a bank.  You have no idea if you're going to get a hundred dollars or a million dollars.  Again, the quantity or the, the amount of money that you get is what dictates the level of your offense level.  Your actions are the same but, you know, if you were unlucky and got a lot of money and got caught you, you pay a heavier price than doing the same thing, getting a smaller amount of money and then paying the price.  I, I don't agree that that is the way to level the playing field.
Story_ID: 467908
Speaker 1: What elements of your life contribute to your judging process?  Do you take your cue from your clerkship and Judge Pierce [Lawrence W. Pierce] who asked you to be patient--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --and deliberative?  And then perhaps other experiences that you've had, do they contribute to how you process cases?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I hope that my life experiences do inform how I go about trying to be fair.  One of the things that I have learned is you really have to listen to what people are saying. You have to really hear what they're saying as opposed to just knowing they they're talking.  You have to give people an opportunity to be heard fully.  You can't assume you know where they're going and then shut your mind off and go on and do something else.  You really have to listen.  You really have to keep on open mind.  And you really have to be fully engaged because at any point, for instance, during the trial judge maybe, you know, called upon to make a ruling either an evidentiary ruling or some other procedural ruling, and you can't afford to say, "Where am I?" and come back in.  I think that one of the things that--for my teaching, for instance, I taught for ten years [at Fordham University School of Law, New York, New York] and I loved it.  Each year that I taught property I learned more and therefore I had to cut back and teach less than I would.  I think I taught the most my first year because I didn't know it as well as I did my third year and my fifth year and my tenth year.  And so realizing that I am a perpetual student, even as I am a professor, helps to inform me to, you don't know everything.  And you may not have approached it this way, you might not have used this strategy, you might not have used this theory, but this is what this individual chose to come with and you have to give it full attention and, and opportunity to be considered.  So I think that knowing I'm a perpetual student from my teaching days, helps me to keep open and waiting to hear what the whole argument is before rushing to judgment as it were.  I also think that it's important, the, the interesting thing here, of course, is that I'm African American, I'm a woman, and I'm gay.  So I encompass three different experiences, if you will, in, in our society.  And how that informs the way that I view a defendant or a plaintiff is, I mean, it, it, is there.  It does not influence the result but it certainly influences how I view the person as they're brought before me.  I think maintaining respect for them as people, even if they're defendants, really listening to what happened, how this happened, how they find themselves in that position, is, is really important.  And also recognizing that whatever sentence is imposed by me, if it's a term of imprisonment, that it not only affects the individual that is being sent to prison, of course, it affects the families of those individuals, the, the, the spouses, the, their partners, their children, their, their parents who may be depending on them, and so it is a very serious event.  Or when someone is sentenced to prison because the, the ramifications just keep ringing out and out and out from that fact that this one person goes to jail.  And this is something that I think I'm constantly aware of, of the impact it has on the, the family.
Story_ID: 467909
Speaker 1: Does your being black, female, and gay--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --affect the lawyers and judges who are in your presence or who come to your courtroom [of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]?  You know, does it--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --ever become an issue?
Speaker 2: As far as I know, as a judge it has never become an issue but if you think about it, how could one treat with disrespect or disregard anyone who is sitting up there in a robe whose job it is to make a determination either in your favor or not in your favor?  I, I, I can't conceive of the person who has been intelligent enough to pass the bar, who would then come in and make some disparaging comment.  I, I don't, whether the fact that I am all three combined makes people particularly careful, I don't know. But I have not experienced any lack of respect.  Certainly not from any of my colleagues, ever.  And not from the individuals who appear before me.  So I, I don't think it has hurt at all.  What they're thinking is another thing, but what they're saying and doing is certainly nothing that I can find fault with.  I, I also think that as a gay person, I have tried to customize some of the questions that are asked of individuals.  For instance, in jury selection I ask the individual juror that I'm talking with to define family as they define it, not as it's defined, you know, between a man and a woman.  And so I think that's another way.
Story_ID: 467910
Speaker 1: Another way that I, I think that my being gay, for instance, has a sort of like comforting effect, I always wear my Lambda earring every day.  I wore it to my confirmation hearing, I have worn it every single day.  What happens when an individual, potential juror is called up to the sidebar to talk about perhaps some delicate areas, questions or answers that you don't want blurted in a group of two hundred strangers, they get to see me up close and I have noticed that several people who are gay themselves have, have seen it and smiled.  And my hope is that it will encourage them to want to be on the jury, as opposed to trying not to serve.
Speaker 2: I'd like to ask you about that, the questioning of the jury.  You said that you encourage people to discuss what was family, for instance--
Speaker 1: (Nods head).
Speaker 2: --according to their definition.  How do you convey to them that that's the definition that you want and how has that opened up the communication in your courtroom [of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]?
Speaker 1: Well, I think, I, I don't know whether I can take credit for it.  I, I don't know whether it's a sign of the times but more and more when the potential jurors are seated and we ask them those questions out loud in open court, I have heard more and more about, "My, my partner, she," when the potential juror is a woman, or, "My partner, he," and they talk about their family and things like that.  And that makes me feel great because that is as it should be.
Story_ID: 467911
Speaker 1: And what about jury selection and this idea that people attempt to get out of being in a jury.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Can you talk about why it's so important to participate if you're called to jury duty?
Speaker 2: Well, it is extremely important.  I have a funny story about this too.  Judith Kaye [Judith Smith Kaye] who is the chief judge of the Court of Appeals in New York [New York Court of Appeals] did some major revisions of the whole jury selection process in New York State.  So job exemptions went by the wayside, everyone gets called.  I get called.  And one of the things that I find so frustrating is that every time I get my jury notice I set aside at least two weeks, don't have anything scheduled, go over, sit, you get interviewed and get rejected.  It is something that happens every single time.  And I, I think about it that this may be one of the few areas of the law that I have not been able to be involved with, jury deliberation.  As someone who gives jury charges or instructions and tells them what to do and how to do it, I would like to participate at the other end and follow the instructions that someone has given and another judge has given if I'm a member of the jury.  So that has never happened.  So I'm one of the people who would love to be a juror.  On the other hand I think it, it's clear that it is an imposition, it interrupts their regular life.  They have to not go to work or not to school or make other arrangements for the people that they take care of in order to come in and sit.  There's no guarantee how long the trial is going to be.  I have presided at three month trials, four month trials.  That's a sizable chunk out of somebody's life and their year.  And so it is understandable that this is not something that everybody is, is, you know, racing forward to, to volunteer to do.  On the other hand, one of the things that I find so wonderful about the jury system, and I am a great believer in the jury system especially in the area of criminal law, if you can get twelve strangers of all different backgrounds, who have never met or seen each other before the day they were impaneled as the jury, to agree on something, it is perhaps more comforting and making you think well this isn't a fluke or she isn't having a bad day or something like that, makes you feel that at least you've been heard, that these twelve people had to talk about it, had to come to a consensus, had to come to a unanimous vote so that whatever the vote is, I think it's, it's a little easier for either the government or the defendant, the criminal defendant, to accept.  Having a trial just before the judge, one person, who knows an awful lot about the case that the jury would not because obviously during the course of the, of the trial or even in pretrial proceedings, I will have made rulings, excluding things or ruling that this can't come in or that but I know about it.  Meanwhile if I've excluded it, the jury has no idea about it.  And so you have people who have been sheltered, people who have been protected from inappropriate things coming together and making a decision.  So why you would ever want to have this one judge who made all the rulings in the case before, up to now, be the one who decides whether you're guilty or not guilty, I, I, I just can't, I just can't fathom it.  So I am a great believer in the jury system because of the way the jury is structured, because of care with which judges give them the law, and because I am not, I, I, I've been on the bench [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York] now for thirteen years.  I am hard pressed to think of a, a trial where either, civil or criminal, where I didn't feel that the jury really did its job or took its job seriously.  Does that mean that I agree with all of the verdicts?  No.  But it certainly means that I think that however, whatever decision they came to, they dotted the I's and crossed the Ts before doing it and I, and I just think it's wonderful.

Speaker 1: What is your case load like?
Speaker 2: My case load is, at least starts out as, as the case load of every other judge in the Southern District [Southern District of New York].  I have anywhere from 375 to 400 civil cases and I have anywhere from 80 to a 120 criminal cases at any given time.  Knowing the exact number is difficult because as I work to resolve them, to get the trial finished, as I'm doing that, more cases are coming in.  So there is a constant flow in and out.  So that's about where it is.  And it does keep you, one off the streets.  It's a lot of work.
Speaker 1: What's your schedule like?  Do you--how early do you arrive at the courthouse?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: And how often?
Speaker 2: That's changing with technology.  And the reason that I say that is that even if I am home, I can be, and am working because I have access to my files and my, on, on the computer.  So that I don't have to be here in order to be working.  I happen to like people, so I do come here.  I would say that I get in on, on average maybe 8:00 in the morning and leave sometime around 6:00 or 7:00, often not having had a break for lunch.  When I am on trial, my days get longer because obviously I'm giving the trial its full attention during the time court is in session.  But those 375 to 400 cases are not sitting there waiting saying, "Oh, she's on trial, she can't do anything."  So I have to allow time to take care of all of the emergencies and all of the regular processes in the other cases, in addition to working on the trial and working on issues that have developed during the trial that need to be resolved.  So it, it, it can be longer.  I mean as an example, because I choose to teach, I teach a trial advocacy course in the evening at Fordham [Fordham University School of Law, New York, New York], the students from Fordham come down to my courtroom and the class is from 6:30 to 9:00.  So on that day if I've come in at 7:00, I work up until 6:30, I go down and teach the class, and depending on what the situation is, at 9:00 I may come back up here and do more work.  So it's hard to sort of give regular hours.  I also find that I wake up at 2:00 in the morning, 3:00 in the morning and I'm thinking about a case.  I'm thinking about how to resolve this particular issue.  I'm thinking about, you know, additional questions I should ask before deciding what kind of sentence to impose.  And my poor law clerks, what I do at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning is I call my law clerk who is assigned to that particular case, not at home, but I call their number here and leave messages on their voicemail so that when they do get in, they know what woke me up at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.  So I, I find that a lot of times the cases that I'm very intensely involved with, they stay with me even when I go to sleep.
Story_ID: 467913
Speaker 1: I know that you were the judge in the well-publicized case against EPA [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency] chief Christine Todd Whitman.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: I don't know if you can discuss that case but could you discuss some of your most exciting or interesting cases?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting because the pat- but true answer is that every single one of my cases is very interesting.  I could have employment discrimination.  I could have thirty employment discrimination cases but the individuals who allege they were discriminated against, are very different.  The factual pattern is very different.  The place that they work is very different.  So that each one, it's like starting anew.  So I, I, even I have developed a love of admiralty cases, which one would think is, is, is not unusual but it sort of I think equates to my found devotion to property after I had to learn it.  But I, I--just getting back to something about the, the work day.  I mean one of the things that's nice is if you need to get off of something, you can go work on another case.  There's also something that has to be done.  It, it is a way to refresh and to distract so that you can work on something else, and then when you go back, you, you are sort of reenergized.  But as I say, what, what I consider my favorite cases, other people may not.  In, in terms of the case where individuals who were down here in this area in, on September 11, 2001 [9/11] and subsequently who were suing for health reasons, I am not in a position to talk about that case because it is currently before the Court of Appeals [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit].  I--my, my favorite case is a case that may be surprising.  It was a civil case, it did not go to trial, it was on the eve of trial but it did not go to trial because the parties literally came in here and worked it out and I worked with them settling back and forth.  The plaintiff was Charles Barkley and he was suing a camera company because they had taken his image and were using it to advertise their camera without his permission, without licensing from him.  And we got that case settled.  And the, the thing that was interesting is, is it kept getting bandied around because the plaintiff was not available because he was in the playoffs or something like that.  So we keep having to move it.  And so finally, it got to the point where he could attend, and so we had one final settlement conference on a Thursday or Friday before the Monday trial and Charles Barkley flew in from California, and there he was standing in the courtroom and it was just amazing to see him in person.  It was actually amazing to see him in clothes also because he was not wearing his basketball uniform.  And he really participated in that settlement.  He was extremely reasonable, the other side was reasonable, and so it was the trial that didn't happen because settlement occurred.  But that opportunity to see or meet and actually work with Charles Barkley makes that my favorite case.
Speaker 1: That's sound terribly interesting.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: How did you find Charles Barkley--
Speaker 2: Uh--
Speaker 1: --in person?
Speaker 2: How--oh, what did I--well, interestingly, he looked even bigger to me, taller than he did on the television screen which I thought would really magnify him.  And he, I don't know what people, you know, he is extremely intelligent, extremely open minded, and I think just getting everybody in the same place at the same time was probably the biggest contribution I made to the settlement.  But I was fascinated.  And, of course, my son [James McCown] to this day has never forgiven me because I didn't ask Charles Barkley for his autograph (laughter).  So my favorite case but one of my bigger failings as a mother (laughter).
Story_ID: 467914
Speaker 1: Do you think that you would like to be an appeals court judge?
Speaker 2: Let, let (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or perhaps a supreme court judge?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, let me answer that question with no equivocation.  I have the best job in the world as a district court judge [on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York].  I interact with people.  I get to help settle cases.  I get to make sure that the cases are disposed of, either on motion papers or at trial.  I get to resolve a lot of things and, and interestingly in civil cases particularly even when defendants lose, they at least feel that they have been heard.  And it's, it is clear that they, that they feel that.  So sometimes it's just an opportunity to have somebody listening to what you're, you know, your position is how you view it, and to see whether or not they, they go along with it.  So I think that, you know, I'm sorry I just lost my train of thought.
Speaker 1: That's okay.  You were--we were talking about whether or not you wanna be an appeals court judge.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: You gave--
Speaker 2: Yes.  See I, I think that answers the question, because I got so involved talking about what I do now as a district court judge, that I forgot what the question was.  Thank you for reminding me.
Speaker 1: It does seem like it's the most interesting--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --level of the court.
Speaker 2: It, it is.  Now the--many of the cases that I decide, never get appealed.  So for those people, that was the final decision.  When people are not satisfied with the way the case resolved either from a jury trial or from a decision that I made on a motion for summary judgment, they appeal it to the court of appeals.  What goes up to the court of appeals is such a small selective part of the entire trial and pretrial activities that I got involved with, that sometimes if I were to read the appellate brief I'm saying, "What case is this?"  Because it doesn't, I don't even remember when that happened.  And I think that getting cases disembodied, has got to be less interesting than seeing it from the beginning and, and seeing it progress and, and knowing every aspect of it.  So, I, I find that the, the limited issues that the court of appeals has jurisdiction over is, is certainly not as exciting as what I get to do.  Also the court of appeals works as panels.  They, there are, there are three judges who will hear a case, will work on a case, determine the case.  So that that is an extra skill that I do not think I have the ability to work, persuade, or accept the views of other people, and have it come out as a decision that I participated in.  I mean, I guess, I'm being so, I'm being spoiled by my job here.  I'm the one who makes the decision.  I'm the one who, who does the sentencing.  So having to work constantly with other people I, I think might be a, a little difficult.  Now the upside of that, of course, for the court of appeals is that what they say, is the law goes.  So they're the ones who get to tell us what the law is.  And that is such an important function that helps us to know what the precedent is that we're supposed to apply at our level.  So I think that while their work in terms of the subject matter and, and involvement with the case is not as interesting, their impact on that case is very telling.
Speaker 1: Just quickly, you--several times mention this idea of being heard.  What's so important for people about just being heard, whether or not the case comes out in their favor or not?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think that it is an opportunity for individuals, whether it's twelve people in the criminal trial or eight people in a civil trial, who really are listening to what your argument is, what your strategy is, what your theory is, why you feel the way that you do.  They take that information, they decide what they believe is credible or not.  They take the law that the judge gives them, and then they come out with a decision.  And I think that just having had the opportunity to, to be heard is, is, is something that permits closure.  And I think that in many instances, if you can have closure because you believe that you have been heard, then you can move on with your life.  And I think that that's really very important.
Story_ID: 467915
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll just break away from the career for a moment.  We talked about your father [James A. Batts] earlier.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: And you had indicated that you wanted to tell a story about when you were in the sixth grade [at St. Carthage School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So I thought maybe we could sort of, we would just sort of--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --talk about that.
Speaker 2: As I said earlier, my father was not Roman Catholic but my twin sister [Diane Batts Morrow] and I went to Roman Catholic schools up through ninth grade.  When we were in the sixth grade, we were walking home and one of the nuns said, "All of you colored girls come back here."  Now, my sister and I just kept on walking because, number one, since we were both goody two shoes we knew we hadn't done anything that could, you know, have us recalled by this very angry nun.  But she said, "You, I mean you."  And then she brought us back and scolded us for rowdiness or whatever.  And we were so upset because first of all, we hadn't done anything, that we went home and told both of our parents.  And my father went up to the school, and without losing his temper, without being threatening, let's just say he set that sister straight.  And it turns out that when we got into eighth grade, she was our teacher.  And by the time we graduated, she was a really big fan, and subsequently as we moved on, we would visit her.  So my father took a situation of ignorance and turned it into a situation of alliance and then friendship.  And I thought that was cool.
Speaker 1: That sounds a lot like what you describe as a, you do also, which is to take situations and provide people an opportunity to iron them out, I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I accept that as a very high compliment.
Speaker 1: Fantastic.
Story_ID: 467916
Speaker 1: Let's talk about some other positions that you've held--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --that don't necessarily, didn't necessarily arise in order.  Can you tell us what the Law Review Commission of New York [New York State Law Revision Commission] is and how you served as a commissioner?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The Law Review Commission is a body of, I believe, six or eight individuals from all over New York State.  Dean John Feerick [John D. Feerick] at Fordham [Fordham University School of Law, New York, New York] was the head of the commission at the time that he nominated me to join it.  And our, our task was to look at these, the laws of the State of New York, and to see whether or not changes should be made that would then be recommended to the legislature [New York State Legislature] to enact.  So it was a wonderful opportunity to look at a situation, not that has to be decided in, in a week or something like that, it, it was a time to deliberate, to look into, to research, to discuss, and to come up with a, a proposal to make, to the legislature for a change.  I recall working on the question of whether or not to codify the law of evidence.  I believe that we also looked at the commercial code.  I, I can't remember other things that we looked at but it was all fascinating and interesting and intellectually challenging and I loved it.
Story_ID: 467917
Speaker 1: Now what about serving as special associate counsel of the Department of Investigation [New York City Department of Investigation]?
Speaker 2: When Mayor Dinkins [HistoryMaker David N. Dinkins] was mayor, there was a question about something that occurred in, in his administration.  And it was felt that the Department of Investigations, which is essentially under him as the executive, was not the appropriate body to look into that.  And so they appointed special outside lawyers to do that, and I was one of them that was so appointed.  So I worked with three other lawyers and I looked into the situation, and it was resolved with no action.
Speaker 1: We won't ask for details because it appears that you are specifically not providing them.  Which is fantastic.
Story_ID: 467918
Speaker 1: If I can next ask you about the Crowley program [Crowley Institute]--
Speaker 2: Ah.
Speaker 1: --and your participation in that.
Speaker 2: That's one of my shining moments as, as far as I'm concerned.  In addition to teaching property, I taught domestic relations at Fordham [Fordham University School of Law, New York, New York].  And the Crowley commission or the Crowley organization that year was looking into inheritance rights in Ghana based on a law that had been passed in 1984, and now this was in 2001 that we were looking at it from a human rights perspective because the law essentially attempted to codify and protect widows who often were disinherited by the family members of the deceased husband.  And so our task was to look into how well the law was being enforced and what its effect was.  We were privileged to meet with many heads of NGOs, nongovernmental organizations, that work in this area, women's rights groups.  We met with chiefs.
Story_ID: 467919
Speaker 1: Can you tell us more about Ghanaian inheritance rights law, and how you evaluated it as a Crowley program [Crowley Institute] member?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I was discussing the process and how we went about it.  We met with many different groups, women's rights groups, NGOs, nongovernmental organizations, working in, in, in this area.  We met with tribal leaders.  We met with the judges of, of the highest court.  We met with village judges.  We met with the president [John Agyekum Kufuor] of Ghana, and that was a wonderful experience.  So we, some of us got on a radio program, and it was so, it was sort of broadcast of what we were doing.  We went to several different cities and areas of Ghana.  We were over there for seventeen days.  And then we came back and all of us contributed to the report.  I, I think it is, it is fascinating to see something that is, is so fundamentally important and the law attempting to protect rights, when it comes up against custom.  It is difficult in many instances, for the law to be enforced uniformly.  And the, the customary marriage, the customary law, are at odds with the statute.  And so it's a, it's a difficult process.
Speaker 1: How did--so can you just, first perhaps explain, how the new law was to operate and did you find that people were able to avail themselves of, of inheritances after the deaths of their husbands, after the laws had been passed?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the law was similar, I, I probably should have looked it up, I think it's PNDCL 111 [Intestate Succession Act of 1985] but I am not, don't hold me to that, that statutory site.  Essentially--
Speaker 1: That's correct.
Speaker 2: Oh, good.  Essentially it protected the spouse so that she did inherit.  It protected or sought to protect the children as well.  It was probably similar to in effect our laws of, of intestacy, of, of how your properties divided when you do not have a will.  I think that the efforts of the NGOs and the women's rights groups to let, to, to educate women to let them know what their rights are, was just admirable.  They worked tirelessly.  They did all sorts of programs.  They went all sorts of places.  But I think that the difficulty would be, in many instances, if individuals were so rooted in how things were done under customary law, it was very hard to get them to change, especially if it was not to their advantage.  So I think that it is a law that is, is well crafted.  That it is slowly spreading in its influence but that it is not automatic in any way, shape, or form.  And that at least women know they have a law protecting them as they seek to pursue what is theirs.
Story_ID: 467920
Speaker 1: Now, I would like to talk about your portrait at Harvard.  Is it at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: At Harvard Law School.  And I kind of wanna just start out by asking if, when you attended law school or when you came to the court [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York], for instance, did the portraits of the people who were displayed have any impact on you?  Do you remember even thinking about the portraiture that you saw (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Do I remember even looking at it?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You didn't take--you didn't look at it at all?
Speaker 2: No, I, I think that the times that I would look at the portraits were when I was sitting in the library trying to figure out something and I would gaze up- upward and I would say who is that guy, you know.  And it could be somebody from centuries past.
Speaker 1: Did they inspire you?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't, I can't say that they did.  Now, if they were people that I knew of, you know, who were well known in the law then I, I'd look at it and say, "Oh, that's a good, you know, likeness, or they look kind or they look tired or whatever."  I mean, I would that way, if I knew the person but the, the portraits of the people from the 1700s and 1800s didn't quite move me in any way, shape, or form.  I was so fortunate the alumni organization at the law school, the gay, LGBT organization at the law school [Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alumni/ae Committee of the Harvard Law School Association] decided that they would like to present a portrait of me as the first openly gay federal judge to the law school.  They were incredible.  They raised all the money.  They had an array of artists, including their works, so that I could choose which artist I wanted.  And I mean, I spent a whole day doing that because it was just amazing how well organized they were and how much effort they had put into it.  At the end of the day it was unanimous and we choose Simmie Knox, S-I-M-M-I-E, K-N-O-X.  He is a wonderful portrait painter.  Simmie works from photographs.  He came to chambers and took several hours, taking untold rolls of picture of me in various positions.  Then he sent me, I believe, five that he thought were the best, and out of those it was clear which one I wanted and then he told me afterward that that was his favorite also.  So he, he, painted my gorgeous portrait, and I can say this because I didn't do it and quite frankly when I saw it, I said, "Who is this person?"  He could make Godzilla look good.  He has painted Justice Thurgood Marshall, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], Bill Cosby.  He has painted a, a lot of people.
Story_ID: 467921
Speaker 1: And when I went down to his [Simmie Knox] studio in Maryland to see the portrait just before he put the final touches on it, I had got to just sort of stare at all of these wonder, other wonderful portraits that he was, in the process of working on, on or had done.  And the man I said, "You, you make everybody look good."  And it was so wonderful because he said to me, "I can change anything that you want, for instance, if you want a different color dress under your robe, I can do that.  If you want a different neckline under your robe, I can do that.  If you want to be wearing different jewelry, I can do that.  If you want to have fewer gray hairs, I can do that, too."  And I said, "Now wait."  I said, "I have earned every single one of these gray hairs and they deserve to be shown, and if you do anything just throw a little more in there so I look a little more distinguished."  And he, it was just magnificent.  I was just so astounded.  It was just beautiful.  And the dean of the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] at the time was, a classmate of mine from the law school.
Speaker 2: I think I have that name.
Speaker 1: Bob Clark [Robert Clark], classmate of mine at the law school was the dean at the law school, and he graciously agreed to accept my portrait on behalf of the law school.  He was there when the portrait was unveiled.  Professor Robert Keeton, who recently passed away, was also there.  He was my torts professor at law school.  He was himself a judge, at this, a federal judge at that point, and I was just so honored that he had come to this unveiling.  Many of my friends, many of the members of the LGBT organization [Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alumni/ae Committee of the Harvard Law School Association] and, and many of the students at the law school who were in the LGBT group.  And then a lot of professors that I knew, I mean it was, knew when they weren't professors but when they were students.  So it was, it was very heartwarming.  And it was on October 29th, 2001.  Clearly, we were all still reeling from the impact of September 11th [September 11, 2001 (9/11)], and it was just absolutely wonderful.  The portrait was then hung for a time in the large classroom on the first floor of the Pound building [Pound Hall] in the back, and when I would go up to the school I would see it there.  And then it was moved to the front entrance of the Pound building.  So I had heard from many friends that they just said hello to me because they just saw my portrait.  So apparently, and, and it's, it's one of the first things you see when you walk into the, the law school, into the Pound building.  And I, I was just up there in April and it still is a, a work of art.
Story_ID: 467922
Speaker 1: Well, I personally happen to think that the portraits make a difference for students--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --when they come to the building.  I remember looking at the portraits in my own school.  So you probably motivate and stimulate students who are there, perhaps some who are like yourself.  Do you--
Speaker 2: Well, let me, let me just respond to that.  In, I, I recall that in my, in my speech thanking everyone at the unveiling I, I said, "I hope that you hang this in a prominent place because I look so nice and kind and good in this portrait and maybe it will fool somebody into applying to me for clerkships."  And so I, I had that in mind myself.  I'm sorry, so.
Speaker 1: No, not at all.  And have you had some clerks from Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  I have had, certainly had some applications and it is, it's, it, it seems to be working its magic.
Speaker 1: And did you tell me that you had a portrait at another place (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Fordham, Fordham law school [Fordham University School of Law, New York, New York] had a charcoal drawing of me done without my knowledge, and when I went in 1997, I think it was February of 1997 to give the, Noreen McNamara Lecture [Noreen E. McNamara Memorial Lecture], before I got there, up to give my presentation, they unveiled that portrait.  And again, I, I don't even know where they got the picture that the person was working from but I mean, I look really good in that one too.  And so I am hanging on the main entrance hall where all of the other charcoal portraits of, of, of professors and it's, it's really cool.
Story_ID: 467923
Speaker 1: Do you think that your being a black woman, gay judge bodes well for future judges of any of those categories?
Speaker 2: I, I would certainly hope so.  Our entire nation should be represented in positions of power, in executive and in legislative and in the judicial.  I, I, I think it's very important that everyone feel that their voice will be heard, perhaps by someone who may know something of what they have experienced.  So I, I think that it is very important to have judges of all minorities, to have judges in large numbers who are women considering our percentage of in, in the population, and also obviously LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender] judges.  I would heartily support any effort by any president to, to increase my number.
Story_ID: 467924
Speaker 1: Can we talk about some of the associations that you're a member of?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I have a list but I thought that perhaps I should ask you what you feel are the most interesting that you might wanna discuss.  What about the Metropolitan Black Bar Association or the Lesbian and Gay Law Association of Greater New York [LGBT Bar Association of Greater New York]?  And I would like you to talk about being on the Second Circuit Federal Bar Council--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --perhaps how you're involved in the court besides as a judge.
Speaker 2: Sure.  I, I feel it's important for me in all of my phases, if you will, all of my statuses, to support legal organizations.  So I am a, a continuing member of LeGaL which is the gay bar organization and the Metropolitan Black Bar Association.  I must say that I am not a member of any women bar association, mainly because there are many of them and I, I think that we are well represented as women in those organizations, so I don't feel that I, I have to do that as well.
Story_ID: 467925
Speaker 1: The Federal Bar Council the Inn of Court [Federal Bar Council American Inn of Court], is a wonderful program that I am proud to be one of the first masters in the program.  It involves senior associates, our partners in law firms, junior associates, members of the federal prosecutor's office at the executive level and also as just at the front line level.  And what happens is, is that we are divided into teams, the judges are called, are the heads of the, of each one.  So each team is headed by a judge.  And you almost feel like you wanna get colors because there is so much team spirit that develops.  And each one has partners at firms, senior level associates, people who have been in the office, U.S. attorney's office, for several years or are relatively new, junior associates, and just starting out lawyers. And the purpose--well, well, what we each do, each team works together and makes a presentation to give to the entire group, the entire inn.  And each month there is a different presentation by a different team.  And one of the things that happens is, is that, you know, you scratch a lawyer and you get an actor.  I mean there's just no question about it.  And everyone gets so into whatever role they are playing, that they do extra research.  They, they help each other out.  There are all these emails back and forth and calls back and forth and it's just amazing.  So that you, you find that the, the hierarchical aspect of it sort of disappears, and you just all come together as a team.  And I think that at the end of it, at the end of the, certainly at the end of the year, but certainly by the time your particular team has given its presentation, some of the awe and, and, and anxiety wears off and people get to know each other as people.  I mean several times my team has wanted to go out again, because after our presentation we go out to dinner and have a celebratory dinner, but the feeling was that, you know, we, we need to do that again because it was so much fun.  And it, it is.  Because I get to see litigants in a light other than standing or sitting down at a table where I'm sitting up there on the bench.  In fact, a couple of my former team members have recently appeared before me representing parties in trials.  And it's, it's, it's very interesting.  And I--because I, I know something else about them.  I see them in a role other than advocate.  And it, it, it isn't that it puts anybody at a disadvantage because clearly, I will reveal or state from the beginning to the other side that Ms. So and So and I had been team members in the Federal Bar Council Inn of Court together, so that you should know that.  So, I, I, I don't think that anybody feels disadvantaged by that.  But it, it, it is, it takes me less time to get to size up with the person because I know the person in a somewhat legal capacity, and, and it's just incredibly enjoyable.  And it's an opportunity for the judges to get together with members of the bar senior or junior people who are friends who have, you know, been in various offices with us.  It's just really nice to have that opportunity on a regular basis, to get together and see your friends.  It's just good.  It's wonderful.

Speaker 1: Are there any other organizations that you might wanna talk about?  The only other one that I have is the CUNY School of Law [City University of New York School of Law, New York, New York] board of visitors.
Speaker 2: I am privileged to be on the board of visitors at the CUNY law school.  CUNY law school is in a class by itself.  It is a law school of the people, by the people, for the people.  It is a law school that, that, that trains individuals to go out and work for nonprofits, to set up their own law firms in their neighborhoods, to be there to be lawyers for their various ethnic groups or their various economic groups.  It is probably one of the most diverse schools I've ever seen.  It has a caring and cutting edge faculty who are intensively devoted to the school and the students.  It is incredibly innovative.  It's, it's just a wonderful school, and I am, I am privileged to be able to sit on the board of visitors. One of the nicer things about the board of visitors is that each month we have a, a, a short presentation from one of the, the clinics or one of the organizations that the students are involved with.  It's fabulous.  You get to, to find out, you know, and then you say, "Why didn't they have that when I was in law school?"  I mean that's the constant refrain that goes through my mind whenever I see this.  So I am very high on CUNY law school, and very happy to be a part of it.
Speaker 1: And can you tell us about earning a honor degree from, from CUNY?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't earn it, that's the whole thing.  I didn't do anything but I was honored by having the honorary degree bestowed up on me, and I was so pleased, so, so touched.  And that was even before I went on the board.

Speaker 1: Is there anything that we haven't talked about that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: Ooh, (laughter) that brings to mind my FBI [Federa Bureau of Investigation] interview.
Speaker 1: So let's hear it.
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, we're gonna bring it to light.
Speaker 2: But I, in this instance I--
Speaker 1: Was that their catchall question?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  But in this instance--
Speaker 1: Can you confirm that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: No can some, anyone else confirm that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm, I'm sure we can find somebody.
Speaker 1: That question was asked--
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm sure that we can find somebody.  You have just done such a fabulous job in, in coming up with these questions and, and helping prompt me, that I think that that's about all.
Speaker 1: So let me just ask you--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Do you consider yourself courageous for being, I'm gonna say the black woman, gay judge that you are or do you feel that that's at all unusual and, and at all courageous or would you consider it just fairly passe?
Speaker 2: Well, oh, wait.  But there's a big difference between courageous and fairly passe.  I think it falls somewhere in between (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In between?
Speaker 2: I was, I felt in, in a no lose situation.  I was extremely happy teaching at Fordham [Fordham University School of Law, New York, New York].  I was a tenured professor.   So whether or not the judgeship came through, I still would be a very happy person.  I think that to represent, to make a, a step forward for any of the groups that I'm in, is wonderful.  Obviously, there are other African American judges.  There are other women judges.  And I might say on the state level, there are a lot of openly gay and lesbian judges.  It seemed that the federal level with a lifetime appointment was a frontier that I was privileged to cross.
Speaker 1: That was such a good answer.  I, I lost my next question (laughter).  Because that distinction between the state and the federal, that's, that's very interesting to hear.

Speaker 1: Now that you've spent your career, if you had to do it again, do you think that you would have become a doctor or do you think that you would still choose to become a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Oh, that is a tough one.  I have to say I have been so happy as a practicing lawyer that while the impact may not have been as immediate as helping someone who is sick, and it may have taken a longer time, I, I still feel that I have made a contribution to the legal profession.  But I have to say that being a healer is something that I think anyone would aspire to be.

Speaker 1: And when you're finished your career--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --and decide to retire--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh.
Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That I was considered fair, a fair judge.
Speaker 1: (Pause) Well, finally we just wanna thank you for taking the time, and the extraordinary long period of time actually, to do an interview with us.  We really appreciate your work and we really appreciate getting to come and hear about it, so thank you.
Speaker 2: Well let me say that I really appreciate your work.  I think that what The HistoryMakers are doing is fabulous.  It is something that should be done.  I hope that as we advance technologically, every new form of preserve- preservation, when DVDs are no longer the thing, I hope that your entire catalog is transferred to the next, to the next, to the next, so that the work that you have done, incredibly intensive work that you have done, is there for generations to come.  Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you we look forward to that.
