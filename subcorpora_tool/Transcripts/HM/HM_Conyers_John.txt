Speaker 1: I'm Congressman John James Conyers, Jr., C-O-N-Y-E-R-S.  I was born May 16, 1929.  I am a member of Congress from Michigan, representing the Fourteenth Congressional District of Detroit [Michigan].  Today is April the 24th, 2001.
Speaker 2: And we're in your offices?
Speaker 1: And we're in 2426 Rayburn, House Office Building, Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 17243
Speaker 1: I ask five questions of everyone.  Oh, I hate doing this because we don't have much time, but I ask them of everyone.  They're somewhat 'People' magazine-ish, but--.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: First I'd like to know what your favorite color is?
Speaker 2: My son asks me that, regularly, about once a week, and I usually go along with him on his favorite color, which is green. But I do not have a favorite color.
Speaker 1: Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well (laughs) I have--I have butter pecan ice cream, which I--I--I shouldn't be eating, but that I love it, but in terms of a food, I like seafood perhaps better than any other kind.
Speaker 1: My father's favorite is butter pecan.  And then your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Well, I--I like the fall the best.  It's the finest time of the year for me.
Speaker 1: Favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: I've taken so few vacations in my life, I take them wherever I am.  I--I don't--I don't need to plan a vacation.  To me, taking days off, in any pleasant environment, even in your own city or in your own house, is a vacation for me.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Story_ID: 17244
Speaker 1: Favorite music, I'm glad you ask.
Speaker 2: Oh favorite--yes, favorite music, (laughing) I'm sorry.  I should--that's a shame--that's right.
Speaker 1: Because as a jazz aficionado, I get a chance to talk about jazz, America's indigenous music, which I am--I have come to--the more I know and learn about it, the more I'm impressed with the--all of the creative modern artists in jazz because there are so many variations that lead up to John Coltrane and come down to Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie and Milt Jackson [vibraphonist] and Paul Chambers [bassist] and Max Roach [drummer] and those great creators of music in a period that we now begin to appreciate, cannot be replicated.  We keep looking for, but now we're beginning to realize that that was a period of history you can't just say, "Well, where--why aren't the young kids doing more than that?"  It's all we can do now to replicate that bebop era in which the creative spark was so alive and people were creating the kind of music that can't be brought back to life.  All we can do is imitate it now.
Speaker 2: What did you think of the Ken Burns [documentary filmmaker] series ['Jazz']--did you--?
Speaker 1: I thought it was good--oh yeah.  And I get invited--I did the--a joint resolution on jazz that passed the [U.S.] House [of Representatives] and the [U.S.] Senate.  I never knew there were so many jazz enthusiasts in the Congress and--so I get invited to all of the national educators' things and the International Jazz Associations [sic, International Association for Jazz Education] and I'm with the jazz musicians.  And Bill Cosby [comedian], who is another serious jazz enthusiast and I communicate and meet and end up at these events together frequently.  We work with Wynton Marsalis and all of the opera--the Avery Fisher Hall [concert hall] and all the folks up there doing such great work, and so it's my pleasure to know many of the former jazz musicians that aren't with us now.  And I'm learning about many of the young musicians that are coming up in their place.  And Ken Burns did an excellent job.  He was the key speaker, keynote speaker, at the--in New York [New York], at the--the Jazz Educators Conference last year, and we were together then.  As a matter of fact, I'm inviting him to the jazz forum that I present at the Congressional Black Caucus every year. So in September we'll be, hopefully--we have a discussion on jazz: where it is, where it's going, how people feel about it, whether commercial forces have been restricting it, and then we have--we have featured jazz artists that join us.
Speaker 2: That's fabulous.  Okay.  I was wondering, you know, what your thoughts because some people--some people were critical, but a lot--there were a lot of people who are very praising of the series.
Speaker 1: It left out, of course, the very year that I was most interested in, but after seventeen or eighteen hours, I couldn't, quarrel with that.  He did--they did such a good job.  It was clearly the product of many years excellent research.
Story_ID: 17245
Speaker 1: I'd like to start actually with your mother, whose name was--is Lucille--.
Speaker 2: Lucille.
Speaker 1: --Simpson Conyers.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Conyers, right.
Speaker 1: And I'd like you to tell me what you know about her and her family, because she was from--?
Speaker 2: Pelahatchie, Mississippi, yes.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (Simultaneous)  Pelahatchie, Mississippi, sorry. So I just want you to tell me what you know about her and growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I know relatively little about my mother's family and my father's [John Conyers, Sr.] family other than the exposure that we got.  I went south as a youngster, two or three years old.  My mother passed last year and we never got around to learning about it.  And I was always going to do the research and was encouraging other people to do it, but I never quite got there. And I'd keep lists of names of people in Detroit [Michigan] who knew my mother from her Mississippi days.  She left as a young girl.  Or that knew my father from his Georgia days. So, I--I was always around people that always gave me the impression they knew far more about my family and its history than I did.  And so, my mother was--I knew her brother, my uncle, and I knew her aunt.
Speaker 1: Roxie--is that Roxie Phillips?
Speaker 2: Roxie Phillips, who brought her forward and raised her, but we never--and her--she had another sister in--I think it was in New Orleans [Louisiana], that is still alive, who would really be able to talk to us about--about that history.
Speaker 1: Did you--did she ever talk about why, you know, she came up with your Aunt Roxie to Detroit or, you know, or even the early--did she share any of that with you or did you just--?
Speaker 2: No.  I think--I think--I don't think I just imagined this, but it seemed to me that she was sent up because she was a young, attractive light-skinned girl that they felt was going to get into big trouble in the South and that the only way was to get her out there early, and that's the impression that I got, that they wanted to get her out.  And then after she got there, she sent--had her brother come.
Story_ID: 17246
Speaker 1: My father [John Conyers, Sr.] was a labor organizer for the United Automobile Workers [labor union], so he got my uncle, Harry Simpson, a job in the plants where he was working.
Speaker 2: Now, your father--'cause you're named after your father.  Your father, you said originally was from Georgia?  Is that what you said?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Monroe, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Where in Georgia?
Speaker 1: Monroe, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Monroe, Georgia, okay.
Speaker 1: But the Conyers, Georgia is named after--his family was very proud of that--was named after the Conyers Corner, Conyers Crossing, or Conyers--which was named after the African American side of the Conyers.  There were white Conyers and there were black Conyers, and they were proud that the original Conyers, which grew and now is a suburb of mostly white upper middle--or middle-class people, at least, they were proud that that community name derived from our side of the Conyers family.
Speaker 2: Do you know what brought your father from--from the South at that time?  Did he move here--move to Detroit [Michigan] with his family or--?
Speaker 1: Well, let's see.  He was--he was the first Conyers here.  Others came.  His sister came, Mary--Mary--Mary Conyers, and I don't think there were any Conyers in our family connected here.  I remember that there were no schools for--for--for black children in the part of Georgia that he was growing up in.  And he worked in a barbershop, a white barbershop.  And he--he--he was always good with numbers.  He could count--he could count in his head faster than of his kids.  He was very good at that and he was very articulate.  And he finally left there to come--come up North to get a job, which is economic improvement, which was the major motivator for most people.  He came up as a young man and immediately got work in the plants and worked in several plants and became interested in the union movement.
Story_ID: 17247
Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents met in Detroit [Michigan]? Did they--did you know that part of the story?
Speaker 2: Well, my--my mother [Lucille Simpson Conyers] was living and being raised by Roxie Phillips over on Sherman Street. We all lived on the East Side [of Detroit, Michigan] at that time, which was probably 'Black Bottom' then, which was the name of the area that blacks were relegated to in Detroit for quite a long time.  And it seems, I don't know precisely, but he met her in that connection in this community.
Speaker 1: And they--and so you--in the family, there was your sister, Dorothy [Conyers], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then you're the oldest boy?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay. And then there's--go through the other siblings.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Then there was Carl [Conyers] and then Nathan [Conyers] and then William [Conyers].  So, there were five of us originally. Only Nathan and I are surviving now.
Speaker 1: And both of you are lawyers?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 17248
Speaker 1: My father [John Conyers, Sr.] fostered this legal thing.  He admired lawyers and defense lawyers.  I remember the Sweet case [murder trial of Detroit, Michigan doctor Ossian Sweet], Ossian Sweet--in which the famous lawyer came in to defend him--who was living in a formerly all-white neighborhood on the East Side [Detroit, Michigan], and he shot and killed people who were trying to attack him in his family and his home.  And they brought in Clarence Darrow [attorney], and my father always was an advocate himself in the Union.  And he read profusely.  The first time I ever remember seeing anything about [William] Shakespeare, he was reading it.  He had books on Clarence Darrow and lawyers.  So we all grew up, more or less, with an inclination toward being a lawyer. And my brother, Carl [Conyers], wanted to be a lawyer.  My brother, William [Conyers] was a--was a--was in law school when he passed away.  And my other brother [Nathan] became a lawyer right after me.  As a matter of fact, he was--he decided on becoming a lawyer even before I did.  So the legal thing and the representing people that needed a spokesperson was instilled in us very early on.  We went to all the local union meetings and union picnics and the Christmas events at Chrysler  UAW [United Automobile Workers] Local 7, which was, at that time, the biggest employer in the city.  And so we got this idea of representing working people and speaking out on their behalf and so he--he liked that.  We were--formed the--he did--I did a little legal work for them.  They formed in Detroit, the Trade Union Leadership Council, and A. Phillip Randolph [labor activist] was a frequent guest of ours and the only time I ever saw the great writer from from Harlem [New York]--.
Speaker 2: Langston Hughes?
Speaker 1: Langston Hughes, was at the Trade Union Leadership Council, which was for predominantly African American labor people and their friends, but there were many white labor supporters and friends in there as well.
Speaker 2: Now when did your father get involved with the unions?  Was it almost immediate?  I mean, I had read that the incident was that he found out, right?  Tell the incident, that why he was so interested in unions.  He was working at Chrysler [Corporation], right?  And found out that, or this is what I read, that a white person was getting paid ten cents--ten cents an hour more than he was, at least that's what I read in the--is that true?
Speaker 1: I don't--I don't know about that.  But I've got a book--one of my former staffers, Carla Van, who is now out at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], came across a book about blacks and the unions in Detroit.  It's out of print and he found it at a used bookstore.  It had pictures of my father.  I think I've got it right over there.  And he--he was one of the early organizers of the union.  And they, of course, unions were prohibited in the automobile plants, and you had to wear your--if you--you had a union pin.  If you joined the union you had to wear it inside on your t-shirt and cover it.  It couldn't be seen.  And when they found somebody that was in the union, and they had on a pin, they would fire them immediately. But they would always say they would beat them up first before they fired them.  It was very serious business.  It was like an undercover political movement and finally of course, they organized in Flint [Michigan], the first UAW automobile local. And then they went to, I believe it was Chrysler, itself, was the second.  And then they all went to the Ford [Motor Corporation] Local 600 [United Automobile Workers] to organize that, which there was huge violence.  There was violence in all of these things even though we had finally passed a labor law to allow collective bargaining.
Speaker 2: Now was this--was this happening primarily as you were growing up, sir?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, this was happening? He was-- (unclear)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) In the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) the whole time.
Speaker 1: In the '30s [1930s].
Story_ID: 17249
Speaker 1: If you could share like two or three stories of your growing up.  Just two or three, you know, fond memories or things that sort of, you know, family life--.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Or friends or anything.  Could you do that?
Speaker 2: Well, the one thing that comes to mind right away was the race riots of 1943 in Detroit [Michigan], which my father [John Conyers, Sr.] went downtown to get my suit from Harry Suffrins's and almost got killed.  We took the streetcar down;  we didn't own an automobile.  And the riots were get--it started building up and we were really worried and he got chased and we finally--he finally survived.  But that was really--had the whole family in a panic, and we'll never forget that.  That overshadowed my graduation from the eighth grade in a very large way because picking up that suit almost cost him his life.  It was a very bloody riot, of course.
Speaker 1: Different from the riot in the sixties [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Well, not that much different.  That was a very bloody riot too [in 1967].  Incredible riot.  One of the--the author [John Richard Hersey] that interviewed me that did the something motel ['The Algiers Motel Incident'] of how the police came in and arrested and shot up everybody.  And we had people talking about--you'd go to police stations and they were, there was blood coming out from under the doors where they were beating people and killing people ruthlessly.  And this famous writer came in and wrote a book.  It was called the something motel .  It was quite--quite a book, and it really documented the hatred and the violence.
Story_ID: 17250
Speaker 1: I want to got back to the childhood memories.  Can you give me two others that, you know, either family life or friends or anything else that, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [John Conyers, Sr.] was the manager of the Chrysler [Corporation] baseball team.  They had a black team and a white team.  They couldn't play together.  They had a black league and a white league.  And he was the manager and he taught us how to play ball and how to scoop up balls and we all had mitts and gloves and I actually played on a local team.  And it got us interested in coordination.  And whenever we went on picnics on July Fourth or Labor Day, we'd always take our gloves and bats and the whole family, including my mother [Lucille Simpson Conyers], would all be there playing ball, and then usually a ball game broke out anyway.  And so I always--we always thought of him because he was always doing a lot for the team.  They were good ball players and had a lot of fun together.  I remember that.
Speaker 1: Anything else that you have memory of?  Fighting with your brothers, you know, or meal times at home or--?
Speaker 2: Well, our father was away a lot because he was an organizer and had to go places, sometimes into the South, which was very dangerous for a black organizer to go into the South trying to organize.  It was--it was dangerous enough going into northern cities.  He went to Cleveland [Ohio] and other Midwestern cities organizing, so we--we always missed him.  He was away from the family quite a bit, as a result of that.  But, I remember in high school, I began to get interested in music and I joined a band. I had a trumpet, which my father was very opposed.  He was afraid I would become a musician and he--he didn't want that.  And there was Grinnell's music stores in the Middle West and there was this beautiful trumpet that cost sixty-nine dollars.  I could see it in the window.  And they had this--the case had this blue furry--and here was this gold lacquer trumpet sitting against that.  And I wanted to buy it, and my father said, "No."  He wasn't for musicians in the family.  Although my father loved to sing and he liked to sing songs of Bing Crosby, and he had a good voice.  But he didn't--he didn't sing, he never, to my knowledge, sang in a choir.  But my mother said that well, if I'd be willing to pay for it--I think it was five dollars a month,  it was ten dollars down and five dollars a month--if I would buy it and pay for my own lessons, that it should be okay. And she finally prevailed.
Story_ID: 17251
Speaker 1: And so I got in Northwestern High School [Detroit, Michigan].  Betty Carter, the singer, was carrying her little alto sax around. I saw her the last time we were together, I think it was in Chicago [Illinois].  I, get invited to jazz events just to introduce people and many of the jazz people know of my deep support of the music and so I get a chance to be around a number of jazz concerts and festivals.  And Betty Carter, of course, started singing and she cut new paths in vocal creativity.  So I--I remember--I earned a letter in music, but I couldn't afford to buy the sweater or the letter, and so I--we just let it go.  But I never lost my interest in music and I played in a band, which I was the youngest third trumpet player. Buck Patterson and his something-or-others and (laughs).  I can remember, now--. And then I played in another band, a bebop group, just a group with Willie Metcalf who's still alive and playing in New Orleans [Louisiana] now.  But  I remember the first moment I heard Charlie Parker and Miles Davis playing 'Now Is the Time' on one side of those little pancake records.  The other side was 'Billy's Bounce,' and it was an electrifying moment.  My whole idea about music was forever changed and I became a big supporter of bebop music.  And Detroit became--was a center for it because we had people like J.C. Heard, the drummer, who played with Norman Granz's 'Jazz at the Philharmonic' [live jazz recording series] which had Charlie Parker and Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holliday and so--and Dizzy Gillespie would come in.  And so John Coltrane would come in.  Everybody would come in.  And then, of course, the great Milt Jackson, the vibraphone player, and all his family, who are all musicians, grew up there.  And then the--the Jackson family from Pontiac, Michigan. We have the--wait a minute, we have the piano player, the trumpet player, the--I forgot the name of this musical family that were great.  And so we had all kinds of things going.  I remember I went into the Club Sudan in Detroit where Charlie Parker and Duke Jordan were playing.  I don't think Miles Davis--I don't remember that he was there, but I put my age up to go in to hear Charlie Parker in person.  And of course we had the--the one theater in which all the black bands, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Jimmy Lunceford [drummer], all the singers, Dinah Washington, Billie Holliday, Sarah Vaughan, all came through.  And every week--almost every week, I would be there absorbing this music.
Story_ID: 17252
Speaker 1: My mother [Lucille Simpson Conyers] was the--the central family figure, which, to us, was perfectly normal 'cause many other households, the mother was the central family figure.  When I became-- when I decided I wanted to become a public servant and run for [U.S.] Congress, it was my mother who was totally behind me, and my father [John Conyers, Sr.] was very cautious about this huge step because I had never run for any other office and to start out running for Congress seemed to him a little bit improbable. And he was--he wanted to slow this thing down. And he finally came around and was very instrumental in me getting the co-endorsement from the United Automobile Workers [labor union], which was very critical because my first election in the primary, which was tantamount to victory in most cities where there's a large African American population, that was critical, and I won it by 128 votes.  So, it was--and I campaigned for a year.  I was in private practice then and I stopped doing everything to--to run for Congress.  I believed I could win.  And I had worked for the former Congressman in the district who had then moved into, down river, to another area, and so I actually knew more about the make-up of the district and the organizations and the churches than anybody else running because I had represented--I was representing the [U.S.] Congressman John Dingell, who had been there before me.
Speaker 2: That's a wonderful story.
Speaker 1: And now he is the Dean of the Congress, and I'm the number two person in the Congress and the Dean of the Congressional Black Caucus, it just so happened that way.
Speaker 2: That's amazing.
Speaker 1: It is--.
Speaker 2: You've had an amazing career.  And your father had reason for reservation, but look, you won. See (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's right.
Story_ID: 17253
Speaker 1: You said when, you know, you first heard it [jazz], it was like, you know, you hadn't heard anything like that before?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: I'm wondering how--what was it that appealed to you?  How did it make you feel?  Or what did you find so fascinating about this music?
Speaker 2: Well, the boldness of the improvisation.  You see, the reason they--Ken Burns [filmmaker] raised up, repeatedly Louis Armstrong so much [in documentary series 'Jazz'], is that Louis Armstrong--and I used to wonder why Dizzy Gillespie praised Louis Armstrong so much, because to me it was an old-fashioned music.  But--but then I began to learn--I went on--we went on missions with Dizzy Gillespie and James Moody [saxophonist] to Africa, through USIA [United States Information Agency], the Information Agency, and where Dizzy was--and he was always talking about Louis Armstrong, and I couldn't--I didn't get it.  I--he wasn't talking, now he would talk about Thelonious Monk and modern--but Louis Armstrong was it, and I just didn't comprehend it.  But I really--after you examined Louis, he was--he was doing improvisational music within the context of jazz as it existed in that day.  But what Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie did was take this revolutionary leap into bebop in which you--you either take the same chords or transpose them into more modern chords that give you a new facility to do things and say things in a way through your horn that were never done before.  So, to hear Charlie Parker, whose creativity was the basis for [John] Coltrane's inspiration--and he started off playing alto sax too, but when you heard these artists creating this whole new sound, it was a revelation.  It hit you.  There was nothing like it.  It couldn't remind you of anything else because up 'til then, nothing else existed.  And there had been a shortage of--of the material that's needed for making records, the acetate, and so there'd been a blackout of the records and during all that time, on 42nd Street in New York [New York], they were developing and perfecting this music that was so progressive that many of the elder jazz musicians rebelled against it because they couldn't play it and so there was a huge dichotomy created in the jazz world, whether you were a bopper or whether you were with standard jazz, the Count Basie, Duke Ellington, the music that had always been there before this music was literally created by these musicians and only a few--and they were all quite young, in their twenties or thirties, some of them even younger than that, who were bold enough to step forward in it.  The music created a division among the music critics who put it down as wild music, that they really didn't know what they were doing.  They couldn't consciously play notes this fast and know what they were doing and so there was all this furor, and they were constantly being attacked by the critics themselves, so the music it just--it hit--it hit you, and you began to realize that this was, indeed, something new.
Story_ID: 17254
Speaker 1: You went where to elementary school and where to junior high?
Speaker 2: I started off on the East Side at the Smith School [Detroit, Michigan], elementary school.  At the sixth grade, we moved to the West Side.  I went to Sampson School [Detroit, Michigan], and then I finished the eighth grade and went to McMichael Intermediate School [Detroit, Michigan] for a year, which was attached to Northwestern High School [Detroit, Michigan], and I graduated from Northwestern High School.
Story_ID: 17255
Speaker 1: What was the young John Conyers like?  I mean, were you shy?  Were you rambunctious?  Were you, you know, were you well-mannered?  I mean what were you like?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a person in formation.  I had a lot of ideas.  I was--I was not a gregarious, outgoing type of person that one might imagine I might have been considering the work I've been doing in public life for these years, but I was in development and I was asking myself a lot of questions that I didn't see many of my friends around me asking themselves.  One of them was, for example, why should I go to law school, especially when I came out of the service, got a commission in the service [U.S. Armed Forces] and went to Korea for a year, and I said, "Well, I guess I'll--most of my friends are in education.  I'll come back to Wayne [State University, Detroit, Michigan].  I've got the G.I. Bill [higher education financial assistance to U.S. military veterans].  I'll finish up.  I'll get a degree in education.  I'll start teaching."  And--but I said, "There's this law school thing pulling at me," and, "Why--why don't you consider law school?"  And my friends were saying, "John, you mean you would go to law school for three years, when you could have been out teaching, getting ten thousand dollars a year as a teacher?  What for?  I mean why would do that?  You could--you could be out.  You could get your own car.  You could move away from home."  And I was thinking, "I could become a teacher and seems like a pretty good life.  And why would--what is it that I'm going to do in law anyway?  I'm not quite sure."  So, all of this was going on in my mind and, of course, as it turned out, I had a much better education in the realities of the struggle for justice, both in the civil rights era--area and the economic area, because my father [John Conyers, Sr.] was a labor leader and we were constantly listening to employer abuses, mistreatments, firing, differential pay scales, strikes, hard times visited, difficulty of blacks getting jobs in plants. All of that was--was part of my education that was beginning to come home. And then when I got out of Korea, I found out--I kept asking myself the one single question, because a lot of people that I went over there with never came back. And I said, "What was I fighting for in Korea that would cause me to possibly lose my life?  Why would I be required if I were brought to the front lines, to kill people that I don't even know anything about. And I'm ten thousand miles away from my home.  I'm not defending my country."  And those questions began to--to permeate, and I began thinking.  I began listening to, of course, the Civil Rights Movement started up. And in law school, Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]--. And then because Detroit had so many churches and a progressive movement, Dr. King and Andy [Andrew] Young [civil rights activist] and Reverend [Ralph Abernathy], the number two man, who was originally the number one man, before Martin got there. They were all coming up, and I would always be at the church or event where they were raising funds, and I began really to see that what many of the people that I had even gone to grade school and grew up with and high school and college and now, even in law school, they were--they were disconnected.  They didn't feel--they didn't interpret what was happening the way I did, as something that was immediate, that something that I could participate in, that something that was relevant.  And so, all of this began to coalesce into the--the modest guy, the student and the young person who was--whenever he did something, I remember one teacher saying, "You're too nice of a person to be talking in class," or whatever it was, because, you know, "There's no reason for you to do that."  I never had a behavior problem or never wanted to drop out of school.
Story_ID: 17256
Speaker 1: I remember I took a public speaking course in school and there was this young teacher who we thought was very attractive, and we--and I had to pick a subject, and I picked the subject of [U.S. Vice President] Henry Agaard Wallace, Henry A. Wallace.  I don't know why I picked it now, but I picked that subject and I began reading about him and writing this long paper that was to be the basis for a speech, and--but it led me into the politics of the [U.S. President Franklin D.] Roosevelt era and all of the issues of the [Great] Depression and afterward, that you never really got in your high school history or civics books.  And all of these little things are like little steps along the path that are leading you in this direction that you had no idea that--I didn't start off thinking I wanted to go to law school or I had to go, and then after I got out of law school--well, it's in my senior year, I was invited to go into a congressional office to work for the [U.S.] Congressman [John Dingell, Sr.]  in the district I eventually ran for Congress in.  And that was a big step. And then the governor of the state [Michigan], John Swainson, appointed me a workmen compensation referee in where I was adjudicating cases between injured workmen and companies, and all of this was building into my political philosophy, a point of view that was separating me out. I was--I was then the protege of [Michigan] state senator Coleman Young, who none of us figured was to become the first black mayor of Detroit [Michigan].  And then, while I was a workmen compensation referee, [U.S. President] John F. Kennedy invited--he was inviting three people from each state to come to the White House [Washington, D.C.] because he was forming the National Committee for Lawyers for Civil Rights.  And I got a hold of my U.S. Senator, or maybe my father [John Conyers, Sr.] did, he was a--he was [U.S. Senator Patrick] Pat McNamara, who was the senator.  He had been in the Plumbers Union [labor union] and had been a councilman in Detroit [Michigan].  And now he was the Democratic senator for Michigan.  And we said we wanted to--I wanted to go to that and so it ended up the three from Michigan was John Conyers, attorney and workmen comp. referee; Damon Keith, who became an [United States Court of Appeals, 6th Circuit] appeals court judge in senior status, right now; and attorney George Crockett, who became a councilman and a congressman along with me. And we were the three that went from Michigan.  And I went to the White House for the first time and I remember it was so impressive, of course, former attorney generals and senators and congressmen were there.  But there was one point I was trying to raise with President  Kennedy.  They were taking photographs afterward.  And I said--I said, "Well, I'll get a chance to do it."  I said, "Mr. President."  He said, "I don't have time for that now.  We have to take the picture, and that's all.  Thank you very much."  And I was really outdone.  I said, "Oh gosh.  He could've taken a minute to just talk with me."  But, of course, it was busy and so forth. But I'll never forget that little incident at the White House.  That committee still operates.  I work with it.  They work with us on many constitutional issues right now, but all of these things were shaping my ultimate career goal, but nobody knew it.  I always tell the young people,  I said, "There may be a president in this classroom, a senator, a congressman, a mayor, a doctor. But nobody knows, so that's why you have to get the best education you can possibly acquire because nobody knows where anybody's going in this society that we're in."  And, of course, I'm a classic example of that.

Speaker 1: You were at Northwestern High School [Detroit, Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  And then you--was it immediately--did you know, "Okay, I'm going to go on to college at this point"?  Was that expected?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I thought I was going on to college.  The week that I graduated from Northwestern [High School, Detroit, Michigan], I ended up at Lincoln Motors plant working.  I got a job immediately.  My father [John Conyers, Sr.] called Nelson Jack Edwards, who later became the first black member of the United Automobile Workers [labor union] executive board that made all the decisions.  He was then just a leader, a UAW leader, no--he was an international representing--he had worked at Lincoln, but he was coming out of Solidarity House, the international headquarters.  And so, I ended up working--before that week was out, I was working in the--welding floor pans with this huge welding equipment with weights on it that we would spot weld the floor of the automobile together.  And--but I applied for college and they said--at Wayne [State] University [Detroit, Michigan], and they said, "Well, you're not ready."  I said, "But I have a college--I took a pre-college curriculum."  And they said, "Yes, but you--you only took one course of biology.  You didn't take any physics.  You need a lot more math and algebra."  And so they said, "Well, I'll tell you what.  You've gotta go to night school and then apply, and we'll let you in on a pre--, we'll let you in on a trial basis part-time at Wayne," which I thought I was all set.  Well, it turned out that there was very little counseling, and there was a very stated assumption,  it wasn't implicit, that "most of you kids are not going to college anyway."  There were a few that they had selected and they were mostly white, I must say in all fairness and accuracy, that you knew were going to college.  And there were some young black students and friends of mine whose parents had gone to black colleges or universities in the South, and they knew they were going.  I had a friend, Harris Foster, my best friend in high school, and his family had all gone to Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama].  That was it.  I mean his mother went.  His father went.  His big brothers went.  His sister went. And he was going.  And I said, "Well, no, I'm not going.  If I go anywhere--."  My father always said, "If you go to a university--," he said, "You're on your own now.  You graduated."  He said, "If you go to a university, it's going to be the closest one from this house."  Well, it just so happened that I lived one block from the cross-town streetcar line that went directly to Wayne State University on Warren Avenue [Detroit, Michigan], and so I knew that I, you know, that was where I was going, that was understood.  And so I was working days in the automobile plant and going nights to Cass Tech [High School, Detroit, Michigan], and then I got into Wayne [State] University, and I was--I still kept working, and I'll never forget one moment.  I can remember this fellow, as clear as I can--as I can.  He worked--I was working, I said, "Look.  This job is killing me." And I said, "I need something that I could study and I've gotta go to school every night."  And so they made me--and they transferred me down to inspect the motor blocks with this electrical instrument that goes into check the--the smoothness of the cylinders, and you had to read it.  It was no, literally, very little physical work.  But the fellow in back of me had to run, shoot water into--into the motor to make sure that it was waterproof, and he had to have boots and a rubber-proof apron, and we got to talking one day.  We were always talking.  There are so many stories to be told there.  But, we were talking one day and he started telling me about himself.  And he asked me, "Well, what about you?"  I said, "Well, I'm not going to be here very long."  I said, "I'm going to Wayne State University and I'm just here, you know, getting my money together and getting organized."  And he looked at me and he said--he said, "I know that story, too."  He said, "That's why I came here.  I said the same thing.  And he said, "I'm never going to leave this job."  That shook me. I could remember the discussion right now.  That--it was--he said, "Now, you start dating a girl and pretty soon you get married and then you'll have one kid and then you'll have--and then you won't be able to leave."  He said, "I know."  He said, "I've heard that all the time about you going to college and all that." He just--and he didn't say it in a mean-spirited way.  He just said it, "That based on my experience, you're not going anywhere, Mr.-Young-Sport-University-Bound.  You're not.  That's just the way life is." And that gave me so much more resolve, but it also frightened me because he said it so matter-of-factly.  He said it like, "I know what your future is.  You think you know what it is.  I know what it is."  He said, "Because that's the way I was when I got here.  I was just gonna stay.  And many of these people around here, they were just going to work for a little while to get some extra money or to get a car or to do this or that."  And that was--that stayed with me to this moment.  I'll never forget it.
Speaker 1: That's sort of amazing.
Speaker 2: That was a--.
Speaker 1: A wake-up call.  That was a wake-up call of the--the most important dimension, for me.
Story_ID: 17258
Speaker 1: You went there [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] for undergrad.  You were working still, then you got--you got drafted, right?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a very interesting story.  Because one of my friends, Harry Woods--still around, a teacher, may be retired now--he came to me and he said, "John--," we had all graduated from high school.  He said, "John, I want to tell you about a wonderful opportunity because you know--you know what they're doing in Korea and they're thinking about sending U.S. troops."  He said, "We're gonna get drafted unless we get in the [U.S.] National Guard."  He said, "You--."  He said, "I'm in it.  And I can tell you, you only meet once a month.  You go to camp two weeks out of the year, and nobody can touch you.  You've got a deferred status."  And so I went down there to the--to the big post office building in Detroit or Michigan at 16th where the 1279th  Combat Engineer Battalion trained.  And there were fellows I knew, and some of the--some of the officers were teachers, and it was--they treated me very nicely and I said, "Well, I'm in school and so forth."  And they said, "Well, that's okay."  I went out to the camp.  I joined and everything was working out pretty well, and then my studies got pretty heavy and so I came to--I remember this captain.  I see him at the reunions that we have every year still, Captain Harris.  I think he lives in Hawaii now.  No, Captain Matthews, who went to Hartford Avenue [Memorial] Baptist Church [Detroit, Michigan], a very progressive church.  And I said, "Captain, this is really jamming me up.  I really hate to say this but the reason that I've been missing some of the meetings is that I just have so much homework."  And he said, "Conyers, not to worry."  He said, "I can give you a honorable discharge or I can leave you on inactive status and you don't have to come."  Well, in my gratitude, I said, "Well, just leave my name on the list and I'll--and I won't be--I'll be excused."  He said, "Fine.  That's okay.  That's all you have to do.  Turn in your thing."  I got the letter, "Greetings. You are now activated.  The 1279th Combat Engineers are now activated, and on August 19th you are to report to Camp Lewis, Washington--Fort Lewis, Washington."  I come down to the--. I said, I remember the major. He was the second in command.  I said, "Major, if I can see you for a moment.  You know, I got this letter.  I know they've activated the group, and I got this letter about me being activated."  And I said, "I'm on inactive duty, so I think that--," and he said, "Private Conyers."  He said, "Sit down."  He said, "I was in World War II.  I've got a family.  I am an educator.  I have been activated."
Story_ID: 17259
Speaker 1: Now all the while, I had been explaining to all of my friends that were in the 1279th [Combat Engineers, Detroit, Michigan] that I wasn't going [into training for the Korean War] because I was on inactive status, and, you know, I would--in my civilian clothes, I would be walking--come to the last few meetings, 'cause they knew that this was coming.  And so when they heard that I had to go, everybody was so overjoyed that, "Conyers is going with us.  He's got to go, too."  And by that time, all the clothing was either too big or too small, everything, it was just--the--I was at the end of the line, so I had to take what was left. And they were so happy that after I've been telling them "I'm sorry.  I'm not going with you. And I'm in school.  I'm a full-time student at Wayne [State] University [Detroit, Michigan]."  You know, I was really feeling great about it. And all the way out there--we took this train. It was the first time I had ever been anywhere beside Lansing, Michigan or Toledo [Ohio]. And my eyes were--I couldn't stop looking at the United States of America.  I was seeing--.  And the train was as slow as it could be.  It took five days or a week to get out there.  And people were playing around and reading and I was just watching the farmland.  You come to a country.  "What state is this?"  "What city is this?"  "What are the people?"  "What's the factory?"  "Here we are at the Grand Canyon."  I was just--my head was swimming--with the first time I ever saw the United States, and it was--it was an incredible experience, so much so that when we finally got our first--I think after the first six months, you get leave and they said, "Are you going back home?"  I said, "Are you kidding?  I'm going to California."  I was in Washington.  I said, "I'm going to California.  I've never--I've been hearing about California."  And there was an officer there from California that wanted his car driven back down to San Francisco [California].  He would pay your way and so forth.  So--and boy, I'm telling you, that was a drive I'll never--I mean, it was raining and dark, I've never driven down this highway before, very tricky.  And I finally landed in San Francisco.  I delivered the car to his family.  And here I was at the Embarcadero Hotel [San Francisco, California].  "Here is San Francisco, you guys."  And I'm wandering around--my first time I'd ever been--. Then I wanted to go to Los Angeles [California], so then I went to Los Angeles too, before I finally came back.  And back in Detroit, people would say, "Why doesn't he come home?  Why isn't he here?  Everybody else has come home, and he's the only one out there on the West Coast."  And I was just filling in--drinking in this delicious mix of rich and poor and black and white, Hispanic and Asian. And I'm just--for the first time in my life, I'm learning about what goes on, not in my community, but in the rest of this country. And I said, "Well, maybe I should make a career out of this."
Story_ID: 17260
Speaker 1: I was working in the headquarters and here's this O--Officer Candidate School.  So I walked over to the battalion thing and I said, "I'd like to apply for Officer Candidate School.  I was at Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan]."  And the lady was very accommodating.  She gave me all the papers.  I started filling them out and in a little while, they said, "We have accepted your application for OCS, but first you have to go to Leadership School, Leadership Training School at Fort Ord, California [Monterey, California] for sixteen weeks."  I said, "That's great."  I said, "I'll get out of this outfit," which is--which was--they were sending people to Korea, as we speak.  I mean you'd wake up and a battalion or company would be all physically removed, and so we all knew that that was probably our lot.  And so they separated me from my 1279th Combat Engineers.  They put me on casual duty awaiting the next class being formed at Fort Ord, California for Leadership School, which is a preparatory requisite for Officer Candidate School.  And so I was there on the base, I'd come over and visit with the guys and they said, "Boy, are you lucky."  I said, "Well, you know."  They said, "We never thought you would do this.  You--we didn't--."  I said, "Well, I think it's a great opportunity."  So anyway, I ended up--they put this--by the way, my--the 1279th was put on alert, which means you--you gotta be ready to go at any time they order you to go--the whole battalion.  And so I said, "Boy, that's too bad.  I hope nothing happens to them."  In the meantime, the officers of command appealed to the Pentagon [Department of Defense headquarters].  They said, "These young kids from Detroit are totally unprepared in the National Guard Unit to go into military duty, especially as combat engineers," which means your--you gotta be prepared to fight and build at the same time, a tremendously difficult assignment, and you're under fire.  The Pentagon reversed their orders and sent them to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey [New Brunswick, New Jersey], where they were sent to Germany for duty.  Me--I--after going to Fort Ord, I came back to Fort Belvoir, Virginia for engineering OCS, and then they sent me to Korea.  And it was--it was--talk about--again my fellow comrades were overjoyed that they ended up sending--"John, it's really wonderful here in Stuttgart [Germany].  It's just great.  You would love it here.  Many of us are thinking about staying," and so forth and so on, and I was in Korea. But I was assigned, fortunately, to Special Category Army with [U.S.] Air Force, which means that I had to work behind the lines with the Air Force personnel who were flying up to the line.  We had to maintain the airstrips and then because I had had battalion headquarters experience with--with records and assigning troops and all that, they put me in personnel in the battalion, so I wasn't even working at that level. And it was--it was very fortunate.  I--once again--and you were only in Korea for a year, and then you came back. By that time, I said, "I would like to get out.  I do not want continue even as a commissioned officer."  And then I went back to Wayne University.  I had the G.I. Bill [higher education financial assistance for U.S. military veterans]. And I finished up my undergrad requirements as a history major, and was accepted into a law school. But--but once again, there was this question that was raised, "Why were we there? What--what--what was the U.S. purpose in Korea?  Was there a domino theory that the communists would take over Korea, and that would lead them to the next step, and we would ultimately all be in a--a--a atomic war?"  So, that there--there is another kind of thinking that was--it wasn't organized, but it was asking political questions.  It was asking foreign policy considerations.  It was asking about choices.

Speaker 1: Congressman John Conyers, June 20, 2001, Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 17262
Speaker 1: I'd like you to just talk about, you know, how you came to work for, you know, [U.S.] Congressman [John] Dingell.  You came back from the--from--?
Speaker 2: I came--I came back from the service [U.S. Army], attended law school [Wayne State University Law School, Detroit, Michigan], and a vacancy came open in Congressman Dingell's Detroit [Michigan] office and my name was recommended. And it was amazing because I was in my senior year of law school, but he decided to hire me anyway. And I finished law school, and studied for the [Michigan State] Bar [Examination], while I was working with him. And then amazingly, after I passed the bar, he agreed that I could begin practicing law in another office in the same block and continue to work for him. So here I was getting great legal training and at the same time, I was getting more involved with the legislative process and with the responsibility of serving the constituents in the congressman's district, which was the same district that I lived in as well. So this--this was indeed fortuitous circumstance because it gave me what little credibility of experience that I had, which was unlike many of the other people running for this job that I had actually worked for a congressman and in his office.
Speaker 1: Now what was that experience like and how did it form you as a person?  Was--did you take sort of to politics like a fish, you know, in water or--because this had not been part of your modus operandi, up to that point really, had it?
Speaker 2: Well actually, I had begun thinking about running for local office, a state representative office, a state office, a state senator's office, and so this fit in rather well actually and I began to really enjoy the experience.  I then was appointed by the former governor of the state, John Swainson, to a administrative judicial post in the Workmen['s] Compensation Bureau, and I worked there as a judicial officer, and I couldn't practice law anymore. And then the momentous occasion of a Supreme Court case known as 'Baker vs. Carr,' [1962] in the United States Supreme Court which held that state legislatures must redistrict every ten years, but if they didn't, the federal judges would do it themselves. And Michigan fell into that category. And we brought a lawsuit based on this Supreme Court case and received a federal court decision that ordered Michigan to be redistricted because as I had rightly guessed, the place that they would add a district would be in Detroit, which had occasioned the most population in growth. So there I was, sitting in a district that I had been raised in, that I had worked for the congressman [Dingell] in--who, by the way, he moved to another location down river--and I started off all by myself because people said, "This is--this is not likely to happen." But when people began to realize that this was a district that had been created in a way that an African American could win, [U.S.] Congressman Charles Diggs [Jr.] was the first member of color in the Congress from Michigan, and they had--they had thought first that it would be impossible that you could get two members from contiguous districts of color, but it became clear that this was quite likely, then everybody got in the race, and I had a real--I campaigned for a year. And with relatively little funds by today's standards, I was able to very narrowly win the Democratic primary which was tantamount to victory, but I only won it by 128 votes so it was deeply embedded into my political psyche that every vote really counts.
Story_ID: 17263
Speaker 1: Who were you running against at that time, do you--and when you said that people didn't believe, who were you talking about? And what coalitions did you have to sort of rely on?
Speaker 2: Well, because I was the first to perceive this possibility and was not a veteran political figure, they thought that--that this was just a pipe dream, it was a fancy that I had that had no basis in fact.  As a matter of fact, they said, "I could probably get [U.S. Congressman Charles] Diggs [Jr.] defeated or someone else, that it was a reckless gamble on my part." But of course, I had worked as the representative of the congressman [John Dingell, Sr.] in the district, so I knew it as well as anyone probably, except the congressman, himself. So I realized that this make-up of the new district would allow a person of color to win.  When that became clear, then everybody got in the race. I started out all alone.  There was--there was some skepticism, some comments, unnecessary comments, made about my candidacy. And then my state representative got in the race.  My state senator got in the race.  Businessmen came in.  There were at least seven or eight other people in, but the most formidable candidate came in, finally, near the end--was Richard Austin, who, himself, was the first African American certified public accountant [CPA] in the state of Michigan, who was a very respected businessman, and whose entry in the race clearly meant that it was likely to be a contest primarily between him and myself. And it--it took a lot of effort on my part. I was--I was out-spent considerably, but the union forces helped me.  My father [John Conyers, Sr.] was a United Automobiles [United Automobile Workers labor union] international representative who was, quite frankly, more well known than myself. And also I was assisted by the fact that the newspapers were on strike in the city and as a progressive candidate, there was little doubt that I would be not even considered for their endorsement and with them out of the--of the influencing business during the campaign, my stock went up, and even then had seventy or sixty-four people voted differently, I would not have won the race. And I really worked very hard for it.  I remember I was so exhausted.  I went home, and I couldn't--I couldn't wake up to stay up all night as the counting went on. And, you know, I felt I had won the race.  I had no idea that it was such a narrow margin. So the next morning when I got up, people said, "You know, you weren't even here.  All during the night. We stayed up all night.  We were worried."  I said, "Well, you know, I thought I was going to win the race anyway." I was young and overconfident.  They said, "Let me tell you something, young man.  You lost the race several times during the night and barely won it as it was." and I said "Oh, I didn't know that."  So that began my career. And it was--it was--it was very exciting because my race attracted quite a bit of attention, simply by the fact that I was not an experienced legislator, and that I did not have huge financial support behind me.  It was a people's candidacy and there was a certain populist atmosphere about my campaign and my election.  It proved that the people could pick someone.
Story_ID: 17264
Speaker 1: I began my career with the-I sat down and tried to write all of the things--what did I stand for? How would I explain myself to someone who's trying to make a legitimate decision?  And it all boiled down to jobs, justice and peace.  Matter of fact, I'm going to show you my first--somebody went in the records and dug out my first piece of literature. And it was--it was--I was against the war, the Vietnam War at the time. And I remember constantly being asked, "How could you know more than [President] Lyndon [B.] Johnson, who is supporting the war?  You are running as a Democrat, as he is.  You are unelected, and you're against the war.  I mean, there's a disconnection here, John Conyers, can you explain it?"  Which I'm not sure how well I explained that, but I was an anti-war candidate who had never held office, that won the [U.S.] Congress. And that resonated across the country.  I immediately became a person sought after by the anti-war movement, the people that opposed Vietnam, the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] came in and endorsed me at the Central [United] Methodist Church in downtown Detroit [Michigan], which was absolutely unheard of.  He studiously stayed out of political endorsements because frequently his friends--there was no way he could separate that out. And when Coretta [Scott] King [civil rights activist] was writing her autobiography, she called me to confirm that that had actually happened because she told me what I had already known, was that Dr. King never endorsed candidacies or campaigns, but I had something special going for me.  I had Rosa Parks in my campaign, who had moved from Montgomery [Alabama] to Detroit [Michigan] and had quietly joined my campaign. And in addition, ministers who were cousins to Dr. Martin Luther King in Detroit had come into my campaign. So I had this civil rights/people's movement aura in my campaign that was successful.  It worked.  We could buy no television.  We spent--we did not have a huge advertising budget, but we campaigned incessantly.
Story_ID: 17265
Speaker 1: What about [U.S.] Congressman [John] Dingell?  What role did he play?  Was he--did he play any role?  Did he sort of stand by the sidelines?  Did he, you know, were you sort of on your own?
Speaker 2: I was on my own for a couple of reasons.  First of all, there was the only place I could run was in what was in effect this newly created district. So Congressman Dingell probably was not enthusiastic about the fact that--that we could end up running against each other in a district now redrawn in which the majority population was African American. So he moved down river, ironically, to run in Dearborn [Michigan], a Detroit suburb, in which there was another son of a congressman.  Dingell [Jr.] was the son of [U.S. Congressman] John Dingell, Sr., who was one of the fathers, if not the father of Social Security. And when his father passed, he ran for the office.  In the meantime, down river, there was another also Polish American congressman incumbent, just like John, who was the son, he himself, was the son of another earlier member of Congress, and they had the biggest war you'd ever seen.  I mean it was very spirited, almost at points, ugly.  To see two Polish Americans, both sons of members of Congress, and both compared to me, very well-financed and very well-known, really mixing it up down river. So he had no time to deal with what was going on in Detroit [Michigan], in this newly created district.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Well, that was to your advantage then, I guess.
Speaker 2: I bet it was, more than likely.
Speaker 1: That's how we say [Mayor] Harold Washington [of Chicago, Illinois] got elected because nobody was paying attention.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Story_ID: 17266
Speaker 1: You win and you think, you know, you have a chance, but maybe that was youth or whatever, you know, or big self-confidence, but you win. What is the whole process at this point because you have worked, at least you have the advantage having worked, you know, with a U.S. Congressman [John Dingell Sr.] but it's a different thing then you are, and you're young too, how old are you at this point?
Speaker 2: I was in my mid-thirties. And this little--although it was a small amount of experience, of course, I magnified it to the fullest.  I--I--I created every responsibility that I had ever imagined went with the job, and a few--a few important things happened along the way.  One of them was I got invited to the White House [Washington, D.C.] when John F. Kennedy, as [U.S.] President, was putting together the Lawyers Commission for Civil Rights Under Law. And he invited three people--three people were invited from Michigan. And the late United States Senator, [Patrick] Pat McNamara, who, himself, was a former labor leader, invited three lawyers to go to the White House from Michigan.  He invited myself; attorney Damon Keith, who later became a first-class judge [United States Court of Appeals, 6th Circuit]; and he invited attorney George W. Crockett, who later became a judge and a [United States] congressman. And of course, we all went as lawyers.  We--all of us were lawyers at the time. And so from there--and of course, this is my first time in the White House, first time meeting President Kennedy.  Matter of fact, only time, and it was all very heady stuff for me. But--and I--I'd gotten involved in a few high-profile civil rights cases that brought people--brought me to people's attention. And it was--it was-- everything was moving along.  This was a huge step, and contrary to political elders who were saying, "Well, attorney Conyers, you do have a good future ahead of you, but don't you think you ought to get some experience somewhere along the way before you become a United States congressman?"  And, of course, my answer was, "No.  I don't think I need any more."  And I argued against--all the other candidates were older than me, had a bit longer resume, but I could argue, "I have worked in a congressman's office.  I worked side by side with him.  I've helped him in drafting legislation and dealing with his constituents, in meeting the problems at the local level." And I elaborated and built that up so it seemed like, according to me, there was nobody, no matter what you've been doing, "You haven't worked with and for a congressman so therefore, my credentials are not only as good as yours--you, who are running against me, mine are really better than yours." And a lot of people bought it and they said--I remember, it was stated over and over again, "We're--I'm gonna give you a chance.  I'm gonna give you a vote.  I hope--if you're like your father, I'm gonna vote for you.  I know your dad."  There were this kind of commentary. And so--and I worked, I had a little bit of experience in campaigning 'cause I campaigned for the former congressman of the district, and I knew where to go.
Story_ID: 17267
Speaker 1: And there was one other thing that was very important in addition to the labor support that I enjoyed and the civil rights support that Rosa Parks and [Dr.] Martin [Luther] King [Jr.] brought to me, and that was the churches.  For the first time in Detroit [Michigan], the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance [faith-based activist organization] decided to revoke their ban on giving political endorsements after a very heated meeting. And they decided  a--to revoke that ban; and b--to endorse me. And that gave me carte blanche into the churches of the Detroit area, which was absolutely critical because it is axiomatic that church people are among the best voters.  It also brought me in touch with Reverend C. L. Franklin, the father of Aretha Franklin, at his church on Linwood Street [Detroit] which was in the district. And he took a liking to me, and he had a huge radio program every Sunday evening and he always allowed me to come on his problem, to bring news to the radio audience of important government and political actions that were going on.  I was sort of like the news commentator coming in to give my input on what had happened in the past week, and that was an enormous help in terms of him repeating my name and mentioning me in a positive way.  Of course, I had the church endorsements so all of those things of careful and persistent campaigning really paid off.
Speaker 2: It doesn't even really sound like a grassroots campaign.  I mean, C. L. Franklin was huge.  Martin Luther King is huge.  Rosa Parks was adored.
Speaker 1: And this was with a shoestring budget.
Story_ID: 17268
Speaker 1: You mentioned that you had worked on two landmark civil rights cases and I was just wondering if you can touch upon that quickly.  You said, "I worked on two important cases as a lawyer."
Speaker 2: Well, I had done a number of cases. Well, first of all, I went south with Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.].
Speaker 1: So you had already gone south with Dr. Martin Luther King?
Speaker 2: Yes, before I ran.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes. I'd gone to Mississippi and I was representing civil rights workers that were incarcerated or were arrested.  Later on in [U.S.] Congress, I took a congressional delegation for Dr. Martin Luther King and [Ralph] Abernathy [civil rights activist] and his workers who were incarcerated in Alabama. So they--it was all really very exciting. And then I got involved in landlord-tenant disputes, in which I represented tenants who were on the short end of getting decent housing, who had withheld their rent, and they were--they were pretty high-publicity cases because I demanded a jury and the rents were withheld, and the people were picketing and it was beginning to spread to other apartments where people felt that they had no recourse against landlords that were not giving them the proper kinds of amenities that they were entitled to. And so I was really involved in the march.  Detroit had its own march down our main street of Woodward Avenue, which Dr. King led a march with Walter Reuther, then the president of the UAW [United Auto Workers labor union], and [Reverend] C. L. Franklin, and other leaders in the community, [Michigan State] Representative Jimmy [James] Del Rio and many others were all--and I was right there involved in that. And I had gotten to know many of the King assistants, Ralph Abernathy, Andrew Young, I got to know  Julian Bond also very well, he was with SNCC [Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee]. And so I had--I was enjoying a civil rights reputation which held me in very good stead because when I began--after I was elected, I had--two people came in to help me raise money and get out the vote and that was Harry Belafonte [singer, actor and activist] and Nancy Wilson [singer], which was enormous. And then Harry Belafonte brought in Bill Cosby [comedian].  Oh goodness, I mean now here, you know, this little young fellow, all of a sudden, I had sort of really moved in and captured a pretty important part of the body politic with celebrities and civil rights leaders, and it all worked out rather nicely.
Speaker 1: That's a fascinating story.  In fact someone, I think (unclear) was telling me before that Harry Belafonte and Martin Luther King were looking at your resume, what was--what's that story, that they look at your resume and they say, "This seems like a bright, young lawyer.  We should give him a try."  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Well, I can't remember how King and I--how we got hooked up.
Speaker 1: That's what I'm wondering.
Speaker 2: But I remember--we got pictures where I used to visit King when he would come back home with Coretta [Scott King, civil rights activist] and the kids.  I'd come to his house and we'd--we'd meet. And I got one of the first awards from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC].  I had good civil rights credentials because I was involved in it and believed that this was an absolutely historic moment. And then with--with Rosa Parks, I said "When I win this, the first person I'm gonna ask to work for me is gonna be Rosa Parks."  And she worked for me for twenty years. So I had an office in which, at least half the people came in to meet Rosa Parks.  They could care less about Congressman Conyers. And Rosa Parks, she was presiding in my office. And as a matter of fact, she just sent me the alabaster porcelain of her.  I just got that, since you were here last. And she came to me one time and she said, "Congressman, I'd like to ask you to cut my pay, reduce my salary," and I said, "I'm sorry.  I don't--I don't follow you."  She said "Well, you let me off to go to these places across the country and around the world."  She said, "I don't really feel I'm earning my pay, and I request a pay cut."  That's how utterly humble a person she was.  It's unbelievable. And I said, "Rosa, look, please I can't even begin to consider that.  We're honored to have you working here.  I can't reduce your pay.  You work when you can."
Story_ID: 17269
Speaker 1: Were you at any time feeling faltering or was it like a wave that was sort of carrying you, you know, along.  That's what I'm wondering because your, you know, your--[U.S.] Congress was a different place than it is now.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: There was not, I mean, there was not, you know, this was a white bastion at that point?
Speaker 2: That's right. I was only--I was only the seventh African American to come to the Congress.  There are thirty-eight of us now. And of course I had a feel for my work because I had worked in a congressional office and so I--I knew what I was looking for.  When I got here I immediately went to Speaker [of the House of Representatives], John McCormack, of Boston [Massachusetts], big, long cigar, white hair. And I made a pitch to him to go on the Judiciary Committee because I was the first--I would be the first African American to ever serve on that committee in the history of this country. And that as a person who had worked with Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and was intimately--oh, he was so impressed.  He picked up the phone and he called [U.S. Congressman] Wilbur Mills of Arkansas, who was the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, which the committee determined where the new members--what committees they would serve on. And my committee member was [U.S. Congresswoman] Martha Griffiths from Michigan, as a matter of fact, from the adjoining congressional district. And when she heard of what I had done, instead of coming to her, I went to the speaker, she said, "Well John, I want to tell you something."  She said, "I know why you want to get on the Judiciary Committee, but there are not going to be any other civil rights laws so you might as well go to the Education and Labor Committee because I'm going to appoint another new colleague of yours, [U.S. Congressman William] Bill Ford, who not only is a lawyer, but he was a justice of the peace"--as if I hadn't been a judge, too.  She said, "So that's it."  Well I went back and told the Speaker, he called Wilbur Mills, and I don't know what happened in the committee, but I ended up on--on Judiciary Committee, and Bill Ford ended up on Education and Labor. And Martha Griffiths didn't speak to me for six solid months.  I mean, she was furious that I could have out-maneuvered her in her choice of where the freshmen members in Michigan were going--which committees they were going to serve on. So that began me off and the--the Congress in the sixties [1960s] was a far different place.  First of all, everything turned on seniority and chairmanships.  Nobody was very much concerned about young congressmen and freshmen until you got some seniority outside of your--your own constituency wanting you to vote, they didn't much care. I remember--I  remember a lot of things.  I remember one Chairman of the Rules Committee, [U.S. Congressman William] Colmer, I think he was from Virginia and he would always pad his pocket, and he'd tell the reporters, "This is the Civil Rights bill I got in my pocket," that he would carry around with him as if somebody could go in his drawer or go in his desk and take the bill and pass it.  He'd carry it around and then he'd--every spring, he'd come to the top of the stairs on the east front, and the reporters--he would say, "Well, I think the cotton needs to be picked or cultivated back home on my farm," and he said, "I think that'll be just about all for this year, boys, and I'm going."  He'd get in his old Flivver and drive off, and there was nothing else the House could do because all bills had to go through the Rules Committee.  He was Chairman of the Rules Committee so that was it.  And so he and southerners blocked all civil rights legislation, both in the House and the Senate, for many years that way.  It was only finally until we--we were finally able to get the '60, the 1964 Voter [sic, Voting] Right[s] Act, and the 1965, I mean, the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voter [sic, Voting] Rights Act, and that was, literally, over his body, that--that we did it, it was a terrible fight. And that also began the change of southern Democrats leaving the Democratic Party.  They became--[U.S. Senator Strom] Thurmond left and they become independents or joined the Republican Party, and the independents soon became Republicans thereafter. So that began the change as the Civil Rights Movement, led by Democrats and northerners, gained in power.  In the South, the southern Democrats became Republicans. And it was a very turbulent time, with the Vietnam War on top of it.
Story_ID: 17270
Speaker 1: What was the motivation then?  I mean if the--if the instigation [for civil rights legislation] wasn't in Congress, was it the courts that were really pushing things forward with those two acts [the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act], I mean besides community groups?  I'm just wondering, what was the momentum that pushed things through?
Speaker 2: The first thing that broke the deadlock was the 1954 decision of 'Brown v. The Board of Education [of Topeka, Kansas', 1954], where the [U.S.] Supreme Court unanimously found that there is no such thing as "separate and equal" and that this was offensive to the 14th Amendment [of the U.S. Constitution]. And Chief Justice Earl Warren--signs went up, especially in California, from where he hailed, "Impeach Earl Warren!"  This is incredible.  I mean, the whole notion that segregation could be illegal was shocking to many people, but especially in the South, where this had always been ratified as a perfectly okay way of life. And so that began the momentum that led to the Civil Rights Act and the Voters Right Act [sic, Voting Rights Act].  And then we had other bills that kept coming along.  We began in the Voters Right Act, we began to deal with the question of gerrymandered districts that were regularly altered to make sure that an African American couldn't win a congressional seat, and that--then those jurisdictions were monitored by the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, and they couldn't make no changes without passing it through the Department of Justice. So there were truly exciting times.  The nation was undergoing one of the most dramatic changes that had ever taken place.
Speaker 1: And what were you learning in that process because you're--the [U.S.] Congress was different at that, you know, as you say, it was a different place.  None of that was frustrating for you?  I mean, I know you got your choice of the Judiciary Committee, but the fact that you're a freshman, you know, congressman, the fact that Congress was different at that point--were you--was any--how were you--how were you able to satisfy your constituents?  Were you satisfying them because of virtue that you had gotten this position and it was a big deal or were you working, you know, with organizations like the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?  I mean, I'm just trying to understand where your activism really sort of played out.
Speaker 2: Well, it was--it was much easier to be an activist as a member of Congress because I brought immediate attention and support, which I could then follow up with legislative action. And so I worked closely with the labor movement, with the NAACP, with the American Civil Liberties Union [ACLU], with a devout Fannie Lou Hamer [civil rights activist] and the brave people in Mississippi who dared to even run for Congress, much less--they not only wanted to vote, they wanted--I once moved to expel the entire Mississippi delegation because it was--they were unconstitutionally elected, I claimed, which was quite true because blacks couldn't vote. And--I just--a couple of years ago, I met a young fellow in Detroit [Michigan], he wasn't that young, but he said, "I always vote in free elections."  I said "What do you mean by that?"  He said "Well, I come from Mississippi." And he said, "The only way I could vote in Mississippi, each time I had to pay a two dollars poll tax."  Can you imagine having to pay two dollars to cash your ballot when everybody else around you was not paying anything, and he told me this story of what finally was the last straw for him.  He was in this--he went into the service [U.S. Armed Forces], he came out--and this was in Jackson, Mississippi--and he said they called him into city hall, and they said, "Look, we know while you were in the service, you were voting," and they said, "But, you're back home now. You're not in the service anymore. And the only way you're gonna vote is that you're gonna pay two dollars like all other colored people." And he said, "That was it."  He had been over risking his life, fighting for democracy and he said he left and never came back.  He said that--that was the last straw." So that's why he could look at me and say, "I vote in all free elections."
Story_ID: 17271
Speaker 1: When [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]--well, no, actually, you were here--you were in Congress during the March on Washington, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.  You weren't. That was in 1963.
Speaker 2: 1963.  Yeah, I was there, but I was a citizen.
Speaker 1: You were a citizen, okay, but, you were here when Martin Luther King got killed?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what role were you playing at that point in time?  Because, you know, the country, they were concerned that there was going to be total civil, you know, uprising and disturbance, and I'm wondering--?
Speaker 2: I'd been working with the--his latest project, which was the March on Washington for poor people, and we continued on, it was--everybody was in such mourning that it couldn't reach the crescendo that we had originally planned, but it was--but I kept asking myself after his assassination, "Well, how can I show that this man not only meant so much to me, but to America?"  And it came to me that the highest honor that we could, as a nation, give to this slain civil rights leader, world renowned, was to have a national public holiday in his honor. And so in 1968, four days after his assassination on April 4th, I introduced the bill that would make Martin Luther King's birthday a national holiday.
Speaker 1: And can you talk about that process because it took many years after?
Speaker 2: Fifteen years.
Speaker 1: Fifteen years.
Speaker 2: We reintroduced it--reintroduced it, but it--but it's a very amazing thing, the bill--the idea of King holiday, contrary to what the critics had predicted, the idea caught on and became more popular every year instead of fading away and becoming less popular. And then finally people saying, "Oh, he can't get it done."  Other countries began to honor January 15th as a holiday, or at least as a moment of ceremony. And so when we would march every year on Dr. King's birthday, in Washington [D.C.], and we began to enlist Reverend [U.S. Congressman] Walter Fauntroy [civil rights activist], who was a King, former King aide, who was then a [U.S.] congressman, and we got Stevie Wonder, and Dizzy Gillespie would show up and [Harry] Belafonte, and, who knows, every--and it was around the world, it was gathering traction, but then something  began to happen inside the country, states began to honor King's birthday, cities began to honor it, school districts passed resolutions celebrating it, and then unions began holding his day as a paid holiday in their collective bargaining agreement.  Well, this was getting very serious. And so we were gradually gathering momentum to get it passed in the [U.S.] House [of Representatives], and then we said, "Oh, goodness.  Now  what are we going to do about the Senate?"  Well, the senators, they had a political eye on this, and finally they started coming around and then finally on the day that the bill came up for floor debate, and the King family and Coretta [Scott King, civil rights activist and widow of Dr. King] and the civil right leaders in Jackson [Mississippi] and everybody, Andrew Young [Mayor of Atlanta, Georgia], they were all up here, and the senators began giving long and passionate speeches in support of Dr. King as a martyr.  We couldn't believe our eyes, we were--or ears, we were astounded.  They gave huge credits, and lifted Martin Luther King's memory and his activities into the skies with grace and we were--we were dumbstruck. And we all went over to the Senate side, and it was clear they were going to pass this bill and they--they gave, it was just so wonderful. And more than one reporter came up to me after and he said, "Well, look, you know, everybody was for this bill all the time.  What took so long?"  And I said "Well, it takes time to build up a critical mass until you can get  to the point where you can-- you have the 218 votes and at least, in the House, and at least 51 in the Senate, when you reach that point, you got a bill, but until then, you're still working on it."
Story_ID: 17272
Speaker 1: What were the critics saying though about this whole thing [the campaign for a holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?  They were saying what?
Speaker 2: Well, they were saying, number one, "We got enough holidays.  We--for goodness sake, we can't keep creating these holidays."  I mean--and the 'Economist' [magazine] calculated how many work hours would be lost, millions of work hours, productivity would decline, wages and income would be reduced.  It was just a bad economic idea.  Number two, "We don't know if King really deserves to have holidays named with George Washington and the founders of our country and the--the so-called discoverers of  America.  I mean, really, it's too early to make that kind of assessment.  I mean, it's true that he brought  about changes."  So those were the main arguments, that it was too costly and that King may not really deserve it, upon serious reflection.  That this was just a project of his admirers and friends who are using this as an opportunity to continue giving him publicity.  After all, there had never  been any African American for whom a national holiday had been named. And so this was the drift, but it became clear that many people, if not most people, almost everywhere, had no objection to this. And so finally, in the last rounds of negotiation, I went to [U.S.] Congressman Jack Kemp of New York, a Republican, and I said, "Jack, you know, you have huge presidential aspirations."  I said, "This is a bill you can't afford not to be behind.  You've always advocated that Republicans open the party up to African Americans and for you not to be on this bill would--would not reflect well upon your candidacy and your--your future as a--as a leader in our government."  Then I went to Vice President [George H.W.] Bush and I said, "Mr. Vice President, you could seriously be embarrassed here because I happen to know that there are Republicans planning to support this bill," and I said, "You'd better--you'd better see what you can do about this."  He said, "Well, I'll go, but President [Ronald] Reagan isn't too keen on this." And I said,  "Well, I can't--I don't have much control about that."  So we finally got President Reagan to say, "If this bill passes the [U.S.] House [of Representatives] and [U.S.] Senate, I'll sign it into law."  They--his advisors persuaded him that would never happen, "so you don't have to worry about it."  So when it happened, of course, we kept him to his word and, of course, he signed it into law.
Story_ID: 17273
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your involvement with the Vietnam War because that was also--. Were you one of the few congressional people, you know, people sitting on the [Capitol] Hill [Washington, D.C.] that were opposing the war at the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yes, we were in a distinct minority, but the opposition to the war was growing.  We had a--we had a group, what did we call ourselves?  [U.S. Congressman] Don Edwards of California, [U.S. Congressman] Bob Kastenmeier, Wisconsin, [U.S. Congresswoman] Bella Abzug, [U.S. Congressman] Ron Dellums, [U.S. Congresswoman] Shirley Chisholm--there were about nine sometimes ten or eleven that were formally opposed, vehemently opposed to the Vietnam War.  There were others who weren't for it, but they didn't feel that it was prudent to speak up against it. And so what began to happen is that as these casualties began to mount and students began to say, "You know, not only are we taking--have our education interrupted, but we could be coming back in body bags."  The original resistance to the war came from the student populations, particularly university students who were the ones that were gonna be drafted and activated and trained and shipped over there, usually with not  very full measure of training.  After all, we hadn't done anything like this since World War II. So they--well, there was a Korean initiative. But this--this was getting very prolonged and it became clear, two things, one, that the whole notion that there was some national interest at stake began to get pretty thin as a logic for us going way over to the Vietnam.  I mean, it was hard to imagine how the Vietnamese were going to challenge this huge super power, the largest ever known in history. And number two, we were losing the war on top of it.  I mean everybody kept promising there would be a victory, there was one last effort, and--and we were publicly being turned back by people far less well- armed than we, with far less seacraft and aircraft and huge guns and missiles--we had all of that, but we couldn't win the war. And those two factors: what are we doing, and why can't we win just began to really--. And so the opposition to the war began to be so great that we'd have these huge marches where hundreds of thousands of people would come and scare the dickens out of the [U.S.] President [Richard Nixon] and Attorney General [John Mitchell].  They would be peeking out looking at the Republican--Nixon and his attorney general, and they would be trying to figure out, "What in the world is going on?"  I mean these people are marching against us.  It was--it was--it was very hard for them to take and even more difficult for them to understand the sentiment that was moving. And many of the prominent leaders, families, their youngsters sometimes their children, sometimes their grandchildren, would assume prominent positions of opposition to the war that someone in their family was a big part of the administration that was supporting and there was some little guy with the same name saying, "Ah, forget that." So it was--people were rethinking this and to me, this came out of the Civil Rights Movement, the anti-war feeling, the whole struggle for women's rights was a byproduct of the Civil Rights Movement  and then, of course, even for the disabled, and then for people of different sexual orientation.  All of these movements, found their roots going back to a civil rights movement which accepted them and then made them realize that they had the same obligation to organize and protest, as people struggling for racial justice in this country did. And so there was this relationship, and finally, Dr. King, himself, after a great deal of study because he was warned by the 'New York Times' [newspaper] and the leading institutions, "Stay out of foreign policy." And they weren't kidding. One of the profound disappointments that Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] experienced was how he was dismissed and the Civil Rights Movement was attacked by many of the institutional people in the media and in the government that had found sympathy and support for him as long as you stay on civil rights. And he said, "I can't do this. I think this war is immoral." And there at Riverside Church in New York [New York], he gave this famous speech that took one through the thought processes that had led him to believe that he was forced to make a statement against his country's endorsement and prosecution of this immoral war. But his stock went down, from that point on, he was never again able to command the editorial presence and the media build-up that he had enjoyed before he had crossed that line, that they said, "Don't you dare. You have no foreign policy expertise.  You don't know anything about foreign affairs. You don't know anything about the logistics of this." And he--and he explained and, of course, he won the [Nobel] Peace Prize and, of course, that put to rest any thoughts about what he might not have understood about it. But in this country, he was literally a marked man from that time on.
Story_ID: 17274
Speaker 1: When I review World War I and World War II, I now find people that were opposed to that--those wars, although I--they still made sense to me. But when you come to the Korean War, there was another problematic forerunner of the--the--what was 'en vogue' then was the domino theory.  That if the Communists could get a foothold in North Korea and take over South Korea, it would lead to Asia and it would--the dominoes would kick in, the domino effect.  And I--I--I backed into the Korean War because I was attending Wayne [State] University [Detroit, Michigan].  I'll never forget this, this young fellow--well, Harry Woods, my dear friend, came to me and he said, "John, you know, this Korean War, they're going to be drafting people pretty soon and you know who's gonna be the first to go."  I said, "Oh yeah."  He said, "I tell you what, there's--I got a really wonderful idea'cause I just joined the [U.S.] National Guard, the Michigan National Guard, and if you're in the National Guard, you can't get drafted."  I said, "Oh, I didn't know that."  He said, "Come on down with me."  And so the next meeting they met, I think, every two weeks, and they said, "This is all you have to do.  You come in every two weeks for a few hours."  I said, "Okay."  And so I was in the National Guard--. And summer you have to spend two weeks at camp at Fort [sic, Camp] Grayling [Michigan]. And so finally my studies got pretty heavy down at Wayne [State] University.  Now all of these officers in the 1279th Combat Engineers, remember that title, they were all people that lived in the neighborhoods.  We all knew--these were businessmen, family men, veterans of World War II.  And so I came to my captain whose name was Captain Matthews, I still see him at the reunions. And I said, "Captain. I really can't--I really don't have time any more. This is--. These studies really require my attention."  He said, "Don't worry."  He said, "I'll tell you what I can do.  I can get--I can give you a discharge.  We can--we can let you go. Or I can leave you in as a--a--we'll put you on the reserve list. You won't have--you'll still be in the Guard, but you don't have to attend any of our activities."  I said, "Well, thank you so much.  Just leave my name on."  And so when I got the letter: "Greetings, August 1950. You are now inducted into the--this unit is activated, and you will report--."  And I went back down there and I said--I remember the Major Womack.  I said, "Major, there's some mistake here because they sent me a letter, as you know, I'm on the reserve list.  I am not active any longer.  I'm on the inactive list."  And Major Womack looked at me and he said, "Look, Conyers."  He said, "I served in World War II."  He said, "I have a family, and you don't.  I am going to this war.  And unless you want to be the first person court-martialed, you will get your gear and prepare to go to Fort Lewis, Washington with this unit of which you are a member."  Well, I had been telling all of my colleagues in the--I said, "I'm not going, guys.  Remember I'm on the inactive list."  And I was--"Goodbye." And when they found out that I had to go, this gave them the greatest pleasure that they had experienced.  And of course by that time, all the gear and the things that fit had been run out and I had--everything I had was too big or too little.  It was whatever was left over 'cause I wasn't going.  And this gave nearly everyone in the battalion great pleasure to see that this guy that had thought he had beat the system was, in fact, going to the war like everybody else. Thus began my military career.

And we'd go to Adam Clayton Powell and say, "You know, there's only a handful of us here and these issues are coming up.  We've got to--we've gotta get a--we've got to organize and meet."  And Adam would have his long cigarette holder out.  And he'd say, "Meet for what?"  He said, "I represent black America.  What on earth do we have to form a caucus for?"  And he would dismiss us.  He said, "That's what I do."  And he would walk away.  And we'd say, "Gosh."  And finally we were able to get--to get this together, but Dawson was a little bit ailing at that time, so we knew he would--but Powell would have none of it.  He saw no purpose whatsoever.  He thought he was doing a perfectly fine job as the national spokesman for people of African American descent. So, we finally got together, we said, "We gotta do this anyway." And we--we elected Charlie Diggs, our first--our first chairman of the Black Caucus.  We had Ossie Davis [actor, activist] come in to make his famous speech: "It's not the man, but the plan," which we--we used that rhetoric for a quite awhile, still do, and he is still very close to the Congressional Black Caucus, he and his wife [actress, Ruby Dee].  And we said, "We're gonna have an event, the first--let's--let's have an event--what will we charge for the tickets?"  And somebody said, "Well, we better twenty-five dollars."  And someone said, "No.  We've gotta charge more than that.  We're gonna charge one hundred dollars."  And there would be a furious argument over whether we could get anybody to pay one hundred dollars to come to tickets from six black congressmen. And people would say, "Who's gonna buy the tickets?  Are you crazy?"  And we said, "No.  We're gonna sell one hundred dollars tickets anyway."  And we thought this was an enormous amount of money to require.  And, "We'll put on some workshops too and lead up to a dinner.  And Ossie--we'll get Ossie Davis," and so we did. And it worked out beautifully and it got bigger and more involved and the numbers grew from then, but that was the genesis of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Speaker 1: Now what was the thought at the beginning about this, about working in a group, you know, about having joint agendas, I mean, what was--was there a mandate that you came out with, you know, with the group, besides--I mean was there a mandate that you wanted to reach?
Speaker 2: Well, the motivating factor was essentially because there were--there were so many things going on in so many committees that we weren't on 'cause we just didn't have the numbers, that we'd have to meet to decide who's going to work on agriculture and who's going to take health care and who's going to work on civil rights. And so we met to try to divide up the responsibilities, who's going to deal with the historically black colleges. And so that was the original motivation--is to more efficiently cover the great realm of various subjects that if we didn't plan it out, they could--they would be very important and we wouldn't have anybody on the committee. And--and that was how--how we really began to come together and why we began to come together.

Speaker 1: You've [the Congressional Black Caucus] had a long thirty-one year history and actually been a few--why was it that the Caucus was defunded?  But it seems like it's even enjoy-- enjoying a resurgence since that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: So--but some people are predicted, "Okay. Oh no funding, it's gone." You know, so--. I would like you to talk about what landmarks--what things that people don't know that the Caucus has played an instrumental role, you know, in over its time.  And, you know, how it's matured. I'd like you to pull back, 'cause he talks a lot with his hands. Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, the Caucus has been involved in nearly everything that's happened at the national level and at the local level as well.  We got involved in the Voter [sic, Voting] Rights Act [1965], the Motor Voter Bill [National Voter Registration Act of 1993], which allowed secretaries of state to register people when you get a license, which played a huge impetus in getting African Americans registered and other people as well.  We've worked on funding for the historically black colleges so that they've just done remarkably well.  For many years, we had [U.S.] Congressman Louis Stokes on the Appropriations Committee and he was able to get millions and millions of dollars for the black medical schools, which originally were the only places that doctors could go--students could go to be trained for medical school--for medical practice.  And as a matter of fact, Stokes would get so much money that he wouldn't--he wouldn't like most of us, issue a press release bragging about it, he wouldn't tell anybody how much he was getting, so that unless you could follow him around or read the reports, nobody knew except the schools that they would benefit. Then he'd go to Southern Methodist [University, Dallas, Texas] and then he'd go to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and then he'd go to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], and then--he was getting money by the millions of dollars, doing a fantastic job, but it was all very low key.  On the civil rights issues, we were there.  [Mayor] Harold Washington [Chicago, Illinois] came to Congress and joined the Judiciary Committee and went around with me and others in the South as we took testimony of how voter rights violations and intimidation and coercion and gerrymandering were still very much alive and well in many places in the country.  So on--on every level, we began to engage with our ambassadors from the African nations and the Caribbean nations, so that we began to develop a component of a worldview of people of color.  [U.S.] Congressman Charlie [Charles] Diggs on the Foreign Affairs Committee was the first congressman to go to Africa constantly, and began to meet and began to acquaint our State Department with this whole huge part of the world that had been ignored up until that time.  It's hard to estimate how important the work that he did.  [U.S. Congressman, Augustus] 'Gus' Hawkins was Chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, and he passed bill after bill creating Head Start, funding public schools, getting special grants for the black universities.  So you have all these people--[U.S. Congressman] Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.], he attached a rider on all bills that--that said to them, unless segregation was ended, no funding. It was called the Powell Rider, that there could be no money expended, if there was any discrimination going on in the Department of Education.  And, of course, there was plenty going on in those days, in all the federal government.  In the Department of Agriculture, it was the Black Caucus that began to look at the plight of the black farmer who could get none of the loans, no access to the training, equipment, assistance that was regularly afforded to his white neighbors. And of course we had a long drawn out battle in lawsuits 'til only just recently were we able to get millions of dollars appropriated to try to begin to compensate for the suffering and denial and deprivation of due process that black farmers had sustained around the country.  So, it goes on and on.  There were--there were so many issues that we handled that collectively made us stronger and more powerful, that we became known as the "conscience of the Congress," and we were--and we still are, as a matter of fact.  Now, we're engaged in this huge pandemic of AIDS [Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome] that is sweeping, not only through Africa and the Caribbean, but has now made its--penetrated into Asia and into China, not to mention that there is a epidemic going on in the United States, itself.  And we are responsible for bringing together all the medical and political forces to try to impress upon our present administration that you can't just throw some change at this and that you can't leave these people to die when we have the anti-viral medicines that could at least stop, if--and halt the spread of this disease, if only we could get them there and skip over the incredibly high costs that prohibit them in most countries of color in the world.  So, our struggles have now become global.
Story_ID: 17277
Speaker 1: We have the whole issue of reparations that some at the United Nations [World] Conference on Racism in Durban [South Africa], that will take place at the end of the year in 2001, there are people that don't want reparations to come up.  Now, it's going to be pretty hard to talk about racism but not have any references to reparations, but it's a chilling thought to colonialists and ex-colonialists and their representatives that--that the time has come now that this is a global issue, and to many of--to much of our surprise, who had focused on the--the incredible mistreatment and inhumanity directed toward Africans that came--that were brought to America, we find that this whole question of enslavement and exploitation resounds in many countries and their history, and they're talking about reparations.  So the last thing colonialists and probably capitalists alike want to do is host a world conference in which we start talking about reparations and of course in politics, nothing can draw more attention to a subject than one that you don't want to talk about.  If you say, "Let's not talk about this", then people who weren't even interested in it want to talk about it. "Well, why don't you want to talk about it?  What's so mysterious about this subject?"  And so the conference is being overwhelmed by this one little word that some people are saying, "Shhh!  Maybe, you know, if we don't say much about it, it will go away, but we don't think there's a place on the agenda for this.  It's controversial.  We don't know if it has any validity as applies."  And, of course, people are looking at the reparations that are being granted monthly all around the world, and even in the United States. And so there's a huge, huge interest and all this comes from the Congressional Black Caucus, its individual members and the collective force that they bring to it in the issues.  This is just three dozen members in a body of five hundred who--who wield enormous moral pressure in the country and in the world that is just incredible, far beyond our very small numbers because in proportion to our presence in the population, we're still underrepresented in the [U.S.] Congress.
Story_ID: 17278
Speaker 1: Do you think we'll see reparations [for African Americans], I mean, you, who worked to make [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s birthday, you know, a national holiday.  When do--what do you think will be the time frame for something like reparations?  You know, to be a possibility?
Speaker 2: It's hard to estimate because the interest around the subject is growing almost exponentially.  There is nothing--of all the subjects I work with and on and support and introduce as bills, there's none that has received more attention nationally and internationally than the subject of reparations.  And there are now books being written about it bringing in perspectives that, you know, in my humble experience, I really hadn't thought through when I just started thinking about what I ought to do about it, which was brought to my attention by a rather insistent constituent, one person, Ray Jenkins, who kept talking to me about reparations, to a point of near madness.  And so I said, "Well, you know," he said, "You've got to do something about it.  You've got--." And I kept saying, "Well, wait a minute.  Well, maybe there is some logic here. Maybe--."  Here's a constituent--and--and he'd never miss an opportunity. Then he lectured my staff and everybody that he could buttonhole and pretty soon I said--I started thinking, "Well, you know, we've never studied reparations in the [U.S.] Congress.  I mean, there's been all this talk and "forty acres and a mule" and the Freedmen's Bureau, and President [Abraham] Lincoln, and President [Andrew] Johnson, but no one--."  I said, "The least we can do in deference to this subject is do what Congress loves to do more than anything else is study something."  This is one thing they didn't want to study.  And so, you know, this is--since 1989, here we go again.  But now this thing is the subject of forums, think tanks, world conferences, now it's going to the United Nations. And then Randall Robinson [author, activist] wrote a book ['The Debt']. And as we meet over there at TransAfrica [Forum, African advocacy organization], he said, "I thought this--." He was just like me, we said, "What in the world?"  He said, "What in the world is Conyers talking about?"  I said that about someone that had first come to me, Ray Jenkins.  And now they've got all the lawyers in America, I mean, this is a--just dropping the names should give pause to anybody that they may be thinking about filing a lawsuit against.  I mean, when you bring Johnnie Cochran [attorney] and then Willie Gary [attorney, philanthropist] in Florida and then go to Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and pull in several of their top legal minds. I mean, all these people they started tallying up the billions of dollars all of this law--these people, if they had been a law firm, have recovered individually, and then put all of their law firms together, who are working 'pro bono' in what will be the most classic international lawsuit of the twenty-first century--I can assure you.  I mean, this is unbelievable that--and more and more people, more historians, ethnographers, people are coming into this thing and it's--economists are weighing in and more and more papers and studies and the case for it and you start saying, "Good night."  This is--this is really what makes being a policy maker in this government truly one of the highest honors to which anybody can aspire.  Money can't even compensate, wealthy people would happily spend half their fortune to be able to be in a position to chart national and international policy for the peoples on the earth.  It's an incredibly exciting adventure that apparently there's no end to it.  You can--you can work on this as long as you are physically and mentally able. And so it's exactly what a person like myself, who didn't like listening to lawyers argue their cases as a judge and didn't like representing people who could afford me as a lawyer and was sorry that I couldn't take more cases of people that couldn't afford me, this is the perfect resolution of the kind of life I'm very blessed to be able to lead, by people who have chosen me to do  this--this very important work.

Speaker 1: The role that you played on the, you know, impeachment hearings with, you know--.
Speaker 2: Well, I had two impeachments.  The first one was the impeachment of [U.S. President] Richard Milhous Nixon. I introduced the first impeachment resolution on a sitting president in, I forgot how many decades--between the impeachment of [U.S. President Andrew] Johnson, there had never been another president that had been the subject of impeachment.
Speaker 1: You mean impeachment of [U.S. President William 'Bill'] Clinton?
Speaker 2: No, the impeachment of Richard Nixon.
Speaker 1: Nixon, right.
Speaker 2: So, I've had--I've had experience either in trying to impeach a president or trying to keep a president from being impeached.
Speaker 1: So how were those two experiences? How did they differ and how did the times in which they, you know, occur, sort of differ?  I mean, they were two different instances completely?
Speaker 2: Well, they were completely different, but that's one of the--the great responsibilities of being a member of the Judiciary Committee, that you--you oversight the Department of Justice, impeachments originate there. And of course Richard Nixon--and this was what made me feel that he was--was a candidate for impeachment, from many different points of view. But Nixon had an enemies list which he kept.  I was on that enemies list, as it turned out.  It became--and of course, the enemies list, in time, became just the opposite of what it was supposed to have been, it became a list of honor for progressives who were struggling to fight people as reactionary as Richard Milhous Nixon. And, you know, many of my friends said, "Gosh, I don't know how you got on that list.  I should have been on that list."  It became a badge of commendation that you had--you had been brought to Nixon's attention sufficiently for him to put you on the list.  You were a guy he had to get.  "What were your weaknesses?  What could they do to you?  How could they get you?" as the saying went in those days.
Story_ID: 17280
Speaker 1: The problem with the [U.S. President Richard M.] Nixon [proposed] impeachment was that John Dean [political advisor] made the reference about the tapes [with evidence of Nixon's Watergate cover-up] which, once they were secured and brought forward, even the most defiant member of [U.S.] Congress supporting their president had to say, "Please, enough. Don't play anymore."  Matter of fact, they archived thousands of tapes because there was way--you had way more than you needed to impeach him over and over and over again. And so he--I think appropriately resigned. Now the case was just the opposite for [U.S. President William] 'Bill' Clinton. Is that Bill Clinton did not commit impeachable acts as defined in the statute, nor were they acts that had any precedent in the experience of impeachment.  Personal conduct is not--or misconduct--is not an impeachable offense, as we found out as the private lives of many members began to get exposed since they felt that it was very important to occupy the high moral ground and attack Clinton and then they began to be investigated--and, boy, that was really something. And so finally in the [U.S.] Senate in its infinite wisdom decided, "We better let this go." And but they inflicted a lot of damage on Clinton and I have never seen such a fury of hatred against Clinton.  I've always asked myself, "Why?" because he is a very affable, personable human being that--as anybody that's ever met him, and most people know anyway without having met him. And I ascribed it to the fact that he was a southerner who was willing to reach out to African Americans in a way that no other president had, including Abraham Lincoln. And he--this sort of amounted to a kind of social treason to many people who resented his genuine working relationships and the fact that he enjoyed social--his social activities involved many African Americans. And it was just--people were totally unprepared for that and I think that got him as much trouble as anything else that he had done. But--and we had constitutional authorities, even the Republicans brought in constitutional authorities that said, you know, "We're sorry, but these are not impeachable offenses.  His personal life cannot be the subject of impeachment." I mean, you'd have to dig up a lot of dead presidents and have  posthumous impeachment proceedings if really that's--if you're really gonna create some new standard for impeachment. And--but the venom and the vengeance and the animus was written on their faces as these guys would march over to the Senate.  As a matter of fact, they made a few senators  uncomfortable because it was clearly a vindictive act that was being perpetrated and--and the senators felt very uncomfortable with this--the way that--it was--that they went about it.  It was not presented in a way that you could say was non-partisan and--and fair.
Speaker 2: Now Kenneth Starr [Independent Counsel leading official investigations of Clinton] brought attention to the role of Independent Counsel that hadn't been brought to that role before, and I'm wondering what's been done since that time and what your view was on that this role, because it appeared that for the first time--this Independent Counsel was not only independent, but he could be his own sort of thing--he had a lot--a lot of leeway that had been granted.
Speaker 1: Well, he had far too much leeway and he used it and abused it. And, of course, what happened is that we found that within Kenneth Starr's law office, he had a connection to Richard Mellon Scaife, one of the wealthiest supporters of right wing causes in America, and that they had been funding, secretly at first, 'til it was discovered, lawyers to investigate Clinton, foundations to sue Clinton, investigators to try to dig up dirt back in Arkansas. And there was a quite obvious connection between the people that were trying to get Clinton and Kenneth Starr and his law office, which led us to decide that the independent counsel had far too many powers and that we were all thoroughly embarrassed by this abuse of the role of Independent Counsel, which had never been abused to this extent before.
Speaker 2: So what's happening. Will that role--?
Speaker 1: We ended it.  We ended the Independent Counsel role.  Yes, it doesn't exist anymore.  The Department of Justice can appoint lawyers, but they don't have the legal authorities and privileges and prerogatives that the Independent Counsel had.
Story_ID: 17281
Speaker 1: I want to talk about Judge [U.S. Supreme Court Justice] Clarence Thomas.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that role because you played a role there, and then I want to go on and talk about the recent election because that was, nevermind--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, but with Clarence Thomas--how did you feel sitting, you know, there in the consideration of him. I mean as an African American and as one who I'm sure had worked, you know, at one time closely with [U.S. Supreme Court Justice] Thurgood Marshall.  I'm just, you know, I'm wondering how you felt and--?
Speaker 2: Well, I was outraged.  I mean to have Thurgood Marshall replaced by Clarence Thomas is almost like a bad joke.  Matter of fact, it was. And I remember during the nomination hearings, Clarence Thomas called me and wanted to meet with me, and I declined because it was very clear to me that I knew what I had to do.  I've only twice in my life ever opposed an African American nominee. And the [Congressional] Black Caucus was over there--my colleagues, they were all over there testifying against him, everybody testified against him because he had done such a disservice to EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which was why they picked him, and he's--he's proven me right.  I mean, he now--if it's possible to be further to the right than [U.S. Supreme Court] Justice [Antonin] Scalia, and every now and then, he is--he's able to go further than him. And he's sort of--you almost imagine that he's doing this out of a vengeance for all of those who attacked his civil rights credentials, that he's proving now that he's there for life.  This is, in a way, like payback time.  I don't meant to trivialize this because his decisions are very poorly put together and so it doesn't have to be anything emotional about it.  It's--he's doing a huge disservice to the court and to America and a painful disservice to African Americans.
Story_ID: 17282
Speaker 1: This whole thing that happened with the election recently [November 2000 Presidential election], what was your view 'cause you're both a lawyer and you sit on the Judiciary Committee, and here we have this election that's very close.  You probably even can relate to that because your election was so close and I'm just wondering what your thoughts were as you watched what happened because some people feel that the [U.S.] Supreme Court, you know--a lot of times, you want to have an image of something, you know, and their image got tarnished this most recent time.
Speaker 2: Well, it is generally regarded by many people in the legal field and out that the election of November 7, 2000 was the first coup d'état in American history in which--that is to say that without tanks and guns and the military, which is the way coups around the world generally occur, ours happened legally.  There were--there were no military takeovers, but there was a political takeover.  The careful coordination of the Bush family, its strategists in government, formallly in government and in the private sector, a huge battalion of lawyers, including one of the lawyers that spent a great time, a great deal of time going after President [William "Bill"] Clinton himself.  All--all of this and the incredible numerous events that occurred in Florida leading up to and during the election and even after the election, as the excellent report by Mary [Frances] Berry of the Civil Rights Commission has made, demonstrated that the state in which the candidate's brother was governor was bound and determined to make sure that nobody else could or would win that election but then-Governor George [W.] Bush. And so with the secretary of state and with other legal people, with the courts and the legal organizations and, in many respects, with law enforcement, they were able to, first of all, deprive a number of people from ever getting to the ballot through any number of processes, including declaring people to be former felons and that, therefore, they were barred from the right to vote, which thousands were barred, and there was no justification for it at all, to moving precincts, to failing to send people who registered under the "Motor Voter Act" [National Voter Registration Act of 1993] in Florida, the Secretary of State [Katherine Harris], simply, a very unusual person herself, just failed to send the notice of registration to the polling precinct in which the driver-citizen had registered, and police harassment tactics of having searches and so forth and then the refusal of election workers to facilitate those who had language problems, the defective machines, many of which were quite old and malfunctioning, to a high degree, all happened to be in the African American or the Hispanic communities, the language problems.  Even the seniors in the Jewish communities who were given the infamous butterfly ballot and all--all of these innumerable things combined to make it clear that there was only going to be one winner in Florida, and that to make sure that that happened, they even--the Supreme Court even took jurisdiction of a matter for which there is no precedent of them doing before to halt, finally, all of the ballot counting and recounting that was going on. So we experienced the first coup.  The person with the most votes didn't win.  The person with--with the least votes beat the person with the most votes. Who immediately set about operating as if he had the mandate. If he [U.S. President George W. Bush] had won an overwhelming victory, he couldn't have conducted himself any different than this questionable crowning of this President, which is now being investigated and reanalyzed.  There are books coming out all over the place that show all of the--the intent to deprive people of their ability to choose a president and that the Supreme Court, itself, finally weighed in to make sure that nothing could go wrong. They didn't even want to risk taking it to the House of Representatives where--which is supposed to be ultimately be the institution that resolves elections that are in dispute--federal elections that are in dispute.  They said, "No. We're not even going to do that. We're closing this thing down now by a one-vote majority."  All of the conservatives determined that George [W.] Bush would become the forty-third President of the United States. So what this has done is put a cloud over this presidency that we cannot remove, but it has done something else, too.  It's motivated more people to realize that their one vote does count.  It's illustrated how a brilliant person like Ralph Nader [consumer activist] could combine to deprive [U.S. Vice President] Al Gore of the presidency, fully aware, as was I and most other students of American politics, that his insurgency emphasized in the right places, which he did, would deprive Al Gore--could and did deprive Al Gore of the presidency. So there are so many lessons, so much excitement, so much unhappiness, so much concern so much redetermination to improve the system, and we're now examining, federally, what we ought to do in the light of the Civil Rights Commission Report on Florida and other places in the country. And, by the way, there were serious problems in many other places in the United States in addition to Florida.

Speaker 1: I have family from Detroit [Michigan] and I remember going there, you know, even as a young child and the drug, you know, epidemic being so strong there. And yet a lot of money has gone into, you know, this drug and it looks like--I mean, into the whole drug issue and yet it doesn't seem to have necessarily helped and I'm wondering, you know, given, you know, this history that goes back some years, what your thoughts about that whole thing are?
Speaker 2: Well, what we found is that the war against drugs has turned into the prosecution of African Americans and minorities for possession.  Many of these people that are prosecuted frequently have no violence connected to whatever drug possession they may have.  That they're not major sellers of drugs, but that it's a easy way to rack up statistics about people being arrested and prosecuted, but the selective method of going into inner cities where you can easily get young people, particularly young African American males and Hispanic males, and subject them to mandatory minimum prison sentences, which then result in the necessity to build more prisons, which has become a growth industry in itself, all points to the incredibly poor criminal justice system and the racism that's connected with our prosecution of crime in America. And so now it's an open secret that African Americans disproportionately are arrested, more disproportionately charged with more crimes, more disproportionately convicted, more disproportionately incarcerated for long periods of time, more disproportionately made members of death rows across the country. And there is now a growing counter-movement in which we're beginning to realize--it's hard for me to imagine that even people that support this present system can deny to themselves that it isn't working and that it will never work because on the one hand, we're letting in--we're letting in huge amounts of drugs or, to be as fair as I can, we're unable to stop huge amounts of drugs from coming in.  We're putting huge amounts of money in trying to eradicate clients--we have over a billion dollars going to Colombia, in a plan that even casual inspection can show you that it can never and will not work in terms of reducing--all they do is move to another location, and business goes on as usual. And that more and more people are coming to the view that the drug problem and its consequent addiction is a health problem more than it is a criminal problem because unless we are investigating and prosecuting the huge international cartels that traffic in drugs--that is one thing, but they are very hard to get.  They have more lawyers than the government.  They have accountants.  This is a very enterprising business activity and industry so it's much easier to bust kids standing on the corner who you can see and look at, watch them selling drugs, and after they are arrested somebody else will replace them almost the next night, making themselves eligible, but it does nothing to deal with the problem.  In the meantime, many people go to problems with a drug habit that is sometimes worsened in the prison system because drugs are available in so many prisons. So we're looking at alternative courts.  We're looking at getting rid of the crack/cocaine disparity in which it takes, you know, a hundred times more cocaine to get the same sentence that it takes to get crack--a crack conviction. So we're--we're all beginning--we're looking at the D.A.R.E. [Drug Abuse Resistance Education] program that was hailed as a police program, and we're looking at the "Just Say No" program.  We're beginning to really see huge flaws in the ability of these programs to deter young people from using addictive drugs.  Now, that has spawned another theory that we may want to legalize drugs, which is a completely different thing from decriminalizing some drugs, which is something you have to be very careful about because it would be hard for me to continue going into the schools telling people not to use drugs if we've--if I've just participated in making them publicly acceptable.  They either have to have some detriment to the users and to society or they don't. And there are very few drugs that I don't see as having an addictive quality or a serious detriment to health. So we're trying to get into treatment and alternate methods and drug courts where people are trying--where we attempt to apply the little medical knowledge we have about how you move a person from addiction to non-addiction, and now we're met with this very challenging conservative viewpoint of saying, "Well yes, we'll give you drug courts, but it'll be on the condition that if they mess up, they go back and serve their sentence," which really increases the pressure on a person that's already under enormous pressure, and there are so many things--you know, dealing with human beings in areas that are as delicate as the central nervous system and how each one of us react to the environment of drugs and their usage and to say, unconditionally, that you've got to succeed or you go to prison, is probably not a sound medical decision to be made, but we're making headway, merely because there's so many people, whose--whose--who are--have someone in their family who's been incarcerated, particularly people of color. But the prison system is growing because of this thing and it's not reducing drug usage, or at least not measurably, not in a significant way.

Speaker 1: I'll just go to jazz, because you were--you were the sponsor recently of the Jazz Preservation Act [1987].
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Right, and jazz has--you're a lover of jazz, and you're--I mean, to your heart and soul, you're a lover of jazz. And I'm wondering when did that love affair start?
Speaker 2: Well, in Detroit [Michigan]--Detroit has always been a jazz city. And it started with the advent of the particular form of jazz known as bebop. And in New York [New York] where Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, later Miles Davis, Max Roach [drummer], and all these legendary people started, during--during one period of time, there was a shortage of acetate which went into the making of the twelve-inch records--well, they were ten-inch records first. And the government banned the production of all records. And while--but while this was going on, bebop was being developed on 42nd Street [New York, New York], that was the center of it.  You could walk up and down the block and all these future famous names were all leading groups and experimenting. Thelonious Monk was there, J.J. Johnson [trombonist] and it went on and on and on. And when the government finally lifted the ban, the music had advanced so far that it was like astounding to hear this new music--this new jazz music. And I can--'til this day, remember the first bebop record I ever heard was Charlie Parker and Miles Davis, playing on one side, a little red--a red disk, 'Now is the Time' and 'Billie's Bounce.' And it was--it was an earth-shattering artistic experience for me. Culturally, I moved to a position I had never been before.

Speaker 1: I had always been interested in music.  I got a  mus- a letter in music at Northwestern High School [Detroit, Michigan].  And I knew local musicians.  I had a deep interest--I played in a band. But this music was truly revolutionary jazz--creative, independent, unapologetic.  It was saying something.  It was speaking to those who yearned to have the freedom to express themselves. And it swept me up and it's never let me go.  I still study.  I have a--one tune I want to play for you as soon as we finish. But it was so important to me that when I got to [U.S.] Congress, that I support the National Endowment of Arts [sic., National Endowment for the Arts], the National Endowment of Humanities [sic., National Endowment for the Humanities], create jazz panels, lift musicians up and bring them, especially jazz musicians who may not carry all of the celebrity and income of other forms of American music. And so I've had a wonderful time working from one end of the country, as a matter of fact, around the world with jazz creators, and now people that are using fusion, jazz fusion, in Haiti, for example,  in Europe, in Scandinavia, in Africa, we have everybody doing this music. And so we created this bill, Joint Concurrent Resolution HR57, which declared--the Congress declared jazz to be a unique American treasure. And I never had any easier time getting a bill passed in my life. Because it turned out everybody, nearly just about everybody, loved jazz in the [U.S.] Senate and in the [U.S.] House [of Representatives]. And I'll never forget the time I was on the elevator and this old gentleman, he was congressman--they called him 'Judge' somebody--and he was from one of the Carolinas, and he was talking about John Coltrane. This being my favorite artist, I couldn't believe my ears, when we got off the elevator I said, "Pardon, me, sir."  I said, "I can't believe you--how did you come to like John and enjoy John Coltrane so much?"  And he said, "Well John, it's like this."  He said "My son was doing his dissertation and he selected John Coltrane," and he said, "For six months, that's all I heard around the house was John Coltrane."  He said "By, golly! I began to like that music too, and I still do." And I realized how this music can penetrate and what are the creative forces of this music, which is, after all, African American inspired. It comes out of the African experience, but it's the period of enslavement that combines to create the gospel and the rhythm and blues and the jazz and finally the bebop and then you go on, I guess, to avant-garde. But this is music with a cry.  It's not all sad music, but it all has a blues undercurrent, even the--the--the fast music. And a few people have become artists that--that really spell it out. And have, as you study this--as I've become an amateur musicologist, you find that those who conduct classical music--Leonard Bernstein had a great relationship with Miles Davis.  Dizzy Gillespie worked with other great classical composers and I use "classical" with very obviously knowing that to many people, jazz is the classical music. But many of the--the creators and the promoters of opera and classical music were keenly aware of the artistry and talent required to be a top-rank jazz performer.  Ken Burns [documentary filmmaker] has done an incredible--made an incredible contribution with his series on jazz ['Jazz']. Wynton Marsalis who's gone from Dixieland to classical music to jazz and back again, all the great artists--and I'm deliberately not beginning to name any of them because the lists are so long, but this is America's great music, largely uncelebrated.  We have our favorites: Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and John Coltrane, but the music itself is a unique form that--that has no precedence. And so when you study all kinds of music, you realize that this is a music--and of course, Wynton is busy building a jazz center in New York [New York], and others are beginning to do the same in other places, and it's being studied. There are degree-granting departments in almost all universities now for jazz and people can now go to school to study it and come out pretty good jazz musicians, a far cry from how you learned it in the--in the smoky cafes and nightclubs of yesteryear. So it's been very exciting.

Speaker 1: I had a trip--an opportunity to go on a trip with Dizzy Gillespie and James Moody [saxophonist] to Africa [in 1989, sponsored by United States Information Agency].  And we went to Senegal and Morocco and other places.  The presidents of those countries treated our group and Dizzy Gillespie, in particular--if he had been the President of the United States. I mean, they declared the first night of his performance was all for the government and the important dignitaries of the particular government. Some had seen and heard him before.  The President of Senegal and his wife had known Dizzy Gillespie when he came to Washington [D.C.] to play at Blues Alley when he was a student at Howard University [Washington, D.C.]. And it goes on and on. And the musicians of each country would turn out and Dizzy would hold--they would hold these sessions that would go for hours and hours in which Dizzy would learn about their traditions and their culture and their instruments. And Dizzy would teach them about his horn and how they approached harmonization and what chord structure meant and how jazz--what the thought processes and the techniques of jazz were. It was just incredible that here we were seeing this great explosion in American music that had an African American base that is now widely celebrated.

Speaker 1: We still have a lot to do in giving musicians--jazz musicians will almost all tell you, to a man or woman,  that they are treated with far more respect and frequently compensated much more [abroad].  Many of them, Dexter Gordon [saxophonist] and Herbie Hancock, and many lived abroad for many years, Johnny, all these musicians, they just said, "Look, people appreciate us more.  You're not just a jazz musician in America.  Over here, you are regarded as an artist, as a talented person to whom our whole society should pay you respect." And so we--it's been--I've been rewarded. Now I know all of my musician friends and I mean, what a thrill it is. And I'm actually doing my work when I associate with them. It's part of my job description so it's been a very exciting and wonderful time.  As you can see, I collect instruments from many of the countries that I travel in, and it's just--it's just so wonderful that every now and then I am celebrated, commended by jazz organizations in this country for the completely enjoyable work that I've done to make this music more respected and the people that create it, more adequately rewarded for their talent.
Speaker 2: See and that's wonderful. So it's you and Ken Burns [documentary filmmaker], and even you--(laughs)?
Speaker 1: Yes. And we invited, for my lecture in--in 2001 in Washington [D.C.] for the thirty-first Congressional Black Caucus, I have invited Ken Burns to be the guest lecturer, and I am sure he will come with as much audio as he needs. Then we're gonna have--we're gonna have a performance section too, where some of the distinguished artists will perform so that's a wonderful--wonderful--I look forward to it, in working with these artists year in and year out, but particularly for the Congressional Black Caucus events in Washington [D.C.] in September [2001].

Speaker 1: Is there any favorite story you'd like to tell about any of your favorite artists--any one of them?  Whether it's, you know, Miles Davis or John Coltrane or--I mean, anything that you would like to sort of share, any interaction you've had with them that--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I've had--well, let me just tell you about the John Coltrane who was very enormously popular in Detroit [Michigan], a jazz city. And in this little club on Dexter [Avenue] and northwest Detroit, the Jone [ph] Bar--hot--all of the John Coltrane supporters and admirers and fans crowded in. And we were listen--John Coltrane.  It was just wonderful. And we'd take a break and we would go outside and John Coltrane was so conscientious that to prepare for the next set, he would start practicing again, practicing the numbers that he was going to perform. And we were out there laughing--we would--if John Coltrane sat on his head and played upside-down, we would probably be just as thrilled, but he was-- even before less than a hundred people, he was a perfectionist, and finally he moved--and he--as a matter of fact he married a Detroit musician, Alice Coltrane [pianist], and they came there to the same place years--a few years later. And he was--had then moved mostly into avant-garde where one number would take up the whole set and it would go on and on.  Now, mind you, I had never talked to Coltrane and then at this set, he came over to the bar and we started talking.  I introduced myself. And I'll never forget this:  I said, "You know, I hate to say this to you because I'm a great admirer, but, you know, you've lost me.  Your music, I mean, you know."  Do you know what his reaction was?  He apologized to me by saying--he says, "I know, I understand this."  He said, "I'm sorry for that."  He said, "But, I have played everything in the style that I began with and I have to move on and--and so this is, is where I've gone to." And to this day, I shall never forget that in my only contact with John Coltrane and us talking together, I was critical.  All I could give was criticism to the artist I admire more than any other artist I have ever met in my life. And I keep saying, "How could I have not commended him for all the wonderful music he's provided with the world." But I had to tell him--I had to give him my opinion of what avant-garde meant to me. And he apologized that he could not live up to my high standards.

Speaker 1: Your parents lived to see a lot of your success, in fact, your mother [Lucille Simpson Conyers] just passed away last year? Ninety-four, right? They brought to you a great sort of heritage themselves.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And--and I'm wondering how you feel that you have sort of continued that heritage that they brought to you?
Speaker 2: Well, actually my father [John Conyers, Sr.], by being a--a union leader, he understood the relationship between economic survival, earning a living, the racism that frequently precluded black men from supporting their families,  the fanatical dislike of collective bargaining in the American industrial system, and I got--I got that from a very early age. I went around with him to the local union meetings and to the picnics and the Christmas parties of working people and their families. And I wasn't  feeling anything special because I was from a working family. My dad happened to--having come from Georgia, Monroe, Georgia, he had the talent to help organize and motivate people to join the union, which was-- was difficult work in the thirties and the forties. So I--I--he always wanted to become a lawyer, too.  He was always reading Clarence Darrow [attorney] and there were all these books about lawyers laying around and yet he never said, "I want you to be a lawyer," which I keep trying to resist telling my kids [John III and Carl Edward.] And it just--all of us, every one of us his four boys, all wanted to be lawyers. And two of us became lawyers, one was in law school, and the other didn't become a lawyer, but we all had this view about being a lawyer that somehow. And so that--to become a policy maker and to make the laws is only, you know, a step away.  My mother had this strong feeling about supporting her family.  She campaigned for me so relentlessly. We had a organization of women, we called it 'Women for Conyers', which would be a sexist term nowadays. But--and then we had the men's group,  they were called the Lancers, and there was a men's group and a women's group. And my mother worked in that--she covered polls so regularly, that years after she was not able to come out and stand in front of polls all day, people would ask me where my mother was.  Why wasn't she there?  "We didn't see her at the last election, John.  Is she okay?"  But she gave--she supported me and all of us, in a way that you just realize, you know, what a angel of mercy she was.  And my father--when we started this business about [U.S.] Congress,  he said, "Now, wait a minute.  Wait a minute, Congress? Are we being real here?"  I mean, he's pragmatic guy.  Now he's the political person in the family. But he had to be persuaded that this wasn't some completely nutty lark that he had to rescue his son from. And--but my mother, she was--that was it.  She was with the program and getting up other ladies in the neighborhood and the people at church, I mean, she was, I mean win, lose or draw, it couldn't matter less to her.  She could figure out that this had logic and was well-reasoned.  My dad was a little cautious--but once this became clear that first of all I was going to do it, and secondly of all, this was not a lark, well, then he was, I mean, you couldn't--you couldn't keep him down with horses. But coming out of a family like that, I had a strength and developed an attitude about life and about governance that controls me even today.

Speaker 1: I believe we can do it--we, the people--that we can make change.  We can change drug policy.  We can eradicate the scourge of racism that's dogged this country from the beginning.  It can be done.  I've always said that I can take my issues to any working-class community regardless of race and show anybody that these policies are more in your interest than some conservative.  I believe that.  I've done it.  I don't--I'm not selling snake oil.  This isn't a--this isn't crazy.  This is how democracy works through all of us being participants in it, but, you know, if you don't have enough belief in the system to be able to go cast the ballot rather than succumb to the cynicism that, "What could one vote change?"  there's a--there's a huge negative factor that works on people who've been misused and tricked and taken advantage of and everything else. And I come along and say, "We can all do it together collectively."  They say, "Oh, yeah, well." And so I am blessed to have been able to--out of my environment, form a philosophy that makes me so strong. I am perfect for this job because once we figure out a direction, I've got people that help me figure the direction out, and we all believe so it's, you see democracy in a minuscule form, but you also see that it can apply not just in the country, but in the world.  We are now world citizens.  It's not just the economies that have been globalized, it's the six billion people in it.  In a way that bodes some very serious changes in the future. Because now working people begin to look beyond their city and state, they begin to look at the exploitation and the oppression that's been historically visited on people as a part of the way a neo-capitalist system works. Somebody gets ripped off. Somebody's exploited. Some people are taken advantage of some people give up to others who don't give back. And this--we've finally come to this point in human progress that this can be looked at from a position that it has never been able to do in the previous few centuries that we've had a United States of America with a constitution like this. So it's exciting that as people look at us as this engine of prosperity and technology and goods and services, they also see a system that could be improved upon, that everybody could use. And--so all of a sudden, the guy from the West Side of Detroit [Michigan] that wanted to be a congressman to help his little corner of the--of the city is now looking at the international questions of the twenty-first century.  It's amazing that we have this influence--that my little thirty-eight colleagues [in the Congressional Black Caucus] have an influence far beyond their numbers. And there are so many exciting problems of healthcare and public education that need to be dealt with--that, you know, are--are--it's just brimming with new possibilities, and here's [John] Conyers right in the middle of all of this fabulous activity.

Speaker 1: But you like being black, don't you?
Speaker 2: Well, I like being me.  I don't know what it would be not to be black, I mean that's all I've ever been. But, you know, I am proud of--I'm proud of who I am and I am very proud of where I come from.  Now it may be--who's to say, that I would--I have been just as proud if I had been an Irishman.  I am--I think people ought to celebrate--if you celebrate your birth, you ought to celebrate the circumstances and the forebearers that allowed you to come to be there, you didn't just happen. And so all of these things are connected, but it's your understanding of who you are and where you are and what your potential is that gives you a philosophy. So many people don't have the opportunity to develop their own philosophy because they're battered by the oppressive circumstances of where they live or what the color of their skin is or what their opportunity is to get a decent education or whether they can get health services that will allow them to grow up and mature in a very human way. So providing those things is really a pre-condition to fulfilling this constitutional ideal of a democratic society that we've spelled out.  You can't be hungry and promote democracy.  You can't contribute to society if you don't get the best education possible.  You can't be--live to your fullest potential if you can't have health services that help you from the time that you're born until the time you leave the planet. And so it's been my rare privilege to be put with the [Dr. Martin Luther] Kings and the Rosa Parkses and the John Coltranes [jazz saxophonist] and the Joe Louises [professional boxer].
