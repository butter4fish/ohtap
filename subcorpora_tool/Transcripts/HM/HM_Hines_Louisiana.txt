Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Say what?
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?  Or maybe a favorite bible verse?

Speaker 1: Those are your brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But she didn't--you know, when I was, back when I was a child, you didn't ask questions, and they didn't tell you everything like they do now.  Children te- people tell you things now that you didn't know until you were grown, and after you were grown you didn't know the truth about it.  They didn't tell you all about. But I heard her say she was the mother of eleven children, but I don't know if they was deceased or whether they growed up and lived a while or what.  I didn't know that.

Speaker 1: Okay.  So, actually--
Speaker 2: But he was here in slavery.

Speaker 1: Okay.  And you say that your father, Ben, that his parents were the ones that were in slavery?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you, do you know anything about them being in slavery?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, unh-uh.  I just know what they said.  My granddaddy was in slavery, and he said Jack Bimble [ph.] was his master.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's, that's what I was alluding to.  What was your father's name--your father's father's name--or your grandfather, Celie's husband, what was his name?
Speaker 2: Grandma Celie's husband?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Gabe.
Speaker 1: Gabe?
Speaker 2: Gabe was his name, they said he was named Gabe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said that--

Speaker 2: Bimble.
Speaker 1: Jack Bimble was the slave master?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what did they tell you about the slave master, Jack Bimble?
Speaker 2: Oh, my granddaddy said Jack Bimble was a nice man to him.  And he had a plantation to sell other men, but he didn't beat them.  He didn't beat them up, and he didn't have them beat up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he let them work, and he said that was enough.  He said he wouldn't let them be beat up.
Story_ID: 493248
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your childhood [in Alabama].  And you told me that you have six brothers and sisters.  Tell me about the plantation or the farm in which you lived.
Speaker 2: What about it?
Speaker 1: Tell me about it.  What was it like?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, folks planted cotton and corn and peanuts.  We called it peanuts--pindar nuts--and ground peas, it's all the same thing.  They call it nuts now; it was peanuts--pindars--and ground peas.  Talking about a peanut, that's one thing.  All of it was the same thing.  And then my mother [Callie Banks Summerlin] read the ladies almanac, and my daddy [Ben Summerlin] and her would plant.  And what they planted would be just like they said it was going to be.  If they planted anything that they said it was going to be doubled up on top, you know, like okra--they call it okra now, but they said okree then.  And so it's just different, you know.  But it's the same thing.  But it would be clustered up, just like they said.  Peanuts, what you call ground peas, and pindars.  They had a time to plant the things in the ground, it would just be full like that.  And the same thing with beans.  You could just get them by the handful, because she planted on the sign that the almanac said.  She knew these signs in the almanac, and my daddy, they knew the signs.  He killed hogs, he killed them at a certain time.  He said if you kill them at a certain time of the moon, the oil would come out of them.  And if you kill them at a certain time, they wouldn't be--the meat would be dry, it would be thick; it wouldn't just--so that's what's the matter with it.  When you cook, when you're frying meat, and you slice it up and it don't be thinned out, it's because it was killed on the wrong time of the moon. They killed them--same day--they killed at the time of the moon.
Speaker 1: So, your mother used the ladies almanac to determine what time of year they should plant certain things?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She'd look in there and read it, and tell what time--you know, they looked like little men and different fish, and all that around.  Well, she knowed what sign to plant the go fishing and anything like that.  They knew that, and that's what they went by.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you have plenty of food to eat?
Speaker 2: Plenty of food, yes, all the time.  Yeah, that's one thing I can say, all of my lifetime.  My daddy believed in plenty of food, and he had plenty of food.  And he killed hogs and cows for himself and had plenty of meat, beef.  A big place they called the smokehouse.  They cured that meat, and he salted it and put it away and hung it up in the smokehouse and let it dry.  And they had a hole dug down in the ground.  Now what they would smoke the meat--they would smoke with--what they would smoke the meat with would be oak wood or hickory wood.  But the pine wood would give it a bad taste; they wouldn't put that there.  And he'd have that meat hanging up on bear grace.  They called it bear grace.  And it was so thick when--they'd stick it in the needles and run it through there.  They had postings, little small postings, and they'd hang that meat down, all the hams and middlings and all the meat up there.  My mother would make sausage--oh I'm sorry darling--she would make sausage, and she knew how to make the sausage without--she didn't never have no recipe to make it.  And then the country sausage, she used to make a lot of that; the white people would have it, she'd make it for them.
Story_ID: 493249
Speaker 1: And tell me, now you were born in ninet- in 1898.
Speaker 2: That's what they told me.  I have a birth certificate on there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got it from Montgomery [Alabama], up there where they make them, (cough) yeah.
Speaker 1: Now tell me about where you lived.  Did your parents [Callie Banks Summerlin and Ben Summerlin] own the land that you lived on?
Speaker 2: Well, no.  But my granddaddy [Gabe Summerlin] had a plantation.  They had a plantation up there (cough) for the children.  Every one of them had a certain portion, but he died when he was, you know, when the ba- when he- when my daddy was a young baby. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And he had a place for every one of those children to live.  But after growing up, I don't know why, but they went to other places to live.  And so they left it with the oldest son, and he had a place.
Speaker 1: So where you li- who owned the land on which you lived?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't--
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying who owned the land that you lived on?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was my, that was la- that was my granddaddy's--my daddy left that for his children.  But it was his daddy's place where he lived.
Speaker 1: I see, I see.  Okay, all right.  Now do you know how much education, if any, did your mother and father have?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.
Story_ID: 493250
Speaker 1: Well, tell me what your typical day would be like as you were a young girl working on the farm?  What was your day like?
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't mi- I don't know.  I didn't mind working, I liked to work.  I didn't mind working, never did.
Speaker 1: So what were your chores?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What were your chores?
Speaker 2: My chores?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: I liked to pick cotton.
Speaker 1: You liked to pick cotton?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Tell me why.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know. (Cough) It was because my daddy [Ben Summerlin] would have three rows.  He'd have on each side and one in the middle.  And it was just a game to pick cotton and see could he grab more bolls of cotton than me.  And we'd laugh and play, all of us, but we could really pick some cotton.  I enjoyed it.  Folks hated to go out in the hot sun like that, but I didn't mind it.
Speaker 1: What, what--how old were you when you first picked cotton?
Speaker 2: Don't know.
Speaker 1: Were you a little girl (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, small.
Story_ID: 493251
Speaker 1: We worked 'til, you know, (unclear). You see, people didn't know a whole lots like they do now.  They didn't, it wasn't a lot of education for the children to go to school.  And so you--and then the teachers they had liked to live with my mama, because they liked cooking Callie [Callie Banks Summerlin] to cook for them; they'd eat that food.
Speaker 2: So did you attend school?
Speaker 1: Yes, I went to school.
Speaker 2: Do you remember the name of the school?
Speaker 1: B. Branch [ph.].
Speaker 2: Say it again.
Speaker 1: B. Branch.
Speaker 2: B. Branch?
Speaker 1: B. Branch School.
Speaker 2: And how long did you go to school there?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So tell me some of the things that you would do on the farm to pass the time, after working?  Was there any time left for fun with your brothers and sisters?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, we played, you know.  You know it's like you have time to eat dinner, and time, you know, like that, play.
Speaker 2: All right.  Now when you went to school, tell me about what the school looked like.
Speaker 1: Well, it wasn't no large school.  It was a, one small place, about as big as from back there to up here.  It was a small place, it wasn't no large school.  And there was no long time to go.
Speaker 2: How far was it away from your house?
Speaker 1: I can't tell you, because it's long roads.  You know, like now children ride a couple of buses--a couple of, couple of blocks, I'm trying to say.  They pick the children up and carry them, they have a bus.  It wasn't no buses then.  But we walked along, I don't know how much, but long roads.  You know, it was uphill or downhill, and all like that.
Story_ID: 493252

Speaker 1: When you left school, what grade were you in?  What grade did you finish?
Speaker 2: I don't recall, because the teacher lived with us, and you didn't have no certain grade then.  And the teacher taught me- us mostly at the house.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the teacher's name?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had different tea- (cough)--
Speaker 1: The one that lived at the house with you?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: The teacher that lived at the house with you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that was Agee Paynes [ph.] (unclear). Agee Payne.  He said he was from, I can't call the name now.  I don't know where he was from, but anyway they both lived with my mama [Callie Banks Summerlin] at different times.  The teachers that I went to school to was Gertrude Iola Gooden [ph.], and Ophelia Penn [ph.], and let me see (unclear). I can't think of this other name.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: So when did you leave Alabama?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: When did you leave Alabama?
Speaker 2: They come up here, but we had lived in Florida, and then I lived a while in Mississippi.  But it's because my son, he was an electrician, and he was showing some men how to cut a pole down.  And he stepped back some kind of way and it fell on his leg, when the war was going on.  And he didn't go, they didn't send him to the war.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I want to go back.  Right before you left Alabama, or any city that you lived in in the South, do you remember anything about lynchings that were going on?  What was going on in the South that you--
Speaker 2: Lynching?

Speaker 1: No, but I mean when you were in Alabama--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember, or did you know anybody that was lynched?
Speaker 2: I don't know anybody that was lynched, but I heard them say that there was people lynched.  Just like a cousin, he was a preacher, George Tiggs [ph.], they k- they lynched him.
Speaker 1: They lynched him.  Why?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Do you know why they lynched him?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  Because he was--so they were saying--I didn't hear nothing about it.  They said he was a--George Tiggs was a preacher, and he was preaching that all men are created equal.  Somebody told the other white people, and they said he kept telling them that and they didn't believe it.  And they went up to see, and so that's what it was killed about.  They said he wa- he didn't equal them.  And so I don't know nothing on the--what they said.

And he was easy to catch on and everything, so he was a foreman of the fruit grove in Florida until he left to come to Detroit [Michigan].  Some of his friends had told him he could get a job h- up here.  And so he came up, and shortly after he was here he was hired at Packards [Packard Motor Car Company] for a foreman.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother did not allow--when I came along, people's children wasn't like they are now where they'd have a book, or your teacher would show you.  Mama could cook, but Mama didn't teach me how to make a cake and how to do that.  Mama could cook for the white people or anybody.  She had these big sifters like that.  She'd go--you know, they used to have bran in it, and you'd sift it out.  She'd go in there, and all she wanted to know was did you have your sugar and your flavor and all like that, and eggs.  People had--she raised so many chickens, oh, lord.  And she'd go in there and break up her eggs, and she didn't measure it or nothing.  And it would just be. And my baby brother, the youngest one, he wasn't the baby, but he was next to the baby.  He could cook just like that, too.
Speaker 1: So, now tell me about moving from Alabama to Florida.  What was, was life different there for you?

Story_ID: 493259
Speaker 1: Yeah, plenty work to do in Alabama.  That's where cotton and everything was growing, and peanuts, and all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So after you got married and you were living in Alabama with your husband [Arthur Hines], then you continued to pick cotton and peanuts?
Speaker 1: The cotton picking was in, nowhere but in Alabama.  It wasn't no cotton picking down there, as I know of.  They had beans and other things.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what about sugarcane?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Sugarcane.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, all of that was there.  All of this stuff was in Alabama, that's where it came from.  And they had peas, and corn, cotton, all of the stuff like that.
Speaker 2: So, that's the type of work that you did until you and your husband left to go to Florida?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 493260
Speaker 1: Now in Florida, after a number of years there, you said that your husband [Arthur Hines], some of his friends told him that he could get a job in Detroit [Michigan], and that's when you moved to Detroit.
Speaker 2: After he left Alabama, he went to Florida and he got to be the foreman of the--
Speaker 1: Foreman of the grove?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The fruit grove.
Speaker 2: Some of his friends had been telling him before he even left Alabama that he could get a be- bigger job or something like that.  And so, he didn't go.  His friend would come back and forth.  But after coming up, each time he was lucky enough to get a job.  He wasn't never having no trouble being at the place at any time.
Story_ID: 493261
Speaker 1: Did you have any children when you moved to Detroit [Michigan]?

Speaker 2: Oh, Allean [Allean Hines House].  And Booker T. [Booker T. Hines] was the oldest one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Allean and Raymond [Raymond Hines].  I just had three children.
Speaker 1: Now tell me about when you arrived in Detroit.  Was it a big difference from where you lived in Florida?
Speaker 2: Well, now, (laughter) you know it's a world of difference.  Because when I first moved here, see, my husband [Arthur Hines] had got a room from somebody.  It was hard to find even a room, now you can get a house.  But the thing about it, when we moved here, the large big buildings, we hadn't seen them before.  And so I asked the lady where we was rooming--you know, I had to go by the place where I had to buy some things, and I did.  She said, "Do you want somebody to bring you back?"  I said, "No, I can get back."  I know how to go back over there. And the streets--I went on down there and got an armful of, more than I could hardly handle, but I seen these signs all about, these signs.  And I just had to stop and rest.  And it said, well, there was no standing.  I said, "Well, I know I can't stand here." I see another one up the street and I sit down there.  I get there, it's no standing.  I said, "Well, what kind of town is this, no standing?  If I can't stand, I know I better not sit down, or the police will get me."  (Laughter) And it was for the cars, but I didn't know that.  And I walked and I walked.  My arms were tired, and I kept looking.  Well, maybe I can sit down up, stop up there.  And it was no standing.  I said, "Well, what the hell is this town?"  (Laughter) And I got back, I got back up there to the lady's house, and I said, "I'm so tired."  I said, "What is it--?"  I said, "How come we can't stand?  Everything's no standing?"

And it was just so black and pretty, and just shining.  I wanted it to stop so I can see.  I know it would stop if he got hung up in that sand.  Sure enough, the sand was so deep it got just against the house, and he just went down.  They got out and they were ringing and ringing and ringing; I don't know what they was doing.  But he had to, he was just beating and knocking.  Children were running all across the field, running.  And they see this car and they're glad, too, to see something. And I--unh-uh, honey. And so--

Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what it was.  Oh, lord, it was the prettiest black thing.  And he had to just beat. And they'd get down and crank or do something down there, and beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat to get it started and get back in.  And they'd go up the hill and come back down.  And that's what I wanted to do.  And that thing played around there (laughter) until the people come from the field, and they helped them get out of the sand after they ate the- ate their dinner.  They came out and helped him out of there.
Speaker 1: So you were telling the people about it in Detroit?
Speaker 2: About?
Speaker 1: About the first time you saw the car?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, different ones was asking me.  After telling this one about it, then he'd tell that one, that he heard me telling that.  But honestly, that was the truth.  But it used to--the hills were so high down in the sand bed, you couldn't--oh, lordy.

You have to have contact with the people to let them know you want a place there.  And if you're not on the street, if you're on a business street and they don't have that shop there, have shops there, then you couldn't do that.
Speaker 1: So, how did you afford to pay to open your shop?  Where did you get the, the seed money to open your shop (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh well, well, you see, the thing about it, we had bought the house out from where I had the beauty shop.  And then one thing, when you're working and you make any money, if it's a little or much, you don't just throw that money away, you save it.  We had money when we came up here.

Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you learned how to rivet.  And then where did you work on the planes? Where did you work on the planes?
Speaker 2: Well, I worked wherever they said work.  Because my main thing was in the tail end of the plane, because I could buck and rivet, too.
Speaker 1: Buck, what does that mean?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You said buck (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That is you hit it, and now I'm on the outside, and I got to know your knock.  And they'd never mess up anything when I went to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where did they send you to work on the planes?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Where did they send you to work on the planes?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, down out from Hudson.  Where were the planes?  I don't know.  Down from--the airplane--oh, I don't know just where that place was.  I can't think of it.

Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, womens, womens, yeah.  Womens and men.
Speaker 1: They learned how to rivet?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  They had to go to school to learn how.
Speaker 1: What other schooling was there to help with the planes?  What other occupations were there?  What other things could people learn besides riveting?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, down in the plant they learned how to make the pieces that go with the plane.
Speaker 1: So did you enjoy that work?  Was it hard work?
Speaker 2: Well, no, it wasn't hard, but you just had to know what you're doing.
Speaker 1: And tell me how, how did you rivet a plane?  Take me through the steps of how you did that.
Speaker 2: How you rivet?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: You, the man or the woman, you're on one side and I'm on the other side.  And I don't care how I knock, you got to know my knock, and I ain't the only one knocking.  It's up and down.  Everybody that's on there, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, just like that.  And I got to know your knock from anybody else's.  That is, you have to know how to take that rivet out--if it's crooked or if it's something. Or it's right.  I got to know how to knock back to you, just like that.  You on one side, I'm on the other side.  And all of them down there, they waiting 'til you hit. Everybody's hitting, hitting, hitting, hitting, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  But now, it don't look like you could know what I'm hitting unless you had studied to know, and listen to how you knock.  But you're knocking and putting that rivet in.
Speaker 1: And you did that for how long?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  (Laughter) I didn't keep up.  Oh, I sure don't know.

Speaker 2: In the '60s [1960s], I'm trying to say.
Speaker 1: In the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Because you, you graduated from beauty college [Bee Dew Beauty College] in 1946.  So that would make you around forty-six years old, because you got your license in 1947.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: And so you owned the beauty parlor, was it more than ten years?
Speaker 2: Was it what?
Speaker 1: More than ten years that you owned the beauty parlor?

Speaker 1: Tell me about some of the things that you have learned.  Wha- when you look back over your life, what are some of the things that stand out in your, in your life?
Speaker 2: Well, the thing about being obedient, like my mother [Callie Banks Summerlin] told me.  You belong on the land which the Lord gave you.  And she asked me if I wanted to live a long time.  And if you do, you have to obey and recognize, and do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  No lying, don't steal, don't try to do what you can't do.  And do--go to the church and do what they tell you to do there.  But now I don't know what the longest, how long my life is supposed to be, nobody knows but the Master.  And you see, the thing about it is I have tried to be obedient.  And her last words she told me, she said, "You're going to live a long time because you've been an obedient child."  And I have tried to be.  I never would give her any trouble no kind of way, and my daddy [Ben Summerlin] either.  When they said something, I didn't question it.  You know, now when children say, "Why?" and "How come?"  And doing so and so, doing so and so.  Unh-uh, you didn't do that.  They said it and that settled it, whatever it was.  And you didn't be talking to grown folks.  And when you was--when you come--when you was in here--you're the mother and somebody pump on the door, and it's so and so here to see Callie.  You know not to be sitting up there and there trying to see what they said, and trying to be in the conversation.  You know to get away from there and go another way.  You didn't get in no trouble asking questions, "How come?" and "Why?"  Unh-uh, no that. You didn't do that.  But now they do different.

My mama didn't know how old she was.  But when they asked, you was whatever them white folks said you was.  Now, the white folks said they didn't know; it wasn't on record when she passed.  They didn't know nothing about that.  But I do know she was a good--cooking Callie [Callie Banks Summerlin] cooked the best kind of chicken pies and biscuits and brim gravy, ham gravy and all that stuff like that. Go, put her away and everything. Ain't nothing wrong with cooking Callie. We won't ever forget her.
Speaker 1: Do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But now, you can put down there a hundred--no, she said--not a hundred.  She said she was eighty-four, but we knew she was older than that.  But cooking Callie, talking about biscuits, and chicken gravy, and ham gravy, and ham and all like that, chicken pie.

Speaker 2: Obedience to your parents.  Be good to your parents and your--others.  Do unto others as you would have them to do to you.  You don't want nobody to take your, take your toys, and you don't want nobody to steal things that you put down, and all like that.  If you don't want that done, don't you do it to somebody else.  Recognize the people, and go to the church and do what the pastor tells you to do.  Because he's teaching you right, to live, that your time will be belonged on the land.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, whatever they prefer, in a way of speaking. (Unclear) that you asked me that question. Because we only live one time, and we don't know what time that's going to be.  But when the Master calls us, if we lack one thing, we lack it all, we lack it all.  We can pretend and make out, but he knows what's in your heart and mind.  As far as color, richness, and all like that, he, he made everything, and he knows what's going to happen, because he made it.  He knows what it's going to be.  You can think how it's going to be, but he knows what it's going to be.  If I just could do this, he hears you one time.  Give me one time, and if I lack that time, I lack it all.
