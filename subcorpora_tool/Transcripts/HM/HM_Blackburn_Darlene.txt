Story_ID: 127657
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, I'm going to ask you about your family history, and I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family.  We'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Cora Blackburn.  C-O-R-A B-L-A-C-K-B-U-R-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: That I don't know offhand.  It's in my records but I had to call my father up for that information.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) do it real quick here.  Okay.  February 16, 1927, does that sound--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what do you know about her side of the family and how far back can you trace 'em, first of all?
Speaker 2: Just to my great grandmother, my great-great grandmother. 'Cause my great-great grandmother lived to be 103.
Speaker 1: That's a long way.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where was she living and what did she do?
Speaker 2: Well, we all lived in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois] and it was that Big Mama situation.  My great grandmother [Cora] lived upstairs over us.  We lived in one big house that my great grandfather built.  And my mother and my grandmother [Mattie Chapman] lived downstairs and my uncles lived on the sides.  So everybody lived in this one big house, and that was really the situation that we even called her, we didn't call her Big Mama, we called her Mama.  And whatever she said, really, we geared ourself to her.  But that's where I grew up, in Morgan Park with my whole family surrounding me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now there is a history of black people living in Morgan Park for a long time from what I hear.  Can you--
Speaker 2: Well, when we lived there, it was just bush.  It was not a lot of houses.  Like I said, my great grandfather just plotted this land, I guess, and bought it and built this big house for, you know, for the whole family to live in.  And I went to Shoop Elementary [later Shoop Academy of Math, Science, and Technology, Chicago, Illinois] up until about my sixth grade.  In sixth grade I went there.
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't wanna to get there yet.  I wanna ask you about family.  So you say your great grandfather built the house?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's, that's quite an accomplishment, you know.
Speaker 2: I thought so too.
Speaker 1: So when they were, when he built that house, that was sort of unincorporated territory or was that part of Chicago then?
Speaker 2: I don't think it was really a part of Chicago.  It was like a suburb.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is like southwest of Chicago, right?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  And you know, we had the big back yard, I mean, side yard, I mean we had area all around, and that's all, it was just area, it was very few houses.  And we had a lot of dogs because everybody in the house, Big Mama, we used to call her Nanny, she had dogs upstairs and on the back yard, you know, it's just, it was really a country setting.
Speaker 1: Did they ever talk about where, were they always from Illinois, or as far as they know, or were they--
Speaker 2: My great grandmother, she was from Virginia, and she would even, a lot of her sisters would come there, et cetera, and it was really interesting because they looked like white people compared to us.  Because what it was, it was a thing of my great grandmother and my grandmother were light skinned and my great grandfather and my grandfather were actually black, you know.  And, they tried to explain to us, you know, all the time that there wasn't, that color didn't matter, it was a matter of finding a good man.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So did they ever talk about life back in around there, around the time he built the house and what things were like in Chicago in those days, or in this area?
Speaker 2: I really don't remember.
Speaker 1: Or talk about Virginia at all?
Speaker 2: (shakes her head no)
Speaker 1: Do you know what town it was in Virginia that they lived?
Speaker 2: I sure don't.  I didn't keep up with any of that at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 127658
Speaker 1: I know, in those days they'd tell kids to butt out of business sometimes.  I don't know, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, yeah.  The only thing I really, I remember a lot of was my great grandmother's [Cora] singing hymns every Sunday.  We would all get together and sing the spirituals, you know.  They didn't go to a church, I ended up going to church by myself.  I went to a Baptist church when I was very young, just getting up and going, but my great grandmother would just have us sing hymns and she made a issue of, I would sit by her side while she was in the rocking chair and she would teach me the Bible, you know, so it was, those were the things that she kind of more or less instilled in me than anything is the teachings of the Bible and family, of being close with your family, just making, just calling them together and making them come together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So since we had your great, let's see we got your great-great-grandmother, your great-grandmother, your grandmother [Mattie Chapman] and your mother [Cora Blackburn].
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: That's amazing.  Really kind of a--do you think when you look back on it, do you, I mean, what advantages do you see, I mean, of having everybody live together like that?
Speaker 2: Well, because everybody, everybody was like watching over me.  I was the first child.  My mother didn't have any more children until fourteen years later.  I felt very secure.  I used to sneak in upstairs and go on the back porch in the big swing and just dream.  They didn't even know I was just in the house.  They thought I was maybe out in the bush somewhere playing 'cause I used to play with, I was kind of tomboyish and playing with the frogs or (unclear) fish, all that kind of stuff, but I just felt very protected as a child.  I was very protected as a child 'cause I had my whole family around me, so I was very secure.
Speaker 1: So you don't remember any stories that any of the grandmothers told?  You got three grandmothers.
Speaker 2: That's really terrible.  I tell you what I did do for, I interviewed my great-grandmother because I wanted to know, she used to do these quilts, she taught me how to do quilts because, and I thought that was very interesting, and that was because my great-grandfather worked in the cemetery and he would take all the ribbons and bring all the ribbons home and she would take the ribbons and braid them and make these beautiful quilts out of 'em to go over the bed, and I mean they were beautiful, 'cause all those different colors, they braid 'em and then they sewed them together.  And I thought that was unique, you know.  As usual how our people take things and, and, that are just laying around and make something out of 'em so unique like that.  And she made all these beautiful quilts that, you know, were on the bed, and she would also make rugs for the bathroom, little round rugs, you know, from these ribbons.
Story_ID: 127659
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell us about your mother [Cora Blackburn]?  What kind of personality did she have, what did she do?
Speaker 2: Well, my mom was just a housewife.  The thing about why I have so much information on my grandmother [Mattie Chapman] also who raised me.  My mother had me when she was fourteen.  And so for a long time, because like I said we having that southern background, sister, brother, that's what they used to call my mother all the time, Sister.  I thought that was my sister.  I thought my mother was my sister for a long period of time when I was young because everybody else was raising me, everybody else was telling me what to do more than my mother was.  And, as time went on, of course, you know, she kept explaining me, I am not your sister, I'm your mommy, you know, but I was really raised by my grandmother and my great grandmother [Cora].  And that's where I got really, I said the strong woman background was from them, you know, but my mom always told me your grandmother wanted to take you, but I wouldn't allow that.  And then when we moved to Englewood [Chicago, Illinois], when we finally moved on, you know, then she was the only one in my life, was really my mother who just really carried on the same tradition that my grandmother and great grandmother had, and that is they were, I mean, with me, it was stand up straight, hitting me in the back, you're tall, be glad you're tall, and it's just the idea of trying to be a strong black woman.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, you do stand up, in fact, you're almost famous for your posture.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: You know, people in the community know you from your posture and how you stand up straight.
Speaker 2: That was from being hit on the back and on the chin because my grandmother and my great grandmother and all of them were short and I was the tall one, 'cause my mother married a taller man [Richard Blackburn], but it was that short thing again, just like it was light skin, dark skin.  The women were short and the men were tall.
Speaker 1: So you're the only tall woman on that--
Speaker 2: Uh hum, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did your mother go to school here in Chicago [Illinois], or did she get a chance to go?
Speaker 2: Well, she didn't finish, that's what I'm saying, she didn't finish when, after she had me, she didn't finish school.
Speaker 1: So she went to school out in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You said it looked like a prairie out there?
Speaker 2: It really did.  It was really just prairie.  I was a brownie scout, girl scout, you know, 'cause that's what was around us, was bush so we had plenty of forest preserve.
Story_ID: 127660
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell us about your father.  Can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Richard P. Blackburn, which is Paul, Richard Paul Blackburn.  R-I-C-H-A-R-D P-A-U-L B-L-A-C-K-B-U-R-N.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't have that.  It's on there though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's my stepfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And you said he's from, he was born in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: His family background in Florida?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, well, do you know much about your natural father at all?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, I really don't.  For whatever reason I never delved in it, you know, being that my mother [Cora Blackburn] had me so young and I was, in those days I guess that's why I teach sex education so strongly is that my mom didn't even know that she was pregnant, you know, because those were things they didn't talk about, and so what happened, you know, to her as a young child was really because of lack of knowledge.  Nobody really set her down and talked to her.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Richard Blackburn really helped raise you as stepfather?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Just like my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, well what do you know about his family?
Speaker 2: Well, his father was a preacher, and a sign painter and, so again, it was the church background, and the mother was a housewife and he had three sisters and two brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they lived out in Robbins [Illinois], mostly, his family.
Speaker 1: It's another suburb--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of Chicago.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: That's where, that's another, that's a--I don't know how long it's been mostly black, but it's been--
Speaker 2: there a long--it pretty, that same thing, it had that same bush area just like Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois] when it first started out.
Speaker 1: That's where the black cowboys are known.  I mean they had their--
Speaker 2: Uh hum, rodeos.
Speaker 1: Right.  Robbins, Illinois.  Okay, so what was your father's, your stepfather's personality like?  What did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, he worked at Ford Motors [Ford Motor Company].  In fact, he retired from Ford Motors from like thirty-four years and again, he cared for me and that bond of protection, you know, I felt, I felt, again, you know, I felt very secure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When did your mother and father meet?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think about when she was about eighteen.
Story_ID: 127661
Speaker 1: And is there a story about how they [Cora and Richard Blackburn] met that they told you?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't delve into my family background that much.  No.  The only thing I really remember is they both could dance real good.  I mean real good and the story that I would have would be that when they went to clubs, being that I was the only child, nobody to baby--nobody wanted to babysit me, I would be in the car while they was in the club dancing.
Speaker 1: Now this is a lot like the late '40s [1940s] when you, I guess when your memory would have started up, I guess.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, what kind of dancing were they doing?
Speaker 2: Well, they called it the Jitterbug at that time.  Uh hum.  Right.
Speaker 1: And the Jitterbug's a real kind of a--
Speaker 2: It's kind of acrobatic also.  It was close to that Lindy Hop, because you know, I remember seeing them swing and throw each other around, my cousins, all of, everybody in my family could dance pretty good.  Regular, just social dancing and that was a part of, again, partying in our house of just dancing--
Story_ID: 127662
Speaker 1: Is that your earliest memory of dancing?
Speaker 2: That's my earliest memory.  In fact, they could dance so good that I would ask my cousins and aunties to teach me.  I wanted to dance just like them, you know, and I really didn't think I would be able to dance.  I didn't think I would be able to dance as good as them, you know.  I felt like, ooh, wow, I'll never be able to dance like that.
Speaker 1: Did you have a lot of music in your household when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the singing and dancing, you know, I was just--in fact the house was never quiet, never quiet.  There was always some music going, always some music on.  And like I said, they could dance real good and they were always social dancing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They played the radio a lot?
Speaker 2: Radio, records, you know, during that time it was LPs and 45s, just a whole lot of partying, party family.  Come from a party family, very happy family, too happy.  The spirits.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 127663
Speaker 1: Now how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: Now I have one living brother and I have one brother that has passed and a sister that's passed.  Both younger than me.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you were the oldest.
Speaker 2: I was the oldest, uh hum.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 127664
Speaker 1: Think back, I know you been talking about it anyway, but give us a sense of some of the sights and sounds and smells growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, my family could cook.  I come from--and I'm so happy that I still cook because of those smells, but I don't cook the same thing anymore, that, 'cause it was that big Sunday dinner again.  You waited for Sunday because you knew Sunday you were going to have biscuits, home-made biscuits, macaroni and cheese, you know.  They gone have the big ham, or the big turkey or just candied yams, I mean, you know, and this is not on Christmas.  This is just a Sunday dinner, and you know you gone have apple pie, or you're gone have a peach cobbler.  You got to save room for all of this.  Don't eat too much so you have room for dessert.  Yeah, good memories of, of, I hate to say it like, parties on eating.  Like I said, and I tell my students that now, chitterling parties.  I can't even believe that I ate chitterlings, you know.  I'm so far removed from chitterlings, but when we were young, chitterlings was one of those things that you ate.  Chitterlings and spaghetti and corn bread.  I remember all of that.  And I mean, I remember it as a fun thing.  I was actually having fun and barbecues in the back yard because we had, like I said, a huge family like that, so everybody just getting together.
Speaker 1: How many years did you live with your great grandmother [Cora]?
Speaker 2: Right, I lived there until I was, in fact, I was born at home.  And finally, when my mother [Cora Blackburn] got married, we moved to Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] when I was about twelve years old.
Story_ID: 127665
Speaker 1: We moved to Englewood [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--So your early years were spent out in Morgan Park [Chicago]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: How close was your nearest neighbor out there?
Speaker 1: Maybe two or three blocks.  We just had area around us.  I mean one time I brought home a big, I thought it was a turtle, but it was like this big and I said, ooh, look what I found in the swamp there right in the water.  They said get that out of here, that's not no just a turtle, that'll snap you, you know.
Speaker 2: You found a snapping turtle?
Speaker 1: Uh hum.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they will, they'll hang on and not let go.
Speaker 1: That's just what my mother [Cora Blackburn] told me, but you know, I'm just having big fun.  I mean I don't have nothing else to play with.  The dogs, and all the nature.  I was really into nature and I guess, I think that's the reason why I travel and I don't have no problem with spiders or whatever I find, you know, I could just brush it off.  Because I grew up around all of that.
Speaker 2: There aren't that many people, I think, from Chicago [Illinois] that remember a kind of country life, but that's what you basically had out there in Morgan Park.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  Uh hum, right.  You know, I picked the dandelions, but I thought they was nice then, bringing 'em home, you know bringing the wildflowers home, you know, 'cause I'm just walking around in the bush, just picking stuff.  Wild kittens, and I mean wild kittens, right, scratching you up.
Speaker 2: You mean like wild kittens living in the--
Speaker 1: Uh hum, exactly.  Yeah.  Climbing trees and hiding in the trees.  I remember my girlfriends saying, well she way up in the trees, she said she's gone kill herself.  Girl, Darlene's not going to kill herself, she'll come on down, and then they'd come back and tell me, your mother said you're not going to kill yourself, you're gonna come on down.  Ah, she makes me sick.  I just come on down.
Speaker 2: Did it scare your friends?
Speaker 1: Uh hum.  I was just trying to scare them anyway 'cause they just, you know, little prissy, prissy girls, you know, and we had a church that wasn't too far from us, like I said about two blocks and I would go on the church steps and I would take my friends and I was producing them at that age.  I had--now that I look back at that, you know, telling them okay you can sing real good.  Now let me show you how to use your hands and, because the Hit Parade, remember the [Your] Hit Parade?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: That was the time of the Hit Parade.
Speaker 2: The television show?
Speaker 1: Uh hum.
Speaker 2: You were in Hit Parade, right.
Speaker 1: I loved the Hit Parade.  Little dancing on the (unclear).  I was imitating all of those kinds of things and miming, pantomiming, music, going to shows and teaching others how to do this also.  That's really interesting to me, you know, to look back at that.
Speaker 2: You were organizing a little company--
Speaker 1: Right.  And I mean this had to be like seven or eight years old.  Had to be around that age.
Story_ID: 127666
Speaker 1: Where did you go to school when you lived in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois]?  Where did you start school at?
Speaker 2: Yes, I started at Shoop School [later Shoop Academy of Math, Science, and Technology, Chicago, Illinois].  Uh hum.  Right off 111th and Vincennes.  But I was into art then.  And plus I talked too much, but one of my teachers which was very inter--Mr. Murphy, I talked so much but he saw that I could draw.  So then what he would do is he would let me paint the windows.  I'll never forget that.
Speaker 1: Paint the windows?
Speaker 2: Right.  I mean, I drew pictures on the school windows.
Speaker 1: With watercolors?
Speaker 2: Watercolors, uh hum.  And got me into my art.  That kind of cooled me out because I finished my work on purpose early.  Get finished with that so I could talk.  And he started when you get finished with your work, you can go to the window and work on your art.
Speaker 1: That's good.  So were active, a very active girl it sounds like?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was very active, very silly.  Keeping up an uproar.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So he made sure you were painting the window instead of finding someone else to talk to?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your favorite subject was art then?
Speaker 2: It really was.  I was really, I really liked to draw.  I was thinking of my being that, I told you my grandfather was a sign painter, and my, one of my uncles could draw real good.  And at that time, they had some kind of person that would come to your house or something if you could draw and they would look at your work and, you know, just a way of getting money.  But they would come and say, oh yes, let me see some of your artwork, and have someone come, they looked at the work and then they let us know they weren't giving anything free, you had to pay for these art classes.  And my uncle, of course, said, I could teach you how to draw, you don't need to be taking no art classes, so I used to draw a lot at home with my uncle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my father [Richard Blackburn] could draw.  Uh hum.
Story_ID: 128305
Speaker 1: Is there anything you want to tell us about Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois] before we get to your move to Englewood [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No more than it definitely kind of started me off because, as I said, I was a Brownie, Girl Scout and a Senior Scout there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us about that and how did you get involved in the Brownies.
Speaker 2: Wasn't nothing to do.  I wanted something to do.  And so I was at the playground because we used to have playgrounds where we used to do sports in the playgrounds and they had said that they were going to have a Brownie camp there at Shoop School [now Shoop Academy of Math, Science, and Technology] in the playground and I went home and asked my mom [Cora Blackburn] could I join the Brownies.  And she said I could, and I was, you know, I was really happy because I just wanted something to do, being the only child and not having any children around me.
Story_ID: 128306
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were around mostly adults then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because my uncles didn't have any children.  I had two uncles, you know, and they didn't have any children, so I was the only child in the house at that time, for fourteen years.
Speaker 1: (Brief interruption)
Speaker 2: So you were in a unique situation being the only child amongst all these adults--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --and going back generations I would have thought.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  And I, that's why I have a real respect for elders and my mentors had been elders, because I've always sat by the side of my grandmother [Mattie Chapman] and my great-grandmother [Cora], great grandmother.  I always did that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now did you, were you kind of reluctant to leave that situation?
Speaker 1: I really was, exactly.  All my friends were there.  You know, I really wanted my mother [Cora Blackburn] to leave me, but, of course, you know, she says, no, I'm not leaving you.  You're going with your mother.  We bought a house, you know, we have our own, and you're going to live and work, that's enough of Morgan Park, you can come back and visit.  So I was riding my bike back and forth from Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois] to Englewood [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: That's over forty blocks.
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.  I was riding my bike because I wanted to go back and see my grandmother and my great-grandmother.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's a long trip.
Speaker 1: Uh hum.
Speaker 2: Okay, so where did you live in Englewood?
Speaker 1: 6129 South Bishop.  That's where my mother moved to.  It was really rough during that time.  It was a mixed neighborhood at that time.
Speaker 2: Now when you were at Morgan Park, was that a mixed neighborhood, or all black?
Speaker 1: It was all black.
Speaker 2: And Shoop School [later Shoop Academy of Math, Science, and Technology, Chicago, Illinois], was it integrated?
Speaker 1: No, it was all black too.
Speaker 2: So that area--
Speaker 1: But Morgan Park [Academy, Chicago, Illinois] was.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Uh hum.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of Chicago police officers live in Morgan Park and Beverly [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Uh hum, right.
Story_ID: 128307
Speaker 1: So, well, how did you like Englewood [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I really didn't like it, you know, it was a block that I wasn't used to, again, here I am the country girl, not used to all these people, you know, and a lot of children on the block, and I'm to myself, you know, because I don't know any of these children or anything.  They're thinking I'm stuck up and I'm really kinda like scared of 'em, you know, just reluctant, 'cause I'm used to being to myself.  In fact, they wanted to beat me up as usual, you know, little stuck up girl.  We gone beat her up.  I was really scared of 'em.
Speaker 1: So where did you go to school in Englewood?
Speaker 2: I went to Copernicus [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Copernicus.
Speaker 2: 61st and Throop.
Speaker 1: So, well, did you, well I guess you eventually got used to it, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I eventually got used to it, you know, but like I said, being the new girl on the block, a couple of fights, and what saved me was my mother [Cora Blackburn], father [Richard Blackburn] and all my aunts, everybody is real friendly.  They are real friendly, I'm not.  They were real friendly and I wanted to learn how to do, remember I wanted to learn how to do the Jitterbug like my parents, et cetera.  Well the kids on the block knew how to dance.  They was used to dancing.  This is, I'm going into my teenage years.  So I told them if they taught me how to dance I would give a party.  And that's how they became my friends.
Speaker 1: So this was about 1954 or so, I guess?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you gave a party?
Speaker 2: I gave a party.  They taught me how to dance first, you know.  At that time, it was the bop.  So they taught me how to bop, so I could have a party, and I, I had this very liberal family, you know, and so I was giving parties.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So a lot of kids couldn't give a party back then.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  They couldn't give parties, but my mom [Cora Blackburn] and them did not mind chaperoning.  My aunties, keep out the riffraff, whatever, you know, so I was giving the basement parties.
Speaker 1: Okay, and they were doing the bop way back then?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: So that's where it comes from.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the basement parties, doing the two-step, the blue lights, the red lights.
Speaker 1: Blue lights in the basement.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 128308
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how was school?  How did you like Copernicus [Elementary] School [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: It was all right.  Again, my art saved me because I still talked too much.  And it was still the same problem 'cause then I got to know everybody and I was talkative.  And, silly, again.  I was real silly 'cause if they wanted to beat me up, I'd just start acting silly.  Why you wanna beat me up and start laughing, and you know, the teacher go out of the room, they getting ready to hit me.  So I would start jumping up and acting crazy.  I'd end up, the girl would end up laughing instead of hitting me, because I would say, you're too big to be hitting on me, 'cause I was real skinny then.  You can't hit me.  And just run around the room dancing all over the place.  And then I talked too much.  Miss Perry, again, a teacher, which was the art teacher, got me a scholarship to go the [School of the] Art Institute [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  So in grammar school I started going to the Art Institute.  And, again, I started doing all the pictures in the hallways.  I would drawing pictures in the hallway, so again, it was the same thing, I got to do my artwork and that always, and the children liked my artwork too.  You know, you can draw real good, so that saved me.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject to draw?
Speaker 2: It was landscaping, it was landscaping.  I really liked drawing trees and water and mountains and just sitting there looking at it.  In fact, I used to go the Art Institute and the exhibit that they have on right now, I'm getting ready to take my grandchildren to see it, on the picnic grounds.  I think it's [Georges] Seurat [painting: A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used to go and sit in front of there and picture myself in that scene, sitting there underneath a tree.  I love that picture.
Story_ID: 128309
Speaker 1: Now had you--did you get a chance to go on a lot of museums when you were young, at all?
Speaker 2: Right, by myself.  I used to go to the Art Institute [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] all the time by myself, because like I was comfortable with it because I was going down there taking art class once a week.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was that your first exposure to the Art Institute was when you took classes?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that must have been something, at twelve, to see the Art Institute.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Did kids come downtown a lot in those days?
Speaker 2: No, but, again, my mom [Cora Blackburn] taught me how to go downtown by myself.  And finally, then I was riding my bike and she wasn't comfortable with that.  She taught me how to take the bus to go to Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois], back and forth.  So, I was, at twelve years old, I was getting around.  They would do things like follow the bus in the car to make me feel comfortable.  We got you.  I look in the back, like are they there?  But, I was traveling.
Speaker 1: They did that, they followed--
Speaker 2: They followed the bus in the car and taught me how to go from one place to the other.
Story_ID: 128310
Speaker 1: So--so you took courses at the [School of the] Art Institute [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and were drawing landscapes and doing a little water color, and what about your other subjects? Did you like the academic part?
Speaker 2: I did all right, I wasn't really interested in them.  I had to get good grades. I come, like I said, I come from a family that if you didn't bring home the grades, you couldn't do nothing, plus you gone get a whipping, 'cause that's just not acceptable.  So, for two reasons, I brought in good grades, but I remember bringing in and I still have that report card, I'm bringing in all E's and I tore it in half.  This lady had passed me on trial for bad conduct, and I had all E's, so I just tore it in half.  I said, and I told my mama [Cora Blackburn], I said you know how those children are, they were pulling on my report card, and, I said but look, look what I'm bringing home though.  But she didn't buy it though.
Speaker 1: She eventually found out?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  That I had passed on trial for talking too much and not, you know, not pulling it up 'cause, of course, I had been talking too much, and she had, the lady had wrote on the back, Ms. Haynes, and you know you remember those names, bad conduct, won't stop talking.
Speaker 1: That's something, you know you never really seemed like someone that talks a lot.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, that's what so interesting, but when I was young, and you know, I don't know, I'm trying, what calmed me down, I trying to think my own self to stop talking so much because all the way through school I talked a lot, all the way through high school, same thing, wasn't really no different.
Story_ID: 128311
Speaker 1: Now where did you go to high school when you moved out?
Speaker 2: Lindblom [Technical High School, later Lindblom Math & Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was rough.  That was, definitely, it was three-fourths Caucasian during that time 'cause that's just going in, getting ready to go into the '60s [1960s], 'cause I graduated in 1960.
Speaker 1: And Lindblom has got a reputation of being a, a really good high school.
Speaker 2: Right, but see that's what--don't forget I'm an art major and that's how I got in, because, again, that was my major at Lindblom.
Speaker 1: But in those days you say it was three-fourths white?
Speaker 2: Right.  And it was rough when I went in because don't forget my name was Blackburn and I used to hate them to call my name, BLACKburn.  Do we have a BLACKburn here?
Speaker 1: So you think they were--
Speaker 2: No doubt about it.
Speaker 1: --signifying?
Speaker 2: Right, and I would look around like, I was so dramatic, look around, nobody bet not laugh, you know.  I was bad.  I had that chip on my shoulder to let you know I wasn't gone take nothing 'cause I come from a strong women family.  I don't come from no coward background.  You bet not laugh and you bet not do nothing, you know, I'm not scared of you.  I was, I didn't have that fear.  I was, just, it was kind of horrible because you couldn't concentrate on your school work because you so busy dealing with the race issue, you know.  It didn't lighten up or stop until I was in my last year.  But all the way through school I was fighting for my grades, fighting to be on the team, sports, because I was athletic and, you know, I liked competition.  I was a gym leader.  We had gym leaders during that time and it was just two of us, two black gym leaders only, myself and another girl.  I started the first dance club there, you know, and things, realized that, you know, they started dealing with me on my ability instead of, it wasn't a color issue, but, I mean that took three years before they were just dealing with me, you know, as a person, but we used to have to work hard for our school letter and I did everything because I wanted my school letter, you know, I wanted my mom [Cora Blackburn] to be proud of me, and I remember Marquette Park [Chicago, Illinois], had me to go on hikes, you know, these walks, to get your school letter, and being the only black walking with all these girls and they tell me, don't worry about it, just ignore 'em and stuff, calling you all these names, you know.  So, I don't really have fond memories, you know.  I didn't go to my junior prom, I didn't go to my prom, you know.  Don't have any fond memories, in fact, as a teacher now, I go to all the proms since I didn't go to my prom.
Speaker 1: So your social life in high school was, didn't really take place in high school I guess?
Speaker 2: Right, it was after school.
Speaker 1: So you had like, you were still able to have parties at your house--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --with neighborhood kids?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  Right, after school.  And then we went over to Lindblom because they had social dances and, 'cause they were having social dances in the schools at that time, and--
Speaker 1: Not Lindblom, but Englewood [High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: They were having them at Lindblom too, but, you know, I'm just saying, you didn't want to go, so you went over to Englewood High School, to their social dances.
Speaker 1: That area has like, was Robeson [High School, Chicago, Illinois] opened then, or Harper [High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: It [Robeson High School] was called Parker [High School, Chicago, Illinois] at that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Parker and Harper.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know about Harper during that time, but I think it was all white, because that whole area, if you cross Ashland, that was the, we used to fight in the middle of the street of Ashland.  You bet not cross, you bet not cross, well then let's meet in the middle since you so tough, all that kind of silly stuff.
Speaker 1: Wow, that was really tense over there.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was real tense.  When we used to play Tilden [High School, Chicago, Illinois], Tilden would do things like come to our school with a casket and drive.  That's what they gone do to you, just murder us.  Then you see, on my street, I'll never forget that, they hung a dummy up on the lamp pole.
Speaker 1: On your, what was it, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was just a dummy of a black person, so it was rough, they just did not want to accept at that time in that area that it was turning, it was getting ready to turn over, and they were moving, and whites were moving out left and right.
Speaker 1: So that was a frontier--
Speaker 2: It really was, it really was.  We had one, one black football player, George Hudson.  You know he was good.  He said he wasn't good because--he said he was glad he could run good so nobody would catch him and kill him.
Speaker 1: It probably was rough.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Story_ID: 128312
Speaker 1: So, now did you, were you aware, well I guess--what did you think about the Civil Rights Movement then, Montgomery bus boycott?  All that was going on when you were in high school.
Speaker 2: Right, and I'm just, I wasn't getting ready to let anyone hit me.  I mean I wasn't, my mother [Cora Blackburn] was, I never forget her saying [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] is up in Marquette Park [Chicago, Illinois], you gone go up there?  I said no, I'm not going up there.  Do you know what's happening?  I been to Marquette Park.  I said it's gone be trouble up there, you know.  I said you remember I told you about me walking with school group?  I said no, I'm not, I'm not with that.  I was explaining to her then that I'm Malcolm X, I'm not King.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's much later, that's like '66 [1966], yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: When you were in high school, did you remember the Little Rock Nine [1957], Governor [Orval] Faubus and all the stuff going on in Arkansas?
Speaker 2: We were having so much going on.  I don't remember it because we was having so much, I mean all the way through my years at Lindblom, we were having so much going on that I was just totally involved in that.  We were having parents coming together walking us to school because I could really walk to school from where I lived on Bishop, you know, and we were having meetings about the best route to take to school, and make sure all of you meet on the corner so that you can all walk at the same time.  It was just too much at Lindblom [Technical High School, now Lindblom Math & Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois].  That was consuming me.  Trying to get out of there and get through there.
Speaker 1: I can imagine. It sounds like--
Speaker 2: It was.  I mean after school, running home and people, the police coming and kids jumping in garbage pails, getting caught jumping in the garbage pails, cause they throwing stuff at each other.  So I really was consumed with that.
Story_ID: 128313
Speaker 1: Okay, were there any teachers at Lindblom [Technical High School, now Lindblom Math & Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois] that were, that you remember that were helpful to you, or--
Speaker 2: Exactly, my third year, my P.E. teachers, my physical education teachers, the one that made me a gym leader and then my gymnastic teacher, they saw that I could dance real good and when I started, asked me, you know, right, why don't you start a dance club here?  And then I had a lot of black and white girls that wanted to join and when I graduated, one of teachers helped me get my first job teaching dance.  I was teaching dance and I didn't even know how to teach dance.
Speaker 1: Now what kind of dance were you teaching?
Speaker 2: I was really doing interpretative, that's what we called it then, modern dancing.  I taught at the Y [YMCA] on Ashland [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now where did you learn, did you learn modern dance in high school
Speaker 2: Again, right, I went all the way down to Dunbar and took classes at Dunbar High School [Chicago, Illinois].  They had a real good teacher there, Miss Shaw, and I went down there and was taking classes with her, down there with her.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is while you were in high school--
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: --and they discovered at Lindblom that you'd been taking lessons and you started a class at Lindblom?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you went right from taking class to teaching class?
Speaker 2: Right.  I was taking classes while I was teaching classes.  Exactly.  I was really just showing people what I was learning, you know.
Speaker 1: Some people say that the best way to learn something is to teach it.
Speaker 2: There's no doubt about it.  I agree thoroughly.  The more you teach it, every time I would go back to my class I was better.  But, it was really, I was better because I had been teaching it.
Speaker 1: I guess when you teach it, you practice too don't you--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And perfect it.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And you wanna look good for the kids that you teaching.  I wanted to show the children that I was really learning something, so, you know, you get a chance to really work on perfecting yourself.
Story_ID: 128314
Speaker 1: Okay. So when you were a senior at Lindblom [Technical High School, later Lindblom Math & Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois], did you think that you would go to college, or get a job?  What did you think that you would do when you graduated?
Speaker 2: Well, it was the same problem again, being that the administration was mostly white.  I didn't have counselors like they have now to help you, so I wanted to go to school.  I wanted to go to college because nobody in my family had gone to college.  That was another reason why I wanted to go, you know, because hardly any of 'em finished high school.  So I really wanted to go bad and I didn't get any help so I really, just really did it on my own.  I went to, it was called Chicago Teachers [College, now Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] at that time, and my, the only teachers, thank heaven it was the teachers that I told that helped me was my PE [physical education] teachers, and they told me why don't you--at that time you had to take a test, a physical fitness test, to get into Chicago Teachers' P.E. Department.  So I took the physical fitness test and I passed it and I was accepted to the Physical Education Department at Chicago Teachers, which was then right with Wilson [Woodrow Wilson Junior College], which was, which is now Kennedy-King [College, Chicago, Illinois].  I don't know if you remember hearing about that.
Speaker 1: Well I hear, yeah, Wilson Junior College.
Speaker 2: Right, Wilson Junior College.
Speaker 1: So they were together on the same campus?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: Was it located--
Speaker 2: 69th and Wentworth there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Near the present location?
Speaker 2: Right.  Uh hum.
Speaker 1: The Kennedy-King we know now is new, right, by I mean in--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, now they getting ready to change again.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how did it go at Chicago Teachers College?
Speaker 2: It went okay, but I was into dance again, you know, being that I really liked to dance and I was dancing, taking classes.  I never forget getting an A minus and I really went up to the teacher and danced, social dancing, and I asked her, I said, why did I get a A minus?  And she said 'cause of your attitude.
Speaker 1: You got a minus for attitude?
Speaker 2: I sure did.  I will never forget that.  I always use that one, that's another one I use for my students to explain to them the importance of when you can even do something well, you know, you can't make it look like its nothing.  People wanna see that you are really trying to do your very, very best, and I just thought doing the foxtrot wasn't what I wanted to do.  The fox trot and the waltz, you know, that what, this was the social class.  It was boring to me.  I didn't think it was hard.  It was, you know, that's why I asked why did I get a A minus because I know I had done everything right.  But she said you had that care, no-care attitude like, all right, I just doing this because I want to pass this class, get this grade.  She was right.  I never did that again, I betcha.  Never did that again.  Learned from that.  And then here I go again, I'm in college and I'm going to Budland [nightclub in Chicago, Illinois' Woodlawn neighborhood].  And I end up on probation, and who when, the teachers that's how they did, they'd meet you, come together with the PE Department and say what are you going to do to pull off of probation?  Well who's sitting there?  The teacher that gave me that A minus, you know, and she feels that I'm not really interested in school, you know, I'm not really interested in the PE Department, and it was issues again I had because I was going through the same thing, some prejudice things, you know, even when I was taking my other classes you know, being, I was a lot of times the only black in the classes, in the gym classes, and you got to have partners for this stuff, and boy, you're going through an oh boy, they don't want to be my partner and I don't really care.  Too many issues, too many issues, I dropped out.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how long were you there?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Story_ID: 128315
Speaker 1: During this time did you, did you--now, who was teaching the class, teaching at Dunbar [High School, Chicago, Illinois]?  Were you still taking classes at Dunbar?
Speaker 2: No, I was teaching at the Ys [YMCAs].  I started at Ashland Y [Chicago, Illinois], Woodlawn Y [Chicago, Illinois] picked me up.  They wanted me to teach classes there.  I was teaching dance classes out of my basement, because I, everybody wanted me to teach them what I was learning.  And here we go back to again, I was telling you how I was in Morgan Park I started on the church steps promoting the little girls and stuff, teaching classes.  I was so physical, remember I told you I was a gym leader at Lindblom [Technical High School, now Lindblom Math & Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois].  I was getting up the whole block of kids by that time in the summertime because we had to work on our physical fitness at six a.m. in the morning.  I'm tapping on people's windows and stuff, talking about come on lets's go, let's go, we got to get fit.  Let's run around the block.  We got to get fit.  Parents are having fits, waking up the whole block.
Speaker 1: That sounds--
Speaker 2: I guess what I'm saying and I didn't know none of that was gonna lead to any other thing.  I'm just having big fun 'cause I'm really physically fit, you know, and I wanted everybody else to get fit like me.  Parents were angry, like, would you tell your daughter not to knock on my window at no six o'clock in the morning.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you've got classes going so when you drop out of school you got classes going and stuff, so that's basically what you're doing for a living or--
Speaker 2: Right, I did that for a second because, of course, there wasn't any money, so I got a job finally at Illinois Bell [Telephone Company], information operator, and then I started taking professional classes 'cause I decided, I told my mom [Cora Blackburn] I decided, that's what I want to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is 1962, '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  I decided I wanted to be a dancer.
Story_ID: 128316
Speaker 1: You were saying that you didn't--you knew about the Bruce sisters, but you didn't have any lessons with them.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Sadie Bruce and Mary Bruce.
Speaker 2: Sadie Bruce, right, exactly.  And I never went to any of their concerts or anything, but I would hear about 'em being downtown having these big recitals, you know, so I really wanted to, I wanted to be involved in that, but my, coming from a dancing family, my mother [Cora Blackburn] said that was a waste of money.  And, during that time people that were dancers remember they were exotic dancers.  My mother didn't really want me to be a dancer, when I said I wanted to be a dancer 'cause she thought that, well, you don't see any blacks on television do you, dancing, so you not gone be able to be a dancer on TV.  You're not gonna be a dancer on a concert stage.  They only had the exotic dances and she didn't, definitely did not want me to be an exotic dancer.
Speaker 1: Was the clubs still, still big in those days?
Speaker 2: Right.  The clubs was real big during those days.
Speaker 1: Rhumboogie [Cafe, 1942-1947] and all that kind of--
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  Club DeLisa.  Right.  And so that was what she was used to, you know, going to those clubs and singing and she didn't want, you know, she didn't want that type of life for me.
Speaker 1: She didn't want you in chorus line or any of that type of thing?
Speaker 2: She didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She never stopped me, you know, but I mean, you know, she just told me, you know, I'm not gone spend no money on you.  My uncle bought me my first leotards and tights and paid for my first dance class, 'cause he was the type that--I was a pretty good child for talking.  That was the only problem they ever had with me.  He said what do you want and I told him that's what I wanted for Christmas, you know.  So he was the one that said, if that's what she wants, that's what she should have.
Speaker 1: Now what about Sammy Dyer?  Did you know anything about Sammy Dyer?
Speaker 2: I knew about him, but Larry Steele was at the Regal [Theater] doing all the chorus lines, you know, I thought all of that was great.  And Julian Swain from my era, was at Club DeLisa.  He was the choreographer and putting on the shows for that, and so when I decided that I wanted to do this, I said I got to do this.  I wanna dance.  I went to Club DeLisa to audition.  I was about seventeen.  He told me I was too young to be in Club DeLisa and I needed to take some ballet classes.  I will never forget that, you know, and well, like I said, my family wouldn't pay for any of those, but when I did drop out of high school, I mean out of college at Chicago Teachers, I was twenty then, and I started working at Illinois Bell [Telephone Company], I started taking ballet classes when I was twenty, from Stone and Camryn [School of Ballet] because it was right downtown.  I would leave work and go to ballet classes.   I leave work go to my modern dance classes, Neville Black, go to Tommie Sutton was teaching downtown, he didn't have a studio on the South Side then, at 218 South Wabash, jazz classes and Jimmy Payne was teaching in the Fine Arts Building, and I would take Afro Cuban.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 218 South Wabash, that the Alcoa [ph.] Building and I know they had a big dance shop up there.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  Right (unclear), so you had all these schools, you know, where, in walking distance, that's my point.  All of them were in walking distance, the Stevens Building.  All of 'em had dance classes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're taking classes and you're working at Illinois Bell [Telephone Company] and you're still teaching class.  This is, we got, we were like in the mid-60s [mid 1960s] now, I guess?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Story_ID: 128317
Speaker 1: Now this is a time, this is an era when people started becoming interested in Black Power and the Black Arts Movement starts--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) during this period of time.  Did you, when did you start paying attention to national politics, I mean, did you start around this time?
Speaker 2: I did, but it was by, I'm sorry, it was by accident.  It was by accident.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: I was going to Budland, in fact, that's, I told you, that's really how I got--my grades went down.
Speaker 1: For those who don't know, what is Budland?
Speaker 2: Right, Budland was called the dance capital, because everybody, even when they came in town, went to Budland.  If you were a dancer and you liked to dance, that was the place to go, was to Budland, and to learn any of the new dances that were coming out, that's where you went, was Budland, so it was even like a tourist attraction.  Nobody would come to town without going to Budland.
Speaker 1: Dance hall or something like that?
Speaker 2: It was a club, it was a club.  It wasn't that really huge like it could have been because Budland was like down in the basement.  It was on Cottage Grove, 64th and Cottage Grove [Chicago, Illinois].  And up over the Budland, was the Pershing Ballroom, and then across the street was where the Grand Ballroom was.  These was all dance halls and the Pershing was where I saw Jackie Wilson dance, I mean sing too, but I mean, it was unbelievable just to see him dance, you know, for me, but this was, and then down the street was Basin Street.  That was your Latin.  And across from Basin Street, was McKee's [Disc Jockey Lounge] and that was your jazz, [John] Coltrane.  So this was just, to me, was awesome, 'cause you could just go like this and really get a wide spectrum of black art.
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much a last time that, those are last days of black, a lot of black clubs and--
Speaker 2: On the South Side.
Speaker 1: --the South Side, right.
Speaker 2: The Tivoli.  That's where everybody gave the big parties on the South Side, the ballrooms, Parkway Ballroom.  They gave the big dances there, you know, all the clubs gave the big dances there, so this was just a, it was really a dance era, that's my point.  You know everybody was dancing, really dancing, and that's why, it didn't, it didn't phase me about dropping out of school.  I wanted to dance, you know, and I just said I can always go back to school, I got to dance.
Story_ID: 128318
Speaker 1: And what happened, I was down at Basin Street [ph.] doing Latin dancing and this fellow was playing the timbales and I was just being creative then 'cause he was really, I said oh oh, and I went over there and talked to 'em and said oh, you can really play those timbales.  He said you can really dance good.  It was Master Henry.
Speaker 2: Henry Gibson.
Speaker 1: Henry Gibson, on them timbales.  And he told me, he says I work with this little band and they need a dancer and the band was the Artistic Heritage Ensemble led by [HM] Phil Cohran, and he said they're auditioning for dancers.  They want, we want a dancer with the band.  And I auditioned.  Well, I don't think, I said, I'm not, I'm not that good, I'm still taking classes, you know.  He said, oh, but just like you did here, you did your own thing.  That's what he wants, he just wants you to listen to the music and do whatever you want to do, so he's the one talked me into it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Let's stop a minute and explain who these people are.  Master Henry Gibson.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You know, just explain him.
Speaker 1: Right, Master Henry Gibson, and I feel that he is one of our master drummers that could play all the different percussion instruments, has played in some of the leading movies, you know, 'Super Fly.'  He worked with all the leading recording artists during that time also, Curtis Mayfield, all the singing groups coming out at that time.  All of them were going right into the, well I say all of them because it was a group of them, Satterfield, Donald Myrick.  I mean all of them were going, they were just backgrounding all the different records coming out at that particular time in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Henry Gibson, now he was famous for playing the congas and the bongos at the same time.
Speaker 1: Congas, bongos, that what I said, and timbales and like you said, all at the same time, going from one to the other.
Speaker 2: He was the lead percussionist for Curtis Mayfield--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --all of his big hits.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: So that's, at that time he was, I guess he was just kinda getting started.
Speaker 1: He was just getting started, like I said, we, we were all just having fun.
Story_ID: 128319
Speaker 1: And [HM Philip] Phil Cohran, now explain who Phil Cohran was.
Speaker 2: Right.  Phil Cohran, I mean has become my mentor.  He is one our leading composers, black composers of music and he was doing his own composition, and he's the co-founder of the AACM.
Speaker 1: Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And all of that was going on at that time so it was a movement going on in the arts and going back to yourself.  At that time I wasn't wearing a natural, or afro as they called it.  And that was the beginning.  My ears weren't pierced, 'cause I was just having fun dancing, you know, and I wasn't thinking about all this being a necessity to dance.  And when I went to the audition and, which was really not very hard because his wife, at that time, Sister Delores Ryell [ph.], she made me very comfortable.  She says, just relax and just do what, listen to the music and do whatever you want.  It's not that hard 'cause you're doing what you want to do.  And I did do that.  Like I said, I will say perfectly with her assistance, and it was so interesting that he came out, he said well sister, you did pretty good and I got a couple of other numbers I want you to listen to and he told me what he wanted from 'em, what type of numbers they were, Orpheus and explained it to me.  Cephas [ph.] was an Egyptian number, explained it to me and then I just did whatever I wanted to, you know, and he was pleased with the actions of it and asked me would I be willing to wear a natural, a afro?  And I wondered why I got to wear a afro just to do these numbers and, of course, he explained it to me again.  And that was my first, I would say initiation or my becoming aware, in which I really still did not understand it yet, until I totally got off in it because I would wear, I wore the afro and then I would leave and put on a wig.  I'll never forget because I was working in the first club, called the Sultan and this was the Artistic Heritage Ensemble and this is where they started at the Sultan, which was on 67th and Stony Island [Chicago, Illinois], and we worked in this, it wasn't bigger than a garage almost, and we worked there.  It was like my training ground because sometimes we wouldn't even have an audience because he was using all this new music that people did not understand.
Speaker 1: Now Phil Cohran was maybe just for those who don't know, he is, you consider him one of our leading people, but he wouldn't be well known by most people.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: But he, he is like, he doesn't have a lot of recordings out here commercially or anything like that, but he's known as a master musician in Chicago [Illinois] and a trainer of a lot of members of Earth Wind and Fire--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --other people that have come through.
Speaker 2: That's the thing, a lot of people have come through him because he never went commercial, but [HM] Oscar Brown, Jr. is an example of saying that his son had to train with him, you know, Bo Bo, bass player Oscar Brown Jr.'s son trained under Phil Cohran.
Speaker 1: Phil Cohran himself trained with Sun Ra at some point.
Speaker 2: That's right and [Jay] McShann also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was one of his musicians.
Speaker 1: These are names that are kind of underground music (unclear).
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Avant-garde.
Speaker 1: Sun Ra was more commercial and has got out there more, but still his roots go all the way back to the big band sound.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Like Phil Cohran was a member of the Nation of Islam for a while.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And then with Sun Ra and that band was on the cutting edge of avant-garde music as well his health and alternative lifestyle, all kinds of stuff.  They were trying all sorts of things.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: New things, so they are trying to, like the core of cultural arts movement rather than just--
Speaker 2: Right. To awaken the people to eating correctly, like you said, we did all of that--
Story_ID: 128320
Speaker 1: Because when I started with [HM] Phil Cohran from The Sultan, we went to On the Beach, and we were dancing at 63rd Street Beach [Chicago, Illinois] and playing at 63rd Street Beach, and giving dance workshops and music workshop and health workshops, teaching, you know, so I said, the whole thing of teaching kids and young people about their health and what they should eat and what they shouldn't eat, you know, and how they should be proud of their African heritage, and I, you know, wouldn't even thought about in that era of not wearing African garb, because everybody was wearing African garb, that was into their culture.
Speaker 2: Right, now the, the whole philosophy of being your natural self, I mean, meant that you were going to be African because that's what you are already.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: You just have to let it out, right.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: That's what he was trying, the message he was trying to get across.  And as a result people started creating, you know, new things.
Story_ID: 128321
Speaker 1: It was, I mean unbelievable the amount of things, I mean we were all inspired from each other.  We were all being inspired from each other, I mean the photographers, Carl Lewis, I mean we were just being inspired from each other, would look at the, because everybody was just taking a whole lot of pictures during those times, and--
Speaker 2: You talking about Roy Lewis?
Speaker 1: Roy Lewis, that's who I mean, sorry.  Roy Lewis, right.  He was taking a whole lot of pictures.  My picture was on the 47th Street, on the Wall of Respect.  That was Roy Lewis who took that picture of me dancing with [HM] Phil Cohran and [HM] Haki [Madhubuti] was doing poetry heavy during that time.  He was Don L. Lee during that time, and that's what I'm trying to tell you, everybody was just, Omar was looking and drawing, everybody was--
Speaker 2: Omar Lama, yeah.
Speaker 1: Omar Lama was very inspired by the movement at that time, you know, and that's what I'm saying, every, all the artists were just thriving off of each other.
Speaker 2: And Bennie Cassel [ph.], Omar Lama, Ramul Unda [ph.]--
Speaker 1: That's right.  Yeah, we need more like Bennie because artists doesn't have anyone now, I'm talking about the--when I say artist I'm not talking about the commercial artists, I'm saying that artist that loves to just be a artist, like Omar Lama as an example, need somebody to promote him.  The artists need somebody to promote them.  A lot of artists now are just hidden here in Chicago [Illinois] because they're not promoting themselves, and they're doing their artwork.  They're enjoying doing their artwork, but they're not promoting themselves so they're not making any money.  And Bennie was the type that, you know, was inspired by what we did and wanted to bring it to the front.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, I take it you weren't aware of this community of people until you got (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Exactly.  I was totally oblivion of it.  I was just teaching in my dance classes in my basement.  I had a group called Those Who Want to Dance.  That was the name of the group and I was taking students off of my block, girlfriends and their little sisters and I had all of them dancing and I had started teaching at the Englewood Urban Progress Center [Chicago, Illinois] in my neighborhood.
Story_ID: 128322
Speaker 1: Well tell us about the Afro-Arts Theater.
Speaker 2: Well after we left On the Beach--
Speaker 1: Well, wait a minute, maybe we should talk about The Beach first.
Speaker 2: Right.  That's how that happened.
Speaker 1: Now this is something that people remember in Chicago [Illinois] is the beach.  These are free concerts, right?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Given for the public and--
Speaker 2: Exactly.  The Illinois Art Council has, you know, they done wrote all these big grants, Doug Williams, Douglas Williams, who's the artist again, does sculptures.  They wrote these grants to have this big, at that time people were writing a lot of grants and they were doing school performances.  We did reach out performances on mobile units out in the streets, just going from street to street doing performances.  So they had wrote this grant to be stationary now on the beach at 63rd and Cottage Grove, I mean 63rd right off the lakefront.  And, in fact, the facilities are still there for something like that.  Unbelievable, I mean just was unbelievable because you got all these people that was coming to the beach and they just, let's go on over to this little area here and hear what these people playing.  And before you know it everybody that was on the beach would come over into that area and then I was giving dance workshops in the afternoon and all the members of the band were giving free music classes, voice classes going on, we had Ella Pearl, the Jackson Family.  They were giving voice lessons.  It was just a whole arts scene.  I can't remember who was doing the art beside Doug Williams, but it was just a whole art scene.
Speaker 1: I seen some of the photos of some of the, of the 63rd Street Beach house.  It was a big huge kind of, I don't know, stone looking facility with a--
Speaker 2: Yeah right.  Like a castle looking--
Speaker 1: --yeah and hundreds of people out there, performances, thousands, yeah, thousands of people out there.  And now the Afro-Arts Theater, well--
Speaker 2: Now right, because that's what happened.  We said that when the summer finished you know, that meant that was the end of that, so we said we don't want this to just die like this here.  We need to house this.  All these people we don't want, there's no place else for them to go so we need to find a theater that can house it and bring these people to a cultural setting like this here.  And so, he had, by that time Phil Cohran [HM Philip Cohran] had a following and so he had people that really believed in the same ideas that he did beside ourselves, the band and the dancers, and they all came together and, at a lodge on 75th and right off of Cottage Grove.  I'm trying to remember what the name of that lodge is.
Speaker 1: Oh that's the--
Speaker 2: What was the name of that lodge on 75th Street, but we came from--that's where we had our meetings at to form a group to raise money to buy, to rent really, to rent on 39th Street.
Speaker 1: That's Moorish Science Temple, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 75th Street.
Speaker 2: Uh hum, I can't remember the exact name of it.
Speaker 1: (unclear) Temple or something like that?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  But that was where we had our meetings and from that humble beginning we were able to rent on 39th Street and they cleaned, it wasn't being really used for nothing, you know, it was just playing cartoons.
Speaker 1: Oakwood Theater, or Oakenwald Theater?
Speaker 2: Oakenwald, it was Oakenwald 'cause it was right off of Oakenwald [sic, The Oakland Square, 3947 S. Drexel, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, that was, that was a community that used to be a mostly Jewish community over there, I believe, but this theater was, had a, is now wiped off the face of the earth.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: It was an old movie theater and it wasn't being used for anything and you all got use of the theater.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that became the home of the Afro-Arts Theater.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Became the home of the Afro-Arts Theater and it was very, it was just really a idealistic dream come true for all of us, you know, like we have come together, we raised the money, people were painting it free.  I mean all the people that were working in it to make it be, you know, even, no funding whatsoever.  No funding.  It was all from this, it was like a community.  If you can paint, okay come, we need somebody to paint, you know, carpentry.  Everybody was doing it free.  All the performers, free.  Wasn't no money.
Story_ID: 128323
Speaker 1: So you didn't charge for the performances [at the Afro-Arts Theater, Chicago, Illinois] either?
Speaker 2: We, we charged, you know like a dollar just 'cause the main thing we were trying to get the people in there.  So it wasn't no money, the money that was being made, that had to be to pay for the light, you know, pay for the electricity and pay for the running of the place.
Speaker 1: Now were you still working at Illinois Bell [Telephone Company] during this period of time?
Speaker 2: Oh no.  I had let that go and like I said I went to the Englewood Urban Progress Center.  I was working at Englewood Urban Progress.  In fact, I almost got fired from Englewood Urban Progress Center for doing a performance down at the Afro-Arts Theater because that was during LeRoi Jones' [Amiri Baraka] time and he had gotten beat up.
Speaker 1: Now, explain this story.  Wait, wait a minute, go back and explain this story to us in detail.  What happened?
Speaker 2: LeRoi had, LeRoi as I said, his name was LeRoi Jones at that time.  He was angry.
Speaker 1: This is Amiri Baraka now.
Speaker 2: Now, exactly.
Speaker 1: He was in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: He was in Chicago and he wanted to tell his story of how he had gotten beaten up--
Speaker 1: And what?
Speaker 2: --and he came to the Afro-Arts Theater.  Not only did he come, right after that, Stokely Carmichael came.  Well I was working at the Englewood Urban Progress Center which is city, and that's when politics started coming in view, because [Richard J.] Daley was in, you know, at that time and he didn't really want any of us being down there.  Unbelievable and the Progress Center Director came to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, well wait a minute, I'm just trying to--so LeRoi Jones was beaten up here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: No
Speaker 1: In Chicago or someplace else?
Speaker 2: No, no, Newark [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: New Jersey.  He had had a run-in with the police and he's, you know, he's such a good speaker so when he came to the Afro-Arts Theater, I mean it was just packed, and they didn't want any, and Stokely Carmichael, it was just packed.  They didn't want to allow any of the press to come in, and I think that's how we got closed down.
Story_ID: 128324
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're saying that this was a big, well, before you all had done mostly art and poetry and that sort of thing--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Now, here's a political speech, so that made for some friction with the city?
Speaker 2: That definitely did.  Because he [LeRoi Jones aka Amiri Baraka] was almost, telling, telling our young men to go out there and kick the first policeman you see, I mean, that's how he made 'em feel, you know, 'cause he was so angry.  And it really could have caused a riot.  It really could have.  We tried to calm him down 'cause, you know, we weren't about that.  We didn't think that was the way.  We thought the arts was, first we have to clean our people up and make them have black pride in themselves and feel good about themselves and use their minds, you know, we were trying to clean our people up.  We weren't about that.
Speaker 1: So you all--
Speaker 2: But it didn't make no difference.  We [Afro-Arts Theater, Chicago, Illinois] got closed down for fire hazard or something silly, you know.
Speaker 1: So the city closed the place down?
Speaker 2: Sure did.
Speaker 1: How long were you in operation before the city closed it down?
Speaker 2: Well, every minute, that's what I'm talking about, we would open back up and they would close us back down, we would open back up, those kinds of things.  Every time--they told us that, you know, this supposed to be a public place, how can you not let people in, it's not a private place, I mean, just all, all kind of ordinance went, happened.  So it wasn't like they just closed us down.  They would close us down for some kind of hazard in the place, you know.  Something wrong, wiring wrong, anything.  But we knew that it wasn't, it was because they hadn't let the press in, et cetera, so they started allowing the press to come in.
Speaker 1: From what I understand, the building was owned by a white guy--
Speaker 2: That's right
Speaker 1: --from the old neighborhood--
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: --and there was some tension in that relationship too.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: I guess so.
Speaker 2: There was a lot of tension going on.
Story_ID: 128325
Speaker 1: We were, what was keeping the Afro-Arts Theater [Chicago, Illinois] alive is that we were working.  I was working three jobs.  I was working Englewood Urban Progress Center.  I was dancing in the schools.  I was working at Peppermint Lounge in the evenings, you know, we were working.  All of us were, and then all of the musicians were such fine musicians they were working in the recording studios, so we were actually dishing out money to keep that Afro-Arts Theater, that's what I'm saying, the Afro-Arts Theater wasn't making no money.
Speaker 2: Okay, so the artists really were supporting the venue, as a venue to perform for the community or to give art to the community.
Speaker 1: Right.  All of those musicians at that time, we all, all the artists I will say, at that time really felt that what [HM Philip] Phil Cohran was about was uplifting our people and we felt that this was the thing to do.  This was the right thing to do.  This is what artists should be about, is uplifting their people.  And the '60s [1960s] was just an era of '60s [1960s] to the '70s [1970s] I would say, was just that kind of era that you wanted to do whatever you could to be a servant, a servant to your race.
Story_ID: 128326
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about the, well, Afro-Arts Theater [Chicago, Illinois], the building itself.  The owner now, didn't, he wasn't, he's a white guy from the old neighborhood that owned it for a long time.  It was in shambles when you all went into it.  You cleaned it up, but at a certain point, they developed some conflict about if you all were going to pay rent, or if he is going to sell popcorn is what I heard, but I don't know.  Tell me what you know about the situation.
Speaker 2: Well, the only thing I could say that's for sure I know, it wasn't no popcorn sold there.  Now I don't know, I don't know the business aspect if that's the reason that, you know, we don't, we didn't keep the place, but what happened is, at that time Look Magazine was going to do an article on us.  They were following us around.  I told you we were in the school system doing performances also and then we're doing universities.  I mean we're going everywhere.  We're performing everywhere.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you had the visual artists too, AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] was, didn't they operate out of there too, or did they?
Speaker 2: Again, they were, we allowed anybody almost to come in and have workshops, they would giving workshops.  We had womanhood workshops trying to teach women how to cook and the importance, sewing class, the importance of knowing how to sew, manhood classes, trying to teach men the importance of, how to be good to their wives and family.  It was unbelievable, I mean, Swahili classes, I mean we had all kinds--
Speaker 1: You said that Wallace Muhammad [Warith Deen Muhammad] talks about (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right.  I didn't even know that's who that was at that time because he was a quiet young man.  Just had all kinds of classes in the evening because it was open.  Anybody that really wanted to share their knowledge 'cause don't forget all the classes, everything is free.  I taught free dance classes.  I mean I never thought of charging 'cause I also worked at the Englewood Urban Progress Center and I taught free dance classes there.  In fact, [HM] Val [Gray Ward] worked there at a time too, Val Gray Ward taught drama classes so, you know, there was a time where all these centers were open too where the city was paying for all these free classes.  Everybody was getting free classes.
Speaker 1: The OBAC [Organization of Black American Culture] Writers' Workshop started around the same time.
Speaker 2: Exactly, and the AACM [Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians], they were giving classes out of 67th where the Chicago Theater is, they were giving classes there free.
Speaker 1: Oh, Parkway Community House.
Speaker 2: Parkway Community Center.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So you just said all over the cities, there's all these free classes, art classes of all kinds going on.
Speaker 1: Wall of Respect was being painted around the same period of time.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And nobody's messing it up, you know, it's on 47th Street.  In fact they guarding it, making sure nobody don't mess up that Wall of Respect.
Speaker 1: In fact, you got all the--Mitchell Caton, [HM] Jeff Donaldson, and Calvin Jones [ph.] and there's some others I guess but there was a lot of art going on.
Speaker 2: Don't forget [HM] Dr. [Margaret] Burroughs is in her, out of her house.  She's got a museum going on on 39th and right off of--is that Michigan?  Is that Michigan?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 36th and Mich--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right across the street from there is the South Side Community Arts Center, all of these art classes are up there, photography classes, free, are up in that building, you know, I mean, just art is just all over the place.
Speaker 1: So this is a, you know, this is real important, a big explosion of art, like we've probably never seen since.
Speaker 2: Right, I don't think so, since.  This explosion of just art all over and the art fairs were just, Lake Meadows.  I could not believe, I was, here I am, I'm doing a dance workshop out at Lake Meadows, also Jewell McLaurin, she's doing a dance workshop outside too.  We both doing it at the same time, you know.  I walk around the art work and who do I run into showing his art work off?  Don L. Lee [HM Haki Madhubuti].  I didn't even know, here he is a writer and also a artist, excellent artist, excellent.  All his artwork.  Don L. Lee.  Haki.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: That's why I'm telling you.  Saw his art work and he's exhibiting his art work at Lake Meadows, because everybody was just, you know, you didn't do no one thing.  People, all the jewelry makers, I mean making jewelry, little tedious artwork and the earrings and necklace.
Speaker 1: Babatunde I guess.
Speaker 2: Oh, Babatunde, Brother Seka [ph.].
Speaker 1: Seka, right, I heard--
Speaker 2: Seka, he's in California now, but I mean he's the one that really brought a lot of 'em out to do the tedious work.  And now, you know, they come out to the African Festival.  A lot of 'em come out from California, Atlanta [Georgia], that were right here doing those art work at Lake Meadows--
Story_ID: 128327
Speaker 1: So, what--can you give me a description of say a typical performance at the Afro-Arts Theater [Chicago, Illinois].  What do they consist of, who would be on the stage?
Speaker 2: Uh hum. [HM] Okoro Harold [Johnson].  He would be doing a drama presentation.
Speaker 1: So a play.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  Right.  You know, just a couple of scenes on his acts.
Speaker 1: Okoro Harold Johnson?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  The Jackson Family, they would be singing some of their original tunes 'cause everything was up--don't forget this is the time, everything was original.
Speaker 1: They were gospel?
Speaker 2: Gospel choir, group, because they had they whole family, the children singing with them.  And then you would have the  Phil Cohran [HM Philip Cohran] Band that was doing their own compositions that had drama inside of those one.  I'll never forget one that we did was called Armagada [ph.].  Armagada, and oh, was that unbelievable because the fog machine was used, and when the fog machine came up, we had these masks on and we would come out like people were dying and running through the aisles screaming, you know, it's the end of the world, it's the end of the world.  So, it was, you know, I'm saying just a multi-media going on, and you couldn't get bored because you didn't know what was gone happen next.
Speaker 1: So you have poetry--
Speaker 2: You have poetry being read, dance, drama, singing.
Speaker 1: Artwork, visual artwork.
Speaker 2: Visual arts all in the lobby.  Some artists were showing off their works and you had all the, and the vendors.  That was really the beginning of the vendors.
Speaker 1: So the vendors were selling jewelry--
Speaker 2: Selling their jewelry, clothing--
Speaker 1: --crafts.
Speaker 2: --crafts and their food.
Speaker 1: Now you have food, yeah, that's another thing, food becomes a specialty--
Speaker 2: A specialty.
Speaker 1: --an Afro-Arts specialty in a sense.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  'Cause now we talking about trying to become vegetarians and the significance of it.
Speaker 1: So we have a group of artists, basically at the core of pushing what most people would call progressive ideas to the community.  They're advocating stop smoking back in the era, when cigarettes were everywhere.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Don't drink, don't smoke.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: The arts previous to this had been associated with smoking and drinking.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And that was the whole thing that Phil Cohran explained to the band 'cause of course they were ones that smoke and stuff and he told 'em, he said you can't, you know, you need to clean up brothers.  Y'all need to clean up, you got to clean up, so your music can be clean.  That's just how he felt and, you know, that the music was supposed to be a therapy and the same thing with the dance and my whole, and I, you know, I was imitating him because that was my mentor, you know, and I was telling the girls, okay, you gotta wash your hair.  You can't dance with me unless you wear a natural or afro.  You gotta wear long dresses, can't come in here with no minis or anything, you know, so I was doing the same thing of trying to turn them around and tell them that oh, I don't wanna see you eatin' no pork, you got to try to clean up these eating habits, you know.  That's what--we were all real, I mean, to the extreme, to the extreme about it.
Story_ID: 128328
Speaker 1: Now how did your family feel about this?
Speaker 2: They was laughing at me.  Calling me nappy head, and, of course, now, 'cause don't forget, we're, I wouldn't say trend, but that's the way they would look at it now, you know, we setting something that people aren't doing.  So, you know, like I say, I come from this liberal family, will let you do whatever you want to, but that don't mean that they like it.  They are laughing at me.  Yeah, if you want to wear your hair nappy, go ahead and do this, but this is not what they're into so I mean, I had, and they were, they were still eating pork, et cetera, and here I am eating, as they called it, grass, you know.  Why are you eating that stuff, and they was just, oh, they having a ball.  And then you look up a couple of years later, my mother's got an afro, my brother's got a afro, you know.  I'll never forget that and then I had to laugh, you know.  Three years ago you was laughing at me.  So, oh well that was different, now, you know, you, you know, the movement, people right, we've got to change our ways if we--we got to feel proud of ourselves.  They didn't change their eating habits, but they understood at least black pride.  They understood that aspect of it, but, and they, you know, they went into trying to eat more vegetables, but, and as they say, we won't eat as much pork.  So it changed a lot of people I felt.
Story_ID: 128329
Speaker 1: Did the Sun Drummers start around, about that time?
Speaker 2: Exactly, Black Harold [Harold Atu Murray], he was, he's from Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] too.  He lived in Englewood.  That's where I met--
Speaker 1: Did they call him Black Harold?
Speaker 2: That's what they first called him, Black Harold.
Speaker 1: Because he advocated black--
Speaker 2: Exactly.  He was walking around with sandals in the winter for a long period of time.
Speaker 1: Explain to me, explain this life.  What did black mean then, as opposed to being colored or Negro?
Speaker 2: Right, I think that was the whole point, we wanted to get out of those, we called them stereotype names, that you wanted to feel black pride in being yourself and, and feeling good about yourself because you, like I told you, I used to hate them to say Blackburn.  And I can, you know, I'd always, again, tell my students about those days that I went through at Lindblom [Technical High School, later Lindblom Math & Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois] because, I, of course, I don't feel that way no more.  I'm glad my name is Blackburn, you know, because I'm, the first thing I tell my students, I'm black and I'm burned black, you know, so, you know, I embed that word and a different vibration after I awoke.  You know, but as we call it, when I was dead, you know, I didn't look at it that way. And that's why, once I woke up to saying yes, this is the way my hair is and people have to like for myself, the pride spilled over even to, after I started teaching at Columbia College, you know, different people I met, Caucasians I met, you know, respected me as myself.  I was able to get along with all races and I, and I will never forget I was at, I was doing a workshop and doing a performance at the Field Museum and his name was Mr. Weiselrowski [ph.] that gave me a huge sum to go to Africa in '69 [1969] and he brought his children to see my performance and I had all my African garb and everything on, and one of the little girls, his little girl said, "Why is she acting like that?"  And he said, "Oh, she's just proud of herself."  "Why she so proud of herself?"  "Because she knows her African heritage."  You know, and that's just, it was like a blackness is like a awakening, like we had been sleep, dead, and we just woke up and said ah, it's okay.
Speaker 1: So when they were calling Harold (unclear) Black Harold and everything, he had a--
Speaker 2: In touch with himself.  And you know, not sometimes, he took pride in that name, that he had woke up, had realized he was black, and it's alright to be black, just like it's alright to be white, red, blue, green.  It doesn't matter.
Story_ID: 128330
Speaker 1: Now I heard a story from Musa Moses [ph.] who makes drums--
Speaker 2: Right, one of my drummers.
Speaker 1: His first drum was made after he went down to the Field Museum [Chicago, Illinois] and looked at drums in cases--
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: And he says that he felt that since he was an African, he could probably make an African drum himself.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And he went home and made one.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Cut a tree down, and or got a, got some wood and made one.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: Now he carves, carves drums--
Speaker 2: That's right--
Speaker 1: --all the time
Speaker 2: --no doubt about it.
Speaker 1: but, and his drums, some of his drums are fascinating.
Speaker 2: I think his log drums in particular 'cause he started when he was playing with me with the log drum with the slit drum.
Speaker 1: He said he just looked at it in the case and figured he could do it.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: People were experimenting and doing things that they never thought to do before.
Speaker 2: Never thought.  Phil Cohran [HM Philip Cohran] has a Spanish sweep and he asked me to play some castanets on his Spanish sweep, and dance, and I said, I don't play castanets.  I don't do flamenco dancing, you know, I don't know nothing like that.  He said that's Moorish, you can do it sister, you can do it.  I said oh no, I can't to myself I'm saying.  And he said I done told you, just meditate, 'cause I was into my yoga then.  In fact, me and Asar [Hapi] started together right in my house doing yoga, three a.m. in the morning and he said, just meditate on it.
Story_ID: 128331
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Now this is something we ought to stop a little bit, Asar Hapi, yoga instructor.  He travels all over teaching yoga in different cities and he started in your house doing it?
Speaker 1: Right, we just, somebody said that we should hook up because I was very athletic, you know, and I was a dancer, and introduced us and said that, you know, y'all about the same thing, you know, and we started, he started coming, well, you know, he's a mild-mannered brother.  He said, yeah sister, we should get together and do some yoga together.  I said, well I'd be interested in that.  He said well, then we'll make some plans and I'll come by your house.  And we started working on yoga, I mean like until three o'clock in the morning going through all these poses, falling asleep in these poses.  And he started teaching it to my dance class as you know, and I started my dance troupe, I started making an issue of, that everybody need to know yoga, right?  And started giving classes there and then I was getting ready to leave to go to Africa again, in 1977 and we were both teaching out of the South Side Community Arts Center, and I was painting the place at that time because I was into my aura and into colors, what colors mean, and we had the ceiling looking like the sky, and all the different colors, and I hate to say it, they haven't taken that paint down, even now.  It is still there.  We painted the kitchen orange and yellow, you know for the sun, had the dressing rooms all different colors.  Anyway, totally off into our art, we would call it the creative space, and I told him, I said Asar, I'm getting ready to go to Nigeria for about two years and teach there, but I want you to keep this space up, but they didn't believe I was really going, you know, and that's how it started.
Story_ID: 128332
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have to tell us about how that got, well, te--first of all, let's finish--well how--What happened to the Afro-Arts Theater [Chicago, Illinois]?  I mean what--how it--What's your interpretation of how it, why it closed down?
Speaker 2: Oh, my interpretation is that, like I told you, we were making all this money around town and Look magazine was taking all these pictures of us, et cetera, and the band and Phil Cohran [HM Philip Cohran], I remember hearing them upstairs, that's all I did, was hearing them upstairs arguing over money, because the group asked for like, I don't know how much money, but it was a lot of money to get this big spread in Look magazine, and it was a mess, they broke up on a money issue, saying that Phil was getting more money than them and he was explaining to them why he got more money than them, and he needed the money to run the art, the theater, and that they were only looking at one aspect of it and not looking at, and they were trying to explain to him that they all had families just like him and that they needed to get more money out of all the different jobs that we were doing.  Because a lot of times, I would, me I was working at Englewood Progress Center.  I would let 'em have my check.  I said, well y'all can have my money 'cause, you know, right, yawl got children, I don't, you know, and I have a job.  But, that's a shame that money, to me, always is a problem with the artists, because really not having a business manager because here we are again, the artists running their affairs.
Speaker 1: So it just kind of fell apart, you know--
Speaker 2: Fell apart because of that, because of money differences, and Phil Cohran told them if he felt, if they felt that they could do a better job of running the Afro-Arts Theater than he could, this was the facts, then here you have it, I'm gone brothers.  And he left.  And gave it to The Pharaohs and that's how The Pharaohs came about, 'cause remember at first it was the Artistic Heritage Ensemble.
Speaker 1: Okay, now The Pharaohs, did they become, some of them become Earth Wind and Fire?
Speaker 2: And some of them became Earth Wind and Fire, because what they did, they were idealistic.  They let the Blackstone Rangers [Black P. Stone Nation] come in 'cause they gone turn them around.  Yeah brothers, y'all live in the neighborhood, you can come on in here and have your meetings and we can talk and maybe, you know, you can become conscious, because everybody talking about becoming conscious, you become conscious too.  And right, you can help us, you know, you can be our security.  Big mistake.  Huge mistake.  Because before you knew it, they wanted to take over the theater.  So, here we go again, what do they, what do The Pharaohs wanna do?  You think you can handle it, you can have it.
Speaker 1: And they stayed there really as a, they made, basically the Blackstone Rangers headquarters out of it.
Speaker 2: Exactly, so, I mean, that show you, people dropped it.
Speaker 1: Daley razed it in 1991 and he made one final raid on it and then razed it to the ground.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  But that's really what it was.  First it was The Artistic Heritage Ensemble, then it was The Pharaohs, and then it was El Rukns.
Speaker 1: Okay, now let's talk about, now we're at about what year now when the Afro-Arts Theater closes?  And it really wasn't open that long.
Speaker 2: It wasn't open that long, so--
Speaker 1: Maybe about a year or so?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm getting ready to say, if anything, maybe '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: 1970.
Speaker 2: '71 [1971] maybe, maybe '70 [1970], '71 [1971], yes, because The Pharaohs got it now.
Story_ID: 128333
Speaker 1: Now are we ready to take you to Nigeria 'cause you went to Cross River State in Nigeria to study--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, first I went to Ghana in 1969.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was still when [HM] Dr. [Margaret] Burroughs--
Speaker 1: That was your first trip there?
Speaker 2: That was my first trip.  I went with Dr. Burroughs and that was when she just had the museum out of her house.  And she had saw me dance at the DuSable Museum, she was still an art teacher at the DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois], and she said you need to go to Africa, and she says I'm getting ready this summer to go to Ghana with the American Forum, which is gonna be a group of teachers, or going to be teachers of the African, different African Studies Departments all over the United States.  And, of course I said I don't have no money to be going to Ghana or no place else, abroad, and she said you can raise money if you really want to go.  And that, she became my second mentor, after Brother Philip because she started me doing affirmations and really believing I could do anything I wanted to.  I just had to want to do it.  I had to know what I wanted to do and put a plan in.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you raised the money to go to Ghana in '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: In '69 [1969], and--
Speaker 1: What was Ghana like in '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, it wasn't like I thought it was going to be 'cause I thought, it was after [Kwame] Nkrumah so when I went there at the University of [Ghana at] Legon everybody had on white shirts and collared down, you know, and I'm ready to see people in African garb and all of that.
Speaker 1: 'Cause all of the pictures of Nkrumah always had him with his kente on.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh hum.  So I didn't see kente until I went into the villages, when I went to kente villages and that was like a, like a dream, you know, actually seeing people making kente cloth.  I mean it was like a dream.  I felt that I was in a dream.  You know how you go and be on a bus and think this is just a picture going by because this is my first trip, but it was great for me because I met John Jatoi [ph.], which was the leading dancer at that time of the Ghana Dance Ensemble (unclear) in Chicago [Illinois], and then Victor Clottey, another Ghanaian, that has worked here in Chicago with Urban Gateways.  But I met them in Ghana and they were, they were like night and day, and they still are like night and day people, and they were both coming, wanted to come to Chicago because, I told you about this fellow, Weiselrowski [ph.] and his family that gave me this money to go on this trip that Dr. Burroughs introduced me to, was also paying the way for Victor Clottey to come here, so he had told me, he said when you get to Ghana, I want you to meet with Victor Clottey and he will show you around and make you familiar with everything.  Okay when I went there, I got in touch with Victor 'cause he was right on the campus.  He was teaching dance classes at the University of Legon, with the Ghana Dance Ensemble, under the direction of Dr. Opoku [ph.] and he started helping me to get money.  I didn't have any real money.  I forget I done just raised enough money to get on the airplane, and he said, well you got talent.  He says you can go to some of the night clubs and perform.  And so he set up some performances in some of the clubs.  So I was dancing in the clubs in the evening, you know, and taking my dance classes at the University in the daytime and that's when I met John Jatoi, cause he was the leading dancer of the Ghana Dance Ensemble, and they kinda, the Ghana Dance Ensemble kinda like took me in and took me around to all their different performances, etcetera, and Jatoi and I became very close friends, so I told him when you come to Chicago, you come see me, you come and see me 'cause I have a dance troupe and I want you to perform with 'em.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Jatoi, he's a, had his own dance troupe in Chicago.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So is Victor Clottey.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Uh hum.  But I met both of them in Ghana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that was your first trip in '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: '69 [1969].  So it was like so easy, you know, I just thought I came back and then I taught everything I knew to my dancers and I said boy, this is taking so long for me to teach you all of this, if you go with me, you can learn as I'm learning, and then we can come back and perform.
Story_ID: 128334
Speaker 1: Now did that make you the only dance instructor in Chicago [Illinois] that had been to Africa, I mean in the black community?
Speaker 2: At that time, at that time because see at that time I also was exposed to [HM] Katherine Dunham through Lucille Ellis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now she's a former Katherine Dunham dancer.
Speaker 2: Former, right, lead dancer and close friend of Katherine Dunham and, in fact, there was a period where I was thinking about leaving the Afro-Arts Theater, leaving being a part of [HM] Phil Cohran's and going down in East St. Louis [Illinois] to stay and study 'cause I, I like to study.  And study under Katherine Dunham 'cause she had just come to East St. Louis then.  And Lucille Ellis had just come back from New York City and was living in Chicago and told me, and was teaching classes and I was taking Dunham technique from Lucille Ellis and so she was telling me that Dunham needed some teachers there and I've taught you basic Dunham technique and I want you to go down there and I want you to finish school.  So here I got all these mentors of mines telling me which way to go, to be truthful, and I'm trying to decide which way to go, you know, myself.  And Dunham came up. I met Dunham and so, of course, I was all enthusiastic actually meeting Katherine Dunham so I said, yes, I wanna go.  So I go down to East St. Louis and registered in school under anthropology and end up  teaching Dunham classes basic, and then I'm taking intermediate classes and I'm getting stuck, I'm getting stuck.  And then I'm doing performances down there, then I'm doing lecture demonstrations with Katherine Dunham.  I demonstrating (unclear) so I'm, I'm losing identity.
Story_ID: 128335
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, we had you back here in 1970, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969], we was at the Ghana University [University of Ghana at Legon] and I was talking about Victor Clottey and Jatoi [ph.] coming here.
Speaker 1: You talked about [HM] Katherine Dunham too.
Speaker 2: Right.  Then I--
Speaker 1: You're in [East] St. Louis [Illinois] and you're stuck, that's right,
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm stuck.
Speaker 1: Stuck in St. Louis, East St. Louis [Illinois].
Speaker 2: East St. Louis.
Speaker 1: It is an all-black town.
Speaker 2: Right, and they were having problems there.
Speaker 1: A lot of problems 'cause they don't get any resources and the economy is not that good.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And Dunham has made up her mind she's going to start a museum there, which she did do, but I'm there just when she's getting ready to do all of this.  And she's just beginning, and it was just really, that was what it was it was just so many things that she was starting that I didn't want to be stuck there, you know.  I didn't want to lose my personal, my identity because everything, everything was Katherine Dunham, you know, it's like your name is not really mentioned, you just dancing under Katherine Dunham.
Speaker 1: She has a reputation of being quite a diva I guess.
Speaker 2: It's, it's this, like I said, it's just that she didn't, she wouldn't say your name.  I mean I actually would come from performances and somebody would ask me was I Katherine Dunham, and that's what woke me up.  I said oh, no, I'm not Katherine Dunham.  I wanted to say, you know, 'cause there was a time when a lot of the elder artists would not show their pictures as they were at that time, so you saw a lot of pictures of her during the '60s [1960s] when she was dancing.
Speaker 1: During the '40s [1940s], '30s [1930s] to '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: Right, and you seeing pictures that really that are way in the '40s [1940s], so they really, a lot of 'em didn't know her by eyesight, and she was like keeping a mystic thing going on, so I said, "Oh no, I'm not Katherine Dunham."  I said, "I'm going back to Chicago [Illinois] where I'm Darlene Blackburn."  So I just came on back.
Speaker 1: This was about, around 1970?
Speaker 2: This is like '70 [1970], right, I'm still, we're still, I'm still at the Afro Arts Theater.
Speaker 1: When did the Afro-Arts Theater close?
Speaker 2: I really think around '71 [1971] that it really went over to another group of people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we, I mean, like I said, the artists were trying to hold it up.  It wasn't that they were making any money off of it.  You know, 'cause I told you, Pharaohs were able, they were then deciding to make their own LPs and they were still working in the recording studios heavy.  So they were making their monies other means in the arts.
Story_ID: 128336
Speaker 1: Now were you here [Chicago, Illinois] when Fred Hampton and Mark Clark were killed [1969]?
Speaker 2: I was, but see I wasn't into none of that.  I really, I hate to say, being that Fred's son [Fred Hampton, Jr.] is right in the Englewood community now trying to uprise.  Black Panthers was a thing that I personally didn't believe in so I didn't delve into, pay any attention to 'em really heavy, I didn't believe in what they were about.
Speaker 1: I mean, what did you, what was your major disagreement with them?
Speaker 2: We were so black-minded, that was the reason why, like I said, we got closed down, the Afro-Arts Theater.  We didn't, we didn't want that idea of blacks and whites working together because we didn't feel, now how is somebody gonna be telling us talking black to us about black and they're not black.  We couldn't see it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That may seem strange to some people but I, that's--that the Black Panther wouldn't be black enough (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the way we felt.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  They were Marxist at that time right, basically?
Speaker 2: Yes, and they were, and you know, they just had too many white women around.  Just had too many white women around us, you know, we thought they was just frontin'.  You know, again, it was just, you know, the movement was in and they was just in the movement, you know.  But, seriously, here they were, they were smoking, they were drinking, you know.  We were clean.  I mean I didn't smoke, I didn't drink, you know.  My dancers didn't do it and if they did do it, they sure enough didn't do it around me.  Bad image.
Speaker 1: Once again, the idea that you really can't make any change unless you change yourself.
Speaker 2: Exactly, we were just totally, I mean to the extreme.  We just, I say to the extreme because you can't expect everybody to be baptized, you know, be in the water, in fact, that's what made me stop going to church was I looked up wasn't no more people to be baptized.  And I felt the same thing was happening with the Afro-Arts Theater, you know, that they wanted everybody to be so clean and it's just, it's just, you just can't expect that out of people.  It was too extreme, including myself.  I was too extreme on my dancers, you know.  I mean I would give them clothes off my back.  I would say you don't have nothing to wear?  Here, because you can't wear that.  You know, everybody had to have on African garb because we were setting examples, you know, and you can't go out into the public, because life is a stage, without setting that example.  And I really think it was to the extreme that we didn't get enough people to really follow us because they didn't feel comfortable when they came to the Afro-Arts Theater if they didn't have on African garb.  The projects didn't come across the street with African garb on, so they looked at us as all them crazy people over there.  We couldn't get the black mass as a whole after the beach, you see what I'm saying, because on the beach they were wearing bikinis and everything else, and we didn't--it wasn't no problem.  I don't know why it was such a problem when we got to the Afro-Arts Theater that we didn't open our arms enough to embrace just black people, or just people.  It was too extreme.
Story_ID: 128337
Speaker 1: Now was Brother Phil [HM Philip Cohran] like the major ideologue I guess?
Speaker 2: Uh hum, right.  And it was, it was too extreme because people every, people that, especially people too far as I'm concerned that are in substance abuse, this is, you know, they're sick.  So you have to treat people like they're sick not like they trash or terrible because they're sick, maybe they would like to change and some of 'em did change but they went back, you know, they weren't able to stay clean.  I'll put it that way, weren't able to stay clean, and they didn't feel comfortable around him, you know, because they weren't as strong as he was, you know, they weren't able to stay clean.  That's all I can personally say.  And I'm sorry that they weren't able because a lot of 'em, you know, like Miles [Davis] died, you know a lot of good musicians are gone because they weren't able, but I think it was totally too extreme.
Speaker 1: It's interesting.  This is a movement, a clean-up movement being run by artists and artists are the ones always have a history of succumbing to all these problems on a high rate, I guess on a high level that even the average man or woman in the black community 'cause they're exposed to, you know, drugs and--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --clubs, you know, club life.
Speaker 2: And everybody, like I used to tell my dancers, everybody willing to give you anything, don't take anything because they gone give it to you free, you know, and you know, trying to explain to them the things that happened to people like Miles and [John] Coltrane and them, you know, that they were being exposed, you know, you don't want to follow that, you know.  You wanna be good musicians like them, but you don't want to follow their tragedy of Charlie Parker, you know.  But--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember the book cover, we walk away in the new world (unclear).
Speaker 2: Uh hum, right.
Speaker 1: Omar Lama's cover of the poem.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: --It seemed like it explains the whole era in some way.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: People were talking about cleaning up, creating and building something.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Everybody, you know, we were all, my child went to Blyden School [Blyden Center for Creative Development, Chicago, Illinois].  Everybody was into alternative schools, you know, that, black schools, you know, positive institute.  We were all into teaching our children to have pride in themselves and thought that maybe cleaning up their eating habits would help 'em too, you know, and I do and I agree with that too and I still think, that if they don't eat all that candy, you know, they eat vegetables every day and salads everyday like they do at Betty Shabazz [International Charter School, Chicago, Illinois].  I think it makes a child better.
Story_ID: 128338
Speaker 1: So in 1971 what did you do in '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: In '71 [1971], I took a dance troupe, my dance troupe to Nigeria.  I raised money again with the help of [HM] Oscar Brown Jr. and Jean Pace.  I gave a, it was a colonial house at that time R.L. Leak owned right off of Cottage Grove on 79th Street [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Right.  Now this is a venue that became Perv's House a little later on--
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: --and now I think it's a motel or something.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  But it was a colonial house when it first opened.  In fact, some people have some footage of us, some black producers that I'm still trying to find because they, at that time, here we go, all the TV stations have blacks behind the cameras and they done put a group together of black cameramen and they decided they gone do their own shooting in their community of the artists, and they did some, just some really nice work on our dance troupe, and publicized us and Oscar Brown [Jr.] and Jean, they said they would do a free performance for us.  [HM] Herb Kent was the M.C.  We raised so much money and we took all the money and then plus, we had engagements at universities.  They gave us the money, in advance, to come back and do the performance.  So it was no, it wasn't even hard to raise that money.  And I took ten artists to Nigeria with me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You went to Cross River State [Nigeria]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: That's another trip.
Speaker 2: That's another trip.
Speaker 1: I keep--
Speaker 2: '71 [1971] is my first trip with my dance troupe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So where did you go?
Speaker 2: We went to Lagos [Nigeria].  Uh hum.  Went to Lagos.  Alyo Tolbert was my solo dancer at that time and he went with us.  Harold Murray was still Harold Murray at that time.  He went, you know.  And Karu [ph.].  I don't know if you've heard of Karu, but he's one of the drummers too.  So I took two drummers and eight dancers with me to Ghana, I mean to Nigeria.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you had made arrangements to study with somebody in Nigeria?
Speaker 2: Wonderful again.  Africans here in Chicago [Illinois] had made arrangements for us to go over there and perform at this hotel while we was gonna study dance.  So we were performing in the evenings and studying in the day.  So someone met us at the, at the airport, you know, when we got there, and took us to the hotel and we started performing there in the evenings and taking classes with the local artists in the daytime.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what group, I mean who, who did you study with?  I mean, what were they (unclear).
Speaker 2: They were just called the Nigerian Traditional Dancers.
Speaker 1: They did all the different styles from Nigeria?
Speaker 2: Right.  So we just was studying that.  And that was just a two-week trip though.
Speaker 1: (unclear)
Speaker 2: Mostly Yoruba (ph.) (unclear) though 'cause here again, that's when I found out how much separatism was going on over there in Nigeria, so, we was really with the Yorubas mostly because that's where Lagos is, is Yoruba.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you mostly studied--
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  Yoruba culture and, because you got your orishas et cetera.  Uh hum.  And then after '71 [1971], '77 [1977]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cause when I went back with Festac ['77, Lagos, Nigeria].
Story_ID: 128339
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you came back in '70 [1970], from the trip in '71 [1971], did you feel like you had grown another leap or something?
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  We really felt that, you know, we were moving on up and I was really into like a double company.  I had my advanced group and my beginner group and that was when I had my same beginner group, I mean my same advanced group, the ones that first started out with me in my basement.  They, you know, they were still with me and then we went to the Urban Progress Center and they was still with me, but by that time we were getting another group because everybody wanted to do African dancing, so I was getting a whole 'nother, just a flux of students by that time and after, especially after we had gone, after I had taken them dancers to Nigeria, you know, everybody thought I probably would be making some more trips, I know that's what they probably thought.  Making some trips, they'd be on the next one, you know.  And so we got a, I was still teaching at Englewood Urban Progress Center so we got another flux, and at that time, [HM] Joan Gray was the receptionist and operator at the Englewood Urban Progress Center, and that's where I met her there, at the Englewood Urban Progress Center.  And started taking classes and then Isatu [ph.] also of Muntu [Dance Teatre] started to taking classes.  And about that time also [Babu] Atiba Walker had asked Alyo [Tolbert] would he be the artistic director of the Muntu dancers.  That was coming to pass.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Muntu dances started, were started by somebody else other than Alyo?
Speaker 2: Right.  Really.  It really is Atiba.  He just plays background but it's really Atiba.  It's really Atiba.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Alyo came to me and said this dance group wants me to be the artistic director, what do you think, 'cause he was my solo dancer?  I said, he said they have seen me dancing at the Afro-Arts Theater and they want to start a troupe of their own and they're working out of Washington Park on 55th and King Drive [Chicago, Illinois].  I told him I thought it was great, I said, that's what we supposed to be about.  I said is passing it on, you know, and he started teaching classes over there at Washington Park with this group that they were getting ready to form called Muntu.
Speaker 1: Muntu really took, took off too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because all the drummers were coming over there to Washington Park.  Here we go again, this flux.  There's no more Afro-Arts Theater.  They done closed, see, so, and we're just performing out.
Story_ID: 128340
Speaker 1: And about that time, I done decided to go into some other things.  I'm experimenting again.  I'm going into 'Purlie.'  You know, 'Purlie' was here in Chicago [Illinois] and I decided to audition for 'Purlie.'
Speaker 2: This is a play, I mean a musical based on Purlie Victorious--
Speaker 1: And right, by [HM] Ossie Davis.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ossie Davis.
Speaker 1: Uh hum.  So I decided to go into that.
Speaker 2: So, did you, so you got in the show?
Speaker 1: I got into the show.  Right, I auditioned for it here in Chicago [Illinois] and it was the lead, one of the lead dancers and it was getting ready to leave Cleo Parker and she was the same height as me, same build as me.
Speaker 2: Isn't Cleo Parker becomes Cleo Parker Robinson down in--
Speaker 1: Uh uh.
Speaker 2: That was a different one?
Speaker 1: A different one, and a New York--
Speaker 2: From the one in Denver [Colorado].
Speaker 1: Right, from the one in Denver.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Uh hum.  Yeah.  And she was teaching classes at, downtown, and I started taking some dance classes from her really because every time somebody come to town, I'm jumping and taking classes trying to build my repertoire for my, my dance troupe.  And they told me, they said well, Cleo is getting ready to leave 'Purlie,' why don't you audition for it?  I didn't think nothing of it you know, yeah, I said oh well, I'll do it, you know, just--my mom pushed me and say yeah, you need to go on and do that.  So I said, oh well, I'll do it, you know, I'm still, really wasn't thinking it was going to come to pass 'cause I'm not no singer or nothing.  And you got to sing, dance, act, do the whole thing for a musical.  But, all the people that were mostly in the company, I looked up were, had been taking dance classes, you know, had been part of the classes that I had been taking downtown so I almost knew all of the cast.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you knew you could probably get in right?
Speaker 1: I, you know, I still didn't, you know, I'm not the type that really think that, you know, I'm just a great dancer, that's my point.  No, I didn't really think I could get in.  I'm not gone pretend.  I didn't think that.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  Got me thinking that you already knew (unclear).
Speaker 1: Right.  Because it was, everybody, been about a hundred of us trying to get these roles.  They had two roles, one tall girl and one little girl that was supposed to be her daughter.  So they had to have one short person and one tall person.  That's what I tried to tell my students again.  A lot of times it's not just your talent.  You fit the character they're looking for.  I'm not saying you don't have to have talent, but you fit the character.  Now if I hadn't been tall, that's my point, it wouldn't have worked.  It wouldn't of worked.  If I hadn't had had the same built as Cleo, it wouldn't of worked because I'm taking on her clothes too.  I'm taking her costumes on.  So those things were in my favor, and then they want you to be able to get along with the cast.  So, right, that came into my favor, but I'm still in front of all of my peers, I'm still in front of all of my peers, I got to show, 'cause they'll go out there and tell Chicago on me.  I'm known in Chicago.  Thank heavens.  I got there and sang, you know we had to sing.  I said oh dear.  So I sang one of my mother's [Cora Blackburn] songs that my mother sang to my daddy all the time.  You got such a fine brown frame.  And the piano player knew it.  I was so happy 'cause I was doing more acting and all this, you got such a fine brown frame, I wonder what could be your name.  So I'm acting, I'm not really singing, but all my peers, they were in the audience you know, sitting there waiting on their turn or had they turn and they clapped so that relieved, it was like a relief 'cause I wasn't worried about the dancing, I wasn't worry about the dancing part.  I was worried about that singing.  People got up there and singing happy birthday, Negro anthem, 'cause, you know, this is just open auditions so we didn't know nothing.  We definitely didn't know anything.  But when it came to the end, it was between me and another girl who could sing excellent, excellent.  She was just superb at her singing and her dancing was good too.  And we were, both of us went for a call back and I really think that I got it because she was a little shorter than me, a little thicker than me.  But she was very, very talented.  I'm sorry, I can't remember her name at this time, but it was, she was good.  She, you know, that's what I--I felt good that it got all the way down to the two of us, you know.
Story_ID: 128341
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so how long were you in 'Purlie'?
Speaker 2: For about a year.  It closed in New York [City].  It closed in New York.  I went all the way around the city, from city to city with them 'cause this was the touring company and then it closed in New York with Robert Guillaume was the last one that played Purlie.
Speaker 1: Who else played the role that you were in?
Speaker 2: [HM] Robert Guillaume was really the biggest star because Melba had left 'cause [HM] Melba Moore was really Lula Bell, but she had left and gone on too, and I think that was, after that Robert Guillaume, he went on too--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and started making it big.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you toured, did you like touring with the big show?
Speaker 2: I did because I had never did anything like that and that was the reason why I couldn't pass it up because it was like a dream come true, you know here about Broadway and touring and being in a musical so you want that chance and [HM] Earl Calloway has always been a good fan of mines.  Anything I do, he's always backed it up more or less because well I tried to back up the other artists also and he knew this and so he put a big thing in the paper, Blackburn going on the road with Purlie and so everybody was really happy for me, I mean my peers, you know.  All the dancers were really happy for me to go and it was really one of my highlights of just seeing how to do everything--
Story_ID: 128342
Speaker 1: So when I came back I was charged up, you know, I was ready.  I had all these ideas because once I, when it stopped at New York [City], I stayed there for a while, started taking classes at Clark Center and didn't even realize, of course, that I was taking 'em with famous teachers, James Truitte again at that time, one of Alvin Ailey's lead dancers.  He was teaching.  Thelma Hill, another past great historian dancer, you know.  I didn't even know.  These were people I was taking classes from, but at that time, you know, I wasn't conscious, I was just happy to just be taking some classes you know, so I was studying with both of them and they were again expressing that I should take ballet.  And, I just couldn't get into it.  Titos Sompa had just come there from the Congo, Congolese dancing, started taking classes with Titos.  He asked me to join his dance group.  I danced.  I joined the Tauntawan [ph.] was the name of the dance troupe.  There I was, I was back into my African roots again.  And you know, it's where my heart was and where I kept on excelling, you know, I took important technique that's where Alvin Ailey Company does, and I really enjoyed it and everything, you know, and probably would have stayed there with it because Truitte and Thelma Hill were just master teachers but when those drums hit, it was like a calling.
Story_ID: 128343
Speaker 1: (Unclear) is it, I know African dance is more popular now probably than it's ever been. I guess they had more troupes and had more people involved in African dancing.  In those days it wasn't that easy to get people involved in it.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  When I started with Urban Gateways and I went around in the schools with no shoes on, the kids was laughing, like ooh, she ain't got no shoes on.  And Afro, oh please, all of that was, I used to go on stage I had to take a deep breath.  I had to take a deep breath because here I was going home with my nappy head and no shoes on and I had, I mean, that made me a good dancer because I did flips, I stood on my head, I incorporated gymnastics in it.  And, I mean, I did some things I haven't seen, and that was like, ha, can you handle this.  I mean I would present it to the audience.  I was always like that.  Can you beat this, you know?  The floor is hot, step on up here.  I challenged 'em to come on up there with me.  So I kinda and I taught my dancers that you demand respect by being good, you know, because they were all, all the other modern dancers, they were looking at me as oh she hasn't had any training, you know, not no real training, she just haven't had any ballet.  And I'd go into an attitude which I didn't know was an attitude at that time.  I put my leg up and I keep moving around on one, you know, one leg just spinning around without stopping, and be doing hand work at the same time, and just hold it because I had taken yoga.  My concentration was superb.
Speaker 1: This is, were you the first dancer with Phil Cohran's [HM Philip Cohran's] ensemble?
Speaker 2: Uh hum, yes.
Speaker 1: So, so you basically set the tone for some of the dance, I mean for those who have seen Sun Ra and the sisters that danced with him, it's a lot of spinning, a lot of yoga inspired movement.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Had a lot of improvisation movement.
Speaker 2: Improvisation, right.  Right.
Speaker 1: It's made up like jazz on the spur of the moment.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: What you feel.
Speaker 2: Whatever you feel, and to have, I mean, the best you know and you had the best musicians and I worked with the Chicago Art Ensemble [Chicago, Illinois] I mean to have people like that Moye and Joseph Jarman and all of them to say, you know, we want you to perform my music.  I mean those, I mean you couldn't have gotten, to me any better than that.  They made me comfortable, so I didn't care about the dance world, that's my point, telling me that I had no real training because I was, I'm dancing with the people, the Chicago Art Ensemble?  Please.
Story_ID: 128344
Speaker 1: Well, we were talking about, well, before we get into 1977, you were talking about injuries off-camera, and how you had to fight through the injuries and stuff, dancing and doing so many different styles of dances at the same time with the kind of exuberance that you bring into, but how do you avoid being injured?
Speaker 2: Well, like I said, in those days I didn't, right, I was called a natural dancer, I was doing improv, like I said, I was doing improv with the Chicago Arts Ensemble and then with Phil Cohran [HM Philip Cohran].  I was dancing with Odell Brown and the Organizers, and I was able to do whatever I wanted to do and I, I didn't think about my movements now.  Now it's just a whole 'nother thing, and then the more I studied and when I went to New York [City] and studied with Horton Technique and studied with Thelma Hill and James Truitte, you know, I learned how to pull up things that--and people at that time didn't think, they thought if they took, and I think some of them still think that African dancers, if they take ballet it's going to take away from their sensitivity to their natural African awareness, but I don't agree with that at all.  I think you can, it's no difference than Joseph Jarman and all of them being able to play Bach, and being able to read music.  It's not gonna take away from you doing your avant-garde.  It's gonna enhance it even more that you are able even to know how to move your hands better, you know, just finger work.  Technique, I, I look at ballet as technique now.  And I tell all my dancers that, I tell in school all the time, they need some ballet training.  Do all this hip hop and you'll be able to do it better if you had a little ballet training.  'Cause it's just good technique.  It's good technique.
Speaker 1: On the, I guess, on the other hand would you think like African dance will help a ballet dancer?
Speaker 2: I think, when I taught at Columbia College [Chicago, Illinois], as I told 'em, you know, I think African dancing helps anyone do anything.  It just opens you up and a lot of my dancers that have studied under me have told 'me that, because you're learning the culture.  I mean you're just learning so many aspects besides just dance, you know.  Just be a better human being.
Story_ID: 128345
Speaker 1: Now tell us about 1977.  You made two trips to Nigeria in 1977?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My first trip was with [HM] Jeff Donaldson and I give him full support and just praise for what he was able to do because he just made like a dream come true.  I mean, you know, the enthusiasm that he had about that trip, made you really believe, I mean, made grassroots in people believe that, yeah, we going, we going.  We ain't got no money but we going.  And he would just keep calling us from Washington [D.C.].  I'm letting you know I'm still working on it, you are going, just get your passports.  I mean, you know, and because the young people didn't believe that.
Speaker 1: Give us some background.  What are we talking about and--
Speaker 2: We're talking about Festac ['77, Lagos, Nigeria] which was the Festival of the Arts in Nigeria and they had totally taken a Festac village and given sections. The Senegalese were over here, the Ghanaians were over here, and the African Americans were over here.  So everybody had their own little compound, and all the arts were coming together.  I mean, and again, all the arts, dance, music, visual arts, poetry, drama, just all over Nigeria, performances on all the arts, lectures, you know, all the great artists just talking about the arts.
Speaker 1: Now this is the second one.  I think there have only been two.
Speaker 2: Right, the first one was Algiers, and [HM] Katherine Dunham helped on that one.
Speaker 1: So it's three then.  I know about the one in--
Speaker 2: In Senegal?
Speaker 1: Dakar, in '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: Oh, the first one is Al.
Speaker 1: One in Algiers too?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: These African Arts Festival where people from all over the African world come to.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: And perform.
Speaker 2: Right.  And it just unbelievable when, you know, we were able to really go and to see all these artists coming together and to actually walk from one compound to the next compound, into another whole country.
Speaker 1: You got Brazil, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, everybody.
Speaker 2: Everybody.  I mean just unbelievable the arrangements that they had made of building all these apartments and having all these compounds for the peoples 'cause that was the main problem having some place for people to stay.
Speaker 1: I hear that the Nigerian government almost overdid it in terms of building.
Speaker 2: It did, especially the auditorium, their largest auditorium, because they built an auditorium and they had all these facilities and they didn't not had the technicians, not the Nigerian technicians, to work the equipment.  They didn't know how to work the lighting or the sound equipment, you know, so that created a problem, you know, created a problem when you were trying to perform 'cause one time, we finally got it together, but one time I was doing a presentation and Carl, like I said, Roy Lewis, I don't why I wanna call him Carl, Roy Lewis had done all these fabulous slides and it was called No Images and he was showing images of black women on the slide projector and the slide projector wasn't working right.  And at the same time he was trying to get--and then I had a band and we was trying to get music with the band correct, so that created a big problem of not being able to be in control of your sound equipment and all your audio.  All the audio and visual slides, but you know, they finally got it together but that was one of the problems of Festac.  Otherwise, like I said, wherever we performed, it was just great.
Story_ID: 128346
Speaker 1: I was there [Festac '77, Lagos, Nigeria] during the time Sun Ra was there.  So I actually sat in the audience and it was packed.  People were just packed in.  And then we all sitting down, I was way in the back at first, and then he started playing and then spinning, spinning one of his electric pianos around and the people thought it was voodoo and they ran out of that auditorium.  That's what I remember.  They ran.  I wondering why they running for?  What's wrong?  And the Nigerians told me, they think this is voodoo the way he's playing.  So we all, all the African Americans, we just went up front.
Speaker 2: Sun Ra could, I saw him appear in a public smoke once, he wasn't known to stay on the subject of public smoking, there he was in it--.
Speaker 1: Those kinds of effects, they consider all that voodoo see, in Nigeria.  But he did an excellent performance it's just that they didn't understand it, you know.  We did one performance where we did calypso and I had the ultra violet lights.  All you saw was the costumes, you know, and they just screamed.  They loved that.  They just screamed, 'cause we had on hot pink and lime and all you saw was this hot pink and lime, you know, all these black silhouettes of bodies, and, so we went over, we got a lot of coverage in the paper there, and got a standing ovation on Afro, one of our numbers called Afro that we do, because they said "Woman Splits in the Air".  And so when I, when they say woman splits in the air, I was thinking that maybe one of my dancers did a Chinese, she jumps up, does a Chinese in the air and comes down.  They were talking about myself because what I do is I roll over and I stand on my head, open my legs.  They call it splitting in the air, but from that all the coverage that we got, my point is that they asked me to come back in '77 [1977] and teach at, in Calabar, the University of Calabar, so that was when I came back and they wanted me to start a dance troupe like I had started in Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 128347
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  Now you're being invited to Nigeria to start an African dance troupe.
Speaker 2: Right.  That was real interesting.  So here again, I got to break my neck to show these people that I can dance again, cause they laughing, what you gone do, put us in tunics and some tights?  No, I'm not.  'Cause that was, you know, what they think of America.  You know, I walked in the university [University of Calabar in Calabar, Nigeria], that was the first thing they said, what you gonna do, you know 'cause my class is male and females.  I said no--they were theater students.  I said you're theater students, I'm a teach you movement for actors, that's all.  I said the only thing I'm a try to do is enhance what you already are doing.
Speaker 1: How did you like living in Nigeria?
Speaker 2: I loved it, I loved it.  It's just I wasn't making the money to survive like I wanted to so that was what made me want to come back and go to school, because  you can tell by the house that a person lived in how many degrees they have.  You knew if a man was a Ph.D. or M.S. or, you know, B.A.  Everything on the university was based on your credentials.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I said well then I need--I'm doing all this work, I'm teaching theater classes in the daytime, I'm working with the theater group that does the plays.  I'm choreographing for the plays in the evening, and I'm going out into the field, into the villages trying to choose, interviewing dances for a dance troupe.  I had three jobs and I'm not making no money for this.  And I'm trying to deal with it like [HM] Dr. [Margaret] Burroughs had told me, you're doing research.  I'm doing my research, I'm writing stuff down, you know, so you're learning a lot.  It was too much work.  So after my second year, I decided to come home.  I told her I was coming home to go back to school.
Speaker 1: So you were there for two years?
Speaker 2: I was there for two years.  I came back, they let me come back for a vacation.  They told me they still needed me.  But I wanted to come back.  I was ready to really come back.  So when I came back, Wole Soyinka was here doing 'Death and the King's Horseman.'
Speaker 1: At the Goodman Theatre [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: At the Goodman Theatre.  And I was asked to help him with the choreography.  So I helped him with the choreography and they moved on to New York.  I couldn't go.  I had to--I told them to make Kimosha Murphy dance captain and I went back to Nigeria, and I stayed on more year and set up everything, you know for the dance troupe 'cause I had started a dance troupe.
Speaker 1: So that makes a third year?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  But I was, when I came back I was coming back just to really get every, to make sure that everything would continue without me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was about 1980 you think?
Speaker 2: '80 [1980] was when I came back.  Uh hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 128348
Speaker 1: What did you do next?
Speaker 2: After I came back?  After I came back I still, I had all this material and I went back to teaching at Columbia College [in Chicago, Illinois] and I started teaching classes at Kennedy-King [College in Chicago, Illinois], and really ran into some superb dancers at Columbia College, really excellent dancers.  In fact, Monifa Diane Chandler, who was dancing with me at that time, she was taking classes at Columbia College.  Regina Tapes [ph.], she was taking classes at Columbia College.  Those are the ones that are still out here, and they were dancing with me and performing with me and I came in contact, I started teaching around the City and dance was the best.  Dancers just started coming to me because they wanted to see the material I had done.  And so, we were going pretty strong in the '80s [1980s].  My dance troupe was going pretty strong.  So it was another layer though, you know it was decades going by.  It was like the first group didn't know the second group and the second group didn't know the third group, because I'm just layering dance groups, you know.  That was really, really what was happening, getting more dancers and at that time I had got some male dancers, Alyo [Tolbert]--Muntu was going strong also.  So I had, I had gotten other dancers and those, the dancers that were dancing with me from Muntu [Dance Theatre] are dancing with me.  Alyo had, was going strong--
Speaker 1: Now what about [HM] Najwa?  We haven't mentioned her, but she's a--
Speaker 2: Well see when I met Najwa she was Arnell Pugh.  I met her when I went to Club DeLisa to see [HM] Julian Swain who I wanted to be Arnell when she was in the chorus line.
Speaker 1: Now she danced with fire or something?
Speaker 2: Right, I loved it.  I used to love, I wanted to do that.  I wanted to dance with fire, so she was really one of the ones that, you know, inspired me, you know, to want to do exotic dancing at that time.  But she was with Julian Swain when they went to Festac.  And after that she came back and formed, then she became Najwa.  Then she started her own dance company, after Festac.  So she started her own company around '77 [1977], somewhere around there, '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's something.  Chicago is fortunate to have so many quality dancing groups, I mean doing African dancing.  Muntu and Najwa, they all, (unclear) your group.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: Some of the, you know, you see enough performances you know the rhythms and the (unclear).
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  Well, in the past like I said, a lot of us were just always, it was all intermingled, like Julian Swain dancers, Najwa dancers, you see what I'm talking about.  They were the same way like Muntu and my dancers.  They were intermingled, you know, Uche [Omoniyi], Oliver, Gordon, all of them that were with Muntu danced with me.  Atiba [Walker] was one of my main drummers, you know Ali [ph.], their lead now, Clifton.  Clifton was with me and he was with the West Indy Dance Company [West Indian Dance Theater Company], so--
Speaker 1: (unclear)
Speaker 2: So all of us have always intermingled because everybody's just trying to survive in they artwork so they all intermingled a lot, you know and performed with each other.  It wasn't like oh, if you with the West Indies Dance Company you can't perform over here, you know.  Horace has worked many performances with me and doing the limbo you know, so it's a little bit different in Chicago.
Story_ID: 128349
Speaker 1: Okay so, you did a lot of performances in Chicago [Illinois] in the '80s [1980s] and teaching--
Speaker 2: Urban Gateways.  Uh hum.
Speaker 1: So did you start like cutting back on performing yourself?
Speaker 2: I did, because that's really what happened.  My dance troupe was getting large and I was trying to choreograph, and I had a child by then, had one little girl at that time, and it was too much, it was too much and I didn't feel that I was devoting the time and effort to the dance part like I was when I was performing with Phil Cohran [HM Philip Cohran] heavy, you know.  I wasn't able to devote that kind of time to it, so I stopped dancing and just started working on doing choreography.  So after that, after I did Death and King Horseman at the University of Chicago at the Court Theater, we did Lion and the Jewel and that was Wole Soyinka's piece too, and I was able to, the director was so nice, I could not believe this myself.  I brought my whole company in to perform, and drummers and musicians.  My drummers, everybody.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw that show.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  I was able to bring everybody in and then hire other people. I hired Kimosha Murphy and I hired, oh that's a shame I can't, Nigeria, cause I made her my dance captain.  So I was able to bring in a lot of people that already knew how to do African dancing which made it easier than trying to teach someone to do African dancing.  You know actors or actresses, it would a took, it takes more time, like when I did it at Death and the King's Horsemen, that was, three-fourths of them were really actresses and actors, they weren't dancers.
Speaker 1: So you had to teach them from scratch?
Speaker 2: Right, and just like I said, that's like when I took my troupe to Africa, you know, it's easy if people learn it on the spot so all these people had either been to Africa or they had taken African dance classes from Africans, you know, they had learned from the Senegalese dancers, et cetera, so Kimosha and Nigeria at that time were with Muntu, but it was easy for 'em to catch on to my material.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What are you, you teach now and you still have a performance company (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  I stopped the performance, like I said, I think artists, I call 'em grassroots artists, grassroots artists really, really, really need management, you know.  I could have went the same route probably that Muntu went because I had a lot of people that wanted to help me, you know, wanted to be my own advisory board and all of that and all of that, but I would have preferred to have had a manager and someone to promote me to do what I wanted to do the way I wanted to do it, and not feel that, I wasn't into wanting to do it from a grant standpoint because I really feel that grants a lot of times hinder you from doing what you want to do.  You may not, you don't want to offend nobody, you don't want to do this because it might mess up, you may not get the money.  I didn't never want that because I liked mixtures, I liked the artistic level of doing it whatever way I wanted to do it.  You know I took an African piece and it was Mama Dailey and Moye did the music, composed the music for me.  It wasn't traditional, traditional.  It was African American.  It was in an African frame of mind because I used Congolese dance movements which was inspired by Africa, but the story was about my great grandmother, you know.  The whole story was around my great grandmother, it wasn't, and to me it's traditional because it's, you know, it's still, my African roots is there, but it did, it was an outlet for me to express myself and that's what I like about arts, is that I think it should be a means of expressing yourself whatever way.  I mean, I like Kendricks, Hendrix, Jimi Hendrix, always saying shoot, I'm ready to change again.  I'm ready to go someplace else.  I'm ready to do something else.  I don't wanna get stuck in one area.
Story_ID: 128350
Speaker 1: Is that, is that like sort of your philosophy of dance and performance, to change and to--
Speaker 2: Right, to evolve.  A lot of things, places I could a went, I didn't go there because I didn't want to, not because I couldn't of, and that was why I did Purlie, to prove I could do this if I want to.  And I could have went on from Purlie into another musical, you know, I could, half of the people from Purlie went right into '[A] Raisin in the Sun,' cause you know everything's a clique, you know the next musical they, the next one musical they auditioned in New York for was Raisin in the Sun with Donald McHale, but I got caught up into Congolese, and I didn't wanna come out of that.  That's what I wanted to do, and I just thought about that and I remember when I was watching Jeni Le Gon talking about what was her most informational times and what did she like most about her life and I've influenced a lot of people and when those people come back and just, and that's what I liked about my sixtieth birthday party, you know, they came and they said to me, we appreciate what you have done and we want to give you this birthday party.  And to know that I've inspired, not people to just become dancers, I'm happy if they are, but just good people.  I mean [HM] Avis LaVelle, that's a good person, you know.  Monifa Diane Chandler, that's a good person.  [HM] Joan Gray, that's a good person, you know.  Joseph Holmes' dancers, Alyo Tolbert, you know, the people that I've inspired is more important to me, being of service.  I'd go back to that.  That's what I like and that's what I feel proud of as a dancer.  I feel I have been of service to my community.

Speaker 1: Is there anything you would do differently if you had it to do again?
Speaker 2: I would have took more classes.  I'm sorry that, you know, because all my mentors in dance, Lucille Ellis, said the same thing to me, you know, you have just so much natural talent.  You got all these long limbs, take some ballet, you know.  My grandchildren are taking ballet now.  They been taking ballet since they were three.  I wish I had started at three, you know, so you know if I could say it to somebody, then I wondered if it would have hindered me, you know, I wondering if that would have took away from my creativity of doing dancing the way I wanted to do it.  I wondered, you know, now I watch my grandchildren because now they're taking classes with Phil Cohran [HM Philip Cohnran].  They're taking music classes, and I'm watching them when he tells them to dance to see, are they gonna just let go or are they gonna be hindered by their training?
Speaker 1: Be on their toes in (unclear).
Speaker 2: Uh hum, uh hum.  And I'm not saying nothing, I'm just sitting there hoping, no, just do whatever you want to do, anything, it's alright, it's okay.  Whatever you wanna do.
Story_ID: 128352
Speaker 1: Okay.  We ask everybody this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, my main concern, like I said, is using, learning the importance of the arts and using it as a vehicle for discipline because our young people are really into the arts, they just don't have any discipline.  I have nothing against hip-hop.  Hip-hop is no different than the Last Poets, you know, the rappers.  There is not no difference, because they cursed then too, you know, but we don't have that element in it.  Hip hop versus the rappers, they don't have the mentors.  They didn't capture Tupac, they didn't say let that part go, this part of you is the good part, and this is the part we gonna push.  They just said he don't do nothing but gangster rap.  Well, that's not the truth.  You know, it's not the truth, and we should have embraced him to help him, and that's what I try to do with my students.  When I find somebody that can rap good and all they, and every other word is a curse word, I say oh, you can't be in the talent show, you just have to wait and come back again when you think you can rap without cursing.  But you don't just say, ugh, I mean we just, we just turning our youth, we're, we don't have, we don't have no balance happening here in the community at this time between the youth and I'm definitely hoping, like I said, that I'm not there, I try to stay in tune as much as possible with 'em.  I think that what they're doing, just needs to be cultivated.  They just R-A-W and it needs to be cultivated, but it's nothing wrong with raw sugar.
Story_ID: 128353
Speaker 1: You addressed this on some level, but what would you see at this juncture as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I'm working everyday on passing it on.  I have dancers calling me every day.  My young dancers and I feel good about that because now I'm not one of them that's out there just blowing off.  If they call me and they ask for my help, I stay open.  I do whatever I can to help them.  If they wanna come over, you know, I don't charge.  They want to use any of my choreography, fine.  I'm just passing it on, I'm not into, into making money off.  I'm not exploiting myself.
Story_ID: 128354
Speaker 1: How did your parents [Cora and Richard Blackburn] feel when your career really started taking off, when you started doing--
Speaker 2: You know the main thing that they always say, my father even says now, my mother's passed on, but my father will tell you in a minute, he had nothing to do with it.  That's his famous word and what somebody said to him he said, they said, and you know what, that was the best thing you could have done for her, is you let her go and do what she wanted to do.  You didn't stop her.
Story_ID: 128355
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is similar to legacy, but different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Someone who cared.  Cared about being of service to her people.

Speaker 2: This is Afro-Arts Theater.  This is performing at the Afro-Arts Theater.  And this is a dance of the talking drum, a flirtation dance and the drummer is flirting with me and I'm ignoring him.  And I cannot remember who that drummer name is.  Oh, that's so terrible, Drekloft [ph.].
Speaker 1: That's why he got ignored see.  You didn't know who he was and he playing his heart out.
Speaker 2: But I do know who this drummer is.  Because I wouldn't have even been up there on that stage if it hadn't been for [Master] Henry Gibson.  That's Master Henry in the background, and he's giving me moral support and I just, not just playing the drums because I'm playing the castanets and I just learned how to really play them.

Speaker 2: I had this Tribune too, I remember this one.
Speaker 1: Uh hum.  You was on the Tribune?  Alright.  And the Tribune took this picture, that's what's so great, caused I asked 'em, I said can I please use this picture, you know that's why I copied it off.  This was during Black History month, right, and they took all of these pictures in color.  They took a lot of pictures and this picture and everybody seemed to like to so much that I started using this for my promotion picture.  They allowed me to take it and use it.
Speaker 2: In 1987?
Speaker 1: 1987.  Uh hum.
Speaker 2: This is Nigeria.  The picture wasn't taken in Nigeria though, this was again, one of my modern dance pictures that was taken while I was living in New York [City] and The Drumbeat was a poetry and story book and they asked to use it.  And this is 1978 in Nigeria, West Africa.
Speaker 1: Ouleku, this is when I just came back with my dance troupe in 1971 from Nigeria.  That was my first trip to Nigeria, and this is so important because there wasn't the Artistic Heritage Ensemble anymore.  At the Afro-Arts Theater was The Pharoahs and so The Pharoahs played behind the dance troupe and we performed the material that I had brought back from Nigeria, and the Metropolitan Community Church is the one who sponsored it at the Dunbar High School.

Speaker 1: This is back at the Rhodes Theater in 1966.
Speaker 2: That's gone now too ain't it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh hum.
Speaker 2: And this is the [HM Philip] Phil Cohran and the Artistic Heritage Ensemble we I was their solo dancer.  This number is called Black Beauty so I'm doing my interpretation.  I cannot remember who the drummer was, but I know he was a Puerto Rican and there's Master Henry Gibson on drums, some congos.  And behind him with the glasses is [Louis] Satterfield.
Speaker 1: Oh, is it?  Okay, Earth, Wind and Fire.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  Satterfield went on-
Speaker 1: He played the bass didn't he or something like that?
Speaker 2: Satterfield was playing the bass with us and the trombone, but with Earth Wind and Fire, he's playing the trombone.

Speaker 1: We interviewed Kojo.
Speaker 2: Oh good.  I met him in Ghana.
Speaker 1: Right.  He lived there twelve years.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  And then at the bottom, this is with, something's missing, but this is the main core of those who put my birthday party together.  Eddie Howard [ph.] is teacher for some time now at Beasley [Elementary School].  She teaches dance at Beasley, and then that's one of my alumni, Calumet students, Jackie, and then, Tyema [ph.] who really--Tyema did so many things at the birthday party for me, set the pictures up and put up a lot of things for me.
