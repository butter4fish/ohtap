Speaker 2: Italian (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right, and do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My wife [Gloria Gooden] says brown, but I would say, oh boy, that's a good question because there's two or three, blue, brown and black.  They all could go into it but I'm trying to get outta that.  I'm trying to get into more lighter colors, maybe gray, I like gray.

Story_ID: 289282
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: And I'm gonna ask about your mother's side and your father's [George Gooden] side, but--
Speaker 2: Okay, I can give you as much as I know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll start with your mother; can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her name is Ruby Adell.  Now you gotta spell that.
Speaker 1: Adell?
Speaker 2: Adell.
Speaker 1: Adell, okay, A-D-E-L-E [sic.], is that close?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's close.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) All right.
Speaker 2: Satterwhite.
Speaker 1: S-A.
Speaker 2: Yah, you got me, I.
Speaker 1: T-T-E-R-W--is it White or?
Speaker 2: White?
Speaker 1: Or Waite, like W-A-I-T-E?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's just like White, Satterwhite.
Speaker 1: Just W-H-I-T-E?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, Satterwhite, okay and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Boy, she was born in Alabama, called Wedowee, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Edowa?
Speaker 2: Wedowee.
Speaker 1: Now, you know what the question is?
Speaker 2: Now I (laughter)--I got some pictures that you can probably get the name of it on.
Speaker 1: Wedowee, is it--wait a minute, W-E.
Speaker 2: W-E-something.
Speaker 1: W-E-D-A-W-A [sic.], like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, Alabama, all right, and what's it near, well, what's it near?  What's Wedowee close to?
Speaker 2: It's not too far from Birmingham [Alabama]; it's a small town a way outside of Birmingham, I would say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a good point to come from.
Speaker 1: Okay, and well, and what is her date of birth?
Speaker 2: That, to tell you the truth I really don't know.  I know she was born in 1900.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's about as far as I know because we never did sit down and talk that much about her younger days or my father's younger days.  I don't know why, it's just that we never had that conversation, like maybe she stayed too busy.
Speaker 1: Now are there any stories passed down about what your ancestors were doing on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Well they, out of your hometown, they have a family reunion there every year.
Speaker 1: Okay so they have a reunion in Dayton, Ohio?
Speaker 2: For the Satterwhite.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they also have one there for Gooden in Wedowee.
Speaker 1: Okay, now are there any stories about any of your ancestors, your grandmother, or your great-grandmother, or how far back can you trace the family?
Speaker 2: Well my cousin that lives in Decatur, Georgia wrote a book of my family thing, but my wife's [Gloria Gooden] cousin needed to use it to get information to start their own book, and it goes back quite some time.  My grandfather which I'm sure I met, and my grandmother I'm sure I met, but only recognition I know of it is when I was about four years old.  My mother and them took me down there for a visit and I--we stayed with her mother, and basically I know they probably took me by to see my father's mother [Barbara Roundtree] and father [Doc Gooden] but I can't remember all of that.  That was the only time I've ever been down there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so from what you know--were your people farmers going back into history or?
Speaker 2: My grandfather (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did they do?
Speaker 2: Was in [U.S. military] service, he was, he went to service and--
Speaker 1: That's, that would be like, your grandfather went into the service?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay so, I mean your mother's father on that side?
Speaker 2: My father's father.
Speaker 1: Well, let me stay with your mother's side here first.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But I never met my mother's father, never knew him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother's mother, I think her name was Annie, Annie Satterwhite, but that's basically all I know because she--they never took me down there anymore.
Speaker 1: Now what did they--did they farm or did they do something else?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah they had farms and they grew vegetables and stuff like that and houses that sat maybe (laughter) about three or four miles apart, that you know, you had to walk back and forth across there and that's basically--I knew that much about them and they all was and maybe in the same type of thing that they did, they didn't do anything else as far as I know, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, none of 'em worked on the railroad or anything like that, or?
Speaker 2: They probably, they moved, I know they branched out from there to all parts of the country, like they--to Dayton and they, they went to Atlanta [Georgia], and they went to Florida and of course I know I was wondering about--only people I know about my mother is her brothers that lived there, and the one of them was living in Pontiac, Michigan.  She had three or four brothers, I'm not sure all of the names, but I never knew that much about my mother's side, mostly things I knew about was on my father's side.
Story_ID: 289283
Speaker 1: Okay just a couple more questions about your mother [Ruby Satterwhite Gooden].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Did she talk about growing up in Wedowee [Alabama] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not to me.
Speaker 1: Wedowee?
Speaker 2: No, not to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She, she never said anything I guess maybe because I didn't question her, you know how some kids would do, they would sit down with their mom and they asked a lot of questions, but I guess I was too quiet but I didn't ask that many questions about how they came up.
Speaker 1: Okay, did she go to school in Wedowee, did she have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but what school it was, I don't know and how long she went I don't know.  I know my father [George Gooden], well (laughter), but I don't know how long she went.
Speaker 1: Well, did they meet in Wedowee?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay that's a small place I guess, I mean I think?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a small, little small town, as a matter-of-fact if you go too fast you'll go right through it, it's that small of a thing, and then, well back then it was no street lights and anything else like that so, it was just--it's almost like a farming community of maybe the Goodens and the Satterwhite just spreaded all around there.
Speaker 1: Now [HistoryMaker] Fred Cash was telling us earlier that your mother played the piano?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And she was a good musician.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she played piano and she played for our church and played and she sung.
Speaker 1: Now did she'd ever talk about how she learned how to play or who trained her to play and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, she said one, she used to play the steel guitar, and she said she saw somebody was playing it, and she liked it, and then she picked it up and started, you know started using this bar thing and started playing it.
Speaker 1: Oh, so she played the steel body guitar too?
Speaker 2: Yeah she did that.
Speaker 1: I know a lotta blues musicians--that's one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of the famous blues musicians in the old days played that steel guitar you know.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: I think Robert Johnson and people like that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know. So she played--did she play mostly church music, is that?
Speaker 2: Basically I'm not sure, 'cause I know they--of course they had their own growing up and when she was real young I know she used to dip snuff and you could tell that later on life because once you do that, your lip has a tendency to stick out a little bit, and you would hold your mouth in a way where you wouldn't let it come out and that's the way, that's the way you could tell, I could tell, and I know my sister said that she used to, she used to dip snuff before she became a Christian.
Speaker 1: Okay so before, you know now we assume nowadays most people, well I guess maybe not most people, but anyway a lot of people assume that you're, you're a Christian even though you may not of even declared it because, just because it's so predominant in the community, but you say it like it was a really definite, you know you become--when you're not a Christian you do certain things and then when you are you stop?
Speaker 2: Right, well, you if you don't stop then I don't feel that you are Christian.  You do things and if you say, "Well okay I'm gonna change my life and change my lifestyle," and that's what she was doing and she just stopped.  She stopped dipping the snuff and she'd become a devoted member of the church and that meant you turned your life around.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I never heard snuff associated with un-Christian behavior, but I guess I mean that's what, but what other things would disqualify you from being a true Christian, I mean that you would do, you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I guess you might say, committing adultery, nightclubs, drinking and this type of stuff, I feel that you're not a true Christian if you are gonna go say, "I'm a Christian, and I'm gonna live my life with Christ," and you go back and you start drinking beer or liquor or whatever and I don't think that would be, that wouldn't be considered right.
Speaker 1: Okay so what you're describing is a view that draws a harder line through who's a Christian and who isn't than a lot of people would--to do in everyday life today, I think in some--you know.
Speaker 2: Some, you know, but it, I'm gonna tell you sometime when you are gonna turn your life around and it takes time, and some things you can't get away from right away, but then you gradually move over to the side where you say I'll just stop period.  I'll just stop drinking, I'll stop smoking, I won't do none of this.  Then you can say what I'll, what I'll do I'll start going to church, I'll start getting involved in the Bible and church association and stuff like that, and being around other, other people that have changed their life that way, it kinda helps you to move onto that side of the, well maybe say that side of the fence.
Story_ID: 289284
Speaker 1: So your mother [Ruby Satterwhite Gooden] learned how--she was a musician (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and but, she never talked, you never found out how she learned how to play and who she studied with or?
Speaker 2: Oh no, she never said anything, but she played piano and she taught my sisters and she taught my brothers, two brothers, and all three sisters she taught how to play piano, and they all sung and I don't know about my brothers singing but they played well.
Speaker 1: Now did your mother's brothers and sisters play piano or sing?
Speaker 2: I don't know, that I don't know.  I know my aunt--no, she didn't play.  She had one sister, she didn't play at all.  She was a great lady.
Speaker 1: Okay, now so your mother and father [George Gooden] met in Wedowee [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Wedowee, they probably, probably went to school and probably knew each other from the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Well it's not a story about--they don't tell a story about how they met and?
Speaker 2: Um-hm (laughter) no.
Speaker 1: Or how they courted or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, no (laughter).
Speaker 1: No courtship stories?
Speaker 2: No, they never mentioned anything like that.  I don't know, I don't know whether it was like you didn't want the kids to know everything that they did, or back then you know they didn't--I don't know.  I can say only what I've asked at some time and they've mentioned it and I never did go into details of their courtship.
Speaker 1: In those days was it, would it be common for a child to ask his parents like how they met or how they started going together?
Speaker 2: No, they--most of that, during that time kids were just being kids.  You know you're out playing, and you come in and you go to bed and your mom washes you up and whatever when you were that small and you never came in and really asked a lot of questions about you know anything.  If anything they would probably mention it to you, but you know, I guess me being the youngest of the family they never did share anything like that with me.
Speaker 1: Now.
Speaker 2: Now whether they shared it with my sisters and brothers, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Now, how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: Well I had four brothers and I got three sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where do you fit--you're the youngest?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Story_ID: 289285
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: George Albert Gooden.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I know he was born in 1897.
Speaker 1: In Wedowee [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: In Wedowee.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what do you know about his ancestors, I mean his, you know how many generations back can you go with your father's?
Speaker 2: About three, but giving the names of the ones that far back--because they, everybody named kids after each other.  You might have five families with the same names like, Ruby, and Mae Ruby, and Anna Ruth and Mary Magdalene, and these types of names, they would all have these names and they would pass 'em down to you know, your kid, okay well I'll name my kid after my brother's kids and this type of situation.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the same names are in your family passed down on that side.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all down through there, and I know that when the first generation that I can go back to, our name wasn't spelled G-O-O-D-E-N, it was spelled G-O-O-D-W-I-N, Goodwin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't know whether that came from slavery days when you know, where slaves run away and instead of spelling their name the same way, people that come to look for 'em, they would spell their name a different way and they'd say, well, you're not the same guy I'm looking for.  So maybe that's why they changed it to D-E-N.  I know it didn't change until my grandfather [Doc Gooden], he, when he went in the [U.S. military] service he went in as Gooden, G-O-O-D-E-N, but there's three or four ways that you spell this name, it's I-N and it's W-I-N and then you got a Y in there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so some members of your family spell it with a Y?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay but they're all the same family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, which most of 'em I haven't met but I just read I the book that my cousin had wrote, and she had all of these names in there, that how would this name would change and--course the cousin that lives in outside of Atlanta [Georgia], his name is spelled W-I-N but he's my cousin (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's something.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It's kinda weird the way it was, 'cause I know I looked at a marriage certificate that was in that book of my father and my mother's [Ruby Satterwhite Gooden] getting married, and they had wrote down G-O-O-D-W-I-N, but back during that time you didn't do it yourself, so they write it the way it wanted, the way it sounds I guess.
Speaker 1: Right, that's, yeah I know, but it's not that uncommon that you know got--in my family own family there's Crowes with an E and Crows without it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: With just a W.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And we were interviewing Tony Burroughs [HistoryMaker Anthony "Tony" Preston Burroughs] of the African American Genealogical Society [Afro-American Genealogical and Historical Society of Chicago], and he said that Burroughs can be O-W, can be O-W-S or O-U-G-H-S or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But see they could be, maybe they could be connected.
Speaker 1: And it appears all that, all different kinds of ways in the records, you know depending on who's writing the record and so.
Speaker 2: Well that's, that's true.
Speaker 1: A lot of black families especially have that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as an issue you know 'cause they, you know way back when before people were reading and writing a lot you know other people wrote down your name.
Speaker 2: Yeah see, my father didn't write that well and he didn't read that well.  He had, now he had a hard life, because he had to stop school, he just went to the third grade, and but he raised eight kids, you know, and none of 'em went to jail, or none of 'em got in trouble of hurting or killing somebody or anything like that.
Story_ID: 289286
Speaker 1: Now what did he [Gooden's father, George Gooden] do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a steel worker, there was a steel-working place here called Southern Alloy, and he used to work there, he worked there for twenty-seven years.
Speaker 1: Now did he come to Chattanooga [Tennessee] to work for Southern Alloy?
Speaker 2: No he just came--he moved his family here because my mother's [Ruby Satterwhite Gooden] sister's husband moved here, and they were telling 'em about moving here would be better for him, better for his family, and so he moved his family here.
Speaker 1: Now is this steel, Southern Ally Steel is this the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Alloy.
Speaker 1: Alloy?  Okay, steel.  Now this isn't the company that was across the street from where you grew up right?  The foundry, that's not the foundry?
Speaker 2: No, this was over on the west side of Chattanooga.
Speaker 1: So yeah, it was an iron foundry across the street, what [HistoryMaker] Fred Cash was telling us.
Speaker 2: Right, that was a little small place over there (laughter), it ain't nothing like that.  It was--this was a bigger production company as far as, they were making things and it was burning up there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he worked for the steel company, but he came to--
Speaker 2: To Chattanooga to better himself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And was he and your mother married when he came to Chattanooga?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he knew he was coming here?
Speaker 2: He was coming in to get a job and just work.  Because I wasn't born then--my--I don't think three of us wasn't born then when they got here.
Speaker 1: So right around--would it be correct to say that right around the time of the [Great] Depression, around 1930?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That he moved here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause my sister [Mary Gooden Scott], my sister that's two years older than me, she was born in '32 [1932] and myself I was born in '34 [1934].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was right in that, during that time of the Depression.
Story_ID: 289287
Speaker 1: What were your parents' personalities like, your mother [Ruby Satterwhite Gooden] and your father [George Gooden], and then who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I guess I take a little after both, because my father was a demanding person.  He was a person that he wouldn't tell you to do something but once, and you'd do it, or you suffered the consequences, but I respected him because of--and later on, but first you was a little afraid, you know when you, basically when you were that small you're kinda afraid of, you're scared of him and you figure that he's gonna kill you, but as years went by then I got to know him a lot better, then I became to love him a lot more, because here's a man that had a third grade education but yet still could raise a family and take care of 'em, and make sure they didn't go hungry at all, and worked from sun up to sun down, you know, to make sure that that happened.  His personality was good that way and I know some of my sisters and brothers would quote it different because they didn't get a chance to really, really sit down and know him the way I did, because I was the last one to leave home, so I got a chance to be around him a lot more and I could see him laugh at times when all they saw was a frown, and so it just frightened them, and that's the part they would quote about him, that he was a hard man, he was a demanding man, but also he was a caring man.  That's the way I would put it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mother she was just the opposite from him.  She was just a loving lady and she was, she didn't do much whooping or anything like that.  She, all she would quote is that, "I will tell your father," and that would cut out anything that you was gonna do, but she was a hard worker and my--there's a lot I could say about her because she just--here was my best friend.
Story_ID: 289288
Speaker 1: I was asking you about who you think you took after most, your mother [Ruby Satterwhite Gooden] or your father [George Gooden], and you were going to tell us a story about your mother, I think.  You said your mother was your best friend.
Speaker 2: Yeah she, I could--if I would be feeling bad sometime like we all do and I would go by her house and I'd sit and we'd sit and talk and just about anything, but when I left there, I, it--she didn't solve the problem but I felt a whole lot better when I left because she would say, "Well don't worry about it, things get better," and this is, that was her word too, "Just keep pushing and things will be better later on," and sure enough they would.
Speaker 1: Of course ironically that's the theme of a lot of The Impressions' songs.  A lot of The Impressions' songs, 'Keep on Pushing,' 'It's Alright,' you know, and I mean it's interesting you know.  So this has been educational (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you.
Speaker 1: But, okay, oh, tell me about, now tell me about--describe the neighborhood you grew up in, and what side of town is it on and who lives on that side of town and--
Speaker 2: I'm trying to see which side of town that is, I think it was, it had to be south, it was--maybe southeast around Chattanooga [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: It's called--
Speaker 2: Called Park City [Chattanooga, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Park City, okay.
Speaker 2: It's a little small community that consists of maybe, oh good Lord, I guess maybe about fifteen, twenty blocks, a circle and other different streets that's running back and forth, but--
Speaker 1: Was it mostly a black neighborhood or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just all black neighborhood, except maybe just past where [HistoryMaker] Fred [Cash] and myself lived on Calhoun Avenue, maybe about four houses down, then it started to turn to white, the neighborhood, and as you go on down that street it got nothing but white down through that end.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're almost just on the borderline?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Where the neighborhood changed?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right, and you lived at--as Fred said, you lived across the street from a foundry, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter) I don't what that was called, I think it was Ziegler [ph.], I think that was the name of that foundry what--it's right on the corner, on the corner of 28th [Street] and Calhoun, and I know we used to go and stand by the gate and watch the trucks and stuff go in, and then we would go down on 28th Street, and we'd go up and watch the guys do the molding, they would call it.  They was making different pieces of parts to stoves, and things like grates and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: So they made manhole covers I think?
Speaker 2: Yeah made that, and but mostly things for heaters, you know, that little thing that sets in there where you set your wood and stuff on and stuff.  They made those in there.
Speaker 1: Okay those grates and--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they made those; they made the handles to the stoves and the legs.  Each guy in there was molding different things, but it was very hot, but not quite as hot as the place my father worked.
Speaker 1: In that steel mill right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 289289
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights, and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You smelled a lot of apples and a lot of peaches, a lot of grapes and cooking.  You smelled--you could smell people cooking whatever they cooked you could smell it all around the whole neighborhood almost.  'Cause I use to come home from school and my father [George Gooden] (laughter) used to like chitlins and I could get maybe about four blocks from where I lived and I could smell 'em and I knew what he was cooking and oh boy, worst smelling stuff in the world.
Speaker 1: I agree with you (laughter), but people like, you know, that's real popular then.
Speaker 2: Oh man (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Even people--
Speaker 2: You got that in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.
Speaker 2: But to tell you the truth, most of the people in Chicago are from down south, you know, Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee.  This is where most of Chicago people come from.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And most of 'em would migrate back down there, 'cause I know, well of course I lived here in Chattanooga [Tennessee] and then moved to Chicago in '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: Okay now growing up though, were any other sights and sounds and smells in the neighborhood?  What about sounds, you didn't mention any sounds?
Speaker 2: Music, you'd hear the--there's a little cafe used to be down on the corner and they had loudspeakers on the outside so they would, they'd blast this music and you could hear it all across the neighborhood, and the other end you might hear some spiritual music coming out of a little grocery store that one of our church members owned, which was on another corner down there, but basically that's all you heard.  You heard kids laughing, and talking and maybe sitting on the corner singing, just, just singing a capella.  This is where you start, you know.
Speaker 1: Was that done a lot in those days, kids just singing for their own amusement?
Speaker 2: Yeah, doing different thing, I know a lot of 'em.  A lot of--we played baseball or softball and that's basically what I was most interested in then other than singing.  Singing was just--I don't know, it was just something I never thought about that much at all.  I only sung in churches when I had to, that's when my parents made me sing in church and that made me dislike it because you know, you hate for something--you dislike for somebody to make you do something that you just really don't want to do at that time, and it just you know, every time you see 'em coming you'd say well, "Oh, here they come, they wanna make sing," and you'd say, "Well I don't wanna sing," and so I would go outside, and of course my father would come and get me and of course I had to sing, and but after that then I'd go back to doing what I was doing before which was, well, playing ball or just running the neighborhood.

Speaker 1: Were your parents [Ruby Satterwhite Gooden and George Gooden] associated with a particular church?
Speaker 2: Triumph Church, Triumph [the] Church and Kingdom of God in Christ [Chattanooga, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay, Triumph Church, is there a story behind that name?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, and I'm sure it is and I never knew the total meaning of it.  I know they have a--it's an organization church where they have churches in Detroit [Michigan], they have churches in, probably in Dayton [Ohio].  They got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The Church of God in Christ?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, it's called Triumph, and I guess as far as the Triumph is concerned it guess it is to overcome, you know, and it came from Epanopia [sic.], what do you call it?
Speaker 1: Ethiopia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, trying to pronounce that ugh, trying (laughter) to pronounce that name, but that's where the guy that started the church.  His name was [Elias Dempsey] Smith, I can't remember his first name but he started the church, and then it branched from there to all parts of the United States and not a great big church, but a little small corner-like grocery store, storefront churches and things like that, and then it started to grow into an organization.  I was--I went there until I got old enough that I didn't have to go, then I wouldn't go.
Speaker 1: About how old was that?
Speaker 2: About sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you didn't really like it that much?
Speaker 2: Well, you--I won't say that I didn't like it, I would say that if somebody is keeping you in church from morning 'til night when you're a kid, when you're that small, you have no time to play, and on the weekend you're there every day, you're there all day up until maybe midnight that night.  You're there, you go to church at eight o'clock in the morning, you're there, and then you're there until that night, and that's a lot for a kid.  So you wait until you get old enough that you didn't have to go, and it wasn't that you didn't like the church, it's just that you had been made to go and you were staying too long, you know, and I guess that after I got about sixteen I joined the [U.S. military] service and I didn't go back.
Speaker 1: Okay, now your mother played the piano for the church right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did your father have a special role in the church?
Speaker 2: Yeah he was a minister.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: He was an assistant minister of the church, yeah.  They--in that church you had about four or five different preachers there other than--they called them shepherd, and you know, you call them pastor of churches, they have a different name for it.  They call it shepherd of the church, and he was like under this one minister and there was about three or four other ministers that was under there, under this minister that was belonged to the church that I went to most of the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I've heard that you all formed a singing group within the church, right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about that?  How old were you when that happened?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well that was after I got out of the service.
Speaker 1: No, no I'm talking about as a little kid.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: No, no group as a kid?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Now [HistoryMaker] Fred Cash said that you all had a group as kids called the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well you would call it kid, but I, we was in our teens then.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay so, wait a minute now let me get, go back a bit.
Speaker 2: No we was in our--we was teenagers then.
Speaker 1: The Southland Jubilees [Southland Jubilee Singers]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we was kids then, we was teenagers then.
Speaker 1: You were teenagers then?  Oh, okay all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah now when it comes down to six, seven, eight, nine, ten, no, no (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you didn't sing, start singing that early?
Speaker 2: No, I well I sung some but I didn't do anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so that clarifies the other interview (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah it just, once we got in our teens we started to--when Fred said, when Fred said as kids, I think he meant teenagers too yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 289291
Speaker 1: When you were a kid then you weren't singing, you were really trying to play ball, and did you like school?
Speaker 2: Not too well (laughter), not too well because I had a talent, I could sketch good, I could draw very well and I'd find myself sitting in class sometime drawing all the comic scripts and I would just sit there and I would draw, draw.  I could draw Dick Tracy better than the guy that did it in the newspaper.
Speaker 1: Chester Gould, yeah.
Speaker 2: But these, you know, these type of things, that was one of my favorite things to do was draw, 'cause I could sketch anything during that time.
Speaker 1: Now did you imagine yourself becoming an artist when you got older?
Speaker 2: I--that's what I wanted to do and I think that was before I went to the [U.S. military] service.  They had this little thing they'd send in the paper on a book that said, "Sketch this and send it in."  I know you probably seen that.
Speaker 1: It's on the back of comic books and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, and I drew those things perfect.  I mean I took a little thing and measured it and everything and just sent it in and I never heard anything from them, and then we were sitting at home and this man came and he knocked on the door, and he came in and he asked my mother [Ruby Satterwhite Gooden] could he speak with me, and I guess she didn't know what this man wanted, thought I'd done something wrong, but he said, "He drew this thing here and I--we would like to have him to go to Minnesota to a school," and she said, "Well we can't afford it because we don't have the money for him to do that," and then he said, "Well would it be all right if he would, you know, learn, we would teach him at home," but of course they didn't have the money for it so that went by the board then.  I think right after that I started losing my interest in it because I knew I wasn't gonna go any farther with it, and it just, I had--that was three things I could do well and that was one and playing baseball and softball that was another, and singing I never thought I could do that well at all.
Speaker 1: Okay all right, so what was your personality like as a young person, I mean?
Speaker 2: My personality?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know?
Speaker 2: I guess I was quiet, kinda shy type people, 'cause I know the girls used to say I was a kinda shy, bashful type of kid, and there was girls that liked me but I wouldn't say anything to them because I was just too bashful to say anything to them, you know, and it never did--I know one girl in school she used to look at me all the time waiting on me to say something and I never would say anything and it passed, it just, it went by the board, but just shy kid, quiet.  And maybe get in a little trouble every now and then, but not to the extent of you know for somebody to say going to jail or fighting or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Okay so what kind of things would you get in trouble for if you got in trouble?
Speaker 2: Going swimming in a creek.  There was a creek that was down the street from where we lived, and every day they would tell us not to go down there and swim in this creek because there were snakes and you know (laughter) everything down in there, but we would go down there.  A bunch of guys, we'd go down and we'd skinny dip in the creek down there and this is what we did for leisure because there was only one place for blacks to go to swim and money was very scarce then as far as me--and none at all that much.  To go to this place you had to pay, it's very little, but that place was so packed with kids that you know you would jump off, if you jumped off the diving board you'd probably jump on somebody because that's how many black kids was in the pool, because that's the only place they could go.  It was called Lincoln Park [Chattanooga, Tennessee], and that was the only place for blacks to go.  We had the ball---two ball fields there, and you had a tennis court, and of course the swimming pool.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was it you know, you went--plus where I lived we had to walk almost across town to get there, you know, unless you had a bicycle, then you rode over there.
Story_ID: 289292
Speaker 1: Now did you listen to music on the radio a lot?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that's basically what I did mostly.  I used to listen to--there was a show that used to come on television called 'The Hit Parade' [sic.] and--
Speaker 1: 'Your Hit Parade.'
Speaker 2: And I used to, I used to listen to all the songs, and I would imitate all the singers, especially the male singers.  I would sing at night, I'd, you know I'd be laying in the bed and I'd just be singing.  Singing things that they sing, you know, and I know like my brothers and them didn't like that too much, because I was keeping them awake.
Speaker 1: So what kind of--what were some of the songs that you would sing in those days?
Speaker 2: Ugh, some things that Bing Crosby sung, and some that Perry Como and some of Nat [King] Cole, these are the, you know just--'Mona Lisa' and all of these, just all of the big songs by Tennessee Ernie Ford, what did--this coal miners thing that he'd done.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, 'Sixteen Tons'?
Speaker 2: I used to sing all of that stuff and I guess that maybe started me to sing a little bit, but not out in public at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you would just sing them for yourself.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I'd sing to entertain myself actually, that's--I was getting pretty good at it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I didn't--the style I had, it wasn't a style of my own, it was just--every time I hear, if I hear this man sing, I'd try to imitate him.  If I see this one I would do the same thing with that one, instead of finding a voice of my own, which was my own voice.
Story_ID: 289293
Speaker 1: When you were in school, did you have a favorite subject at all?
Speaker 2: English.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: English mostly.
Speaker 1: And did you have a favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ms. Dixon [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Only she was in junior high.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Grammar school I think it was, I think I fell in love with a teacher.  I think her name was Ms. Brown [ph.], but she was a beautiful lady, boy, boy (laughter) and I was a little bitty guy then, man I--if she asked me to turn flips that's what I would do.  She was something.
Speaker 1: Okay, all three of you all had the same grade school experience (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, by--basically yeah.
Speaker 1: With these pretty teachers you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: Now when I, when I went to junior high then Ms. Dixon was the lady that--she was an easygoing teacher that I drew--like I told you I drew, and she would have me do these type of things to sketch out things for the class that out of the books and she'd said, "Well would you draw this on the board for them?"  Or either, she'd put paper along the wall and ask me to draw different segments, then when she'd get ready to teach on this, then she would point to this section and say, "Now this is so and so."  That way she didn't have to worry about the book, and the kids didn't have to worry about looking in the book, they could look on the wall and see the pictures that was in the--that's still in the book.  You can take it home and look at it, but you know you didn't have to--you can look at it in school, you'd just sit there and look at the pictures on the wall that I have drawn for them to study by.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you play sports in high school?
Speaker 2: Just baseball and softball.
Speaker 1: Okay so now, oh, what was the name of your grade school, let's get the name of the schools down.
Speaker 2: You mean the elementary school?
Speaker 1: Yeah, where did you go to elementary?
Speaker 2: Park City School [Chattanooga, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Park City, okay, did you go there for the whole of?
Speaker 2: It went to the sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay to six.
Speaker 2: I went through the sixth grade there.
Speaker 1: And then where'd you go?
Speaker 2: I went to East 5th Street Junior High [School, Chattanooga, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay, East 5th.  And then where'd you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Howard High [School; The Howard School, Chattanooga, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay, Howard High School, okay, now when you were in high school did you get involved in like the social activities, clubs and all that sort of thing and did you run for office or--
Speaker 2: No, that never interested me at that time, 'cause I know right before I went back to Howard High School I went to the [U.S. military] service.  I went to the service when I was about sixteen.
Speaker 1: Oh so you just, you went right from high school to the service?
Speaker 2: I went from junior high.
Speaker 1: Junior high?
Speaker 2: To service, then I came back out of service and I went to high school on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just trying to finish it up.
Story_ID: 289294
Speaker 1: Why did you go to the [U.S. military] service when you were sixteen?
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter) this is a story that the guys in the group like to hear me talk about, is that my father [George Gooden] had a lot of chickens, and he had a hog and everybody had left home but me, so that meant everything that had to be done I had to do it.  I had to cut wood for the heater and stove and the cooking in the kitchen, then I had to chase chickens every day after I came home from school, trying to run them down from outside, back into the fence, then either when my father was off day, I was helping him fix the fence, picking grapes, digging a garden, going out finding food for the hog, so I told myself that as soon as I get of age that I could go and I could join the service.  I was gonna get away 'cause I was just getting tired of just doing it all by myself, and it was getting you know what I mean--you don't want to--you're not gonna, you're not gonna go against your parents and the only way to not have to say anything, get in a big argument or anything because I was getting up in age then, you know I was getting a bigger, bigger guy which I probably you know, I probably wouldn't try to fight him or anything, anything like that but I would probably dispute him at that time.  So I didn't want to do that so I said the best thing for me to do is get of age and go on and join the service.  That way I'm away from there and when I come out then I'm a man then, so I don't have to worry about doing those things anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay so when your sixteenth birthday came you--
Speaker 2: I went down (laughter) to the [U.S.] Army recruiting station and I took the test.  You have to make a seventy-nine.  I made a seventy-six, so, yes, that same way you're shaking your head, that the way that guy was shaking his head.  So I left there and I went over to the [U.S.] Navy.  I took the same test, seventy-nine, I made a seventy-six.  So I'm sitting there about crying because aw man, and this man, this guy came out.  He was there he had on an Army uniform and he was asking me, "What's wrong?"  And I told him, I said, "Well, I'm trying to get in the service, but you have to make a seventy-nine and I just make a seventy-six on all the tests."  And he said, "Well why don't you go into the [U.S. Army] Reserve?"  I said, "Reserves," I said, "I don't want to be in no Reserve.  I wanna be in the Army," and he said, "What you can do, you can ask when you join the Reserves, you can ask for active duty and they will give you a two years active duty."  So that's what I did, I went and joined the Reserve and asked for active duty, not knowing that there was a war going on, didn't think about it, didn't think about none of that at all.  So, I joined and I was supposed to report that next week.  I think I was there three days early and the guy told me, said I can't give you no uniform because you're too early, and this, I think it was a lieutenant or a guy came in.  He asked him what was wrong and he said, "Well, he's too early and I can't issue him no supplies and uniform and stuff because he don't supposed to be here.  He's supposed to be here two days from now," and the man--and he told him go on and give me some uniform because you don't find too many people who's gonna show up early.  They don't want to show up at all, half of 'em don't want to come to get in the service, but then I--after I got in I found out that (laughter) there was a Korean War going on and I'm right in the middle of it, didn't know it, but I was away from home, put it that way.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is 1950 I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so you joined, joined the Army in 1950 and so did they, did you, did they sent you to Korea eventually?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have enough time in, I went to Fort Jackson [Columbia] South Carolina for training and I had eighteen weeks of training.  So by the time I got out of there then I didn't have that much longer for active duty, so they sent me to Germany.  So I went to Germany, I was in Germany when I was, I guess early eighteen, just about eighteen, and I stayed there for the nine months that I could stay over there, and I was back out in '53 [1953].
Story_ID: 289295
Speaker 1: So you were out in '53 [1953] and you went back to high school [Howard High School; The Howard School, Chattanooga, Tennessee] to finish up?
Speaker 2: I went back to see if I could finish up, but couldn't do it so I dropped out.
Speaker 1: Did you feel funny coming back to high school in like it was like way past you, you know at that point or?
Speaker 2: No, because there was other, there was other students the same way that was coming back too.  They went to the service and came--you know they was going back there on their G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] and I got to the tenth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And just got tired of it and I just stopped.
Speaker 1: Now when you came back, what did you plan to do career wise?  Had you started doing any singing at that point or did you, did you?
Speaker 2: No, I went into the [U.S. military] service, I was a heavy truck driver over in Germany, and they gave me a certificate to apply for this tractor and trailer school in Tennessee but I never took it over there at all.  I never did, and I just started doing different jobs around the city, and my mother [Ruby Satterwhite Gooden] used to work at a hotel called the Patten Hotel [Hotel Patten] which was then one of the largest hotels here in Chattanooga [Tennessee], and she got me a job there, and I started working off and on there, and doing other different little things and then we would, me and [HistoryMaker] Fred [Cash] and a couple of other kids would sit around the corner and we would harmonize and sing, not thinking nothing was gonna come from it, we were just having fun.
Story_ID: 289296
Speaker 1: Coming back from the [U.S. military] service, you all form the Southland Jubilees [Southland Jubilee Singers] right?
Speaker 2: Right, then, well.
Speaker 1: Where'd you get the name?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well there was, there was a group, I think already named the Northern Jubilees [Northern Jubilee Singers], not in Chattanooga [Tennessee] but other places.  We were trying to get something that people didn't have, and then we were from the South, and so we decided the Southland Jubilees, and (laughter) we did a show at my father's [George Gooden] church [Triumph the Church and Kingdom of God in Christ, Chattanooga, Tennessee], and of course you know when you're doing spiritual, you prolong it, you wanna at least last an hour.  I guess we didn't make an hour, but we did pretty good, we did very good, and of course the people give you a little offering and stuff like that, and that was enough for us, we head from there, we go on to the movies someplace and the next day or two we would probably go back and sit down and rehearse some more, and try to better ourselves because there was no musician and we were singing like a capella and that, well you know that way a lot of groups used to sing, even on records they sung just a capella by patting their feet and popping their finger.
Speaker 1: Right, a lot of the doo wop groups would sing their own baseline.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: And it just--
Speaker 1: They do their own rhythm.
Speaker 2: Then we decided to do some pop songs, and we started singing some pop songs, but--
Speaker 1: Now were you writing your own material then?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or were you just copying somebody else, doing someone else's (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, we were doing records that we would hear just like different records come out and then we would sing those songs.  You know, I'd learn 'em or try to learn 'em, but what we found out a little bit later on is that there was about four or five other groups that was a hundred percent better than where we were, and they had some musician, you know they had a guitar player or something that was playing for 'em, and there was a band that, that played behind all of the local acts, a group called the Upsetters band, and I don't know why but they would learn every single song they sang themselves.  So that mean all of the other kids that had a group, you had nothing to sing because they sang all of these songs, and if you gonna go up there and try to sing this song, they already doing this in their show, and they was very popular in the black neighborhood that, that you could go down, 'cause there's a street called East Ninth Street, and you would go down there and you would find them at this club all the time and they would be there every week, every week, and they would have a guest group to come in and there was one group, I don't know whether Fred [HistoryMaker Fred Cash] probably told you the name of this group, but I can't remember the name of that group, but they was excellent, they was a well-put together group, had a good lead, had a good background vocals.
Speaker 1: Was that the Lamplighters?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah that's them, they was really, really good.
Speaker 1: Well what happened to them?
Speaker 2: They just split up, I don't know.  They, they just stopped and then the two guys that sung with us was talking about going to Chicago [Illinois] 'cause they had, he had, I think he had a sister lived in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Now these are the Brooks brothers [Arthur Brooks and Richard Brooks], right?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, they had a sister lived there and they said, "Well let's go to Chicago."  So he talked me into going and we were talking to Fred about going, but his mother [Lola Cunningham Cash] wouldn't let him go because he was too young.  So, we got in the car (laughter) didn't have that much money to get there, and this friend, these girls that we knew made us a great big box of sandwiches that we didn't have to stop to eat, we just ate out of the car, and we had almost run out of food when we got there and almost run outta money, and we stayed at his sister's house until we could find some jobs to work.
Story_ID: 289297
Speaker 1: And while we was doing that we was just harmonizing, with the three of us, and there was a guy across the street that he sung with a group, a local group [in Chicago, Illinois] and we was asking him did he know anybody, that we're trying to put two members with our group that couldn't come, and he said he knew a guy, said, "He works, he's a short order cook and he works at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association]," and he said, "but the only thing about him, he don't like to sing background, he likes to sing lead."  And we said, "Well, we could care less about that," so he took us down to the where he was, and that's where we met [HistoryMaker] Jerry Butler, and so Jerry never got off work until about, he got off I guess about twelve o'clock at night, and he would come over and we all would sit down and we would sing, and we would sing, we would rehearse until about three or four o'clock in the morning.  Then we'd do that every day, every day, every day, and we was getting pretty, pretty tight and Jerry said, "You know we need somebody to play and we don't have nobody to play," but he said, "I know a kid that sings with another group that I'm gonna bring by and he plays guitar, and maybe you know if we start--if we like, if he likes us then maybe he might join this group."  So he brought Curtis Mayfield by, he had this little old raggedy box, a little box about that big, an amplifier, and he had this guitar, it was an open-faced guitar and he had this little bar that he used to hook on the thing there so that he can get his keys right, and we started rehearsing and he did top tenor and it sounded great.  We sounded, we really started--so we rehearsed for about six months I guess.
Speaker 2: Now, let me ask you, I mean I think before you left town the group was called The Roosters, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was called The Roosters then.
Speaker 2: And Four Roosters and One Chick [sic. Four Roosters and a Chick], right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was this boy that came, he didn't come to Chicago [Illinois] with us.  His name was Emmanuel Thomas, and his sister [Catherine Thomas] used to sing lead for us, and then--
Speaker 2: She was the chick?
Speaker 1: Yep, she decided not to sing anymore, so now we got to find somebody else to sing some lead, and none of us sung lead, so we didn't know what we were gonna do then, anything like that, so that's when [HistoryMaker] Fred [Cash] couldn't come to Chicago, so we went to Chicago and when the guy said something about the guy liked to sing lead, that was fine with us 'cause I did a lot of the lead then, and so we started rehearsing with Jerry, and when he brought Curtis by then we all really started to gel, and we started singing some songs.  The first song that we started singing was Sam Cooke, 'You Send Me,' and I used to do lead on that, that particular song so we started to polishing it up every year, we'd polish, we'd polish, we'd polish, and the guy across the street said they're gonna have a contest at this high school next month. So we said, "Well maybe we'll come and sing there."
Speaker 2: Now is this the DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois], the DuSable, what they call the DuSable Follies [sic.] or something, or the DuSable--
Speaker 1: I think it was, yeah.
Speaker 2: It's fam--it's like a talent show at DuSable High School (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And they were, they have a contest but they had one microphone.
Speaker 2: The Hi-Jinks I think is, is that it, the DuSable Hi-Jinks?
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.  So they had one mic, and when we got there all of the other guys were singing.  This last group had just got up and sang; the boy that I told you that was that lived across the street, his group got up and sung, but after hearing all of 'em, we felt that we were better than them.  So to show you how groups were, they said the mic went out and that the mic wasn't working anymore, but see what they failed to understand that we was in a gym where the echo and the stuff, it sounded like a mic anyway.  All you had to do is sing and so we sung this 'You Send Me' and just tore the whole place up and after we finished we was all walking out and this guy came up to us and asked us about being our manager, and I'm saying, "Manager, manager of what?  We're just getting started here," and he said, "I'm not asking for no money until I can show you that I can do something for you," and this guy's name was [HistoryMaker] Eddie Thomas, and he asked what the name was that we had?  And we said, "We're called The Roosters," and he said, "The Roosters?"  And he laughed about it, and while Jerry and the other two guys was in writing a song, they was at a piano at this guy's sister's house and they would do, they would be there all day writing on this song.  They'd go note by note.

Speaker 1: And me, there was a semi-pro baseball team that was practicing about, I guess about four blocks over from where we was staying so I went over and I was standing watching 'em, and the guy that was over the team asked me said, "Are you interested in playing?"  And I said, "Yeah," and he said, "What position?"  I said, "Whatever, you know shortstop, third base, second base, it didn't make any difference," and he said, "You do all those plays?"  "Yeah, plus I can catch," and he put me at shortstop, and he liked what he saw because I had good hands, I had good hands.  I had a good arm, I was a darn good baseball player and so I started playing with them.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the team?
Speaker 1: I don't even know, I'm don't remember, I know it's--it was on the northwest side of Chicago [Illinois] that we used to play all the time, and so we was practicing one day and this man was standing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh so, were you living on the northwest side of Chicago?  I mean, up.
Speaker 1: I was living on Larrabee [Street], that's the northwest side, that's right near Cabrini-Green [Homes, Chicago, Illinois] and that area.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's northeast.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, more northeast.
Speaker 1: That's where, right in that area.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: On Larrabee, huh?  Laramie [Avenue] though is west, though, that's west though?
Speaker 1: You got Laramie and you got Larrabee.
Speaker 2: Okay, you are on Larrabee, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got two of 'em with very similar names.
Speaker 2: All right, okay.
Speaker 1: And we was on Larrabee.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so the guy was watching us, you know I just, you could see the guy standing there watching you, and I finished my practice and came back up and I was getting ready to take some batting practice and he came over and asked me, had I ever thought about playing professional baseball?  And I said, "Sure, every kid thinks about playing professional baseball," and he said, "Well, I do a lot of scouting for the [Chicago] Cubs."  And I said, "Cool," you know (laughter) but you could say that.  I could say that, anybody could say, he's doing this for this team, don't have to be doing it at all, they could just be, just pulling your leg, and I said, "That's good, great."  And he said, "You think you would like to try out for them?"  I said, "Fine, it don't bother me."  So I went and was still doing--and he said, "Well when it comes time for spring training I'm gonna come by and I'm gonna take you down and let you have a tryout."  That was cool, but after that I went back while those guys was rehearsing the song, and I started rehearsing with them, and it got better and better.
Story_ID: 289299
Speaker 1: Our manager [HistoryMaker Eddie Thomas] introduced us to this lady, and the lady said, "Well I'm gonna take you all down to Chess Records [Chicago, Illinois] to let you audition," which was on a Saturday, and most record companies round Chicago [Illinois] they--that's not a work day there.  That's just a day when they package their records, and you know, they be in there but they don't be taking auditions that much.  So we went down there, it was in the winter, and we were standing knocking on the--she was knocking on the door of Chess Records.
Speaker 2: It was snowing I heard too, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was a lot of snow.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was snow, snow up to your knees almost, and this was guy was sitting in there and he was sitting there just like I'm sitting right now, and he was just looking at us and we would knock and he didn't move at all.  He just sat there and looked at us, just watched us, and it irritated her and she said, "Come on, we're gonna go across the street," and I didn't know what was across the street, but across the street was another small company called Vee-Jay Records [Chicago, Illinois].  So we went across the street and we went in and this guy was sitting at the desk and she told him that we was--I want you to hear my group.
Speaker 2: Now what was the woman's name?
Speaker 1: Vi Muszynski.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And she said--the guy that was sitting at the desk his name was Calvin Carter, and he said, "Okay, well go ahead," you know, so Curtis [Mayfield] set the little amplifier down and hooked up a guitar and we sung all of our songs, and he said, "The group sounds good," he said, "but is there another song that just--you feel like that just knocks you out?"  Well this song we hadn't finished, and we said, "Yeah, we got a song but we haven't really finished it totally," you know.  And he said, "Well sing that one for me," and the song was 'For Your Precious Love,' and we--as soon as we started singing this song, this guy jumped up, his eyes got about this big and we didn't know what to think you know, here this guy's getting ready to run us outta here, but he said, "Hold it, hold it, hold it, don't--just stop right there for a minute, just stop," and he said, "wait, wait 'til I come back."  So he went upstairs and he got the president of the company and he came down, he said, "Now y'all sing that song again," and we did, and man they signed us right then, and April, I think April the 26th we had our first recording session.
Speaker 2: April 26, nineteen fifty--
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-eight [1958]?
Speaker 2: Eight--now this is, so this is the first--that day was the first time you tried to take your work to a recording studio, and the one you went to wouldn't let you in the door.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, Chess Records, and they got mad at her after the records were released, and she told 'em said, "Well I brought 'em to you in the beginning, and you sat there, you had somebody sitting at the door there would not open the door for us."
Speaker 2: Now who, what was the story there that the person?  Did you ever find out what was going on that the man wouldn't open the door for you?
Speaker 1: He just, you know, he didn't want to hear anything I guess.
Speaker 2: Was he one of the owners or was he somebody just worked there?
Speaker 1: Um, yeah.
Speaker 2: Was it Phil Chess or?
Speaker 1: One of 'em, I don't know which one it was.
Speaker 2: One of the Chess brothers, okay.
Speaker 1: But there was one of 'em sitting there but he said, yeah he saw us out there, he said, but he just--I guess maybe he wasn't in the mood to hear no singing or anything or audition or anything.
Speaker 2: Making too much money.
Speaker 1: Yeah I guess, you know with Muddy Waters and the rest of those guys.
Story_ID: 289300
Speaker 1: Just before we recorded it ['For Your Precious Love'], we went back after signing the contract and stuff and our manager [HistoryMaker Eddie Thomas] said, "Well we gonna have to change this name, because this name is just not gonna go right with this song."  So we said okay, so what we did, everybody wrote down a name and put it in the hat.  And they shook it up and I reached in and pulled this name out, and I pulled it out and it says Impressions.  I said, "Impressions?"  And that's the name that our manager put in there and I pulled that name out and (laughter) to this day we're still trying to live up to that name, you know we're trying to keep.
Speaker 2: Trying to make a good impression (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, on everybody, and that's I guess that's what he said, that will give you something to shoot for.  Said now you got something to shoot for, a goal to shoot for, because to have a name like that then you definitely have to start trying to live up to that name, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So The Roosters kinda fit in the idea of the Orioles.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, all that other stuff.
Speaker 2: All the other bird kind of names, right?
Speaker 1: Right, and that's why, that's why we had that, you know, 'cause we couldn't say no bird name because all them was gone, you know (laughter) so we said, The Roosters, and you know, it didn't make much sense to tell you the truth.
Speaker 2: Okay, 'cause it made you sound kinda country too, I guess too in a way.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well we were from the South so, you know I guess they say roosters and you got roosters in the South you know, I guess, and other places you got, let's see, there was robins, there was all of us but all these names was already taken.
Story_ID: 289301
Speaker 1: All right, so you become The Impressions?
Speaker 2: Impressions.
Speaker 1: And, but I heard and I read that there's some mix-up in the labeling of the record that came out three different labels or something?
Speaker 2: Well first it came out, the big 78, and I think the president of the company [Vee-Jay Records, Chicago, Illinois], he liked Jerry's [HistoryMaker Jerry Butler] voice as a lead singer and he was, they was good at separating acts, of taking the lead singer away from the group and putting him out on their own, and letting the group go this way and they have two acts in one.  So what he did on their own, they put up there Jerry Butler and The Impressions which caused quite a stir, because you know we had worked so hard to get where we were, and for somebody to stick a big name out front, and but being green as we were, he said, "Well this is gonna help sell the record," but it was not, it was--you know it helped sell the record, but it was helped selling him also, you know, and not the group, and so Jerry caught a lot of flak from it and I think he caught a little more flak than he should.  I don't know whether he knew what they was gonna do, or whether they talked to him about what they wanted to do, and I'm sure at some point I'm think they did talk to him about what they wanted to do or pulling him away from the group and just letting him go on his own.
Speaker 1: What was their anger you know directed against him by other members of the group?
Speaker 2: Yeah, especially the two brothers [Arthur Brooks and Richard Brooks], they, I mean they rode him every time, every time the name was broadcast on the radio and sometimes they wouldn't say The Impressions, they just said Jerry Butler, and maybe just--peed [ph.] them off, they was just mad and they would complain, they would complain to the company, they would complain to him, and he just got, well I think he put up with as much as he possibly could in my thought of it, 'cause I know there was a few times that it got so bad that they refused to go on stage.  Like we was doing a show in Atlanta [Georgia] at--I forgot the name of that club, but anyway, we was doing a show there and they refused to go on stage, so Jerry, Curtis [Mayfield] and myself we went on stage because we had the high and we had the low and we had the vocal, lead vocal.  So it maybe it wasn't full in the middle, but everybody loved the song and it sounded the same 'cause Curtis was doing the top tenor and I was doing the bass at that time, and Jerry was doing the lead and we got a standing ovation, just the three of us.  Now, we gotta do a second show, now they're ready to sing, now they're ready go to on stage with us now.  So we said, "No, we--hey you didn't want to go on then, ain't no use of going on now."  So we went back on did the show with the three of us.  So it kept up until we got right here in Chattanooga [Tennessee], and Jerry told Curtis and myself that "Chattanooga would be my last show," and he sat down with us and he said, "I can't take it no more," and we understood, and he asked Curtis, said, "Curtis are you gonna go with me?"  And I'm thinking, I said well I'm thinking Curtis gonna say yeah because they're, you know they're homies.  You know they're both from Chicago [Illinois] and they used to sing together and stuff, and it really threw me for a loop when Curtis said, "No I'm gonna stick with the fellas," and Jerry left.  So then I started, we started, while we was there here and Fred [HistoryMaker Fred Cash] was at the show that night, and he came by to watch the show, and we told him that we're gonna need another vocal, and we took him, and we took one of the other guys that had been with us to Chicago with us.  We wanted to see which one fit the best, but I knew that Fred was more versatile than the other boy, because the other boy just sung tenor and we had tenors already, we didn't need that.  We need somebody that's--when I'm singing lead would do the bass or do the baritone, and Fred could do all those three chords so we wind up with him, with Fred doing that.  Then I started to, we started rehearsing '[For Your] Precious Love,' 'Come Back My Love,' all of the tunes that Jerry did that I did.
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because I was gonna, I was supposed to do the lead on the record, but he wrote it, he wrote the song and the way he was singing it was great, he said you don't change in the middle of the stream with this guy singing this thing perfect, so let's go, let's go with what's happening now, but after that I started doing the lead on it.
Story_ID: 289302
Speaker 1: For instance, you all actually toured as Jerry Butler and The Impressions without a [HistoryMaker] Jerry Butler.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I wrote Jerry's name and (laughter), I remember we was in New Orleans [Louisiana], and that was the only place in think somebody knew me, and of course they knew I wasn't Jerry, and but the sound was the same and we did, he came in the club and our road manager saw him, and he was getting ready to say, "That ain't no, that ain't Jerry Butler," and he said he stopped him and he kinda cooled him down and he didn't say anything, and he sat and watched the show and he really enjoyed it because Jerry and my voice were very similar, same range, same baritone voice and everything was phrased basically the same.
Speaker 1: Now I'm just, you know, this a natural reaction to this, I wanna, can you sing a little bit of it so I can hear you sing.
Speaker 2: '[For Your] Precious Love'?
Speaker 1: In the Jerry Butler.
Speaker 2: (Singing) For your precious love means more to me than any love could ever be.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay all right so I can see it, I can see it, yeah.  So you sang baritone and bass right?
Speaker 2: Well I sung bass when Jerry was there and after he left I started singing lead.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then Curtis [Mayfield] started doing lead, and we decided to let him do most of the lead other than the things that Jerry had done with us.  When it came to those parts then I would do it, but then Curtis started writing more, he wrote 'Gypsy Woman' and some of the other stuff and he was doing lead, but the other two guys [Arthur Brooks and Richard Brooks] didn't like that too much because they wanted to go in another direction.  They wanted to go in things like the Elvis Presley stuff you know and all this, that's what they could hear, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, they wanted to do more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Those.
Speaker 1: Chuck Berry style, up tempo.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, you know that stuff, and they didn't want no cutie stuff, so they decided to quit, and, but what they didn't know is that while we toured with them, we also was learning songs for just the three of us, where I was doing baritone instead of bass and Fred [HistoryMaker Fred Cash] was doing tenor, and Curtis was switching back and forth, he would go--he would sell a lyric and revert back to the background which made it full.  It was, it's not easy to do, try to sing words and then revert back to what the background is doing too.
Speaker 1: Now we all know how difficult it is; most of us that sing while we're driving a car and in the shower, we try to sing all the parts ourselves (laughter), but he actually had to do it and be good at it right?
Speaker 2: Yeah he could do that, he could do that, Curtis could sing, he could sing a line, and what we would do, Fred and I would, we would harmonize around his lead voice which made it full.  He would only cut out when there was parts that he had to do without us, then we would continue with the harmony, only we would just go in a two-part harmony.
Story_ID: 289303
Speaker 1: We were talking about off-camera about how Curtis Mayfield tuned his guitar, and explain that to us?
Speaker 2: Well, he--you see you got black keys on the piano.  You got white keys on the piano.  He didn't tune to no white keys, just all black keys and it's called, well, guys would call it Vestapol, and there's no (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm not gon' ask you to spell that cause you probably--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No please!
Speaker 1: Vestapol, though, you're saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but the thing.
Speaker 1: Say it slowly though.
Speaker 2: Vestapol.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, 'cause there's a transcriber who's gotta try to figure this out, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, a musician can tell you, and that's the hardest thing to play in, and if you're playing guitar, standard guitar it's hard to play in that because it's tuned different, and I know there's a guitar player named Phil Upchurch out of Chicago [Illinois], and he used to pick his guitar up and try to fool around with it, and it'd sound like nothing, and Phil is an excellent guitar player, and, but he'd pick his own guitar up and, and play it, but it's some--it would skip octaves there on the black notes, and he was self-taught so he taught himself.
Speaker 1: Did he teach himself from a piano, or did he have a piano that he tuned it from, like, or how did it?
Speaker 2: No he'd just grab a guitar and go ahead and look at the--I guess he would point to one of the black notes and he would go do-do-do with the notes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's the way he played, and if you would hear him play, then most of things when he'd be playing, a lot of times he'd be--his fingers would be going up this way, you know he'd be playing up and where other guys would go down, you know, on different things that they would do, they would go down, and after you hear some of our records, there the chinks, chinks, chink is up, it's not down, none of 'em goes down, all of 'em goes up in all of our songs, 'It's Alright,' 'Gypsy Woman,' all of the songs that you hear the guitar playing is playing the chinks that goes up, 'cause I know we were rehearsing our band the other day here, and Willie [HistoryMaker Willie Kitchens] was telling him, don't go down on the chinks, go up on 'em, because they all go up, and that stayed with what Curtis was playing, and see was playing all this funny stuff that he plays in his guitar, with his guitar.  He, I don't know.  I've never heard anybody play that way.  The pretty notes, he could get almost a standing ovation just playing some chords, you know, that before we start singing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's, right the beginning of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, of songs.
Speaker 1: Of, that doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I been trying--
Speaker 1: That 'People Get Ready'--
Speaker 2: He played that, and the same thing with 'People Get Ready,' it, he had, and it just--he had a slur, it's almost like a slur in his playing 'cause I know when we did the first record, they had another guitar player playing the intro to '[For Your] Precious Love,' and the guy, the Inara [ph.] man sat there and he said, "No, no, that's not the way it should go, that's not it."  I'm not--something is missing, so they, this guy went over--oh, I don't know how many times, but he said, "No, that's not it, that's not the feel, that's not it," and I told him, I said the reason you're not getting the feel, because Curtis played the intro to that song, and he said, "Well Curtis didn't belong to the union."  So he told 'em, said, "Well, play the intro for me," and he counted it off and soon as Curtis started playing he said, "That's it, that's it right there, that's it."  Simple you know because nobody plays it that way.  There are guys right now that tries to play the intro to 'For Your Precious Love,' and it's still not the way he play it.  It just--he has, I don't know.  It's almost like you fall in love with the music when you hear him play.  That's the type of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he played a pretty sound on the guitar when he was (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know the, it's just--I don't know, it just becomes a part of you, you know, and you love the song, you love the music and everything.  You just get caught up in it.  He was a very talented young man.
Story_ID: 289304
Speaker 1: Was he born and raised in Chicago [Illinois]?  Was Curtis Mayfield?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was born and raised there.  He started.
Speaker 1: Roots in Mississippi or Arkansas or--
Speaker 2: No, Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerry Butler] was from Mississippi.  He was from--Jerry was born in Sunflower [Mississippi], but he, his family moved to Chicago when he was a baby and he was raised in Chicago, but actually Curtis was born in Chicago, and grew up listening to Muddy Waters and all these things, playing blues and stuff.  That's how he learned how to play guitar.  Somebody gave him a guitar and he started--and he taught his self how to play and then he started writing songs.  I know the--he wrote his--I think he said he wrote his first song when he was about thirteen.  He wrote 'Gypsy Woman,' but we didn't, it wasn't recorded until I think it's 1961.
Speaker 1: Now he wrote 'Gypsy Woman' when he was thirteen years old?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's something, that's--there's a story about that I wanna ask you about as we, as we keep going, but back to the chronology.  You were all were touring--you said you were touring the South.  You were in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Where you played your last Jerry Butler concert when you were Jerry Butler?
Speaker 2: Right (laughter) and I was--matter of fact, the guy came, took me by the radio station.  I went by the radio station and we talked and I signed autographs.  I've watched Jerry sign his name so I knew how to do that you know so--they always would look the same, but I just wondered if people have seen us they saw us--well, they saw us once on television.  That was on 'The Dick Clark Show,' that's when Jerry was there, but the shot was so far back that you couldn't tell who was who, you know.  So, (laughter) so when we started doing this--that was the only way we gonna get--we're getting shows then.  We were singing as Jerry Butler and The Impressions.
Speaker 1: 'Cause of that song being the top song (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, because of his name being out front.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know and it--the group didn't mean very much unless the lead singer was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so we had to pretend to have the lead singer.
Story_ID: 289305
Speaker 1: Now I've heard though that times got really tough after you couldn't do the Jerry Butler and [The] Impressions anymore, and I know Fred [HistoryMaker Fred Cash] was telling us that you all--for a while you were washing dishes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did some of everything, washed cars.  I--we was in Detroit, Michigan.  Now that was, that was about the hardest time of my life because I had nobody over there.  My--Fred had brothers and sisters that lived there.  Me, I didn't have anybody that lived there so I had to kinda knock about on my own, and so I would wash cars at a car wash.  I'm got--I don't know where the car wash was, but now I think about it, and I say well you know this, maybe this is what I was supposed to go through to get where I am now.  You know, so I didn't have one place to stay, at one time I didn't.  I would wash cars and at night down on Woodward Avenue which is in Detroit, they had all these overnight theaters where everybody'd go and they'd sit all night.
Speaker 1: The Fox [Theatre, Detroit, Michigan] and the--yeah?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you'd go down there and you can go and you can stay until that morning, the morning when it opens, closes; about four or five o'clock or maybe six o'clock in the morning.  Then that was time enough for me to come out, catch a bus back to the car wash, and I washed cars the rest of the day, and at night I would go back to the theater, and then I--that's where I would stay.  That was my house there.
Speaker 1: So the movies would go on and you were asleep?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was sitting there getting some rest, sleeping.  It was pretty hard, pretty rough.
Speaker 1: It does sound tough.
Speaker 2: And then my brother moved there and I started staying with him, and we decided to go to Chicago [Illinois] to visit Curtis [Mayfield] and our manager, which was [HistoryMaker] Eddie Thomas, and we found out that they was in town and we decided to drive over to, just say hello and then come on back.  So we drove over and we started--we rehearsed 'Gypsy Woman' with Curtis at his house and we put it on tape and we said, well, that evening we said, "Well, guess we better head on back to Detroit," and he said, "Why go back to Detroit?  Why don't you just stay here?"
Story_ID: 289306
Speaker 1: Well, we had nothing left over there [Detroit, Michigan], I had no place over there, my brother was there, but wasn't nothing holding me there so we stayed at his house, our manager's house (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was Fred [HistoryMaker Fred Cash] there at the time?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah, we both--we always, we stayed there and worked during the time while they were trying to look for somebody to record this record, and--
Speaker 2: Oh, they were trying to find somebody to record 'Gypsy Woman'?
Speaker 1: Yeah, recorders.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay so, so Curtis [Mayfield] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Curtis was working with Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerry Butler] then.
Speaker 2: Okay, so he just did it as he was trying to sell the song?
Speaker 1: And he was traveling, he was traveling with Jerry and had wrote a couple of big records for Jerry, of course, 'He'll Break Your Heart' ['He Will Break Your Heart'], him and Jerry wrote together on that song, and when we did 'Gypsy Woman' at his house, at our manager's house and they taped it, it sounded so great, you know, and the guy said, "Well hey, we're gonna get somebody to take this and let somebody hear it and we're gonna get it recorded."  So there was another artist, lady artist that we knew, Maxine Brown.  Her husband had a production company, so he--Ed [HistoryMaker Eddie Thomas] and them knew him because of them traveling around with Jerry.  So, he said, "Yeah, we're recorders." So we went to New York [New York] and he had about--I think we had about four hours for the session.  If we couldn't get it done in that time then, you know, you gonna run outta money.  So we got it done and they, he had already had some people interested in distributing it which was ABC-Paramount [Records], and he took it to them and they distributed it.  He said, "Now Eddie will push it," because right after that Eddie had started working for ABC-Paramount, he was working as a promotion man.
Speaker 2: Now ABC-Paramount, now this is what, this is what year is this?  This is?
Speaker 1: That had to be '60 [1960], '61 [1961].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Early '61 [1961].
Speaker 2: Okay, '61 [1961], okay, and now what--I didn't ask Mr. Cash about this but what kind of orchestration was in 'Gypsy Woman'?  I'm just trying to remember.
Speaker 1: Well that was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The song but what was--I know you all?
Speaker 1: Curtis, guitar, and of course bass, drums and this lady came in and played some castanets.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I heard, yeah, that's true.
Speaker 1: And that's what she did, she came in and played the castanets on it.
Speaker 2: And you all played like kind of classical (singing) aha, aha.  It sounded like a movie.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Score or something, you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, that is the way he wrote it.  He wrote it and he had the background the way he wanted it, the way he wanted the background to go, Curtis did.
Speaker 2: Now did you ever hear of the story--now he told this story on public radio after he was paralyzed.  He was talking to Terry Gross on National Public Radio [NPR] on 'Fresh Air,' I believe, he talked about how he went to--they performed in Paris [France].  He was performing in Paris, I don't know if it was with the group or just by himself.
Speaker 1: He never rehearsed, he never practiced, went overseas with the group.
Speaker 2: Okay so he was there by himself I guess, and he said all these gypsies were coming into the hall where he was supposed to be and the word got to him that the gypsies were there for him you know, and so he thought they were there to hurt him (laughter), but come to find out, you know, they were there because they were in love with the song.  They said nobody had ever written a positive song.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: About gypsies before and he was, and they gave him an award and a lot of--have you ever heard that story about that?
Speaker 1: No, but I know we didn't do the whole song on the record.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because there was a left out verse?
Speaker 2: Oh, what was the verse?
Speaker 1: Well the reason we did that is because during that time, disc jockeys had a certain length of time to play your record, and if you wanted them to redo it a little bit then your record had to be short.  It had to be maybe 2:15, 2:10, two something, 2:05, and if we'd have put the third verse in there it would have made it too long, so we just kept it at two verses, and it went out, went right out after the second verse, but the third verse was, I think was the best verse of the whole song.
Speaker 2: What was it, do you remember?
Speaker 1: "Before the night was gone and I was all alone, the charms of the gypsy woman and the caravan was gone; all were left was burning embers to a love that made my heart surrender to the gypsy woman," [sic.].  And I think that was, it was the closing part of the song but we never did do it.  Now Curtis would do it when he'd do live shows, and we do it now when we do live shows, we do the third verse, but that--to me that was a really touching, touching verse.
Speaker 2: It's interesting you know, gypsies being an oppressed minority in a lot of the world, you know and taking a liking to this song written by Curtis Mayfield, who had never met a gypsy I think before.
Speaker 1: And see the thing is, you sit and you thought a young kid at thirteen talking about burning embers (laughter), that's just (laughter)--'cause at one time you said, "What in the heck is burning embers?"
Story_ID: 289307
Speaker 1: What fueled his [Curtis Mayfield] creative energy?  'Cause he was, as you're describing, somebody that's sort of intellectual too on some level.  He's able to write poetry, and those lyrics are poetic (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well he, well Curtis wrote stuff that was past his time.  I mean things that's happening today, he was getting thoughts of things that, if you listened to the lyrics, all these things are happening now.  'Cause we [The Impressions] did a song called '[The] Young Mods' Forgotten Story.'  We did an album and the song was saying that, you know, bombs will fall out, and all this other stuff, and this is supposed to be in the streets, you know, not in war, but now if you look at it bombs are falling everywhere.  Look at the [World] Trade Center [New York, New York] and those other bombs over in London [England] and all this stuff.  It's happening today when this guy wrote about it years ago, you know, so (laughter) it's weird, 'cause I know one song that we were talking about doing, but the lyrics he had in it at that time were so, so hard that they wouldn't, nobody would've played it at all because of the words that he had in there, and we--he had, right in the studio.  He had to change the words, 'cause what we did, we went in the studio and we recorded it exactly the way he wrote it, but our producer [HistoryMaker] Johnny Pate said, "Man, you gonna have to change all of this, 'cause ain't nobody gonna play this at all because they--man, this is too hard, and too rough."
Speaker 1: Now times have changed now as we sit here in 2005.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he changed it then.
Speaker 1: No, no I said times have changed as we sit here in 2005, I don't think there's anything you can't put in a song.
Speaker 2: If you'd have heard what he wrote in there, (laughter) something about, "The black boy has dried his eyes, and is moving on up."
Speaker 1: Oh, in 'We're a Winner.'
Speaker 2: "They'd be no more, there'll be no more Uncle Tom. At last this blessed day has come and we're a winner."
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, those were lyrics in 'We're a Winner'?
Speaker 2: That was 'We're a Winner.'
Speaker 1: Yeah do that again, now wait a minute, wait a minute, now 'We're a Winner' was one of my favorites and the favorites of a lot of people in college in those days, when you heard that, you know, 'cause we were like starting black student organizations and people involved in the Civil Rights Movement and the Black Power movement, and what were those lyrics again?
Speaker 2: "They'll be no more Uncle Tom.  At last his blessed day has come, and we're a winner, and everybody knows it too, we just keep on pushing like your leaders tell you to."
Speaker 1: "They'll be no more Uncle Tom," (laughter) I'm trying to write it.
Speaker 2: Yeah and then in one of 'em it's--some part of it said, "The black boy done dried his eyes and he's movin' on up." and it was, it was (laughter).  It was out there, 'cause Johnny Pate said, "Hey man, this could be a smash record but not with these lyrics," so we sit down and he said, "I finally dried my eyes," not "the black boy," but "we have finally dried our eyes."
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: "And we're moving on up."
Story_ID: 289308
Speaker 1: Well I wondered, you know, in the early '70s [1970s] especially when you started hearing music from the white singers like Bob Dylan and others, you know, Country Joe and the Fish around the time of Woodstock [Festival; Woodstock Music & Art Fair], and it was so much made of the relevant lyrics in the music of--but you know it seemed like there was hardly any of that coming out of the black community, though people did point to The Impressions as a group that tried to write music that had social commentary, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah I know, and what bothered me about it was that I think James Brown--after we've done these songs, and I think James Brown came out with 'I'm Black and I'm Proud.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the president called him up there and gave him this big award by being the first person to stand out and speak out for the masses, and we're sitting there listening to this and I'm watching this and I said, now wait a minute, he wasn't the first one to do that.  Now we've sung four or five songs like that, you know, and 'cause 'Keep on Pushing.'
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: You know, that's where [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson got his Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] from, and Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] used to use that.  That was his song, they marched by that particular song, and I'm saying now, but that is one thing that I would say that The Impressions are not recognized as much as they should and the things that they have accomplished and the things that they've done, it just seems like it's being pushed to the side, you know it.
Speaker 1: But I think you'd be surprised at the people though that do like understand that contribution, even like Sam Cooke's record from way back, 'A Change is Gonna Come,' you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That was picked up by people involved in the [Civil Rights] Movement, and 'Keep on Pushing,' 'We're a Winner' and you know, all the other Impressions songs.
Speaker 2: 'Choice of Colors.'
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause the person, I had a guy that asked me (laughter), "What do you, what are you talking about, 'Choice of Colors'?"  I said, "Now if you sit down and you're sitting with your people or I'm sitting with mine, and you sit down and you said if you had a choice, it's not saying you've got a choice, it said if you had a choice which one would you choose?  Will you choose what you are, and stand up for what you are?"  That's all it means, you know you stand up for what you are, not saying that you don't dislike what this nation does or this--people do, you just, you stand up for who you are and then as far as black people, then they can say well this is what I choose.  Then if you choose that, then why don't you stand up and speak about it and stand up and be proud of it?  You know you got some people that will say things, and then when it comes time for them to stand up and be vocal with their thoughts and say, well, no I better not ruffle this guy's feathers over here.  You're not ruffling anybody's feathers, you're just only speaking what you feel and how you feel and where, how you stand about things and this is me.  I'm black and I'm proud and I'll stand up.  I don't care where it is between--in front of anybody and I'm not trying to be white, I'm not trying to be Jewish.  I'm not trying to be anything else.  I'm just trying to be who I am and that's all it's saying to all of the people.  If everybody stood up together, and pulled together we wouldn't have all this junk that's going on now, because of the thing is, you will respect you, and I'll respect you and you'll respect me.
Speaker 1: That seems to be what it's about when you boil it all down.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and that's, basically the song says that, you know.  "How long have you hated your white teacher?  Who told you, you loved your black preacher?  Do you respect your brother's woman friend, and share with black folks not akin."
Speaker 1: Yeah right, it's a powerful song.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and see the thing is there's black peoples all over the world that's not--just you know American black people.  There's African, there's all the other people that got that black color.  It's just a matter of listening to the lyrics.  Some people listen to certain parts of a song and they'll say, "Well, I don't like that song. They're militant," you know, "they are against this, they're against that."  No, they're not against anything, it's just being proud of who you are just like the other song 'I'm So Proud.'
Story_ID: 289309
Speaker 1: Right, now that's an interesting song because of the, it seems like there's always been a subtext in--even the love songs written by Curtis Mayfield and performed by The Impressions (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He--Yeah he, Curtis wrote about things that happened every day in nature or stuff that you see people do of life experience. You know he writes about these different type of things, and you got a lot of writers out there, but when it comes down to really talking about different little things in life, he writes--you don't write no better than he does.
Speaker 1: Well a lot of encouraging songs like you know, that song 'I'm So Proud.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean that's a song that I mean that really hits people in their heart.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know being proud of somebody that they're involved with or being proud of their people, and 'You Must Believe Me.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I know it's a song about a personal relationship between a man and a woman, but it's also you know, "No matter what the people might say, you must believe me," you know.  I just didn't happen that way, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, see that's, that's why I say this guy, he was a genius.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He was a genius when it comes to writing and he pours his heart out in his songs, and he used to bring some to us and he would ask us; he'd play 'em for us and if we didn't like 'em we'd tell him, you know.  Said, "Well no, don't like that," 'cause I know we had finished a show in Nashville [Tennessee] and we were sitting in the car in between shows and he wrote a song called '[The] Monkey Time' and of course we're singing the heck out of it in the car, oh having fun with it, and but I told him, I said, "Hey man, we, we're not dancers.  We don't know nothing about no Monkey Time, what is that?  That's a dance thing," and he said, "you think we should record it?"  I said, "No, (laughter) we, if you dance, if you're gonna sing this song you got to find some way to do something to work out with this song."
Speaker 1: Promote it yeah, it's the monkey (unclear).
Speaker 2: And he said, "Well Major [Lance]," he said, "Major been asking us to help him do something."  He said, "Maybe I'll give it to him."  I said, "Well that'll be good," and we went back to Chicago [Illinois] and Major Lance, we went in the studio with 'em and did the background behind it, and boom--big record, but he know how to, you know he was a dancer.  He was fast on his feet.
Speaker 1: All right now I heard that you all did the background on a lot of the songs of Curtis Mayfield?
Speaker 2: Too many I think (laughter).  I know the president of ABC-Paramount [Records], it was one song that Major did that you heard us more than you heard him, and I guess they did too, 'cause they called us into the office and said, no more, that's it.
Speaker 1: Is that um, um, um, um?
Speaker 2: He said no more, said no more, said, "This is an Impressions song because Major Lance you can hear him way in the back you know, but all of it is you all."  So we had to stop.
Speaker 1: Yeah it did have the distinctive voice of The Impressions.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did, we did [HistoryMaker] Jerry Butler, we did Gene Chandler.
Speaker 1: Okay, they were all for a different label, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 289310
Speaker 1: I was talking about a show I saw in Dayton [Ohio] in 1966 that included The Impressions with [HistoryMaker] Jerry Butler and Curtis Mayfield and of course you too, and Gladys Knight, and Major Lance throwing his jacket to the audience.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And having it thrown back at him and different--those are the you know--so you'd often go on these big tours like that with a whole lot of people or was that like a?
Speaker 2: We used to all the time, we used to go out with the Jackie Wilson's tour all the time.  One reason why we did that is that, there was a band that play for him called The Upsetters band, and we used to like that band because they had good musicians and stuff, so we didn't have to worry about a band not sounding right because they had got used to us, and I know one tour they offered us was the Sam Cooke tour, but also Jackie's show was going out maybe about a week later, so we decided to go out on the Jackie Wilson tour because we'd been there before instead of going on the Sam Cooke tour, but I laughed.  The first time I got a chance to meet him was in Chicago [Illinois].  I know his brother very well and he was working at the Regal Theater in Chicago and, and his brother introduced me to him when he was coming off stage and that was it, no, no Sam Cooke anymore (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so Jackie Wilson, you all were big Jackie Wilson fans I guess?
Speaker 2: Oh hey, those--that was my buddy there, he was a very good friend, talented guy.  One of the talented persons you ever want to see on stage.  I--that's the only person I ever heard that sounds exactly on stage the way he do on record.  Everything, every movement, every voice sound, his voice was just as clear as a bell and I don't know how he did it, but he was that, he was just that talented.  I know he told me once, and we was a little afraid when we first started that people wouldn't like us as much as these other guys go on stage and these guys be turning flips and, and standing on they head and stuff, and he said, let me tell you this, he said, "No matter what anybody do on stage, when you go on stage you sing your song.  This is your stage, you control this stage, you control the audience, don't let the audience control you, so you sing what you wanna sing because they'll be hollering up there to have you to sing this song or that song or this song, but you make them like you, and don't worry about what had happened before.  You worry about what you getting ready to do."
Speaker 1: You think artists sometimes get caught up in what they think is trendy?
Speaker 2: True.
Speaker 1: And as you were saying you all wouldn't do '[The] Monkey Time' at the time.  It just didn't seem like after you do some of the other songs you've done you know that 'Monkey Time' didn't seem to fit in with--
Speaker 2: Not with us.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But what we would do is to kid around sometime we do some of the songs that Curtis had wrote for other people and we would do it on stage.
Speaker 1: Oh, in the show?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we would do some of the things that Jerry done and this type of thing but they'll recognize it and they'll know that Curtis wrote it and we wouldn't not do--we would not do it exactly the same way, we would add group harmony within the song so that it would be just a wee bit different but have the same flavor.
Story_ID: 289311
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Fred Cash was telling us that one of his favorite phrases is it's all right, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: And that became the song ['It's Alright'], you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: So did you ever influence a song with an idea or lyrics or anything that you know of?
Speaker 2: No, I just--when mostly with me, I could remember all the lyrics of our songs.  We might be doing an interview like I'm doing now and Curtis [Mayfield] would be sitting over there and somebody might ask him a question about one of his songs, and he can't remember it, but he'll ask Sam [HistoryMaker Samuel Gooden], say he can remember all of that stuff and I could remember most of those, those things.
Speaker 1: What's that early part of 'It's Alright,' 'cause we were trying to remember that and Fred couldn't remember it and the song was his.
Speaker 2: Which part?
Speaker 1: "When you wake up early in the morning," how does that?
Speaker 2: "Feeling sad like so many of us do, hum a little soul, make life your goal and surely"--let me see! (Singing) "Hum a little soul, make life your goal, and you gotta say it's all right," (laughter) I forgot that part, one important thing.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) All right well that's pretty good, you know once again it's an upbeat song with a message, you know.
Speaker 2: But yeah Fred, that was his word he used.  We'd say, "Well Fred let's, let's go get some dinner--."  "It's all right," and he kept saying that over and over and over again and we were sitting like I said, sitting in the car between shows and Curtis said I wrote some, a song around what you said.  So we said okay, let's listen to it, and he started, he had this little open box guitar we sitting in the car and he started playing it's all right, and we started singing and we started repeating what he was saying and it, "Hey, this, this is gonna work right here."  So we went in to do an album and we got to that--that was the first song we'd done and we never finished the album that day.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because once we finished that song, the whole orchestra, the band, all of us just stopped and we just started listening to this song over and over again.  We would--they would play it and in the studio, and the guys on the trumpet would say, "Man, that's nice," and the drummer, everything--he said everything is perfect, but we never did another song that day.  We finished the album probably the next day, but we stopped singing after that.
Speaker 1: What's interesting about The Impressions is that so many of your songs could sound good with just a guitar accompaniment or even a capella, and people, the way, the way you all sing the harmony is so strong.
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: But the orchestrations of [HistoryMaker] Johnny Pate.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Johnny Pate.
Speaker 1: A song like 'It's Alright,' I mean it's just--it's fantastic.
Speaker 2: I would say this, that before Johnny came with us we sung well but when he got with us he knew us so well and what was lacking in some spots in background, he knew how to cover it with music, with a horn line, with a hum of a horn that would go along the same lines that Fred and myself was singing and it would sound like we were still singing and he knew how to do these things, and that's why I said, "This guy, he made us," you know he made us as popular as we are today.  If it wasn't for Johnny Pate I don't think we'd be as popular as we are because this guy was just, he was just so much a part of the group.  He was almost like the fourth member of The Impressions because that's where he lived with us, and he lived with the sound, he would take it, he would take a sound home.  We would do the rhythm and he would tape it.  He would go home to get, to arrange the horn and stuff around it and he knew where he needed to put this or put that to enhance what we was trying to do.
Story_ID: 289312
Speaker 1: Did background singers feel that--you talked about going through some tough times, the lead singers go on and they go on someplace.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But when the group is left--I mean a couple of times this has happened to you where the lead would leave and you're left--the background guys are there, they're out a group and it seems like it's--do you feel--is it very insecure position to be in to be the group but you're the background, but you're the group.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No not with us because the background did so much to enhance the lead in our group [The Impressions] that you could take the lead out and you could get another lead, and you could still get the same sound like we do now.  You'll get the exact same sound that we had then.  Why?  Because the background was more around the lead, the lead was doing just lead vocal.  He wasn't doing no harmony changes, the other two guys were doing the harmony changes around this lead singer.  So if you got a singer with the same type of voice that could do these parts then you can take that and surround him with the two other voices and it'll sound the same.
Speaker 1: Now is it hard for a lead singer to find good background people that know what they're doing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so because you find a lot of guys right now they search around for different guys.  They change different members in background for themselves too because they don't sound like the guys that use to be there you know, and we're not gonna do it that way.  You know that's why a lot of people thought that when Curtis [Mayfield] left that our sound was just gonna, just fall outta the sky because they figured that he was doing most of everything, that he was doing, that he was doing the harmony and he was doing the lead also, but he wasn't.  He was doing--most of the songs that Curtis sung he was doing straight lead and we was doing around him, we would surround him with the background, and we would switch voices a lot.  We would go over him and he would go over me and Fred [HistoryMaker Fred Cash] would go over me and just, it's what you call being versatile to be able to jump each other and still carry the same type of harmony.  You know you switch voice, I could switch with Fred, I could switch--Curtis could switch with Fred, Curtis could switch with me.  I could take the top, Fred could take the bottom and then you know, vice versa, and this is what you call being very versatile but you got to be, you have to be very I mean creative to do it.  You know, because everybody can't do it and especially take it on stage.
Speaker 1: Right, now I tried to hear it before I came down here.  I found a website where I could hear a sample of each one of your songs, I was listening to the songs.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This is a good job to have 'cause I got a chance to do that for a couple of hours (laughter).
Speaker 2: But see if you listen to a lot of things we've done you can hear and then you'll wonder well where do this voice go?  Does this voice stay at the same pitch here or did it go someplace else?  And that's what a lot of people use to try to sing some of our stuff, and they didn't know which way the voices was going (laughter) and so it didn't come out right.  They'd be singing the song but the song didn't sound the same.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's complicated.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know it sounds simple but it's not.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No it takes a lot of rehearsal, a lot of practice and that's what we do with Willie [HistoryMaker Willie Kitchens] here.  He's--Willie, he can do all the voices and he knows how to jump voices.  He knows how to switch here, he can take the low, he can take the top or he can take the middle, you know, and then we might right be right in the middle of a song and we switch, switch parts there, and it sound like it's very easy to do when you got to know what pitch he was in and he got to know what pitch you was in and where were you gonna go, when were you gon' switch back to where you were in the first beginning.
Story_ID: 289313
Speaker 1: I believe it was in '68 [1968] or '69 [1969] I found an album in the record store called "The Best of the Impressions" ["The Very Best of the Impressions"], and I'm thinking like, they're not over with yet, how come the best is out, you know?  But I bought it, you know I went home and all the big hits were on there, but that was like a turning point because I think Curtis Mayfield decided to end his time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, he was, Curtis left in, in '68 [1968] right after '68 [1968].  We did the last album with--no, no we did the--that's when we did the last thing with ABC-Paramount [Records].  Curtis left in '71 [1971], but that was getting to be the time when he had wanted to branch out a little bit.  What was happening is that we started Curtom Records and if there's not somebody there that truly knows talent that you could skip talent, you know people that could come into sing for you, and if the guy didn't know talent as well as somebody else then he might turn them away when this act might be good, and Curtis wanted to start to stay in and evaluate the talent which was around Chicago [Illinois] in the area, and he decided to do that in 1970 and so we started trying to find a replacement for him and so we had--this group that called, outta Washington [D.C.].  They was going to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and there's a young man that was singing there.  His name was Leroy Hutson and he basically had a same, similar voice, but not as mellow and very mature as Curtis' voice was.  So we started to teach him the way we did things and how things were done because at first he thought that Curtis was going from one part to another part, but he wasn't.  We just told him to sing straight lead and we would sing around his voice and it would work the same way it that when Curtis was there and so we rehearsed there for I guess about six, about six or seven months to get it all together and then before we went out on the road.
Speaker 1: So what was your first big hit with that group?
Speaker 2: We did not have a big hit with Leroy.  We did a tune that Marvin Gaye had done called 'Inner City Blues' but we was on the road and Curtis and them was trying to find us to get us into the studio before they would put this record out on Marvin, because they heard it off one of his albums, he had another song out at that time and they wanted us to do it.  So when we did get a chance to come in and do it we asked Motown [Records, Detroit, Michigan] for the opportunity to do and they said it was okay.
Speaker 1: So you were under a contract with Motown then?
Speaker 2: No, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, from--to get the rights from Motown.
Speaker 2: Yeah you always--yeah, 'cause they can say well no, don't--we don't want you to do this song.
Speaker 1: But you all were working with them?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You were with ABC?
Speaker 2: We knew, we knew Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy], we knew Marvin and them.
Speaker 1: Yeah but you were with, you weren't with?
Speaker 2: We were with Curtom.
Speaker 1: With ABC anymore but you were with Curtom.
Speaker 2: Curtom Records, yeah.
Speaker 1: With Curtis.
Speaker 2: And so the guy said it was okay, so we went in to do it and we had the timing, the tempo and everything perfect and there was an older engineer in the studio.  We had did this thing letter perfect all the way through and we asked him to play it back for us and he had erased every bit of it.  We never could get that same feel back again, we did it over, but it just wasn't like the first time we done it.  We done it maybe just a bit, just a bit faster than what Marvin was doing his, but it was letter perfect and when we put it out the guy said, "Hey, this is gonna be a giant record," but I think we waited a bit too late because--that's about, I think that's about a week, maybe less than a month later they put it out on Marvin and I know it was, it shot straight up and that just knocked ours to the side.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: But no we--with Leroy we never did--we did a lot of traveling overseas and other places, but big record, no we never had one with him.
Story_ID: 289314
Speaker 1: Now you did have some big records in the '70s [1970s] but what was, what was the first big one in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: 'Finally Got Myself Together' ['Finally Got Myself Together (I'm a Changed Man)'].
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Was about two weeks from turning gold, (laughter) but this guy was going to change distributing companies and that's what this company we was with, they were the distributor of this record, and when they got the word that we were gonna change, they wouldn't push it anymore.  So we just stayed right there and it never did make the gold record, because it was--we went into the office that day, and the guy told us said, that the acting lady said, "Now how long before this record will go gold?"  And she said give it two weeks and it'll be gold.  That was gonna be our first gold record, but there was a lot of people that were saying (laughter) they really think we had millions, and millions of gold records, no.
Speaker 1: Oh, the first one for The Impressions period, 'Finally Got Myself Together,' that was almost the first one?
Speaker 2: That was almost the first one.
Speaker 1: None of your other records were gold?
Speaker 2: None of 'em.
Speaker 1: That's amazing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Does it speak to--I mean do you suspect that perhaps something was not you know quite on the up-and-up here?
Speaker 2: Well, I feel like '[For Your] Precious Love' would've been a gold record, should've been a gold record, but we were with that small company [Vee-Jay Records, Chicago, Illinois] and you know, you were green, you didn't know anything about the business.  You knew singing that's about it, and you didn't know the business part of the thing, you know about, of checking and finding out how the record is selling, you know what's this, how is this going?  How long before it gets to be nine hundred thousand and you know this type of thing.  Of course they wasn't gonna tell you anyway, you know because they didn't want you to know.  That was back during the time when a company was messing over young acts.
Speaker 1: They say there are lawyers in the entertainment industry now that are--now, this is another thing I heard on public radio, they said they are willing to take the case of anybody that made a record between certain dates 'cause they know that they're owed some money (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah that's true.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I mean they, it is 'cause the companies can't stand any kind of investigation.
Story_ID: 289315
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, right now there's a lot of money owed to a lot of acts that right now, that are not doing as well, and this money could be a benefit to them, you know, and that the only thing I think about is that these guys that put their heart and soul into singing and traveling and risking their life out there, especially going into places where there was a--you know, they didn't like you that much, like in the South and in Mississippi and all these places that they didn't like you, and you know you couldn't eat different places, and you was afraid for your life at times.  It's just that these people done all of this and not they can't reap no benefits from it because nobody give them their royalties.  And then plus now you got all these bogus groups that's out there that I've personally have worked with at least six Drifters and I've worked with five Coasters, I've worked with six Platters, which I know they weren't no Platters, and they knew I know and the same thing with all of the other groups that you had a chance to work with, which they're taking money from these other acts that they can't get these shows anymore.  Because people see you, say, "That's not, that's not so and so," you know, "that's not the Coasters," or "that's not the Drifters," or "that's not the Platters."  But see you got some people they don't care.  You know they don't care who show up.  You sing the songs, if can sing it halfway like them, fine, this is so and so, you know.
Speaker 2: And a lot of people really don't know too, you know.
Speaker 1: No, it's bad, it's really bad, it's getting worse now that if you don't get the trademark of your name, even if you get the trademark of your name that there is somebody out there that'll go to certain parts of the states and say they are you.  And that's the only way you're gonna stop this is that each state in this union would go right to their senators or whoever there that's in charge of changing laws to say that there will be--this state will have no bogus group perform in their state.  There's--see Pennsylvania has it now and I think South Carolina, and we're trying to get it here in Tennessee, that no bogus group would be performing here under somebody else's name unless it's the one that made the records.  Of course there's a lot of acts that there are no more than about two or three members of that are still there, but if those guys are still there even if they put some new members around them, then they are the same, they are the same group because that's that main guy is still there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I know there've been cases of people who may have been in a group for a little bit, a small amount of time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Who've gone and put together.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Whole new groups around.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, around one or two guys that may have been at the beginning of something but never did the hits.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: And now they try to tour with--
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a group that the gentlemen that sang lead with 'em sound exactly like the guy that was there, but the thing is on you, what you would think about is, what happens when you make a new record?  Will this guy sound like this, because all he's doing is listening to what the other guy had performed and when it come to your voice now, you gotta put out a new record, are you gonna sound like this?  No.  'Cause I know this guy in [The] Stylistics, young man that sounds great, sounds just like Russell Thompkins [Jr.], but he's not him, and Russell's gonna sound the same all the time, but when this guy, when they have to put out a new record on as Stylistics, how is the lead singer gonna sound?  Will he sound like Russell or will he sound like him?  'Cause once you know, I'm sure this guy wants to sound like himself, he don't wanna sound like Russell, he wants to do a song, you know, mostly in his voice.
Story_ID: 289316
Speaker 1: Now the record publishing companies, I mean the record companies have ASCAP [The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers] and BMI [Broadcast Music, Inc.] to go around and they'll go to festivals and anybody singing those songs, say a Stevie Wonder song or a Curtis Mayfield song and they want, if they have the rights to it they'll like make 'em pay, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well.
Speaker 1: There's nobody to stop somebody from--
Speaker 2: No, no you can.
Speaker 1: From pretending to be.
Speaker 2: No, no you can, you can perform the song, that's you know, as long as the credit goes to the person that wrote it and the publishing and everything goes to the person that had the publishing on it.  You know, we could go out and do a song now that belongs to somebody else but we can't put our--you know we can't down there and say, "Written by so and so, and written by him and published by this," no, we got to put the same thing that's on their record on this and then, of course they have no squabble with that because then they're getting all the credits.  They're getting the publishing, they're getting the writing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the groups themselves can't, you know don't have anybody to police who goes around and performs in their name right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, there you got, like you say they have got guys that have been in a group, maybe a month, two months or maybe a year, then he gets outta the group and he wants to start him a group with that same name, and if that group name is not copyrighted by the guys that has it originally then the guy can do what he want.  It's, it's bad, it's bad and it's sad.
Story_ID: 289317
Speaker 1: You did 'Finally Got Myself Together' ['Finally Got Myself Together (I'm a Changed Man)'], that was a big hit and it almost went gold right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the first record that came close to going gold, some of the other records, the "Keep On Pushing," and all the other stuff, no.  We had an album, I think it was the "Keep On Pushing" album that was at nine hundred thousand for the album, and that was the closest album that came to going gold, but no, we got no gold, like to have 'em, but haven't got it.
Speaker 1: You know that's, that's just truly amazing with all the hits and there's no gold, you know.
Speaker 2: We was a part of a CD that went platinum, but it wasn't ours, it was, it belonged to Eric Clapton.  We did a background vocal on not this last album, CD, but the CD before that called "Reptile."
Speaker 1: Right, right I heard that, yeah, yeah, and that was an interesting kind of collaboration, this recent kind of a collaboration.
Speaker 2: Oh, that was fun, that was fun.  He's a fun guy and he's a good singer, good musician and he's a guy that makes you very comfortable being around, and I consider him one of my best friends.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's that good of a guy.
Speaker 1: All right, so you all toured England with Eric Clapton right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did, we did six days in London [England] at the Albert Royal Hall [sic. Royal Albert Hall] there, and then we went to Manchester [England], and Birmingham [England], and another place.  I've forgot the first one but everyplace was sold out for him, he was just that talented guy.
Speaker 1: Okay now, that was just in 2000 right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was.
Story_ID: 289318
Speaker 1: We left off with 'Finally Got Myself Together' ['Finally Got Myself Together (I'm a Changed Man)'] then after that came?  What was the next hit that was, I think--
Speaker 2: To tell you the truth there was 'Sooner or Later' and there was a tune that was made famous by The O'Jays called, what was the name of that song, 'You Are My Sunshine' [sic. 'Sunshine'].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And we did a retake of that one, it went well for us also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But after that we've been laying in the bushes I guess you might say, until we got Willie [HistoryMaker Willie Kitchens] with us and we started doing a Christmas CD ["I'm Coming Home for Christmas"] which I feel is some of the best singing we ever done as a group, even way back then.  Everything is so, so tight and everything is so, the voices are so--just outstanding though on this CD that we've done.  We've done ten tunes already.  At first the company wanted twelve songs and then when we went and let 'em hear all of this, they wanted--they needed fifteen and plus they all package their Christmas stuff in May, and this was--we thought it was July so we decided to wait until next Christmas to put this CD out, but I, once you hear it you would say the same thing I say, it's about the best that we've done.  We've done some.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: We've done some good things but the singing wise and the vocal wise, is really strong.  This is as strong as we've ever been.
Speaker 1: Do you find as you get older are you, does it--how does that affect your singing when you get older?
Speaker 2: Well at first, I thought, I said, well what's gonna happen, your voice is gonna drop down it's gonna be lower but instead of my voice getting lower, my voice going up some because I use to do mostly baritone and I had a low baritone, and now when I do these parts in the same key, it's higher.  My voice range is higher than then, it sounds kinda weird that your voice would go up instead of down.  I don't know whether that I'm doing more switching and the things that we're doing, you know, we're basically doing the same that we done when Curtis [Mayfield] was there for the three of us, we're doing the same switching, we're doing the same keys that we're doing other songs in.  I don't think we changed any of our keys, which is a blessing that you're able to keep the same vocal chords there.
Speaker 1: And do you look for the same kind of projects, I mean in a sense, there's a certain image that The Impressions have and people expect to hear, to see The Impressions they think of, there's a, the sound is closely related to a gospel sound.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And there's also, there's always like some kind of--a certain amount of dignity in the songs of The Impressions that goes, you know.
Speaker 2: Well that's what we're doing with this, if you hear this Christmas CD, I don't know whether--I know Willie has some discs of it here that we've done.  If you heard some of it you would say it's even stronger.  It's even stronger now than it was then because we're doing recoding a little bit different than we did back then.  Back then you would go in and you would sing, and you know old, every song you would go like this, like this and you would go back and check and see how that sounds.  Is that all right, or did I miss a note there, or did I miss a beat there, a key?  Now, the way we record now we would do a song, then we'd come back in the next time we get ready to record the next song and we'd listen to that song over again and we will pick out little things that says, "Well that's sticking out, or that's sticking out.  Let's fix that."  So we go in and fix it, and that, that's why it takes so long for a lot of acts to do a CD.  You take a year, a year and a half maybe to do it because they're constantly going back changing stuff in it because they see things that they've done wrong.  They see things that the band may have done wrong and maybe a pitch might be here and a pitch might be there.  You change it, you go back in and say, "Okay, there, that we can change this right here.  We can make that better," and that's what you do.  Then when you push your sound up, your voices, I don't care what you push up then, everything is good.
Story_ID: 289319
Speaker 1: Back in the old days I know one of the disappointments I used to have in going to hear a group live is that they never sound exactly the way they did on a record, and I think people always, though they know that after a while you kinda figure out they're not gonna sound exactly--but you still expect 'em to for some reason.  You have the song in your mind 'cause you've heard this same version, the same take of this song like a million times and then you go hear 'em perform and they sing it slightly differently as somebody you know, you say well what, what's going on?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've heard people talking about a friend group of ours that they don't do it the way they--they add something to it, but that's why when we do our stuff, and we do it on stage or anywhere.  We do it exactly like the record.  Now we might add something at the end to tail it off, to make it a little bit more exciting, but when it comes to the song per se, then we do the song exactly the way the record is, and I think that's why a lot of people come see our show, and they'll say well they sound just like they sounded years ago you know, and that's what we, that's a compliment to us because that's what we're trying to get.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what are you, what's the, what are future projects?  Now you're working on a Christmas piece ["I'm Coming Home for Christmas"] right now, but is there anything else in the future?
Speaker 2: We're gonna do a gospel CD and we're also gonna do an R&B CD.  Those are the two, those are the three things we're in the process of doing.  We're gonna finish the Christmas thing.  When we finish that then we'll go into the gospel thing.  We've already done a couple of things, one called 'Mary, Did You Know?' and we've done one called 'We Fall Down,' that [HistoryMaker] Donnie McClurkin done.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But we kinda changed it a little different to mold it to the way we sing and that, we've--matter-of-fact Willie [HistoryMaker Willie Kitchens] may have that there too, that you could that he might play a little bit of it for you, but that goes onto the gospel CD.  We haven't--we've rehearsed about three songs, but Willie had wrote some more songs that are good gospel songs and we are trying to pick out what we wanna do and we wanna do some of the old, old standards of gospel and then move into some of the newer stuff.  You know, we don't wanna get into--you know you got some of this contemporary which is great, and that's what a lot of guys do if that's what you want to do, but I want to do maybe a little bit of that, and mostly basically stick with the original stuff.
Story_ID: 289320
Speaker 1: Now do you have, other than The Impressions and everybody that's been with The Impressions, do you have a favorite musician or favorite musicians that impress you the most?
Speaker 2: That you mean, that used to play for us?
Speaker 1: No, no, other than anybody associated with The Impressions I mean?
Speaker 2: Oh, heck.
Speaker 1: Excluding, yeah.
Speaker 2: I got plenty, I got plenty of those (laughter).  There's [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis, there's oh man, I could sit up here and I could name guys off, there's a bass player that plays with I think Fourplay.  He plays with Eric's [Eric Clapton] band and--what is that guy's name?  East, his name is Nathan East, excellent, excellent bassist, and then you got other musicians that--man I could say--like I said I could sit here and name plenty of 'em if I could remember all of the names of the guys that, but there's--I like, what's this guy's band?  Aw man, I forgot the name of the guy's band, but he's--got excellent musicians in there.
Speaker 1: You like mostly jazz?
Speaker 2: I like jazz too, yeah I like good jazz.  I liked The Jazz Crusaders [The Crusaders], that was my favorite, favorite act, and of course I like Ramsey and of course the other group [Young-Holt Unlimited] that branched off from Ramsey's group [Ramsey Lewis Trio], you know.  But I'm into all types of music, there's a lot of country music that I didn't know that sounded as well until I sat and listened to the lyrics of the songs that they sung, and I said, "Man, they made some great lyrics to these songs."  Me and my, me and my daughter, my daughter and my son-in-law took me to one of these karaoke things and friends of theirs was singing these songs.  So I got a chance to hear some of the lyrics of these songs, and man, they're some great lyrics in these songs, great songs.
Story_ID: 289321
Speaker 1: What would you consider I guess to be your major contribution to The Impressions?
Speaker 2: Besides my voice?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the voice, okay let's count that, we know that's one, but.
Speaker 2: Um, maybe the way I carry myself, and I try--there's a lot of people that call you a star and they call you this and they call you that, but me I call myself just a human being, and I'm just a singer.  I'm a person that loves what he's doing and I go on stage and I perform the best of my ability, but when I come off then I become a different person.  I just become me then, I just become an everyday person just like anybody that goes on a nine-to-five job.  My friends are my friends whether they are not singers at all.  You know I have friends that's in the police department, I have friends that--fire department, I got friends that do a lot of things that I'll hang out with them most so than other entertainers because that's the way I am.  And I don't treat them no different and I don't want them to treat me no different.  I don't want them thinking that I'm bigger than them, or I'm above them.  I'm just on the same level and I try to keep myself on the same level as just a performer and you know and if somebody say something about a star I say stars are in the sky.  You know, God made stars and he made me, I'm just an entertainer. You know I perform and people have--enjoy what I'm doing or trying to do for 'em, and I try to carry myself in a way that they can, they can think of me.  They can always come to me anytime, not where you're afraid to approach this person because there's so many security people standing around.  You know I, only time I would care for a security people is maybe overseas some place, but if I'm here in the states then when I finish performing if you, if I have, if you give me fifteen or twenty minutes to change clothes, then our doors is open.  You can come in anytime, sit and talk, shake hands, autograph whatever.  You know, we answer any question that you wanna answer and I guess that's, this is the way I like, this is the way I like to see myself in this business, just an ordinary, hardworking guy.
Story_ID: 289322
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you a lot about the last days of Curtis Mayfield.  I know he was in an accident in 1990 I believe right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Curtis had went overseas, and we had him and Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerry Butler] and ourselves--we had set up a date that when he came back from overseas that we all was gonna sit down and we were gonna map out a tour with just the three acts, and so when Curtis came back he had one date to do that was in New Jersey--no, no, Brooklyn, New York, and it was an outdoor thing and he had just got back and he was in a hurry to get home.  So he asked an act that came on, that was gonna come on before him if they mind that he would go on in their place and then come on after him and they agreed, but the weather was bad and, and the wind was blowing and stuff and you had big tree lamps that stage lights, that the things weigh over three of four thousand pounds, and what you do you usually anchor those things down with guide wires on both sides here and a side there and a side on the other side, that to keep 'em, even if they did rock, they wouldn't, wasn't gonna fall, but they didn't do that.  They didn't have that there and they didn't have 'em on the tri-parts, and well Curtis, when Curtis came on stage, he don't have his guitar already out there.  He carries his guitar with him and his carts, and he turns his back and hooks up to his amplifier and soon as he walked on stage, the wind blew it over, and by the time he turned it came down and it hit the fence and then it caught him, and I know he told Fred [HistoryMaker Fred Cash] and myself that he never lost consciousness.  Said it's just that, it seemed like everything, the life was going out his body.  Said it just looked like everything just, you know, just going numb and, but it paralyzed him from the neck down.  I know when we was in Atlanta [Georgia], we did a show there and he had just called us and he asked us would we come by the house.  And we said if we get a chance to we would come by but he asked, he definitely wanted us to come by.  So Fred and I, we were living in Chattanooga [Tennessee] then, so we said, "Well okay we'll go by and we'll stay for half an hour or an hour or so," and then you don't know how you're gonna react to seeing the guy laying there like that and you know, 'cause people can look at your face and they can see the expression on your face that you just hate to see that, but once we got there and we got to talking and we started talking about different things, we wind up about two or three hours sitting there, and he talked about that he'd had dreams about us, and I never thought he would ever say something like that (laughter) or have a dream, you know, and I think my wife [Gloria Gooden] or somebody asked me did I, did I dream about him, you know?  I said, "No, never dreamed about anything like that.  I think about times that we had years ago, but no, not in dreams.  I just go to bed and go to sleep," but all in all, I done got away from your question that you asked me on this particular thing.  I know you're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no you're deep into it and I was just asking you, I guess I really wanted to know you know about how you felt about Curtis Mayfield's last days and what--
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: You know, and you're saying that he dreamt about you, you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what he said, he told Fred and myself that, "You know I dreamed about you guys?"  And we said, "Really?"  That's really something, something for him to say, but it was something to hear, something good to hear.  You know you hear a guy that been with you for a while and I don't think--I know a lot of people thought Curtis was there maybe twenty-five, thirty years, but he was there only thirteen years, you know that's--well it seemed like it was that long you know because the way, the way we sung and the way we would sit around and talk a lot, and rehearse a lot.  We rehearsed almost every day to perfect our harmony and stuff.
Story_ID: 289323
Speaker 1: I think that--one thing I think about a lot is that the time that we did put in to increase our talent, to enhance our talent more so to say that made us sound a lot better, and because if you don't put any work into this business, then you might as well just get out, you know.  'Cause when I first got into this I just, I figured it would last about maybe five or six years and then I'd probably start doing something else, and here now it's getting close to fifty years that we been in this thing and I enjoy it now more so than I did then because now, then I was just singing, you know, I was singing and you'd make a little money here and you would go out and party at night, and just run the street, but now, now that you're putting, you're putting in great time into it now where when you finish you're tired, you go home and you get a good shower and you go down, lay down and you think about what we're gonna do the next time we go into rehearse, how are we gonna do this, how are we gonna change this, how are we gonna make this better?  What we try to do is try to make The Impressions--I know we can't stay around forever, you know, but we we're trying to make our music stay around forever if that's possible, that as long after we're gone then there will be people that will still love us, and think very highly of our music and our talent.
Story_ID: 289324
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, I got, it's just so much I could say.  I look at all other nationalities of people and how well they stick together and how they grow together.  Like the Jewish people.  If you see 'em they're all together.  They are one, all for one and they're not trying to hurt each other.  Here with our people, and what makes me so sad about it is that we're killing each other, we're hurting each other.  We got gangs over here, we got other gangs over here.  You don't want this guy over in your territory.  You don't want this guy over in your territory when you're the same color, and you're the same, you're the same nation, nationality.  So why is it that we can't as a nation with us, why can't we just grow together and help each other more, 'cause there's neighborhoods that's going down where other people can go, you can go--they, you got to have another race of people to come in and straighten that neighborhood out for you when you could do it yourself.  You know, you could pool your monies, and they won't do it 'cause everybody wanna be in charge.  You know they wanna say, "I don't trust that guy 'cause all he gon' do is make money for himself," you know where you got other races, you put that in that man's hand, and that in that man's hand and they pull the whole race up.  You know, the neighborhood, you look around at it and it's just beautiful.  You look at ours, haven't grown at all.  You got some that's grown and got some that just, it's the same way you were thirty years ago, you know because we, we just--I don't know we are lacking something as a, as a race.  You know we're not pulling together you know, and until we do and we can all pull together as one, we could get anything done in this whole country.  You know we could get, we could have, talking about a black president, you could get those things in there.  You can, that can happen, but the thing is we don't support each other.  You know we just, we support other, other races.  You know, "Hey okay, this guy here let's push him, yeah he gon' do this for me," you know, but the thing is why can't you do these things for yourself?  Why can't you find somebody that has the education and the knowledge in your neighborhood and in your race that can do the same things that those people can do and we have 'em, we have 'em.  No, and I ain't just talking about the [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson and the [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].  I'm not just talking about them, there're other, other people right now that's talented enough to do these things, that if you put 'em in the position, but will they turn their back on you when they get up there?  See, and that's what happens with our people.  They get up to that certain point, then they don't know you anymore.  You know they just, I don't know.  It's a mess, our race is a mess, you know and until we can come together as black Americans.  I say black Americans, they say some people say African Americans, I say black Americans.  If we can't, if we can get together and stand together, but I don't know how long it's gonna take for that to happen.  I might be dead and gone before this will ever happen and somebody will look back and say well that guy said that, you know, that if you do this and you get all of these people together and pull together you can make a beautiful country.  You know, hey, that's what people are looking at now.  They are afraid that if we ever come together and settle down together and come up we'd take up the whole country.  Not because we're there you know, we got the people and we got the people in school, the kids coming out of school, educated, know how to do all of these things.  Put 'em in the position that you need to have and let's work together and grow just like Jewish people, just like white people, just any other, other race of people.
Story_ID: 289325
Speaker 1: We just talked about it off camera, but we were talking about the tragic loss of your entire band in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Everybody was killed in an auto accident.
Speaker 2: It just--those guys were so close to you because these are the same guys that you hear on the record, every one of the guys that played with us, played on all the records.  We would go in and rehearse it and then we'd turn it over to thing and we'd go to the studio and play it, and we had just finished, we was on the Jackie Wilson tour.  I think that was '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Not the '80s [1980s], it was '68 [1968] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, '68 [1968], yeah '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right that's different.
Speaker 2: And we was doing a show in Columbia, South Carolina and some kinda way the on and off switch on our sound system that we were using for the whole package show, you couldn't cut it on and off.  So we had a day off the next day, and we were gonna go to Atlanta [Georgia] to get that fixed and that was a good place to go to Atlanta because we could there and relax, and take the day off and then go to Greenville [South Carolina], which was the next date.  So our band, we talked to them after the show, and they was saying, laughing and talking, they was saying, "Tell everybody we'll be headed to Atlanta in a little while."  Said okay, so we left and drove to Atlanta and I got to the hotel and I said, "I'm tired," because we had done so many days without a day off and I decided that I wouldn't call home, I would just wait until in the morning before I called, and I guess they left, about probably about three o'clock in the morning coming to Atlanta, and there's a highway, Interstate 85.  There's--of course you got the four lanes, two-lane highways on one side and two-lane highways on the other side and right in the middle there is a median where you got a grassy knoll in there and when you get to a bridge there's an opening, there's a bank on one side of the bridge and the other side there's another bank, and they had to be doing at least about ninety-five in that car, or in that station wagon, and it went into the knoll and went across that bridge opening and it nosedived to the other side of the bank which killed, of course killed all of 'em instantly and all of the paraphernalia that we had in the trailer was scattered all over the place and that morning when the workers came by and discovered the accident, they saw a little sign that said, "The Impressions this and The Impressions that," and Impression pins and different things, and of course there was--all these black guys that was killed in the car.  So they turned it over to the highway patrol and they reported it that The Impressions was killed, but we was in the hotel, and I think they had called my wife [Gloria Gooden] and they called everybody and it had been on television and everybody was doing different things, and the first thing we thought about was going to find out you know, look at the--identify the bodies and stuff.
Story_ID: 289326
Speaker 1: So we went to a little town called Winder, Georgia and identified the bodies and stuff, and then Fred [HistoryMaker Fred Cash] asked me, he said, "Have you called home?"  I said, "No, not yet."  I said, "I'll call when I get back to the hotel."  So he said, "I haven't called either," so maybe we better call home.  So I got back to the hotel and, and dialed (laughter) my home phone number and my wife [Gloria Gooden] said, "Hello," and when I said "Hello," then there was a great big pause and I'm wondering what's, something wrong, what's the matter?  'Cause I'm calling to tell her about the accident, and she said, "You're not dead?"  I said, "Dead?  No, I'm not dead," and she said, "But they reported on television and stuff that you all was killed."  I said, "No that was our band, our band got killed," and I told her, she knew 'em well too, so I had told 'em that and then she said, "Well you better call your mother [Ruby Satterwhite Gooden], 'cause she about to go crazy down there."  So I called my mom and I told (laughter), and everybody, of course everybody relaxed then, but.
Speaker 2: 'Cause that had to be kinda eerie though if they think you're dead and here you're calling on the phone.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and 'cause that's, 'cause I didn't understand--I thought something was wrong 'cause she didn't say anything for a long time.  There was just a pause there on the phone as if to say, "No, this can't be you, you know you can't be talking to me on the telephone," and then we--she finally came back and I started talking and she had been crying, and I said, "What's wrong?"  And she said, "Well they said, they have all over the place that you all was killed."  I said, "No, our band got killed early this morning and we been over to identify the bodies, but we, we was at the hotel already, and I said the reason I didn't call you last night is because I was tired and I said I'd call you in the morning."  I said the way I usually do, I usually just say I get to a place and I'm tired, I won't call because you don't wanna talk and when you know you say well hey, you don't seem like really want to talk and I said well I'm tired you know, and I think, I don't think sometimes wives don't realize how tired you get when you especially, when you're--during that time when you were driving to these places and then you gon' have to get up there and perform, then you gotta get in the car and you gotta drive to the next place, you know you're not getting a lot of rest because if the place is a little bit farther than the place that you played, then you might have to leave after the show and drive to the next place and then check in there, and that, a lot of time that's what we did and but after that I started calling when I got to the hotel I would call and say, "I'm at the hotel.  I'm not going anywhere (laughter), I'm going to bed.  I'm not going out to get no food, I'm not going nowhere, so if anybody tells you anything happened to me it's not true."
Story_ID: 289327
Speaker 1: That's quite a story; it took you a while to recoup and get another band together right?
Speaker 2: Well, my nephew [Joseph "Lucky" Scott] knew most of our stuff.   He's a bass player, and we called him and we rehearsed him for about a week or two weeks and then the third week we went out and did the last two days with the Jackie Wilson tour.
Speaker 1: Who were the guys that were killed, and there were four right, from your group?
Speaker 2: A guy named, a base player name was Lenny Brown, the drummer named Billy Griffin and the guitar's name was Joe [Joseph Thomas].  I can't remember Joe's last name, but then there was two members of the Jackie Wilson band, which they lived in Atlanta [Georgia].  I don't know though, I didn't know their names at all.
Speaker 1: It should be one more right?
Speaker 2: No, it was just that, that was it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just that was it?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because it was three of ours, Curtis [Mayfield] made the fourth musician when he came along, the other three and made four guys.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so yeah that's a rough kinda thing.
Speaker 2: It was, it was rough because we owned some Corvettes, Stingrays during that time and before that, that accident happened we had come down the same highway and we used to come down through doing way over a hundred miles an hour in these cars and not--just laughing and having fun.  Not knowing that these things, you know you could--that could've been us.  You could've, you know we could've run off the road with those things and to tell you the truth Fred [HistoryMaker Fred Cash] was driving his car, wasn't doing but forty-five miles an hour, and it was raining.  It had been raining and the car spun out and went down the hill, an embankment.  It didn't hurt him that bad, at all but the thing is it just goes to show you how fast he was going to have the accident, what would've happened if he had been going over a hundred miles an hour.  So it just, it took all the speed outta me then, I just.  I let my car sit, I think I wind up selling it back to the people I bought it from because I didn't want it anymore and far as--it took me a long time to get used to the bumps in the road as we would drive along or somebody else was driving and I was may have dozed off and went to sleep and it just--it'd make you jump--be jumping all the time, then finally you kinda you know kinda get over it, but it was, it really was a horrible thing for us you know, it hurt us because these kids we knew, we knew 'em so well and they were just so close to, we had a close-knit unit that we had with us, and they played on records for us.  All the records that you hear that have been played out there, the early records, these guys played on all of 'em.
Story_ID: 289328
Speaker 1: The Impressions, one thing about The Impressions, and I discussed it with [HistoryMaker] Fred Cash as well, was that it seems to be of all the groups that, you know, who come back and stuff.  I know there may be others that do this but The Impressions seem to be the type of group where the people that, I mean [HistoryMaker] Jerry Butler would come back and sing with you and if Curtis Mayfield was still alive he'd come back, he'd perform too.  It seems like everybody was welcome and it was very--there was even a reunion, twenty-fifth reunion--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) of The Impressions and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we interlocked a show that where we would switch out lead, switch out lead, then we all would be there together at one point.  It took us a while to get that to work together, then after we finished that one we went and we decided to do individual type of shows, where Curtis would have his band.  We would have our band and Jerry would have his own band, and we would each do our own shows and if we wanted to do a song then we would, but basically then we stuck to our own menu of things that we did.
Speaker 1: It seems unusual that groups even perform--so, so many I mean they've never been able to get The Beatles back together again or, or.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: The Supremes or you know I mean a lot of groups just don't have that kind of--
Speaker 2: Well, I, we grew up--well actually Fred and I grew up together and Curtis and Jerry grew up together so what the thing is we stayed around Chicago [Illinois] so, so long.  I lived in Chicago for about twenty-two years and we just got to be almost like brothers I guess you might say, where if he failed--like we might be performing in Chicago and Jerry might come to the show, and we might invite him up to sing a song with us or something like that.  You know this type of thing.
Speaker 1: And he'd do it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause that's.
Speaker 2: No problem and none and not animosity or anything in it, it's just that well, peoples remember that part of it so we show 'em a little part of that then we go on and do our own thing--
Story_ID: 289329
Speaker 1: Do you have any advice for young musicians?  We were talking about some the--your concerns about the black community.  Are there any signs of hope in the young generation, and what advice would you give 'em?
Speaker 2: If a guy wanna be in this business, he has to put his heart and soul into this business, but he also got to remember that it don't have to work.  It can be a long, hard struggle.  It's not easy, you got to take the bumps, you got to take the bruises and you got to wanna stick with it, and you got to wanna do this.  If you don't wanna do it, get in another business, because otherwise you gon' be spinning your wheels, because if you think that you look at The Impressions or you look at Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] and The Miracles, you look at The Temptations, and you say, "Wow, that's where I wanna be, that's exactly where I'm gonna be!"  You can, but it's gonna take a lot of work and you gonna go through some rough time, you gonna go through some ups and downs just like you going up and down hills.  There's gonna be some low points in the thing that you say, well I think we better stop, it ain't gonna work, and then next thing you know the next day it's up again, but when you get that chance and they open the doors for you, just be able--just be prepared to walk in and claim a spot because that's the only way you gonna get there is that you just claim it.  This is mine and I'm gon' be good at it or I'm not gonna be at it at all and that's the way, that's the way we did.  We rehearsed over and over and over and over--you just get tired of rehearsing, you get tired, and you're tired, but when people see you on stage and you start these songs, and you start singing these parts that you done rehearsed all this time and the way you do it and the way it affects people then you say, "Man, that was fun and that was worth, that was worth the work that we put in," and the younger people, there's a, there's an opening for you in this business because this business is like a great big old rubber band that it expands for the next person to come in because where you come in, there's another one going, gonna step down because we're not gonna be here forever, you know, the groups get older and they just get--they retire.  Then there's a spot for the next group to step into that spot where that group were, but you have to be ready for it.  You have to have worked and rehearsed and got your act together and put together a show that you feel like people can enjoy.  Not where you're gonna go out and sing a lot of songs that have a lot of cuss words or anything in it, but I mean just singing.  Singing things that people wanna hear, and that's what we try to do.  You know, we try to do that and we encourage other acts, young acts to maybe, hey, look at what we did.  Look at how we did it, and what I'm saying to them now, then maybe they can listen to and they can say, "Well if we put as much work in it as Sam [HistoryMaker Samuel Gooden], Fred [HistoryMaker Fred Cash], Curtis [Mayfield] and everybody that was with The Impressions.  If I can put that much work in it I can make it," and you can.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But that's, that's the only way you gonna make it.
Story_ID: 289330
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I would, probably I, probably wouldn't have maybe ran the street as much as I did in my early years, or either I might not have done a lot of drinking and smoking cigarettes here 'cause I never did do anything else besides that but those two.  Those was bad enough and running the street, I could have taken that same time and that same energy, and put it within the group, and put it in rehearsal and maybe we could've been even better than we are today.
Speaker 1: Now those there are, I mean music when you talk about musicians, you know a lot of musicians fall victim to drug abuse and other problems, you know, big family problems.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you know, and kids all over the place.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I mean just all kind--financial disasters.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean it seems to follow musicians around, how do you avoid really being caught up?  I mean as a group you all seem not to have been.
Speaker 2: Well, there's not too many things that, that you can hear that--negative things that we've done.
Speaker 1: Yeah in fact I actually heard you--I told you a story when I walked in about a young lady from Chicago [Illinois] who's a nurse who--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who said you gave her a ride home and you weren't trying to hit on her.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You just gave her a ride home and she was impressed about that you were just a nice guy.
Speaker 2: It, well that's what you try, that's what you try to leave with people.  That's what we try to do with this group is to leave that same type of impression with people, that hey, it's not something that--we're not out to trying to go to bed with everybody you see, anybody that comes to you.  You know whether somebody want you or they don't want you, you know.  We try to carry ourselves in a way that people respect us and that got us a long ways.  As of today you know what, when Willie [HistoryMaker Willie Kitchens], Fred [HistoryMaker Fred Cash] and myself now do, is that we'll go to the show and there are people that wanna hug you and kiss you on the jaw and things like this, and they wanna know where you're staying or where you're going, but we don't say because soon as we finish we go in, change clothes, we wipe off, we sign some autographs, talk to the people and then we get in the car and go back to the hotel, and this has carried us a long way because then people can't say you gonna see that guy--'cause they've asked us to go to clubs.  Say they having an after party over here or over there.  We say we'll think about it, but we know we're not going because we're going back to the hotel and sit down, and relax and what, this is what have carried us this far now that we can go out now and still do a high energy show and people say well how can they keep doing shows like that?  They're not getting any younger, you know.  It's because we get a lot of rest and we don't drink (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you still you were too wild when you were younger huh?
Speaker 2: Ooh, I was terrible, I was, I was--I'm gon' tell you this, that, this go out to anybody I tell anybody don't follow that road 'cause I was, I mean I was out there.  I'd not--doing everything but drugs, wasn't doing no drugs or anything like that but I was ripping and running, lady here, lady there.  You know, you go to this city, lady there.  You know there, there, there, there until you just, you know all of a sudden you just got to grow up and this stuff that, you know it's just, it's not for you.  Then you get married and you try to do the best for your family.  You know you try to say, well hey, I have a family now, I've got marri--.  I've got a wife [Gloria Gooden]; I cut that running stuff out.
Story_ID: 289331
Speaker 1: At this point in your life too when you look back at everything you've done and all the accomplishments, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh boy, I guess probably the high point probably was being judged by your peers going into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame [Cleveland, Ohio] and then there's a Vocal Group Hall of Fame [Vocal Group Hall of Fame Foundation, Sharon, Pennsylvania] and then going into the Pioneer, getting the Pioneer Award, and then there's another award down in South Carolina which called the [Carolina] Beach Music Award Hall of Fame, and we have been selected in all of these, but we never had the honor of having a life achievement award.  I know the Grammy people have given one to Curtis [Mayfield], and I always say, I, I say he deserved what he got, but he didn't get there by his self and that's Fred [HistoryMaker Fred Cash] and myself, why can't we get a life achievement award?  I see 'em handed out to Gladys [Knight] not too long ago.  She deserved it, but shouldn't we deserve it?  You know here we are still going, and was there with Curtis through all of the hard ups and downs, turnarounds the other, all them records and everything, but nobody think about giving us a life achievement award.  Now that's the, that would be gratifying to me, that would, I think that would--and a gold record, that would, that would make mines [ph.] complete.
Story_ID: 289332
Speaker 1: Now tell us about your family now, you have children right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got four kids, three by my wife [Gloria Gooden] but I had one before, before I got married and stuff and I've--I had a son [Samuel Gooden, Jr.] and I got eight grandkids and just became a great-grandfather.  My granddaughter had a little boy.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what about your own parents [Ruby Satterwhite Gooden and George Gooden], did they--were they surprised that you became successful at this or did--were they all for it or did they have their reservations?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I--my mother did, my father, of course he was being a minister, I think he probably he never saw me on stage.  I don't know whether he saw me on television or what, but I know he never saw me in person, but anytime my mother could get there, she was there.  She would come to our show 'cause I know her church members would say, "You shouldn't go in a place like that," she said, "I don't care what you say.  I'm not going there to drink, I'm not going there to smoke.  I'm going down to watch my son sing," and she was there, and that made me happy.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did your father ever express any happiness about your career?
Speaker 2: After, after I used to come home and I would, I would always bring him a watch and I think he collected at least--he said about ten watches I would--every time I would come through I would leave a watch with him, and yeah I think he enjoyed me doing that then.  I think he finally knew what I did and my achievement.  That--I think about it 'cause some other people asked me the same thing.  What would--you know when I got in the Hall of Fame, "What do you think your parents think?"  I said I wished they would've been here to see me standing up here getting this award, and it would've made me very happy.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there anything we haven't asked you that you think we ought to talk about before I ask you the last question that we have.
Speaker 2: No, I think you covered everything that I can think of.
Story_ID: 289333
Speaker 1: Tell us this.  It's similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: You mean as a group or just as an individual?
Speaker 1: No, as a person, as a person, yeah.
Speaker 2: As a man that loved life and that tried to live it at its fullest and that tried to treat his fellow man as he wanted to be treated, not, not saying color, race or anything.  I wouldn't care if they was pink if they're my friend, they're my friend and I would want them to say, "There goes a great person that gave his best in anything he done, not just as an entertainer but just as a person and as a man."
Story_ID: 289334
Speaker 1: Give us a description of this picture?
Speaker 2: That's my second oldest brother.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Lavelle [Gooden].
Speaker 1: How do you spell Lavelle?
Speaker 2: Heck if I know, V-A-L-L-E [sic.], yeah something like that.

Speaker 2: That was me and we was looking out the window in Chicago on 87th Street.  A friend of mine took those pictures, they were talking about me doing some modeling and I didn't know whether I wanted to do that too much.
Speaker 1: Now, there was, is a rumor that you looked like Fred Williamson?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they said that, you know I met Fred in California, but if you saw.  If you saw me and him together you would say no, no we don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, they were saying that, now I heard somebody say that.
Speaker 2: Now that's my wife and the little bitty one there that's--her name is Gloria, the next one to her that's Gina, and the one to the far that's Sandra [Gooden Hudgins], all of my girls.
