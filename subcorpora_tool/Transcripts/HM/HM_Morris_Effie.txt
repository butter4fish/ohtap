Story_ID: 326686
Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to follow--have a few little warm-up questions that require just a short answer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.

Speaker 2: I can't, well, I'll say Paris [France].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  "It is only with the heart that one sees rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye," which is a phrase from 'The Little Prince' by Antoine Exupery [Antoine de Saint-Exupery], and I use it very often in speeches.
Story_ID: 326687
Speaker 1: Okay, now we're going to talk a little bit about your family background, okay.  Could you please tell me about your mother?  What was her name and could you spell her name for us?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Erma Caskie Morris, actually she was Erma Lee Caskie Morris and it's E-R-M-A, capital L-E-E, capital C-A-S-K-I-E, capital M-O-R-R-I-S, and she taught, as they did in those days when you got married, you quit teaching and stayed home so she stayed home with my sister [Mary Morris Pettiford] and me.
Speaker 1: Okay, could you tell me when she was born?
Speaker 2: I can't tell you exactly.  She died in 1992 and my sister and I have been trying for sure because she always said, never give her age, southern lady, and she said, "If you've got to, take the youngest age you find on the insurance policies," but we've been working at it using her graduation and so forth and we think she was about 104.
Speaker 1: Wonderful (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Aunt Effie [Effie Caskie] died this past March and she was 104.  We can definitely say that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Long livers.  How would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: She taught, so at ninety-nine she could still, you know, do the dances with the kindergarten.  She--very long heritage, very popular, very pretty when she was young.  She, very outgoing, very outgoing.  We used to tease her and say, if there were two parties in Richmond [Virginia], the only reason mother wasn't at one party was 'cause she was at the other.  And so, she was very enthusiastic.  She enjoyed, enjoyed life.  She loved to read.  When we were little, she had been trained in elocution as people of her generation were and she would recite, by the shores of Gitche Gumee, 'The Song of Hiawatha' [Henry Wadsworth Longfellow], and 'Thanatopsis' [William Cullen Bryant] to put us to sleep and at night.  And so we started with the literary interest and background and she, she just reached out to people wherever and was--a word I'd really use for her, she was charming and was it Barrett who said, Barrie [J.M. Barrie] who said, "If you have charm, you don't need anything else," and she was kind of one of those people, she really was.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories with you about her growing up when she was young?  Things that happened to her?
Speaker 2: Yes, one in particular I remember (cough).  When she first began to teach, she taught a first grade and her salary was $19 a month and she loved bananas.  So when she got that first check, she went out and spent it all on bananas (laughter).  So she still loved bananas all of her life but she really had a lot of them at that time.  That's one of the things she told us.
Speaker 1: What was her first job?  Did she tell you?
Speaker 2: Teaching.
Speaker 1: Where?
Speaker 2: Richmond.
Speaker 1: In Richmond.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  I don't remember the name of the school but definitely Richmond, Virginia.
Story_ID: 326688
Speaker 1: Okay, what could you tell us about your father?  Could you tell us his name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Yes, I certainly will, and I'm going to pull out slave papers to show you.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: William Hamilton Morris, W-I-L-L-I-A-M, capital H-A-M-I-L-T-O-N, capital M-O-R-R-I-S.  He was perhaps, three or four years older than mother [Erma Caskie Morris], but when he died, he was sixty-six, I remember that.  He was born in Portsmouth [Virginia], or Norfolk, Virginia.  I'm not awfully clear, but they're right across the river from one another, so it doesn't particularly matter.  As a little boy, for some reason, if I could find the picture, he was sent north to school and he went to school in Connecticut, and I don't know why he had, he was the oldest brother.  He had a younger--a middle brother [Samuel S. Morris] and a younger brother [Merritt Morris (ph.)] but he was sent there.  He, when he came back, and as we know him as an adult, he was an entrepreneur.  He ran what was called Morris' Cafeteria, which was the meeting place, it was on Second Street [Richmond, Virginia] and the literary clubs met there in the afternoon and that sort of thing, and I think there's some pictures that I can show you about those.  And he--it was also, rather a hotel, because remember this is under segregation, and he, that's where mother--he and mother lived for a year.  I was born there, and then we moved to 129 West Jackson [Street] and that was where we lived until we left Richmond [Virginia].  Then the Depression [Great Depression] comes along and he goes back on the railroad and he is the executive, what were they called?  He was the executive chef and in charge of the private railroad car that belonged to Frank Whittaker [Frank M. Whittaker] who was a CEO of Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad [Chesapeake and Ohio Railway] and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad moved its headquarters from Richmond, Virginia to Cleveland [Ohio], and that's how we grew up in Cleveland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was there he, as I said, he was sixty-six when he died and he didn't have a chance to retire, he died, and then mother went back to teaching.  She taught in the Cleveland schools.
Story_ID: 326689
Speaker 1: Did he [Morris' father, William Morris] ever tell you any stories about his growing up when he was young?
Speaker 2: Now I'm not the one to really ask.  We should have my sister sitting beside me, because Mary [Mary Morris Pettiford] remembers a lot more things than I do.  I, as I said, I remember about his going away to school when he was small and he assumed real responsibility for his brothers.  His brother, Samuel Solomon Morris [Samuel S. Morris], with--the middle brother, became an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] minister and was the head of the Christian education for the A.M.E. church.  Merritt [Merritt Morris (ph.)] was younger and went into the [U.S.] Navy and retired from the Navy and died very shortly afterwards.  So I don't remember much about, of him.  We're a very small family as I said.  Uncle Sam had children and I can talk about them but, because Uncle Sam's children were William [ph.], Sam [ph.] and, who's the third one?  William, Sam, I don't--one more, I'll think of his name in a moment.  William lived (cough), William was a graduate of Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and was an engineer with RCA [Radio Corporation of America] so he lived his life out in Rich--in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Samuel was Wilberforce and Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and became a bishop of the Third District [sic. Fourth Episcopal District] of the A.M.E. church.  He was bishop when he died.  When did he die?  He died before Len [ph.] and mother [Erma Caskie Morris] and so forth, and he died.  Now, who was the third?  No, that's his son.  I guess he only had two sons, but I'm not being awfully clear about that and I wish I were.
Speaker 1: No, it's wonderful.
Speaker 2: But, there are the two of them and I did mean to talk about mother's sisters and so forth and whenever you want to get to that and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, we'll talk to--
Speaker 2: --if, when you want to get back generations before that, I will pull a daguerreotype and, yeah, I actually have a daguerreotype (laughter) of my grandfather sitting on his mother's lap.
Story_ID: 326690
Speaker 1: Could you tell us about your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll have to pull the papers.  On my mother's [Erma Caskie Morris] side, my grandfather was Robert A. Caskie [ph.], a charming musician, more or less, I don't know.  He was, its--his mother, Delia [Delia Ellen Johnson], whom I have pictures of and I will show you, this daguerreotype, he married Aunt Delia [Delia Caskie (ph.)].  His, his wife's name was Delia, too, and that meant that his children, Aunt Delia, was the first child and everybody in Richmond [Virginia] taught.  She taught and married and had two children, Charlotte [ph.], who was beautiful.  Charlotte looked like Myrna Loy.  You could put the pictures side by side, and she taught. And then William [ph.], her brother, who was just a year older than (unclear) was more or less an entrepreneur, he was in small business in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And so there are those two who are cousins on that side, and Aunt Effie [Effie Caskie], who was the youngest sister, lived in New York [New York], we visited her and all that sort of thing.  Had wonderful times in New York.  Now, I, I forget the name that quickly, next door to her lived the man who went to the North Pole with--what was his name, Matt (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) With Matthew--
Speaker 2: --Matthew--
Speaker 1: --Currie?
Speaker 2: Matthew, yeah, something--
Speaker 1: Henson [Matthew Henson].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Henson, that's right, and they all lived in the Rockefeller, no, Paul Laurence Dunbar homes [Dunbar Apartments, New York, New York].  You know, those were big things at that time and he was still alive so he lived in there.  And so it meant that, you know, you just sort of knew the, we would go to visit Aunt Effie and you'd walk the down the street and you'd see all these people, you'd say, "Hi" to Countee Cullen, and you would know Harold Jackman and, oh, I just knew so many people from growing up there then because the community was much smaller, so everybody knew everybody else and it was really a wonderful time and that's generational, really generational 'cause you couldn't do it at all but, anymore, but--
Speaker 1: You mentioned your aunt, excuse me, you mentioned your Aunt Effie.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there any connection between your two names?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was named for her.  Her name is Effie Louise, and she lived with us.  She was the youngest sister.  She lived with my mother when I was born, and so they named me Effie Lee [HistoryMaker Effie Lee Morris], which is Effie for her, and Lee for my mother, and she said, since she was kind of pudgy, "Call her Effie Lee, there'll be no big Effie or little Effie around here," (laughter).  And so, that's why I really insist on the double name.
Story_ID: 326691
Speaker 1: Do you have any memories?  You mentioned that there were a lot of famous people in your neighborhood.  Do you have any memories of them, aside from just saying hello?
Speaker 2: Well, Ida Cullen Cooper, who was Countee Cullen's widow, I remember her and she, because she was a friend of Aunt Effie's [Effie Caskie].  I don't really remember people too much then because there were people and I didn't really identify with them in terms of their being important.  We were all important.  I just heard Price Cobbs [HistoryMaker Dr. Price Cobbs] say the other day on television on CNN, he has a new book, 'My American Life' ['My American Life: From Rage to Entitlement,' Price M. Cobbs, M.D.] and he said, and I'm older than he, I would be in his parents' generation, but he said, when he was growing up, you weren't elite, you weren't special, you were, all the working class, everybody had aspirations and that's what made the difference.  It was just that you all knew one another and you aspired, so, which is quite different from today which is of a concern because you talked about the materialism and the lack of knowledge.  I once had a little secretary who went south for the first time in her life and she, we were talking to her and trying to tell her which my, then comments when she went to the South.  "I wouldn't take any of that.  I," and she went on and on and, "Oh, how my father stood it."  I said, "Because he did.  You are here today because you might not have been if anything had happened to him."  So our young people really don't know what life was like then (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Story_ID: 326692
Speaker 1: You mentioned you have slave papers.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Are they in your family?
Speaker 2: Yes, they're--
Speaker 1: Can I help you?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  Here we go.
Speaker 1: Oh my.
Speaker 2: I really should take better care of them but--
Speaker 1: Who are they for?
Speaker 2: They are for--
Speaker 1: My heavens.
Speaker 2: Henrico County [Virginia].
Speaker 1: We'll take a picture of them later.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh my heavens.
Speaker 2: This is from Margaret Johnson who was, let me see, Margaret Johnson, Mary Elizabeth Johnson, this is my [maternal] grandfather's grandmother's [sic. Morris' maternal great-grandmother] name, yeah, Delia Ellen Johnson, Delia Ellen, Margaret must have been the sister.  Now at this point, then we should have my cousin Billy [ph.] here because Billy knows the history of the family.  Aunt Delia died before we could really get it all recorded but anyways, that's those--
Speaker 1: These are amazing.
Speaker 2: --and, there, that's the, one of the daguerreotypes with my grandfather [Robert A. Caskie (ph.)] and his mother.
Speaker 1: Oh, my, and was, were, was she a former slave and--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, my, that's so wonderful.  You are so fortunate.
Speaker 2: Yeah, really to have that and let's see what this one is.  I don't know if we've--
Speaker 1: Oh, we could do it later.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) two years, I can't quite see who that is, but this is another one, those are older ones, and--
Speaker 1: Oh, my (laughter).
Speaker 2: This was my father's [William Morris] card case.
Speaker 1: Oh, with his card, his business card.  Oh--
Speaker 2: And I'm not sure--
Speaker 1: How wonderful.
Speaker 2: They should really be preserved and we haven't done it and my sister [Mary Morris Pettiford] and I differ as to who gets what and where things go and I think they ought to go, yes, now you can barely see this one.  See, that's another one of those, can you see her?
Speaker 1: Now, I think, maybe after we get done with this--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --we'll put, because he [Scott Stearns] has stands and he knows how to take the best--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Nothing in there that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was that?  That looks like a cigar case or a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, the papers were in this and I have taken them out and let me see--
Speaker 1: My heavens, you are so fortunate to have all of this history.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm amazed that we have it.  I think we even have more than this because Aunt Delia [Delia Caskie (ph.)] was the historian of the family.  So Billy should have, now, yeah, this is my grandfather and I'm trying to see whether it's mother [Erma Caskie Morris] or not, but that's another one of those little things that you can barely see.
Story_ID: 326693
Speaker 1: You mentioned you have a sister.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us about your sister?
Speaker 2: My sister is Mary Louise Morris Pettiford, M-A-R-Y, L-O-U-I-S-E, P-E-T--Morris, M-O-R-R-I-S, P-E-T-T-I-F-O-R-D.  She is now a widow and in Richmond, Virginia and she has two sons, one [Robert "Bob" Pettiford] of whom was in the [U.S.] Navy and one [Charles "Chuck" Pettiford] was in the [U.S.] Army and they are both married and have children and one is in Indianapolis [Indiana] with his family and the other's in Virginia Beach [Virginia], with his family and both of them work hard for a living.  Chuck is a Brink's [The Brink's Company; Brink's Incorporated] driver, something like that, and the other, both retired from the [U.S.] military service and so, and Bob is in security in Newport Beach [Virginia], or in Virginia Beach or something, all of these are kind of new things that they've all gotten involved in. And Mary, Mary herself was very fortunate.  She was the administrative assistant to the chief of the Department of Gastroenterology [Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology] at the University of Virginia medical school [University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia] and she was, well she had had other positions along with--because she followed her husband [John Pettiford] who was in the Navy, too, and they lived in Great Lakes [Naval Station Great Lakes, Lake County, Illinois] and they lived in, oh gee, what's--they lived in North Carolina.  What's the big [U.S.] Marine Corps, Marine base [Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Jacksonville, North Carolina] in North Carolina?  I don't know.  I don't remember now.  Oh, gee, you can forget all these things.  I remember the airports and so forth more, almost more than that, North Carolina, because I remember going from the airport to their home, and North Carolina has all those stands of trees, those beautiful, beautiful stands of trees, and so she lived there.  She is alone and in Richmond [Virginia] now.  She is two years younger than I and we talk almost daily, you know, just keeping in touch because she's alone, so am I alone, and then we talk about various things.  As I said, Aunt Effie [Effie Caskie] died in March, she was the last of that generation and William [ph.] died about two years ago.  He was a racetrack aficionado.  They would always go to Indianapolis derby and he and his wife were on the Pennsylvania Turnpike and it was a single car accident and he, the seatbelt wrapped around his neck when they crashed and although that particular portion of the Turnpike is very heavily patrolled because they have so many accidents right there and the highway patrol got to them immediately, but it was too late.  When they cut the belt from around his neck, he was gone.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, now that's our family.
Speaker 1: It's a wonderful, distinguished family (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean it's all (laughter).
Speaker 1: You're very, very fortunate.
Story_ID: 326694
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well there are two things, you see, because I was born in Richmond [Virginia] and lived in Richmond long enough to go to elementary school, and I was a reader and, of course, all of us were readers, all of our friends, everybody read but there was no library that we could go to and the Double O [ph.], which was a community center, had discarded books from the main library in it, and our parents [Erma Caskie Morris and William Morris] would not let us handle or touch those books.  So we--
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: They were discarded and dirty, pride for one thing, and under no circumstances were you to handle anything that had been discarded.  And for our young people today, if anybody wants to know how people really react to that in fiction, Mildred Taylor's book, 'Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry' [Mildred D. Taylor].  Remember the little boy and the textbooks, and he would not use the textbooks, well our parents were like that and so they gave us books for every holiday, every birthday, every occasion to get a gift, and then you, he traded them around.  And I remember my book house, the fairies, the volume that had the fairies in it was my favorite and Charlotte [ph.] always said she was an African princess.  We never knew where and how she really got the idea because at that time, Africa only had savages in it, not her, she was a princess and, of course, we were all part of her court, but nobody was savage in her thinking.  So, those were some of the games we played.  I remember another thing.  I don't know, maybe people in the South remember, too, when they would tar the streets and they rolled down and, roll these--pour the tar and then this big, oh, big flat thing would come along and roll over it and we would pinch off pieces of that tar and chew it.  I mean (laughter), I remember that and I don't know why, but we did.  And I remember the elementary school.  We had black teachers but a white principal and so, as I said, I was a reader and I just read everything and she would, Ms. Winston [ph.], I even remember her name because she let me read all the textbooks in the school, I was, by the time I was a first grader, you know, so, because I read all the time.  She just let me read and those were old days.  We had desks with inkwells.  Oh, I'm dating myself terribly (laughter), and I remember Thelma Payne [ph.], who sat in front of me and had a big long braid and one of the boys would try to catch her and dip that braid into the inkwell.  I don't know, just one of the things they did, but it was funny.
Speaker 1: Could you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so those are the kinds of things I remember.
Story_ID: 326695
Speaker 1: Could you describe your family life?
Speaker 2: We moved, as I said, to 129 West Jackson [Street, Richmond, Virginia], which was a home and mother [Erma Caskie Morris] was at home with the two of us.  You could play all day long.  Five o'clock came and you took a bath.  You had dinner and you sat on the steps and watched with no more playing, it was time to go to bed.  My sister [Mary Morris Pettiford] was a little rebel.  She would not sit and so I was constantly having to run down the street, calling, "Mommy, she's running away" and we would bring her back and we would sit on the steps.  It's funny the kinds of things that you think about.  That, 129 West Jackson, the street on the other side became the Lincoln Highway, which goes from New York to Florida, and, of course, we sat there and could watch the traffic go by and that was something I remember.  As I said, mother read to us, recited the poetry.  We were always pleased.  My father [William Morris] went hunting when he was with the railroad [Chesapeake and Ohio Railway] and he would bring rabbits back and we could not stand that.  How could you kill Peter Rabbit?  (Laughter) We would have a fit about that but, and that's pretty much impacted because 'Peter Rabbit' ['The Tale of Peter Rabbit,' Beatrix Potter] was my favorite book 'til I was about three.
Story_ID: 326397
Speaker 1: --You mentioned the street that you lived on.  Could you describe your block?  Tell us something about your neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Well, there was 127 West Jackson [Street, Richmond, Virginia] in which Henry Hucles [Henry B. Hucles] and his grandmother and his mother and father lived next door to us.  Those were twin houses and somewhere in all of these papers I've pictures of those houses, oh I know, it's the little one with the four of us with Charlotte [ph.] and William [ph.] and little me, in fact the little boy on the end.  You can see the houses and there were those.  Then there was a big house that had a porch on it and goodness, the Tiptons [ph.] lived there and they were a white couple who were still in this black neighborhood, and we used to go over there 'cause she was nice, Ms. Tipton was very nice to all of us.  And there were a couple of more houses, I don't remember.  There was an alley behind us in which some people lived and there were little boys there, and they were quite poor but they were the best behaved, most courteous, yes ma'am, no ma'am, and they were just wonderful children and we didn't play with them much because they were boys and we were little girls and so mother [Erma Caskie Morris] kept us home, but when the neighborhood came together, when all the children came together, they came together with us.  Bill Robinson [Bill "Bojangles" Robinson] grew up somewhere around there because the statue to him is at the head of the street, it's right up the street, in the middle of the street and it must be in Lincoln Highway and that would be about a block or so from us.
Speaker 1: Excuse me.  There's, there'll be some young children watching this.  Could you tell them who Bill Robinson is?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh Bill Robinson was the tap dancer.  He was a famous, famous tap dancer primarily remembered for dancing with Shirley Temple in 'The Little Colonel,' and he is the one who supposedly taught her to tap dance.  Now if you wonder who Shirley Temple was, she was a star at about three years old, and she had curls, which everybody talked about, the Shirley Temple curls, and she was a very bright little girl.  She learned all her lines.  She sang 'On The Good Ship Lollipop,' and she danced with Bill Robinson.  As I said, they tap danced.  She grew up and she still lives in the area.  She was at one time assigned to be the ambassador to Ghana and she comes to The Commonwealth Club [Richmond, Virginia] for their activities when it's something that really pleases her, but she's down the Peninsula [Virginia Peninsula] somewhere and, of course, she's not as active now because of age, but she was beloved, and it was during the period when Bill Robinson was the tap dancing butler, and those were plantation stories, and we all loved them because we loved him and we loved her and our consciousness of what that meant had not yet really reached us as children, nor was it much in society as an understanding of what the plantation life was like and what slavery was like.  This was entertainment, and so it didn't reach into the realities of living during that period.
Story_ID: 326398
Speaker 1: Yes, so he [Bill "Bojangles" Robinson] was there.  I can't quite, yes, I can think of other names.  Now, I don't quite remember them because when I was nine, we moved to Cleveland [Ohio], but Mrs. Maggie Laura Walker [sic. Maggie Lena Walker], who was the first woman to head a bank, yeah, Maggie Laura Walker bank [St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, Richmond, Virginia], it's very important and she headed that bank in Richmond [Virginia] and she had, Maggie, she's Maggie Laura, Maggie Lena [sic. Maggie Laura Walker] was her granddaughter who left and went to Chicago [Illinois] and became a doctor, but Armstead Walker [Armstead Walker, Jr.] was her--oh, and that reminds me of something else, too.  Armstead was her grandson [sic. husband].  Armstead and Freddie [ph.] were brothers and both our fathers were, oh, Armstead was Walker, crazy, oh, this is all in the same family and all these children are together.  Armstead, I remember, was the last birthday party I went to before we moved to Cleveland, but when we were little, because there were very few places you could go in Richmond, Mrs. Kersey [ph.] would take Warren [ph.] and Freddie, and mother [Erma Caskie Morris] would take Mary [Mary Morris Pettiford] and me and we had passes because our fathers were on the railroad [Chesapeake and Ohio Railway], and we would go to Washington [D.C.] on a Saturday and we got to vote as to where we wanted to go and the three of them always wanted to go to the zoo [National Zoological Park; Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, Washington, D.C.], which, I think, is one of the reasons I don't go near animals because we had to see the zoo so much and the fourth Saturday then, fourth month, we went to the museums and I am a museum buff.  I go to museums everywhere and really dig into museums.  I know how to go in back doors and things, oh, I really search out museums.  I love them and so that's another memory but that we did one Saturday every month, as long as we lived in Richmond.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: Because of the segregation in Richmond, we couldn't go to Patrick Henry's house.  We couldn't go look in the House of Delegates [Virginia House of Delegates, Richmond, Virginia], so we went to Washington and we saw the different things there.  And we had good friends, you know, the neighborhood is small so you, you know people when you get to Washington.  You get to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], and all.
Story_ID: 326399
Speaker 1: What was Richmond [Virginia] like in those days?
Speaker 2: Richmond is a southern city with real southern charm and real southern segregation.  My mother [Erma Caskie Morris] was very fair and my sister [Mary Morris Pettiford] and I about the same color complexion.  My father [William Morris] was brown-skinned so that we are browner than my mother, and when she would take us downtown, people would look at her and say, "Where'd you get those two little nigger girls?"  I remember that.  So that was a part of living in Richmond, and my mother with her feistiness would almost get us all killed because she did not take kindly to their remarks but, but Richmond was really quite an elegant town and black people knew one another.  You would hear about Oliver Hill [HistoryMaker Oliver W. Hill] and Spottswood [Spottswood William Robinson III], you know, the men who were--became the civil rights lawyers, they were from Richmond and so they were growing up so they sort of set the kind of feeling in the black community, which was a pretty tight community and we all--they all knew one another because we left when we were still children and did not go back for, well we went back but it, it was different, you know, and when I go back now, gee, Julia Thornton is my good friend and we have--but we knew one another as adults, you know.  The people I knew as children are no longer really in Richmond, except Francis Foster [Dr. Francis M. Foster, Sr.].  Now, Dr. Francis Foster is a retired dentist, but he is a historian.  If you want to know anything about anybody, he knows.  He knows lineage and I think I suggested his name.  I think he really should be interviewed.  Percy Sutton was here a couple of Sundays ago and spoke.  Now, and I went to and asked if he knew Francis Foster 'cause he, Percy had talked about his grandfather in all of Richmond.  He said, sure, how do you think I found out about my grandfather.  Francis had told him because Francis knows that much and that's his hobby.  He is, he's always being honored by the Library of Virginia [Richmond, Virginia] and so forth and, oh yes, he really knows the Virginians and knows what life is like, and so we all just grew up there, you know.  And thinking about it but the contrast was great when we moved to Cleveland [Ohio] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm sure.
Speaker 2: --and we saw that difference.
Story_ID: 326400
Speaker 1: You mentioned that your father [William Morris] had--you had passes on the railroad [Chesapeake and Ohio Railway] and you would go to D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  What was it like traveling on the trains at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Segregated car and you bought Coca-Cola in the bottles.  That's the best Coca-Cola in the world, and when they stopped putting it in the bottles, it changed, and I don't know but that was a part of the riding on the segregated car which was the car closest to the engine which was when the little ashes flew back, they flew into the car.  All the things you read about, you know, in terms--but it's funny now that I'm sitting talking with you, I read about all these things but now that I think about it, I experienced them (laughter), and never thought about it, you know, but yes, yes.  So it was a three-hour trip up on the train, and we had about three hours then in the city and then we'd take the train back again and three hours home.  So we got home, it was nighttime.  You carried your own sandwiches and things on, on the train but the Coca-Cola you could buy.  I remember that, and I remember those bottles.  Different, that Coca-Cola was wonderful in those days.  Oh, I'm sorry, I've got a, I had my hand across the microphone (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, that's okay.  When you got to D.C., what was D.C. like?
Speaker 2: Well, because it--Richmond [Virginia] was down where the South begins, but D.C., because it was federal, was not totally segregated.  Anything federal was not segregated so we could go to the zoo [National Zoological Park; Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, Washington, D.C.].  We went to the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.], that's why I'm a devotee of museums and, but it was segregated as far as school systems were concerned.  Miners Teachers College [sic. Miner Teachers College; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] was a college that trained the Negro teachers.  Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], Howard was there.  What else?  The Aunt Sadie [ph.] that I pointed out to you was the dean at Miners Teachers College, and so I remember U Street, and I guess U Street has had quite a history.  I'm not remembering clearly whether Aunt Sadie lived on U Street or whether U Street was a street that we knew in Washington, but it was the excitement of going and seeing the various things.  I loved the dioramas in the Smithsonian, and the Smithsonian at that time was what is the fairytale castle and Lindbergh's [Charles Lindbergh] plane hung down in the middle of it, but the dioramas were the Indian [Native American] tribes and they were life-size of figures and life-size tents and they had the various tribes in these dioramas all around in the museum, and they really made an impression on me, too.  Funny all these different things.  You know, I remember that very well.  At Washington, it's so impressive, you know.  It's so impressive and you just really are, well you're glad you belonged, even though you went back and got in a segregated car.  You didn't know that anything could ever be done about that kind of thing because when we came from Cleveland [Ohio], my father died in Cleveland and we took his body back to Richmond.  From Cleveland to Washington, we were not segregated and we saw his body, you know, the coffin on the flatbed outside the, outside the train, but from Washington to Richmond, we were segregated and they put his body, this was during World War II [WWII], 'cause there were soldiers on the train, a segregated baggage car.  Yeah, I remember that very well.
Story_ID: 326401
Speaker 1: Back to Richmond [Virginia] (laughter), and were you a member of a church?  Was the church important to your family life (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  Now I'm going to, because it's Bethel, it's Third Street, it's Third Street A.M.E. [Third Street Bethel A.M.E. Church, Richmond, Virginia], and when there was a new baptismal font, Mary [Mary Morris Pettiford] and I dedicated it.  I remember that from hearing it, you know.  Mother [Erma Caskie Morris] told all these things, I don't remember it but she did and I remember we used to have candlelight marches.  Now what that was, I don't know what it was for, but at any rate, all the children marched down the center aisle in the church and then around the sides and back up in the front, and we had candles, and we had lighted candles and we would march all the way and I was too close to Mary, and so I hit a part of her head (laughter), and I was beating on her head and put it out and of course she started to cry.  She didn't know what was going on and mother had a fit.  From then on, as we went and came down, she blew out the candles (laughter), and so then we didn't have any light as we walked and I was just being protective of my little sister but that happened, I remember.  She didn't get hurt, you know, it's just quick and out but she will remind me when she wants to be angry (laughter).
Story_ID: 326402
Speaker 1: Can you tell me, are there any sights or sounds or smells when you come in contact with them that remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh I suppose there were some deja vu things, but off the top of my head, when we would go back to visit Aunt Delia [Delia Caskie (ph.)], she would make us eat before we went to anybody else's house to lunch or dinner or anything.  I'm not sending you out of here hungry, and one of my favorite meals in the morning was lima beans and Duke's Mayonnaise and Noddy's [ph.] pound cake and sliced tomatoes.  I mean I remember those things and I remember we used to have to sit on the front steps before Sunday school and snap the beans, you know, get those ready.  It's funny I haven't thought about, but there was a lot in childhood, you know, and I remember reading.  We had the Winston clear-type classics.  I read 'Heidi' [Johanna Spyri] and 'Tales From Shakespeare' [Charles Lamb and Mary Lamb] and all of the books that were within those category and you see, we owned them because we couldn't go to the library but there was a big difference and, of course, when we went to Cleveland [Ohio].
Story_ID: 326403
Speaker 1: But now we're going to go to school, and you went to elementary school, you started in Richmond [Virginia].  Could you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: I went to the first, I went through the first through fourth grades in Richmond, but I skipped in there, so I was in the fourth grade at a young age because it was fourth grade when we went to Cleveland [Ohio].  I can see the room in my mind's eye.  I can't see my teacher.  You know, I told you the principal [Ms. Winston (ph.)] (unclear), and I don't know whether we had different teachers, first grade teachers, I can, I don't remember that.  I do have, I have collected all, papers from everywhere and I have papers in Virginia.  Mother [Erma Caskie Morris] kept everything so probably there's a report card there with teacher things on it.  I don't remember any particular incidents during that time.  No school plays or anything, which I remember from Cleveland, but not in Richmond particularly.  Just went to school.  It was less than a block, about a half block from home, so we could go, and we could go out on recess and there was a corner store, and we could buy those big fat pickles (laughter), and we would eat those pickles during our recess time and they used to come out of a great big barrel.  I've never seen or tasted pickles like that since.  I can't find them, but that was one of the things about the elementary school experience.  No, I don't remember anything else particular about it.
Speaker 1: And then you moved to Cleveland?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Why did you move to Cleveland?
Speaker 2: Because the headquarters of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad [Chesapeake and Ohio Railway] moved from Cleveland--Richmond, to Cleveland.  My father [William Morris] was with the vice president so we moved and we moved to 134th Street.  3296 East 134th Street.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the year?  The year?  Nineteen--
Speaker 2: In the '30s [1930s] probably.  Yeah, I kind of think the '30s [1930s] and we were the first African Americans on our street, which now I would say was a little United Nations.  Right across from us were Italians.  On the other side were Germans.  On that side were Jewish and up and down the street, there were more boys than girls so Dorothy Smith [ph.], who was of English heritage, and I were good friends because we were girls.  There were more little girls my sister's age.  Mrs.--Mary [Mary Morris Pettiford] could tell you her name, the German lady who lived next door in that family, she made root beer, and so we would have root beer.  Up the street was a vacant lot and that was (unclear) Fields [ph.], so she had boys who were about our age, I guess, or they were Mary's age, and Dorothy and I and the little Italian girl from across the street, would go on a picnic up to that vacant lot.  That was as far as we were allowed to go without supervision and next door, because they were Jewish, they would want the lights turned out and they would get, you know, ask the children, so we would go out, go over and turn the lights out for them on their Sabbath and the boys were so funny.  There were four boys, there was Seymour [ph.], Seymour was the baby, and he would let you play with him like he was a doll, but the boys taught us all to swear and I can still swear in Yiddish (laughter).  I thought it was so funny what they taught us.  Yeah, I'd swear too if I feel like it and tell you in Yiddish what they'd say.  Yep, that was one of their jokes.  They taught everybody and of course because it was in another language, you didn't know, so that was fun.
Story_ID: 326404
Speaker 1: So when you moved to Cleveland [Ohio], your neighborhood was very, very different--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --than what you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because as I said, we were the only African Americans on the street.
Speaker 1: Did you feel any prejudice or any ill feeling?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes and no.  Not so much on the street because people, yes, when we first moved there.  I don't know who it was, or which families objected.  When father [William Morris] got--brought out his pistol and said, dare you to come over, and that was the end of that.  And we made friends as children do, you know, we had friends on the street.  At school, Mary [Mary Morris Pettiford] and I were the first two African American children in Robert Fulton [Robert Fulton Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio], which, yeah, it must have been 1930, 'cause I think Robert Fulton was built in 1929.  It had everything that was important, good or recommended for schools.  The--we had the intercom and the principal would announce things on the intercom.  We had Friday morning music appreciation with Walter Damrosch and the Cleveland--Rudolph Ringwall, and all the Cleveland Symphony [sic. Cleveland Orchestra].  We had departmental in the third grade, which meant you went to an art teacher, you went to a music teacher, you went to a language arts teacher, you went to a science teacher, you marched around--your whole class, you went from place to place, classroom to classroom and then you had a homeroom teacher and you were in the homeroom.  Mary, as I said, was two years behind me and I was in the fourth grade and somewhere along in there I skipped 'cause I still can't do long division (laughter).  It was taught in one of the classes that I skipped.  There were incidents at school and mother [Erma Caskie Morris] was up there in a minute, and that was the end of that but as I showed you the picture of Rabbi Sanford Rosen who used to be in the temple [Peninsula Temple Beth El] down in San Mateo [California], he was in the sixth grade class, and I am in touch with some of the people from that class.  Esther Givitz still lives in Cleveland.  Esther Halpern became a professor at the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and lives in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and now she, oh, all, all of us are retired but Sanford and let me see, we, well that goes to the high school [John Adams High School, Cleveland, Ohio], but Esther and Evelyn and Sanford and I were all elementary school together and Sanford and I, I think I've given you one of the papers.  Sanford wrote the long story about us, and when we were in junior high school and Ms. Gaffney [ph.] was our teacher, and we were all in Ms. Gaffney's homeroom and she kept us together like a club, and we were all different ethnicities--ethnic backgrounds, and she kept us together.  We met when we finished junior high school, we went on to high school and we met, we continued to meet and she wrote her dissertation on us and I've always wondered why I haven't looked that up because she really wrote about all of us, what we had become, you know.  She had followed us from the time we were in her class.  I wonder why Sanford didn't look it up?  Huh.  I think I'll have to deal with that.  She must have been, I'm not sure though where she went to school, whether she was at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] or at Reserve [Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], but I guess I could track it down.  I just never have thought about it and as I said, he did write the article and I gave you a copy of that.  And so, in the elementary school, yes, mother was up there a great deal.
Story_ID: 326405
Speaker 1: The junior high school, we went to--I was in Ms. Gaffney's [ph.] homeroom and that was a major work group and for study hall, we met in the auditorium.  You sat on the first floor when you were seventh grade, and you sat in the balcony when you were in eighth grade but above the proscenium in that auditorium was, "Where there is no vision, the people perish" [Proverbs 29:18], and, you know, I've always remembered that, been very happy about that and now and then use it but it's, I can see it still right above. And we did lots of things there.  Now to show you, too, a different--the ninth grade always did a play for its graduation.  Well, I've forgotten what kind of play it was but there was no role for me, and Ms. Gaffney wrote introductions to the three acts, these long things, and I memorized them, and then I would introduce the act, and then my, my classmates were in the play and she did that so I would have a role in the play.  She was the only one, but she kept me included.
Speaker 2: She sounds like she was a good influence on you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was and when she was on, the various ones of us, we went to high school and they broke us up.  We were in different homerooms.
Speaker 2: What high school were you in?
Speaker 1: John Adams [John Adams High School, Cleveland, Ohio], which I hear has been, well they tore it down but it has just been rebuilt, I understand.  It was a wonderful high school, wonderful high school.  There were not very many of us in it and, but we had everything.  It was just an incredible high school.  Of course, the Cleveland [Ohio] public schools had an unusual reputation.  They were extremely good during those days.  Beginning in the, oh we began in the seventh, sixth, seventh grade, we went to the playhouse once a year and saw a Shakespearian play, so that by the time you had graduated from high school, you had seen six Shakespearian plays.  We went to the Karamu House [Cleveland, Ohio].  Now Karamu was the Jelliffes' [Russell Jelliffe and Rowena Jelliffe], the famous--well they were white and founded this theatre and we went there to see plays, because that was another important place.  We went to Nela Park [East Cleveland, Ohio], which was General Electric's big scientific place.  We went to the symphony, the Cleveland Symphony [sic. Cleveland Orchestra].  Everybody from third grade up went once a year to the Cleveland Symphony in Severance Hall [Cleveland, Ohio], everybody from third grade up.  You see, if you're a third grade, you're old enough to get on the streetcar and behave.  We went to the Cleveland Museum of Art [Cleveland, Ohio], but you had to be in the sixth grade to go in the catacombs, which are down in the basement of the Museum of Art.  They have lots of medieval knights.  The armor around, oh, it's a wonderful place, a wonderful museum and we would go there.  And what else did we do in high school?  Well, those were some of the main things that we did, and the library, of course.  We had two libraries in the school.  One was the literature library and the other was a general library.
Story_ID: 326696
Speaker 1: Proctor Institute [Samuel DeWitt Proctor Institute for Child Advocacy Ministry] at Children's Defense Fund, which is at Haley Farm, they bought the Alex Haley farm, it's in Clinton, Tennessee and there were all these community people there, about two hundred, but into religion, religious people, minister speaking, and then about two hundred of young college students who teach in the Freedom Schools and they were, Moss [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Otis Moss, Jr.] was there.  He was magnificent and if I could find my second tape, I certainly would give it to you--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to hear him talk about the hip hop and of course you know so many people in the religious group say, hip hop is evil but, yeah, and then when we go to these things, Jamake Hightower--not Hightower, Jamake Steptoe [sic. John Steptoe], has been trying for years, you know, to teach--(unclear) noise (unclear) I don't understand it.  Furthermore, I don't understand the pronunciation, it isn't clear, the enunciation is not clear enough to me and so, and then there's Jaime Hamilton [Jaime Levi Adoff], Virginia Hamilton's son and he is also a musician and with him it's fun and, you know, he's young and he's that age which I should ask you, do you know about the University of San Francisco's [University of San Francisco, San Francisco, California] symposium?  We, they have had, I think this'll be the ninth, in March and this year, I'm not sure what the focus will be.  Joyce Carol Thomas is going to be there on my recommendation, I'm going to introduce her, but last year we had Arnold and Jaime--Arnold Adoff and Jaime.  Jaime uses Hamilton, that's interesting, they don't use the father's name, and then who else was there?  The Dillons [Leo Dillon and Diane Dillon] have been out and, of course, Ashley.  Ashley is my beloved, Ashley Bryan is just wonderful.  Those were all these, his books are there and there are books and things behind over there that he's done and he was the reason we left Chicago [Illinois] and went to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] on a day trip because he had an exhibit in the Milwaukee Art Museum [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and that's that new museum, I can't remember who the artist is.  I want to say Coolhaus [ph.], but I don't think that's right but it's the one where the wings come down and the wings go up on times, I think.  So at any rate, that came from there and that's why I went because Ashley was there.  And Ashley has done the book plate which is in, well, let me see, I can't see anything, right there, which is the--I keep (laughter), I don't blame you.
Speaker 2: No, no, this is wonderful--
Speaker 1: But I think really you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and for the people who don't understand--
Story_ID: 326697
Speaker 1: You've been talking about how you just keep learning and you just keep meeting wonderful people and did this start back in, in your childhood?  What kind of a student were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Good.
Speaker 1: --always interested in (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I was a valedictorian, sure, and that's a very interesting thing.  I hope I sent you those papers.  If not, I've got to dig them up.  Esther Givitz, Sanford Row--no, Matt Machesky [ph.], Naomi Chapin [ph.] and I were valedictorian of our high school class [at John Adams High School, Cleveland, Ohio].  We graduated mid-year and there were about 270 of us, although there's huge classes in that school, and they carried our grade point average out five points, and we all had the same.  So they named the four of us graduate--valedictorians of the high school, of my high school class, yeah. And then I'm sure I sent them somewhere, I should have anyway.  And see we've had reunions.  I've been to the fiftieth and the sixtieth, and they said we probably wouldn't have any more after that.
Speaker 1: When you were in school, what were your dreams and your aspirations?  What did you want to do?
Speaker 2: Well, during the period in which I was in school, planning to go to college, there were three things black women did or, did.  You were a teacher, a social worker or a nurse.
Story_ID: 326698
Speaker 1: So we were talking about your dreams and aspirations, what you wanted to do in high school [John Adams High School, Cleveland, Ohio] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I was saying I came from a family of teachers but somehow I didn't want to teach but I wanted to be two things (laughter), really funny.  One, I wanted to be a psychiatric social worker.  Now where I got that in high school, in concept, or I wanted to be an international architect and, you know, those were not related and so, but I did.  I read, I kept journals.  I, so those were the things.  I was in a group, my high school group was still pretty much the same high school group, the same group that went over from middle school [Robert Fulton Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio].  We lived way out on 134th [Street], so the contacts we had as African--well, we were still colored, were in around 90th Street and around at a distance where we had, mother [Erma Caskie Morris] had to take us.  We belonged to a community center where Mrs. Saunders [ph.] taught us ballet and piano lessons and we had to go that distance and, of course, we had a circle of friends then that were there but for the high school, I continually had that same circle of friends, 'cause as I said, I know where Esther Givitz, she and I correspond and have visited one another.  And so, we've kept in good touch.  And so most of the Clevelanders, too, except we were all getting, growing older and many of them have passed away.  I'm really shocked every time Jean Branch [ph.] comes back she says, "Did you know so and so had passed away?"  Thedelma [ph.] and all, well Thedelma hasn't passed away but she has moved and the Boyds and--did you ever know Mary [Mary W. Boyd] and Bill Boyd [William F. Boyd], the three generations of funeral home [E.F. Boyd and Son, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio]?  Really very, you know, all of those people that we had grown up with, they were all, Mary was older 'cause she was along with Nancy and Nancy Phillips [ph.] (unclear), that's my, we were all Debs About Town.  That was our club when we were in high school.
Speaker 1: Debs About Town?
Speaker 2: Debs About Town and there was a chapter in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and--
Speaker 1: Could you explain what Debs About Town was?
Speaker 2: Well, you mean, we had good (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was it a national--
Speaker 2: --it's a social club.
Speaker 1: A social, was it a national group?
Speaker 2: No, well, not, there was a chapter in Pittsburgh.  I don't know where else.  There might have been other chapters.  I'm not remembering, but we were the group in Cleveland, and we were a pretty large size group, too, but I remember we were at Vivian Weaver's house on December 7th, 1941.  So, you know, you remember some things, you know, and, and I'm wondering how I could have been there when I should have been in school, but then I'm out, I can solve that later.
Story_ID: 326699
Speaker 1: Could you tell also those young people who are not sure, what happened on December 7th?
Speaker 2: That was Pearl Harbor, the day that the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor] in Hawaii, and we were going to war [World War II, WWII], and we heard it on the radio, no television in those days, but we heard it.
Speaker 1: How did that affect you?  How did--?
Speaker 2: Well, everybody was too stunned and we didn't know what it would mean, and so we went back to playing bridge.  We were in shock, but still what did it mean?  How was it going to affect us?  How was it going to affect the city?  And so, we went back to playing bridge and eating, thinking about, well we're in war.  What does this mean?  And, of course, we just had no concept of what it could mean and what it did mean and how it affected us and Cleveland [Ohio], surrounding Cleveland were steel mills, and so it definitely affected the community, very much so.  I'm trying to think of what else in Cleveland.  Railroads, all of that were, made quite an impact during the war (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause they were gearing up for the war effort.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right that was.
Story_ID: 326700
Speaker 1: And I know, but the high school [John Adams High School, Cleveland, Ohio], well the incident which was in stirring the waters about the swimming, you know, am I going to go to swim because Ann Shifrin [ph.] and some of my friends were going swimming and I wanted to go, too, and we were all freshmen and we had to have an exam by the doctor to say that we were certified, we could go swimming.  Now Cleveland, the schools, did not have pools within them, but the recreation department throughout the city had pool houses and, which were open to the community and the nearest one to us was in a Polish neighborhood and the gym teacher took us to the pool and we went.  You paid a penny for a cake of soap so you could shower before and after, and you would get in the pool and learn to swim.  We did that once.  The next week, the principal came to my homeroom, Ms. Herbert's homeroom.  Ms. Herbert's brother [Paul M. Herbert] later became the lieutenant governor of the State of Ohio, any rate, came to my homeroom and called me out on the side and told me that black people, colored girls, were not allowed to swim in that bath house and this being Cleveland, we hadn't encountered that sort of thing but there'd been things all along.  And so, he was very sorry but I could not go swimming.  Well, I burst into tears so they sent me down to the gym teacher's office to calm down and quiet and I was in the room where you lay down if you were not feeling well, and the doctor came in and the gym teacher, the head of the physical education department said to him what had gone on and she said, "Why did you give her a permission?  You know that they aren't supposed," he said, "Because I got tired of saying no."  And so it was just a doctor, the school doctor, who did that and I heard that.  I heard all of that and I went home, "Mother [Erma Caskie Morris]," right straight to the school the next day to find out what had happened.
Story_ID: 326701
Speaker 1: Well, it was of such major importance that she called Uncle John, and that's why I asked you about John Hubbard, who was councilman at that time and told him, well, you know, immediately he was onto it.  School superintendent, school principal, what is going on?  They all came out to John Adams [John Adams High School, Cleveland, Ohio] to see what was happening, and I was told to go swimming and it would be all right, I'd be protected.  Mrs. Lily Mason and Mrs. Clayborne George, Mrs. Clayborne George was wife of the, one of the three members of the Civil Service Commission, and they were both huge women.  If they jumped in the pool, they would have displaced water, but with them there, you felt very comfortable and safe, and they were there.  And when I got there and I, so, I was given the soap and went through and the, they, the recreation department people had been out to see what was this that I couldn't swim there, and it was a big thing going on.  There were police outside and here we'd go in along with my high school friends going in, and Mrs. George, "Get in that water, girl, put your--learn to swim."  I wouldn't put my face--I can't swim to this day (laughter), 'cause I wouldn't put my face in that water and not be able to see what was going on, and I came out and the investigation revealed that it was the woman who was the clerk who sold the soap who told them that I couldn't swim.  So, for the next sixteen weeks, I went to that bath house with police escorts sitting outside and the gym teacher crying every time we went, 'cause she didn't know, you know.  She was, well I was just a student, she took me along with everybody else, and Mrs. Mason and Mrs. George, whatever they were doing, they gave up and they were there every Tuesday afternoon, sitting on the side of that pool.  And so, sixteen weeks went by and I got out of there without ever learning to swim.  It was a year before another black girl went but, oh, it made the papers and they say a thirteen year old adult, they don't say my name but the whole thing was written up.
Speaker 2: How did that make you feel?
Speaker 1: I was just curious really.  I was accustomed to mother [Erma Caskie Morris] battling for rights, and I had as much right to go as any of the other students did, and they were very protective of me.  It was very interesting because they didn't understand what was going on and--but, however, if it was going on with me, they weren't going to let anything or anybody hurt me, so I felt very comfortable.  I was uncomfortable with the police, very uncomfortable with them and one made some derogatory remarks, which I reported.  I guess he got sent to Siberia, I never saw him again (laughter), but, I mean, they were the regular ones every Tuesday.  So that the incidents and the things that occurred to me because of racial situations, were resolved in ways that were most satisfactory.

Speaker 1: There was another major one.  I was on the high school paper and John Adams [John Adams High School, Cleveland, Ohio] always won all the awards for the state, they're working on the elevator, and so when it came time, everything was submitted and we were going to go to Columbus [Ohio], to Ohio State [The Ohio State University] to, the weekend, when these awards would be given, and I wanted to go and we were going to stay in the dormitory and Ohio State sent back word: no colored girl in the dormitory.  And so, I went home, told mother [Erma Caskie Morris] and we got on the phone, and Mrs. Banks [ph.] had moved down to Columbus so Ruth [Ruth Banks (ph.)] could go to Ohio State.  Of course, come on.  So mother and I went down and Ms. Evans, Verda Evans was the journalism teacher.  We got every award and she'd say, "Go get it, Effie Lee [HistoryMaker Effie Lee Morris]," and I'd go up to the stage representing John Adams.  Everything, (laughter) when it came to the sports page, John Evans started crying, "She's not on my sport page, (unclear) go get my own award."  Ms. Evans said, "Effie Lee, go get that award."  So they made a point.  They made a very definite point.  So I've been very fortunate into having contact with people like that throughout my life.  That was really funny, but we went in Columbus, you know, mother and I and mother walked through, we were going in the dime store, I don't know how we had time to do some of these things, but we went in the dime store and they were handing out flyers.  They handed her one, not me, you know, following right behind her, no, but very interesting.  And so, then as I said, at graduation, it came along and the four of us graduated together and have kept in contact all these years.  Miss--kept in contact with Ms. Herbert for years, of course she passed away, and with Ms. Gaffney [ph.] for years until she passed away, too.
Speaker 2: When you were in high school, how did you spend your leisure time when you weren't studying?
Speaker 1: Well, I read a lot but, and we were pretty far from the black community.  As I said, mother had to take us.  So I read.  Dorothy Smith and I were good friends.  I played library and, you know, all the kids could come borrow the books I owned, too, but for the most part we were friendly with the people on the street and so there wasn't that much time.  You know, it gets very dark very early in Cleveland [Ohio] during the wintertime, so you weren't out on the street at all.  We belonged, now what did we belong to 'cause what was that Sylvia [Sylvia Lawrence] and I were in?  We were in some kinds of social clubs.  I don't remember what now but we were and so, of course, we had to go to meetings but it was always the case of mother having to take us out for a long time, because even though I went to high school and we went on the buses and so forth alone, wondering around in the city was not acceptable, although there wasn't anything particular happening, you know, people just ignored you, but it took a long time using public transportation, and certainly nothing that was after dark.
Story_ID: 326703
Speaker 1: --When you were growing up, who would you say were people who influenced you the most?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, mother [Erma Caskie Morris] was a big factor.  Friends of hers were.  At school [John Adams High School, Cleveland, Ohio] there were--Ms. McCann [ph.] was the counselor.  I remember, gee it was funny things you remember.  She was a graduate of Rice University [Houston, Texas] in Texas and, Anna Marie Callow.  Now Anna Marie lived in, I don't know, she lived way out on the other side but when I came to school, she said, "This is my little sister and I want her to do everything that I have done," and she was a twelfth grader.  She was a big woman on campus and she was leaving and there were very few, as I said, colored children in the school.  And so, she introduced me into various clubs and things within the school.  I mean, she graduated but we kept in touch and so things were done.  I was there with, I worked in the office with Ms. McCann, and my high school yearbook is over there with pictures, you know, of the various things we were in, the various clubs.  I was not athletic, so I was into the more intellectual things that went on.  And that was pretty much it.  With friends, I went to camp one summer which was the YW [Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA)] camp, Mary Ells camp [Mary Ells Vacation Farm, Madison, Ohio], and I went one summer to that.  I, and I took the Girl Scout trainings.  I was a Girl Scout [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] leader for a brief time.  So things like that, you know, just, and as I said, friends and so, and we would go to one another's homes.  We did, let me see, Edwina Lawrence [ph.] lived way out and Sylvia [Sylvia Lawrence], who was a Lawrence, but they were not related, Sylvia and I would go out and we would spend the weekend with Edwina.  We were all about the same age and, because she lived out in East Cleveland [Ohio] I think, and they were the only African Americans out there so her mother always encouraged people to come because Edwina was so alone.
Story_ID: 326704
Speaker 1: Then, Bama [ph.], Bama was Mrs. Banks [ph.].  I've mentioned her in terms of our going to Columbus [Ohio] and staying with her and we needed, when I needed to.  Bama was a housekeeper for the Rockefellers.  There were Rockefellers in Cleveland [Ohio], and she was one of the housekeepers.  They were very good to her.  When they'd get a new set of china, Bama got the old set.  Well, she lived way out in Collinwood [Cleveland, Ohio] and with her were her grandchildren, Helen [ph.] and Loretta [ph.] and Kenneth [ph.] and Ruth [ph.], and on the weekends, because she was way out there, too, you'd go to visit Bama and the--her grandchildren.  Loretta was a little bit older, Kenneth, Ruth, and Ruth was older, and I was, too, but we were all there, and Bama taught manners, and she set those tables like she set them for the Rockefellers and you had foie gras and I remember asking for more foie gras and then somebody said, "Oh, you like chicken liver?"  Ah, and I nearly died (laughter).  Is that what I was eating?  Never, I've never touched it since but she was a stickler for manners and all, and she did that.  She trained all of her friends' children as well as her own.  You obeyed Bama, and if you weren't sure, you'd stop and think, not which mother said, but what did Bama say, and then you'd follow and of course, you know, things were similar, but that was also a very interesting experience.  And Cleveland was a city that had one-tenth, one-tenth of the population was Afri- was colored.  So they had one, there was one colored on the school board, there was one colored city councilman, there was one colored on the Civil Service board [Civil Service Commission], wherever in city government, there were appointments, there was one African American, colored, Negro, whatever.  So it made for a very interesting experience and Cleveland was the Western Reserve of Connecticut [Connecticut Western Reserve].  Now in Connecticut, the settlers were burned out by terrible forest fires, so they came to the Western Reserve as part of, of America, you know, growing up and settling.  And so Cleveland was part and around us and that's why you have Case Western Reserve University [Cleveland, Ohio] and around us was Hudson [Ohio] and all the different suburbs that were around.  There was an amusement park, no blacks were not allowed but, and that was when the, but I don't think, well we thought, well, you don't want us, we don't want you either.  I mean, that was it because the attitude was always, nobody's any better than you are but you've got to be twice as good to make them aware of it.  So that was what came from mother [Erma Caskie Morris].  So that was high school [John Adams High School, Cleveland, Ohio] pretty much.
Speaker 2: So after you left high school, what happened?  What did you do?  Did you want to go to college (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I graduated mid-year, so I had wanted to go to Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio] and took the scholarship exam, came in second so which meant no Oberlin.
Story_ID: 326705
Speaker 1: I wanted to go to Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], and as I said, came in second so, you know, money, and so I didn't go there.  So then I was going to go to University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], which I wanted to, and Ms. McCann [ph.] and Ms. Herbert called me back to John Adams [John Adams High School, Cleveland, Ohio] and said, "There's a scholarship for the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and we would like to recommend you."  So, I went to the University of Chicago as a freshman, in freshman, and then there is, the life there.  I lived in the Frank Lloyd Wright house, because Chicago [Illinois] had no dormitory facilities for colored girls.  They were into France and Maurice Baptiste [Maurice Evans Baptiste] had just moved into the dormitory.  They were ahead by a year, but they were the first two African Americans to go in the dorm, and they still had no place for girls.  Aunt Sadie's [ph.] brother, you know, I told you my godmother in Washington [D.C.], Charlie Daniel [ph.] was there in the Theological Seminary [Chicago Theological Seminary, Chicago, Illinois] and the theological seminary owned the Frank Lloyd Wright house, which it used as a dormitory.  It had room for two, four, six, and there was a black woman in one room.  They were all graduate students, and I was a freshman, but they let me have that other bed and that, one of the seminal times of my life, there's more about Frank Lloyd Wright.  I met him eventually, and we talked about the house and I've bought everything, there are loads of things over there about Frank Lloyd Wright and the Robie House [Frederick C. Robie House, Chicago, Illinois] and there's a new children's book which is called, 'The Wright 3' [Blue Balliett], and they did not know that I had lived in the house.  Well, Blue Balliett, I think, is the author's name and Scholastic [Scholastic Corporation], publisher, they can't do enough because I lived in that house.  I think I keep getting advance reader copies and so I've got those.  I haven't finished the book, but that was an experience living there as a freshman.
Story_ID: 326416
Speaker 1: When we ended, you went, you were in University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you were living in the Frank Lloyd Wright house?
Speaker 2: The Robie House [Frederick C. Robie House, Chicago, Illinois] on campus.
Speaker 1: The Robie House, and you have a scarf on that is very important, has something to do with that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, my scarf, I have the three of them.  Interestingly, these scarves are the, are the de Young museum, the Fine Arts Museums in San Francisco [Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, San Francisco, California], hold the franchise on these scarves, and they haven't had any for a while, but I lived in that house, and loved that house.  Did I tell you that I shared with Jessie Sherrard [ph.], who was the, she was a graduate student in the Chicago Theological Seminary [Chicago, Illinois], and every day we had to straighten up our rooms.  Of course we had maid service, but we had to keep our rooms very straight because the house was always on view, and they were taking people on tour, and Bertrand Russell came through while I lived there (laughter).  I didn't see him but he was there.
Speaker 1: Oh, he did?
Speaker 2: He walked all through the house and that house was, that was a seminal thing in my life.  The dining room was a communal dining room for the students and, from the Theological Seminary, and so I got to know them very well.  The cook was just superb.  She'd call up at night and said, "Don't you want some milk and cookies?" And I'd go down and sit and talk to her because she made these wonderful Danish cookies that had the prunes inside.  Oh, boy, I was down there in a minute (laughter), and Jessie was so accommodating.  So people were very nice to me during that experience.  And also, on the university campus, I, in the various courses and so forth, I really had interesting experiences on that campus, and I was there for three years.  Oh, the first year when I was there, we were freshmen 'cause 'Native Son' [Richard Wright] was published, and you know that's Chicago [Illinois], and the impact was felt on that campus, oh yes we felt it.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year that was?  Could you tell us?
Speaker 2: It must have been '41 [1941], '42 [1942], '41 [1941], maybe.  Oh, yeah, we really felt that impact.  People looked very differently and the Af- colored servants on the North Side were getting fired.  It was, that was really a reaction to 'Native Son,' yeah.  The literary reaction was that it was a wonderful, great story, but the realistic reaction was people reacted to having black people.  Well, I've been black, colored, Negro and so forth, and I think we were colored at the time, colored or Negro, and they did not want any more personnel.  And we all had a boyfriend (laughter), you know, from--and there were seven of us in the freshmen class, but everything stopped with that.  It was just the end.  It was fascinating.
Story_ID: 326417
Speaker 1: I was there [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] a couple more years, and then I went back, went to Case Western Reserve, which was Western Reserve [Western Reserve University], Flora Stone Mather [Flora Stone Mather College for Women; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio] then, and I graduated from there and--
Speaker 2: I see. Is that where you got your degrees in library science?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I graduated with a bachelor of arts, bachelor of library science, master of library science, so the three degrees are from there.  Reserve is, being in Cleveland [Ohio], and that was home and (cough) down the street was a family who had two beautiful, wonderful little boys, and Bobby [ph.] was the older, he was five.  During the summer, the Cleveland public schools had for--taught foreign languages on the Reserve campus, and so every day I took Robert with me while I was going to school during the summer courses, and he learned, he learned French and I--then his mother would pick him up at noon 'cause I had to stay longer and that sort of thing but that is a comment on the university--on the Cleveland school system and on university, because I was a joint, joint arrangement, and they had children from five years old up from all over the area during the summer, learning foreign languages.
Speaker 2: When you were at, excuse me, when you were at Case Western, you were studying library science.  Could you tell us a little, maybe some of your courses?  How--were you the only black student in library sciences?
Speaker 1: No, let me see (cough) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was it like?
Speaker 1: Estelle Shorter [Estelle Shorter Holmes] was there.  I don't, I think Helen [ph.] went along ahead with, at least there were the two of us.  The library schools, wherever they are, are not very large so to have two of us was quite something.  I can show you the book, too.  Ms. Harriet Long [Harriet G. Long] was the, taught the courses that pertain to children, public library service to children's storytelling and children's literature, and so I read and I knew things so she was very supportive for me.  She wrote a book, I have the book and I will show you the dedication in the book where we're showing things because she wrote it in terms of an excellent children's library.  She really had an impact.
Story_ID: 326418
Speaker 1: The courses were really cataloguing and quite different from what you have now, of course.  We had cataloguing and classifications [at Flora Stone Mather College for Women, Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], which we used to say is like learning how to ride a bicycle.  Once you learned how to classify, you could fall off, but when you got back up, you knew how to do it again.  And, the literature, we had many courses in the literature.  Then the philosophy behind the library science, and quite in depth, all of that, and then, so I finished and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Excuse me, why did you become interested in children's literature?
Speaker 1: That was just natural.  I was always interested in children, in children's literature because I had, I didn't want to teach but wanted something that related to children.  I just kept on with the library and as I said, everybody had been, the family had been teachers and they were governed by the bell.  At the end of a class, you had the bell and the class had to move. With the library, we were just free, no time (laughter), we could do as we pleased, you know because the approach is different.  It is no teaching for the children or you, it is inspire, encourage, stimulate, develop curiosity: "Aren't you interested in horse, horses?  What, at your age, everybody's interested in horses.  Do you want to read 'Black Stallion' ['The Black Stallion,' Walter Farley]?  Do you want to read 'Black Beauty' [Anna Sewell]?  Can I find you a poem about a horse?"  That sort of thing, you know, and it's really, really fun and the children, the children are fascinating because you know instantly if they like you.  If they don't, they let you know it, too, and it's just a very interesting relationship, plus it means that you know a little bit about everything in the whole wide world, because some child's going to come and ask you. And I had a little boy, was about eight years old and he wanted books on brain surgery.  Why?  His father was a brain surgeon.  He wouldn't let him read his books, but he wanted to be a brain surgeon when he grew up.  Could I find him something?  Well, we found some books on people who had problems with their heads but (laughter), it satisfied him.  He was a good reader, you know, so, then he could be led to other things and, but all, I used to tell a children's librarian, you take that child the way he is when he crosses that doorstep.  If he is fifteen and wants to read 'The Cat in the Hat' [Dr. Seuss], you give it to him without any judgment.  He can be reading it to his little brother, or it can be self-sustaining in terms of the fact that it's a book that he has read all by himself, and that's the way it is.  You take that challenge, whatever they say, find out what it is they want and when they tell you, "No, I'm just looking," stand and make conversation until they finally tell you what they want and you, please, get it for them.  No pointing, get up out of that chair (laughter), take him to the shelves and find it.
Story_ID: 326419
Speaker 1: After you finished Case Western [Flora Stone Mather College for Women, Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], you got your first job at--?
Speaker 2: Cleveland Public Library [Cleveland, Ohio] and that was the philosophy of working.  You did everything for the children.  Another thing, though, Cleveland Public Library was such a fine library that we (laughter)--we could go through Case Western Reserve without using the Reserve libraries.  You simply went down to the main library, whatever department, whatever paper, political science, you might be writing a paper, you'd go into the department, and you tell the librarian what your topic was and you needed reference materials, and she'd say, "Fine, have a seat," and go find everything for you.  So, we were really spoiled in those days but that was what librarians were taught that you really look for what the patron wants--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --and you get it and find it.  You never let a patron go empty-handed.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's 1946, and you're working in the children's library in Cleveland Public Library.  Were there lots of books about African American children in the library for the--?
Speaker 2: Not a lot but there are some.  I think I sent you the little book list.  Negro History Week [Black History Month] was beginning by '46 [1946], I think it had begun.  Well, Cleveland [Ohio] had done nothing in the library particularly about Negro History Week.  And so I asked if I could have a program and if I could do something for Negro History Week and that's how that little book list of oh, maybe, about twenty-five or thirty books was developed, because those were the books we had about African, about Negro children.  When I first, I was a substitute for a while in the library and there's a book called 'Frawg' [Annie Vaughan Weaver], F-R-A-W-G, the worst stereotype, I don't want to--the worst pictures of any little African American boy, the worst dialect.  Well, people bought that with an innocence, and as I went from branch to branch on summer schedule, well it was just amazing how many children read and tore up that book, says I as I pitched it in the wastepaper basket and went onto the next branch (laughter).  I cleaned out lots of branches, let's say, and so 'Frawg' is probably non-existent.  I wish I had a copy now to show, you know, some, I do have copies of 'The Pickaninny Twins' [Lucy Fitch Perkins] and some of the other books of that period, but there weren't many. So they let me, the administration said, "Yes," and I'd have a program and I kind of forgotten who I had but, oh, I was at Woodland Branch [Cleveland Public Library, Cleveland, Ohio], and we had a big auditorium that held a lot of children.  So we had a big Negro History Week program, that was the first, and then the library got in the habit of celebrating and make taking note of that.  I read a great deal and every now and then I'd come across a book and Ms. Briggs [ph.], who was the children's coordinator, would say, "Well now, Ms. Morris [HistoryMaker Effie Lee Morris], you know people like that book."  "Yes, Ms. Briggs, but it's a 'Pickaninny' book, and I don't think we should have it," and she said, "Well, all right, you don't have to have it."  "Oh, if anybody else is going to have it, I'm going to have it, too.  I want my children to see what other people are reading about them."  "Well, then I think we better put this on the do not replace list."  "Thank you, Ms. Briggs."  And there was a lot of that, you know--
Speaker 1: Good for you.
Speaker 2: --oh yes, I did that all the time.
Speaker 1: There was a pamphlet, the Negro and children's books--
Speaker 2: That's the little one (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that you were talking about?
Speaker 2: That's Cleveland Public Library and I must say, they were quite supportive once it started but as I mentioned about Cleveland, that was a really open atmosphere.  It felt very different from the integrated situations we have now but it was, for the most part, it was pretty much integrated, and wherever you are, you have problems with being a person of color, so you accept it or fight it and my mother [Erma Caskie Morris] was a fighter.  She fought about everything.  She didn't let those things pass, so I inherited that but for others, you know, if I'm fighting for myself, it is so that whoever stands on my shoulders can go further than I did.
Story_ID: 326420
Speaker 1: You were there probably about eight years and then, 1954 or so, you went to Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I just went for a semester.  I went to fill in, and I taught the children's in school courses in the library school.  Virginia Lacy Jones was the dean, and the library school was one of two.  There was a library school at North Carolina Central [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] and at Atlanta, and the Atlanta one opened when the Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] school closed, because Virginia was a graduate of the Hampton school, and that was a wonderful experience living in Atlanta [Georgia]--
Speaker 1: What was that like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I was there in May 8th, 1954 and I lived in the dorm.  Phyllis Wallace [Phyllis A. Wallace] who, were she alive, you'd have her as a HistoryMaker.  Phyllis is the, was the Albert Einstein professor at--economics at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] when she died.  You know, that's quite a while but at any rate, she was there.  Whitney Young was in the dorm.  He had just gone to be head of School of Social Work.
Speaker 1: Did you know him?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes--
Speaker 1: What was he like?
Speaker 2: --and Margaret [Margaret Buckner Young].  Both of them, well he was in the dorm before Margaret came, and she wrote a book.  I must have a copy of it there somewhere.  Whitney, interestingly, people like that, when you know them in other ways, are lots of fun.  He was wonderful fun and, of course, he was, well, the consummate politician, the consummate organization had because he left and went to the Urban League [National Urban League] then, but he, he was head of the School of Social Work, and I was only there a semester.  So I knew all of these different people there, and I'm trying to think more about the experience there.  On Sundays, Virginia Lacy Jones and Dr. E.A. Jones [Edward A. Jones] would talk French at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  We would go to church [First Congregational Church, Atlanta, Georgia] where Homer McEwen was a congregational pastor (laughter), and preferred your white gloves.  You never take your white gloves off.  You get your money out, you put it in the envelope, you write your name on it, all with your white gloves on and all that's gone now.
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: It went with your hat (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So sad.
Speaker 2: We used to have teas for the library school students on Friday.  All week long they could be as casual as they wanted to be, but on Friday when they came to the tea, which had Virginia's laced tablecloth and the silver tea service and we were teaching them how to serve and how to be--a reception, and they had to come with hats, gloves and stockings and the men, very few men, of course, but those came with ties.  Things nobody thinks about these days.  I think, really I had an interesting life when I stopped.  No wonder I'm talking so much (laughter), 'cause these are weird things and they're generational things.
Speaker 1: No they're not, no they're not.
Speaker 2: Nobody thinks about anymore and you did it automatically but we sent out some fine, fine students.
Speaker 1: I'm sure you did.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Somewhere I, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: My students were special, sure.
Speaker 1: See, somewhere I read this period of time, you read over six hundred books a year?
Speaker 2: Well, that, when I became the coordinator and after all I remember lots of them were picture books and readers (laughter).  That was no big deal.  I mean, you could really go ahead and deal with them very rapidly.  And so, oh yeah, I used to do about a hundred a month because I got all the new books, and I'm assigning them to people to read and review and I could go through very quickly, skim, this is a good book but, this is not so good a book, do you want it, but other people were reading them in depth, but I had enough contact with them to know what they were and to know what, oh, I'm sorry, I'm, where's the microphone?
Speaker 1: No, you're fine, you're fine.
Speaker 2: I'm putting my hand all over it.
Speaker 1: No, it's all right.
Speaker 2: And so yes, oh yes, and it's a good thing I like to read.
Story_ID: 326421
Speaker 1: Okay, so after you left Atlanta [Georgia], you went to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went back to Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: --to Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was only on loan.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you didn't stay very long because in 1955 you went to New York [New York].  Could you tell us about that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to the American Library Association convention in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Augusta Baker [Augusta Braxton Baker] and the New York children's librarians where there.  We had a great time together, and Augusta said, "Would you like to come work in New York?"  I said, "Oh no, I'll think about it," and she went and told John Mackenzie Cory who was director of the library [New York Public Library, New York, New York], and he promptly made me an offer and I went back home and I said, "I'm going to New York," and nobody could believe I'd leave Cleveland, and I didn't believe it myself, but I went, and thoroughly enjoyed New York.  I worked first at a branch in the Bronx [New York], Mosholu [Mosholu Library, New York Public Library, Bronx, New York], which was one of their new branches and it was way out at the end of the subway line and everything was different from Cleveland.  In Cleveland, I would say to the children, "Now stand in line," and they would go and stand in line.  In New York I said, "Stand in line," they all looked at me and then I heard a teacher say, "Get on line."  So I said, "Get on line," and they got in line (laughter), and it was learning the language, too.  Mosholu was fascinating because it was incredibly busy.  Oh, they had children just, every, from everywhere.  It was a new branch and so there were lots of children.
Speaker 1: Where was it in New York?  Do you remember which part of it?
Speaker 2: 205, 205th Street, Mosholu, end of the, end of one of the subway lines.  I don't remember which one, but it's there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Still there and very, very much so.  And I left there to go to West Farms [West Farms Library, New York Public Library, Bronx, New York], where one of the duties of the children's librarian was to go over to the Bronx Zoo [Bronx, New York] and tell stories in the afternoon, and you would go over and call all these children, "Come hear a story," and they would come and the lions roared in the backgrounds and there was the smells and there were the mothers yelling, "Come on, we're going," and it was a real experience and if you could tell and hold children's interest in that environment, you could do anything (laughter).  And I did for a while, and I went from West Farms to Library for the Blind [Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped; Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library, New York, New York].  The New York Public Library received a special grant, and Mrs. Frances Clarke Sayers--no, Spain, Frances Lander Spain, was the coordinator of children services then, and she chose me to go to work at the Library for the Blind.
Story_ID: 326422
Speaker 1: In Cleveland [Ohio], you have quite a community orientation.  You work with the community, and you know where all the schools are, you know where the children hang out, you know what organizations are in your community.  Well they didn't quite have that kind of orientation in New York [New York], because you had so many people just came to the library.  So, to go to the Library for the Blind [Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped; Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library, New York, New York] meant to build the whole population, to build the audience.  There were children, now it was very interesting.  Up, beginning in the 1940s, there was just a sudden rush of blind babies and blind premature babies and finally it was discovered that these new incubators which were in all the special hospitals, the [U.S.] military hospitals, these were the children who were being blinded.  Kids who were--poor kids who were put between hot water bottles in (laughter) the dresser drawer were doing fine, but it so happened that these new incubators had a greater quantity of oxygen, which was fed to these children to keep them alive, but damaged the optic nerve.  So we called these babies retrolental fibroplasia, RLF babies, and they were all over.  So the, but at that time they had been going to schools for the blind and as they began to be five years old, their parents, and many of them were middle class children, their parents didn't want them to go, they wanted them mainstreamed, and that started the mainstreaming of children with disabilities into the regular schools and classrooms, and I had a lot there in New York.  I had those wonderful volunteers, Ruth Turkeltaub [ph.].  The sisterhoods in the Jewish faith [National Federation of Temple Sisterhoods] are the ones who are supportive of working with the blind, and so the group from Great Neck [New York] was very supportive of one little boy, his mother was a member of the group and this little boy said one day that he wanted to be able to look up things for himself.  He wanted an encyclopedia.  He had to do a report and so his mother's friends, who had all learned to braille books to be supportive, wrote Marshall Field to ask for, no, they wrote the World Book [Scott Fetzer Company] to ask for permission to braille the World Book [World Book Encyclopedia], and Marshall Field heard about it and underwrote the commercial production at the American Printing House for the Blind in Louisville [Kentucky].  And so all of that generated from this one little boy who wanted, and now Bruce Bresnow [ph.] lived out here.  I knew children all over the United States 'cause I was the only person with children's background in literature so they wrote to me from everywhere and even Red Wing, Miss--Minnesota [Red Wing, Minnesota].  There was a blind child there and that blind child wrote to the New York Public Library [New York, New York], and so I was helping him and interestingly in Michigan, the librarian for the blind at that time didn't want to be bothered with children at all and so I got all the Michigan children, came to me and this was crossing all kinds of lines and, of course, I had to discuss it with Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.], which the division for the blind [Division for the Blind and Physically Handicapped] was responsible for talking books and so forth, so that the federal, it was a federal district that I lived, that I was in, and I had to serve my district, but I was also serving these children all over the country because they could say I need a book on whatever and I knew how to find and send you.  So it grew.  They were getting, because they were mainstreamed, you see, they were in the regular schools.  Now Mrs. Edith Thompson [ph.] was a wonderful volunteer and Mrs. Thompson made picture books for the blind.  She did 'Little Blue and Little Yellow' [sic.] is one of the books and, of course, and then she cut the circles out of felt and, you know, she could apply them.  So, oh, I had all kinds of children who wanted to stand in front of the class and give a book report like their friends did.  Well, they could with the 'Little Blue and Little Yellow' because they could show pictures.  They couldn't see them.  They could feel them and we had a great time.  She did many wonderful books, which I hope the New York Public Library still has.  They were one of a kind, and there were many experiences, as I said.  The children who were, played the children in Perkins [Perkins School for the Blind, Watertown, Massachusetts] in Helen Keller on Broadway, 'The Miracle Worker' [William Gibson].
Story_ID: 326423
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were just getting ready to tell us about some of your blind patrons who were on Broadway.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, those wonderful children.  I have pictures of them.  I will show them to you, and the picture of the New York Public Library [New York, New York] annual report.  In the recent years (unclear) here, there's a little girl sitting and there's an arm around her, she's a blind child and that arm is mine and those children were the children who played school children at Perkins [Perkins School for the Blind, Watertown, Massachusetts] when Helen Keller was there.  We all went to see it, and I did go to Helen Keller's eightieth birthday party.  American Foundation for the Blind had a birthday party for her and we were, oh, you know, people were invited and she stood and she talked but, you know, it was meaningless because we could not understand any of the things, but she was smartly dressed, very well groomed.  She had on a hat and she talked (laughter), and after that occasion whenever I went to visit the children in school, I would say, "I went to Helen Keller's birthday party," and they would look at me.  I said, "Um-hm, she's still alive."  They weren't believing (laughter) and they, they just, they knew about Helen Keller, she had to be dead, but it's surprising, she lived into, I think it's in the 1960s before she died, I would say.  It's really surprising, she lived a long time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear). She did.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Could you just tell us the name of the play that the children were in?  I don't think you mentioned--
Speaker 2: 'The Miracle Worker' [William Gibson] was Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft, and Anne Bancroft was a niece of Frank Lloyd Wright's, you know, that's a part of her history, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Small world.
Story_ID: 326424
Speaker 1: You continued with your work with blind children.  You were the first chairwoman at the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.].  Could you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: (Cough) Well, the books for the blind were chosen by people in the staff of the Library of Congress to be produced either in braille or talking book.  Books of braille were produced at American Printing House for the Blind in Louisville [Kentucky] and the books in--talking books, were produced at American Foundation for the Blind in New York [New York].  Well, once I was appointed, then, and making a difference in the service to children, I worked with Library of Congress going back and forth.  This was the first time I really did that, get up and go on to the corner and get a taxicab and go to the airport and fly down to Washington [D.C.], spend the day at Library of Congress, eat dinner, get on the plane, come home (laughter) and--
Speaker 1: You were so grown up (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) those were wonderful days. But any rate, it was me alone for a while choosing gigs, and then Robert Bray [Robert S. Bray], who was head of the division [Division for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.], decided, well, we could have a committee.  So the persons on the committee were from the surrounding area, but they were all in charge of the children's services and their libraries.  Maxine LaBounty was the D.C. Public [District of Columbia Public Library, Washington, D.C.].  Carolyn came down from Philadelphia [Free Library of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Carolyn Field.  Isabella Janette was Baltimore Public [Baltimore County Public Library, Baltimore County, Maryland] and, let me see who else was there, about four or five of us and that was really a group of people who read and knew books and knew the authors, alive, dead or whatever.  We knew the illustrators, and we were making sure that the children who were blind had the same books as the children who were sighted.  And then an interesting thing, you know, in terms of reading them, when you read certain editions of 'Grimms' Fairy Tales' [Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm], remember in 'Cinderella,' the wicked sisters?  Well, in some versions, the doves fly down and pluck the eyes out of the wicked sisters, so you have to be very sure, you know.  We had to be very much aware that there would be things, would be different and sensitive for these children.  So that was a wonderful experience.  I was also president of the National Braille Association [National Braille Association, Inc.].  Oh, and I have that paper for you, 'cause they're now sixty years old, and that was the organization of volunteers from all over the United States who brailled the books for the children within their area, or for Library of Congress if they wanted something special, or through the American Printing House, and those were the best volunteers in the world.  They were so sensitive to your needs, and you could tell them that so and so needed such and such, and they did not give you any kind of argument.  How soon do you need it?  Are there any special qualifications?  Those volunteers, as I said, they were the sisterhoods.  The Great Neck [New York] sisterhood really competed with the Chicago [Illinois] sisterhood and though, because we were mostly East Coast, there were few out here in California, individuals who were out here, and the organization, or the National Braille Association, we had annual conferences and the year that the World Book [World Book Encyclopedia] came in braille, we met in Chicago and we always, Marge Levi [Marjorie Reynolds Levi] and I would tease one another because we had the top floor, we had a floor in the Hilton [Palmer House Hilton, Chicago, Illinois], and all the doors, connecting doors to the rooms, we had opened up and everybody was Braille Association.  You could walk from one room to the other and just go all the way.  Marge Levi was very, in fact, she secured that.  Her husband, Julian [Julian H. Levi], was vice president of the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and we were all good friends.  Those were wonderful women and, do I hear from any--well, yes, I just heard from the organization.  I put the paper aside to give to you because I had written them on each occasion that they've had a big event, you know, information for the braille booklet.  They were really great.  Some worked with volunteers at many of the situations, and it is rare to have a volunteer come to you and say, just exactly what you want, tell me, and I'd do it, no questions, except to make sure that this is what you want, instead of some groups of volunteers are organized, and they will come and tell you how to run your business.  It makes it a little bit difficult (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It does, it certainly does.
Story_ID: 326425
Speaker 1: Was there anything else that you did with the blind?
Speaker 2: With the blind (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Any other work that you--that you'd like to tell us about?
Speaker 2: Let me give a quick think.  No, well, I was president [of the National Braille Association, Inc.] for two terms and considering, see this is another thing.  For much of my life, I've been the first, or the one and only, and I think that makes a difference to how you approach things because you know if you start anything, it's you, there's nobody behind you to come along and help, so you have to have--think very clearly about what you're doing, and how, and I'm trying to think about the blind, other than that, I just enjoyed them.  I used to go Christmas storytelling to the Lions [Lions Clubs International] party--Christmas parties for the children.  They would always put me on after Santa Claus (laughter), and that was something.  I used to want to say, "Now fold your hands, and bend your head," or else I was going to say, "Now we're going to say the Pledge of Allegiance," something, anything to get those children back out of the euphoria they were in when Santa Claus had walked around and touched them, and, but they all loved 'The Night Before Christmas' ['A Visit From St. Nicholas,' Clement Clarke Moore], so I gave up learning stories and learned that and said it after Santa Claus came and the children were wonderful.  I'm trying to think what kinds of, well, I don't know.  I used to wear hats back then, too, and, I went to an Urban League [National Urban League] luncheon, and I had on a crazy hat and at the speaker's table was Cardinal Spellman [Francis Spellman], and Lester Granger [Lester Blackwell Granger] was sitting next to him and I didn't know it then but I saw Lester beckoned for me to come up, I knew him from childhood.  So I went up to the (laughter)--and he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry, who was, could you, for those of us who don't know--
Speaker 2: Lester Granger was head of the National Urban League and so when I got up to the table, he said, "Cardinal Spellman wants to know: who's that lady in the crazy hat?"  He said, "I'd introduce you."  Well, nothing could have been finer.  I was having all kinds of trouble with the Xavier Society for the Blind [New York, New York].  They didn't want me to come.  They didn't want me to know what they were doing and I told Cardinal Spellman.  He said, "You call them at nine o'clock Monday morning, and you will have entree."  I called them at nine o'clock Monday morning, they wanted to send for me (laughter), they wanted to know what I wanted, whom did I want to meet, what did I want, oh yes, come as soon as I wanted to come.
Story_ID: 326426
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea why they [Xavier Society for the Blind, New York, New York] didn't want to work with you at first?
Speaker 2: No more than organizations that, and I, that was not a racial thing, that was a, they didn't want to work with the New York [New York] schools, they, you know they, they didn't want to work with Industrial Home for the Blind [Brooklyn, New York], and Industrial Home for the Blind didn't want to work with--it was just organizational.  Goodness, I can't think of the word, but you know what I mean when I'm saying that each organization--
Speaker 1: Their politics.
Speaker 2: --has special interest in politics, yes, yes.  And so that was it and New York Public Library [New York, New York], librarians have a very difficult time, you know, particularly if you're a children's librarian, that's why it's interesting.  I've been a president of all these things because you're supposed to be, well you're not quite right if you want to work with children that much and if, you know, teachers get it but if you get it and people understand what a teacher does, you can imagine what a librarian goes through when we're trying to say, "No, we don't teach."  "Then why are you existing?"  "No, we want to work with you."  "Oh, you just want to protect your job.  Oh, you want special interest," because people really don't understand the significant differences, and when you're dealing with schools, particularly, in many instances, well, I don't know, out here, at any rate, they had been coaches, they didn't read, and so, in many instances, you had principals who weren't all that supportive, but you could get some incredible children, and it was the children who'd break the barriers because I had real problems with unified school district [San Francisco Unified School District], which I don't want to put on tape.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: But, (laughter) but, it was very difficult getting cooperation because they--well, two things.  One, they saw as competition but--and two, they saw invading their turf rather than seeing that we were colleagues. And three, they didn't understand library.  We don't need a library, we've got the San Francisco Public Library [San Francisco, California], so have all the children who go to parochial school, all the preschool children, all the children in institutions, we serve children regardless of where they go to school, and you really should have school libraries.  Well, they do and they don't.
Story_ID: 326427
Speaker 1: Mentioning San Francisco [California], in 1963--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you moved west.  Were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I left my blind children.  San Francisco was the last major city which did not have a coordinator of children's services.  There were coordinators in Boston [Massachusetts], New York [New York], in, well, in every city that had a public library, there were children's libraries.  The major cities had administrators and San Francisco was the very last.  Down in Los Angeles [California] was Gladys English at the Los Angeles Public Library and then Rosemary Livsey [Rosemary E. Livsey], and those women had built strong departments of children--they, I don't want to say controlled, but they were aware of every kind of movement and so forth.  And then, I was recruited to come to the San Francisco Public Library [San Francisco, California], and I would, this is a comment now.  One of the, my collegial friends from another city, while I was not a coordinator, I ran in that group and that's probably how I got in (unclear). One said, "What, you're going to that racist city?"
Speaker 1: Oh, really?
Speaker 2: Because they know what people knew on the different level and I was shocked because that was the first I had ever really thought or heard of that but Lester Granger [Lester Blackwell Granger] also told me, "Take your time making friends."
Speaker 1: Oh, really?
Speaker 2: And I didn't know what he meant by that, but I learned, and so it was a very interesting thing.
Speaker 1: Excuse me.  Could you, why was, I think, lots of people, because it's not the South, and this is California, California's supposed to be so open and so tolerant, so could you explain a little bit about why San Francisco was viewed as a racial city, a racist city?
Speaker 2: Well, I think now, the person who said that had been in the [U.S.] Army.  She was in Special Services or something so she'd been out here so she may have seen what happened with soldiers and all and she was a very sensitive person to doing that but you remember, 1963 when all up and down Van Ness Avenue, when people rebelled against the automakers and Thomas Burrow [ph.], the dentist, went to jail over the Civil Rights Movement.  When they began this movement and began to tell people what was going on, 'cause people were out there at Hunters Point [Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco, California], and people didn't see them.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: They didn't know the kinds of conditions.
Speaker 1: Hunters, excuse me, Hunters Point in San Francisco for people who don't live here--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --is predominantly--
Speaker 2: Predominantly (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) African American community.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Story_ID: 326428
Speaker 1: And they were workers who had come from the South during World War II [WWII], and so they had stayed and therefore a lot, to a lot of them, of course, anything was better than coming from, than staying in the rural South where you had this open, open hostility and they were here, and they were out there, but then there were things like one of the department heads said to me one day when I said, "We're discarding many books."  "Yes, you can send--why don't you send them out to the branch at Hunters Point [Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco, California]?"  I mean, those were the kinds of subtleties that you ran into.  Why send them out there?  Well, those children, you know, just like the recent Barbara Bush remark when she remarked about the people in the Superdome [Louisiana Superdome; Mercedes-Benz Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana] after Katrina [Hurricane Katrina].  Well, you know, this was a step up from where they came.  Well, this was what we're saying that, and the war was on.  Oh, I'll tell you.  I never let anybody do anything where my children were concerned and the month, gee, (laughter) all these things, and February was Negro History Month [Black History Month], and I had good people.  I loved my children's librarians and they loved me.  We, when I came, there were two of them with degrees out of thirty, and then there was this great turnover with Berkeley [Berkeley Public Library, Berkeley, California] and then I got all these wonderful, wonderful people and we made a difference.  We, the reason, and (laughter) I think I might even be included in all of this because we turned that library and this city.  A lot of people had to look around to see what we did, and I gave those people enough starch in their backbones, the dentist [Thomas Burrow (ph.)], stand up and say, "No," or to stand up and say, "I have a master's degree, I know what I'm talking about," and however they wanted to phrase it to get the point across, that we were experts in the field of dealing with children, and we were going to deal with the children in the city to the best of our ability and we had a brochure on children's rights, which I must give you.  But any rate, the month of February, beginning in September, I'd start putting aside the books about blacks came and having people read them when the reviews came, put them aside.  Came the month of February, was nothing but black books on the list, and every month we met and the children's librarians ordered whatever they wanted for their neighborhoods, but came February was nothing but black books and one librarian said, "Ms. Morris [HistoryMaker Effie Lee Morris], I don't have any black children in my neighborhood."  "All the more, Mrs. So and So," you know, that you must buy many books and some of them, old Thomas [ph.] would try to sneak things by, you know, and not buy and I would look at the order slips, everybody's before they went in.  "Oh, Ms. So and So, I noticed that you did not order such and such a book.  You may have--did--you may have overlooked it, so I have ordered one for you, deduct one from your quota," (laughter), but, as I said, I had just great people there.  Lots of things around here, all these owls.
Story_ID: 326429
Speaker 1: I came in February 1963, and in April 1963, I had a birthday and they gave me three little owls.  I have to tell you the story of the owls, but they gave me three little owls and the librarian who presented them suddenly forgot her speech and she looked at me, she handed the owls over, "We hope they give you wisdom," (laughter) and we laugh about that to this day (laughter) because that was so funny but from that day on, in that library [San Francisco Public Library, San Francisco, California], for the time that I stayed in that library, every April we had a birthday party and they gave me owls and on other occasions they gave me owls and my friends would travel and they gave me owls and my friends who have, oh Christmas, I got owls.  I got owl books, and I've got Clement Hurd's 'The Owl' ['The Mother Owl,' Edith Thacher Hurd and Clement Hurd] and 'The Blue Heron Tree' [Edith Thacher Hurd] is up over there.  The Owl Gallery [San Francisco, California], the Owl Gallery was a store right on the corner opposite the Sir Francis Drake [Kimpton Sir Francis Drake Hotel, San Francisco, California], and around the top of that building, etched, were those owls, there was a poster like that, and I've forgotten who bought the poster and who had it framed, gave it to me.  And so, there are owls everywhere and you can, as you look around you see all these owls.
Speaker 2: In fact you're wearing owls (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And they are gifts.
Speaker 2: You're wearing owls.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  Now I wear three, I wear four owls.  Anyone who worked in the New York Public Library [New York, New York], and anyone who respected and honored Anne Carroll Moore, the first coordinator of children's services for the New York Public Library, knew about the owls.  Anne Carroll Moore wrote book reviews, children's book reviews for the Herald Tribune, New York Herald Tribune, and she didn't have a title for her column, so the New York Trib--Herald Tribune asked her for a title and she was on vacation.  She was a Vermonter and she was on vacation writing book reviews, and she looked out the window and there were three owls flying toward her and she took that as a symbol and named her column, The Three Owls.  So for all the years, she wrote book reviews and did The Three Owls.  To put that a little bit more in context, Frederic Melcher [Frederic G. Melcher] established Boy Scout Week, just about the same time so there was much attention paid to the critical reviewing of children's literature, and so we all knew it and Ms. Moore collected owls.  I did not work with Ms. Moore.  Augusta Baker [Augusta Braxton Baker], whom you've heard--whom I've spoken as a children's librarian in the New York Public Library, had started collecting owls, and she had her collection, and when I got there, and then we would dec- you know, move fast to see who'd get the owl in the hotel or wherever because we were collecting and we'd shop, and birthday presents, so forth, owls would go back and forth.  Well, the three owls mean, and I'm going to do a gesture, the author, the illustrator, the critic, and the fourth owl, as I told people, I always wear, right above my heart, that's the reader.  And so people thought I collected owls and that's what's happened there.  If you can think of any shape or anything, I have towels, I have clothes, I have sweaters, I have skirts; I have an Abercrombie and Fitch skirt with a great big owl embroidered on it.  It's a little tight in the waistline now.  I have, what else do I have?  I have hors d'oeuvre knives.  I have soap dishes.  I have towels.  I have sheets.  I have all those kinds of things and, of course, I have stuffed pillows, like the one that just came from Munich [Germany] over there, and then this other one my assistant gave me one time, that's a great big owl pillow.  I have a neighbor who is just one of the most generous, kind and wonderful people, I'm going to mention her name, Marian Knott [ph.].  Marian and Connie [ph.] live here in the building.  They--Connie was a school superintendent in New York and Marian volunteers in the schools but she is a shopper.  You know how some people can tell you when (laughter), oh for example, when Macy's has moved one bracelet from inside the case to top of the case, she can tell you.
Speaker 2: Oh, dear.
Speaker 1: She's a real shopper, and she's always looking for owls and she brings me incredible owls.  I would almost have her come down, but she's in London [England].  They just left the day that you came (laughter).
Story_ID: 326430
Speaker 1: Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When you were with the San Francisco Library [San Francisco Public Library, San Francisco, California], the coordinator of children's services, what were some of the things that you did to improve the children's library?
Speaker 1: Gee, I wish I had my paper in front of me.  I organized the department; I set the standards for staff, for books, for services.  I developed Priority Preschool, which was a program, which we emphasized, work with the preschool children and out of that came Dial-A-Story and I have--people all over the country have copied Dial-A-Story.  That's, well for us, it was a three minute recorded story.  The children's librarians recorded it.  It was on telephone lines, and so the children would have somebody to call up, and they could call and hear a story and let's see what else.  Developed advisory councils.  Each branch had an advisory council of children, preschool, all the way up.  They knew what went on in their neighborhood.  They knew the places that were good so this is a community outreach, meaning that you don't sit there and wait for them to come.  You know what's out there in the community and that I'm going to digress a little bit, is out of the Cleveland [Ohio] background.  Now there's a story about Clevelanders.  Two Clevelanders died and went to heaven.  Now the Clevelanders always were meeting-oriented so when they got to heaven and they saw the road, one road said, this way to heaven and the other one said, this way to a meeting about heaven, and the Clevelander took the meeting road.  So (laughter), meaning, community oriented is a part of my heritage and I've passed it on.  You know nothing if you stay in that building and, of course, outreach in the last twenty years has become something in terms of knowing your community.  Well, our little children knew it.  They had maps of the neighborhood and the librarian would pinpoint, this is a favorite place where you buy ice cream and this and so forth.  It was to relate things to them and, of course, we, in so doing, made the library have to change many of the ways that it functioned because we wanted to function like this.  We had summer reading programs and, well, we had them, they had had a few in different branches but we had a citywide one in which we had a committee to develop the theme and the illustrations and the posters and the flyers and I was a big part of everything we did but we had wonderful children's people, and they were really creative, and they came out of Berkeley [California], a lot of them did, and they were here and when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed, I had someone make up a book list and to send out a notice to all the branches, you have a big picture of Martin Luther, I had bought those, oh famous Negro--on kids and everybody.  I bought them and sent them to everybody.  "Take the picture from those kids, display it and do whatever else you wish but indicate that we are in, we are mourning," and they did some incredible things.  One librarian took all the chairs from around one of the tables and put the picture in a bowl of flowers.  I mean, just little things that are just beautifully done.  Others put them up on the bulletin board and put books and things around but that's to show how they responded and in so doing, we could send a signal throughout the system as well as look what we're doing and look to the community, too  as to what, what we're doing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Excuse me, just before we take a little break, could you tell me how many branches--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --there were when you were coordinator?
Speaker 1: Thirty-two, I guess.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Let me see, 28, 30, well I had 32 librarians, no, I guess there were 28 branches and the 32 was because of the Ming Children's Room [ph.]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --which had more branches.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).

Speaker 1: We were just talking about the branches, that you had twenty-eight branches that you were in charge of and another important thing that you did was you originated, a children's historical and research collection [Effie Lee Morris Historical and Research Collection of Children's Literature].  Could you tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Yes, San Francisco [San Francisco Public Library, San Francisco, California] had many books that many of the libraries didn't buy.  This is a matter of standards and criteria, and in San Francisco [California], it's part of the culture, anything goes, so you had a lot of anything goes books and I realized that it's important, very important, and I began to, to pull them in from the branches so that the last copy of anything we had went into that kind of collection.  So that's a valuable collection, of periods of children's literature and then they named that collection after me.  It is in the main children's room as a (cough), it's a separate room in which these books are housed and it's a huge collection now.  I'm not, I don't know for sure the numbers but I'm sure it must be 20, 25,000 in the--individual copies sure, but in addition, they have been keeping up with all the new books, all the award books, and any of the books that were rejected because of stereotypes.  A little while ago, various publishers began to send, make different editions of 'Little Black Sambo' ['The Story of Little Black Sambo,' Helen Bannerman], and so all the editions are there so that you can see, you know the--how things have developed.  You know, so then they named that for me, I think when--?
Speaker 1: In 1964.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then, let's see, this is the tenth year we have had an annual lecture in my name.  This is the Effie Lee Morris annual lecture on children's literature [Effie Lee Morris Lecture in Children's Literature], and it's held in the spring, and an author is chosen by the main library staff (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A children's author?
Speaker 2: --a children's author, to speak to the group and we have an author and a reception and this year it will be Tomie dePaola who has done 'Strega Nona,' you know those books, okay, well it's going to be Tomie this year and so (cough), you have to be sure to come.  It will be in May and I, we have switched back to an evening.  I'm not sure how, that--when we're, we had it on evenings, we had it on Sunday afternoon.  I know the evening I'm thinking about the Southern California black caucus [California Legislative Black Caucus] sent one of its members this past year with a check and people give checks to the lecture because it's the Women's National Book Association which started this for the library.  I was on the board before I came out from New York [New York] and came out here and established the chapter, so I'm the president emeritus and that chapter initiated this lecture so they're the one's who feel really responsible for seeing that it's carried on.  We've had wonderful people.  Lauren Shipp [ph.] was our first speaker.  Ashley Bryan was a speaker.  We've had Milly Lee who has done children's books of San, with San Francisco [California] background, and we've had Thacher Hurd, he's the son of the Clement [Clement Hurd] and Edith Hurd [Edith Thacher Hurd], and is an author, illustrator in his own right.  We've had, we've had Robert San Souci [Robert D. San Souci] and his brother, Daniel San Souci.  I've been very careful when they tell me whom they may have to make sure we have representation of color.  We've had Nikki Grimes.  We had Pamela Munoz Ryan [Pam Munoz Ryan].  We've had--Ashley and Nikki, are they the only two African Americans we've had?  Might be, but, you know, we've had the Chinese.  We've had the Hispanic, and it will go in a circle.  We've had the Caucasian (laughter), because we had to have.  Now Tomie we will have, now Tomie I knew when he was an art, taught art at USF [University of San Francisco, San Francisco, California], now he is an industry unto himself (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Certainly, certainly is.
Speaker 2: And so (cough), those two things.
Story_ID: 326432
Speaker 1: I stayed [at the San Francisco Public Library, San Francisco, California] fourteen years, and then the pressure was too much, I burnt out.  The fighting, the struggles, the continual struggle for budget, no, well, you know, okay, you can have some money, but it was a continual battle to keep things uphill and so forth.  People were shocked.  I went over to Harcourt Brace [Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, this is in 1978?
Speaker 1: --which had an office, yeah, and I was there awhile, and then I taught at Mills [Mills College, Oakland, California], too, and then I just sort of recovered.
Speaker 2: I can understand that.
Speaker 1: It was a very, very difficult situation.  I would never have believed it, but I think if you read San Francisco [California] newspapers you know the politics, it's always not what you're doing, but who you know.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: And sometimes I say the less you know the better and there are occasions when I've written letters saying, you know, I appreciate your perspective, but also please respect mine.  I have these three degrees, I have worked for years, I have done this, I have done that and if you insist, please give me back my library school tradition--tuition.
Speaker 2: Okay, you also worked for Head Start, a task force?
Speaker 1: That was one of the community groups with whom we worked as a library.
Speaker 2: There's--
Speaker 1: Then I did, not actual working in the organization of Head Start, but as a cooperative sort of thing, building on them.
Story_ID: 326433
Speaker 1: I'm sure, with all of your work as a librarian, you're a member of the American Library Association--
Speaker 2: Oh yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and they've given you many, many awards.  Can you tell us something about your connection with the American Library Association?
Speaker 2: Well, it started way back in Cleveland [Ohio], of course, when I was first a librarian, yeah, as soon as I finished library school [at Flora Stone Mather College for Women, Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], I joined, plus joining the Ohio Library Association [Ohio Library Council]. And for the American Library Association, when I was in Cleveland, I went to the conference, the one I was talking about the Palmer House [Palmer House Hilton, Chicago, Illinois].  I don't know whether we got that on tape or not, but that was the first conference I'd gone to was American Library Association and my director, let me tell you, I've been incredibly fortunate in the people I've known, that's why when, it's a devastating experience, I don't quite how to take it, but the head of the department [at the Cleveland Public Library] in Cleveland said, "Oh yes, you can go to the conference," and she gave me all of the invitations because the publishers invite you.  She gave me all of her invitations so that that started me, and I know, I remember going to a party and Carol Brink [Carol Ryrie Brink] was there, she wrote, 'Caddie Woodlawn.'  I don't know whether children--well she and I were there, and I get heady on people and she was heady on wine and we were up on the, about the thirty-fifth floor, something, they raised the window and they're holding their heads out the window (laughter), I (unclear), me and Carol Brink but there were all kinds of experiences like that and in Ohio I really began to get involved.  I was appointed to head the--I must, that must have been in Ohio--Notable Children's Books Committee, and that committee chose the notable books of the year, plus we served on the Newbery [John Newbery Medal] and Caldecott [Caldecott Medal] award committees, and I'm trying to think what else happened.
Speaker 1: That's good--sorry, could you--the Caldecott is for picture books and the Newbery's for (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Caldecott--the Newbery's for text for the older books and they are the Pulitzer Prizes of children's literature, and I think I still hold the record as having served longer than anybody in, at many terms.  I think seven or eight terms I've been on those committees.  They're in the Ohio Library Association.  The community organization background of Cleveland is very important, learning in Cleveland schools and all.  Right, I organized the junior members of the Ohio Library Association.  We were the young ones who came in. And I was president of that for a while and I was president of their children's division and here again is an experience, going to Cincinnati [Ohio].  The Ohio Library Association met in Cincinnati, Mildred Stibitz [Mildred T. Stibitz] was president, and Cincinnati was superficially, but very strongly segregated, and yet here would be all these librarians.  Well, interestingly, there were not, our people don't participate very much and I was probably the only one around, but she had gone around to the various restaurants and hotels where we would be meeting to make sure I would not be embarrassed and I was always with friends and I was quite aware of people staring when we went to various restrooms, black people didn't go to those.
Speaker 1: What about, what time was this?  What year was this?  What decade maybe?
Speaker 2: Late '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Late '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: And so that was an experience with junior members and American Library Association and working on the books and you see the conventions are when you meet the people and meet the authors and the illustrators and have the opportunity to talk about books.
Story_ID: 326434
Speaker 1: Then, of course, when I went to New York [New York], I'm in the midst of the publishing world and all kinds of things and all kinds of people I began to know and I'm trying to think what else was unusual in New York.  Well, the work with the blind was my unusual work in New York and, (laughter) you know, funny, I had resigned and had been out here for two years and I went back to--what was that store?  On, oh gee, it was my favorite store, on 34th Street?  Golly, I can't--
Speaker 2: Macy's?
Speaker 1: Altman's, B. Altman's [B. Altman and Company, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: I went back, I'd been out here for two years and I went back to buy something I didn't, I have clerks from all these different places and this woman said, "Where've you been, I haven't seen you for a couple of years?" Nope, I lived in San Francisco [California] for a couple of years now.  So, it, New York was--New York is a state of mind.
Speaker 2: It certainly is.
Speaker 1: There is no place on earth (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) It certainly is.
Speaker 1: --like New York no matter what and people used to ask me, "Well, do you like New York or do you like San Francisco?"  They are not to be compared.  Each one has its own uniqueness, its own special--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: No, they're very different.
Story_ID: 326435
Speaker 1: You also won the Women's National Book Association Award?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Could you, it's given--
Speaker 2: That, after I came out here--
Speaker 1: So it was given to a living American woman?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When--the Women's National Book Association is the organization that was founded in 1917 when the booksellers in New York [New York] would not allow the women to be a part of their organization [Bookseller's League], so the women who were in publishing and so forth, not many of them were but they were, they founded that organization and it's gone on from there.  Well, when I came here to San Francisco [California], I founded the chapter here because I'd been on the board there.  They have chapters in New York, New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Los Angeles [California], I think Dallas [Texas], now.  They have about ten chapters scattered around the United States and they, too, hold meetings annually but the New York chapter was the one and the main one and they began giving what was known as the Constance Lindsay Skinner Award to people in the publishing world, in the book field or readers or people who they respected because they gave Eleanor Roosevelt an award and, the award one year.  I was in New York when she got it, and I remember meeting her and we were in the receiving line and she came down the line in her elegant evening dress and I looked down, she had her bedroom slippers.  You see, she had learned (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Oh, she's smart.
Speaker 2: --you don't wear heels or those Oxfords that she wore when you're going places and having to stand a long time, you learn to be comfortable.  Rachel Carson received the award.  Charlemae Rollins [Charlemae Hill Rollins] was the first among us to receive that award.
Speaker 1: And she is?
Speaker 2: She was the children's librarian from George Cleveland Hall Branch [George Cleveland Hall Branch Library] in Chicago Public Library [Chicago, Illinois].  It was Charlemae who initiated with the publishers way back in 1927 a change.  She tried to change the interpretation, the depiction of Negro characters and she was the first author, 'We Build Together[: A Reader's Guide to Negro Life and Literature for Elementary and High School Use,' Charlemae Hill Rollins].  We went through four editions of 'We Build Together.'  She wrote her own book, 'Famous Negroes in Science' [sic.].  She wrote, 'Christmas Gif',' which is on the table somewhere, which was a story, which is a book of Christmas tales and things about African Americans, how we celebrate and she was generally beloved by the profession.  I don't think anybody, Augusta [Augusta Braxton Baker] comes close in being beloved, but Charlemae was beloved.
Speaker 1: Was she black or white?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Was she African American or was she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) African American, African American, and the first.  You know, she made the way for all of us and then Augusta came along and I came along doing my thesis, you know, on the Negro character in children's literature, and I did that at Reserve [Flora Stone Mather College for Women, Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio].  I wrote it while I was in New York, but it was, I had finished all the course work so it gave me, we were retreads.  We already had (laughter) a bachelor of something and then a bachelor of library science and in order to get the master's of library science, we, as retreads, had more courses and then had to write a thesis.
Speaker 1: I see.
Story_ID: 326436
Speaker 1: So my thesis was on the African American--or the Negro character in children's literature.
Speaker 2: And what did you discover?  What was your--?
Speaker 1: Well, because it began with rainbow in the Peter Parley [Samuel Griswold Goodrich] books, it, and I wrote all the way to 1950, I was going to continue it and then got too busy and didn't, but it shows the trends.  We go from being just a part of the background to being a part of the plantation literature and then we're being seen as characters and then we, the comics and the stereotypes over the years and, and very definite trends and in 1950 there were beginning to be books in which the African--well, Negro character was positive and was the main reason for the book and there were very few, but it was beginning to happen and if you begin to have little bits of integration in the books, of course those flourished after, after the Civil Rights Movement and then, you know, it was quotations around that black gold was just write anything you wanted to but you could go back and you could find out about some Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes, of course, and then people like Virginia Hamilton and Mildred Taylor [Mildred D. Taylor], Mildred Pitts Walter, Eloise Greenfield, all of those people came along in the next period and there were many, many.  Then we also started the Coretta Scott King Award.  Now, Glendon Greer, who was in New Jersey but was from Atlanta [Georgia], wanted to start an award for children's books and she wanted it for a woman so she named it for Coretta [Coretta Scott King], and for some time Coretta didn't accept this.  We used to have to deal with her because she wanted it named for Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  She did not want it in her name but as times gone on, the wisdom of Glendon Greer using, asking Coretta, has become more prominent because now as a woman, she, it is also prominent, which, by the way, I, according to the last LISTSERV, Coretta is feeling much better.  She's had the stroke and a heart attack but she's feeling much better, her therapy's working.
Speaker 2: Oh, good.  That's wonderful to know.
Speaker 1: And so we had the Coretta Scott King Award.  Now there are two ways of approaching it.  I say it's an award for African American or black experience, not to be compared with anything else.  The Newbery [John Newbery Medal] and Caldecott [Caldecott Medal] people, you'll see great battles raged over the Newbery and Caldecott not having any black authors.  Well, there are no black authors were really writing and those who were writing were not really at the stage of writing books that we could be proud of because there was an awful lot of anything goes.  And so the Coretta Scott King was to pull the best of those and bring them to the attention of the public, and that's the reason for, and because this is a controversy within the literature, and I hear many African Americans answer, well, the Coretta Scott King Awards were developed because the Newbery, Caldecott wouldn't give an award to black people but it's not the reason.  It should never be said in that way.  It's because we can stand on our own and for a while if we didn't have anything that was any good, then okay, well when we hit something that's good, we're going to shout about it (laughter).
Story_ID: 326437
Speaker 1: You've had many--won many, many awards.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You wanted me to mention your Silver SPUR Award from--the SPUR Award (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, did we mention Grolier [Grolier Foundation Award] because that's--
Speaker 1: No, we haven't done that either.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, Grolier, what was that?  Well, oh I should finish WNBA [Women's National Book Association].  I mean, I can stray so far from everything.  Nineteen eighty-four [1984], I got the WNBA Award [Women's National Book Association Award] and I am so proud and pleased and I hope that in some way you will quote the citation because it's the nicest citation I ever had.  I think you have it in writing 'cause I always copy that one.  When it's, it says that I made a contribution to readers and through readers to society.  I really liked that quotation.  I got that in 1984 so it puts me in the company with people as I mentioned, Mrs. Roosevelt [Eleanor Roosevelt], Pearl Buck [Pearl S. Buck], Charlemae [Charlemae Hill Rollins] and then Augusta [Augusta Braxton Baker] got it, too, and then me and then--who's been getting it.  Barbara Tuchman [Barbara W. Tuchman] got it, oh yeah, and I was on the Committee of 100, the first Committee of 100 for the Center for the Book of the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.], and Barbara Tuchman had just gotten the award and I said to her, "Congratulations."  She said, "How do you know about it?"  I said, "'Cause I was nominated, too."  (Laughter) So, and the next year I got it.
Speaker 1: Who's, excuse me, who's, could you tell us something--
Speaker 2: Now Barbara Tuchman was the author and, of course, I'm going to draw a blank on what she wrote, except she wrote major historical novels and she was a power in the literature.  She was really incredible so I was, I'm really in honored company when I'm in that group and when I mention that group.  And then the Grolier Award, put a pin in this, the bicentennials, something, I want to tell you about bicentennials because when did I do bicentennial, yes, out here in San Francisco [California], but the Grolier Award is given to a children's librarian, or young adult librarian, who has made a significant contribution to the service to children, young adult, in public libraries.  Yeah, I got that in 1992, but I want to go back for a minute.  It made me think of bicentennial, which would have been 1976, a hundred years [sic. two hundred years].  American Library Association decided they would do book lists for children, young adults and adults on books on life in America and I chaired the children's and we had a fascinating time with the old Blackstone Hotel [Renaissance Blackstone Hotel] in Chicago [Illinois].  They locked us up for a weekend and we came up with these book lists of which 8 million were published (laughter), and they were given out all over the United States.  I love that and I hope I have one, I can find one to give to you but that was one of the other things.  To think about, I'm trying to think on national level still.  American Library Association, in 1970, I was elected president of the Public Library Association, which was a division.  It had nine thousand some members when I went in and eleven thousand when my term was up.  It is public library--because I think there's sixteen thousand in the United States, so we had a very good representation.  It was during my administration that we moved from qualitative standards, six feet between the shelves and that sort of thing, to quantitative standards which dealt more with the human relations aspect of the standards for public libraries.  And, as I said, that was during my term and they carried it on until it's become standard, goals, guidelines and standards for public libraries.  It's taken years, but they did it and then, what else?  Oh, I was on council.  Council is the governing board--body.  It's about 150 people and you have to go to the conferences and you sit in the council and you, you know, and it's all official business.  And then I've served on numerous committees, any number of committees for American Library Association.
Story_ID: 326438
Speaker 1: For California Library Association, now here's another thing, I don't care, I'm going to tell it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Go on (laughter).
Speaker 1: For California Library Association, I was very, very active and I had chaired the children's section and we had had good programs with some difficulty but there are all different kinds of opinions in the State of California and I was nominated for, to run for president and when certain people became aware that I was nominated and that running against me was a very weak candidate which was going to make sure that I would win, they talked him out of running and put in a strong old-timer and she won.
Speaker 2: Because you were black?
Speaker 1: That, too, and then because I'm uppity.  So (laughter), I mean, I was a little bit of both but it would have been later they had presidents who were black but at that time, they had not had--
Speaker 2: When was that?
Speaker 1: In the '50s [1950s], in the '50s [1950s], and then on in American Library [American Library Association], you know, I'm in Newbery [John Newbery Medal] and Caldecott [Caldecott Medal] and book committees and other committees.  One other thing I did which I thoroughly enjoyed, but strange, what is it called?  Library, 'Library Response to Urban Change' ['Library Response to Urban Change: A Study of the Chicago Public Library'], which is the seminal study of the Chicago Public Library [Chicago, Illinois] by Lowell Martin, and I was responsible for the children's aspect, or the children's concept in that book.  Although it printed, it's a little bit different from the way I articulated it but children's have a fairly strong role in that book which is, you know, just standard, everybody reads it and knows it.  And so, let's see, what else can I cover?  Oh, and so far as San Francisco [California], because of community, I just never, certain things I just did not understand and community you're supposed to go to whatever area meeting or neighborhood meeting there is and I went to lots of them.  I lived in this area, before I lived here, I lived up, straight up Geary [Street] on Terra Vista [Avenue], so it was in an area, you know, where, no Terra Vista is across the borderline.  This is Western Addition [San Francisco, California] as people call it but, and I went to all of those meetings.  I was on the mayor's childcare committees and anything to do with children.  Somehow or another, I tried to be involved and so I have awards for being in the community and I will show you later the Silver SPUR Award--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --which they give to community people recognizing their work in communities.
Story_ID: 326439
Speaker 1: You were going to tell us about the SPUR Award [Silver SPUR Award].
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, the SPUR Award.  It's quite a special award.  It is given to citizens who have made a difference and those three (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In San Francisco [California]?
Speaker 2: In San Francisco, and those three words made a difference.  They mean everything to me.  I've been a catalyst, a pioneer and a living legend, and so to have made a difference with all the people in the world, to have it acknowledged, I'm very pleased with the SPUR Award and they have a very nice saying, too.  The citation and all is very nice, but I don't remember it off-hand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I was telling you about the Reading the World Award, which is University of San Francisco [San Francisco, California], and that award is for the contribution to multicultural literature and services for children.  I'm trying to see what else is over there.  I have a couple of, you know, several of those things are either from the California Senate [California State Senate], or the California Legislature [California State Legislature].  I have a couple from the Senate, too.  I have them scattered away and packed away because there really are a lot of them.
Story_ID: 326440
Speaker 1: I was so impressed to learn you were a television star.  Can you tell us about, 'What's My Line'?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That--'What's My Line' was so much fun.  As I said--
Speaker 1: What was about the year, do you, before you start telling us?
Speaker 2: Let me see because it was, Dial-A-Story, it had to be--
Speaker 1: Dial-A-Story--
Speaker 2: --seventy-three [1973], '74 [1974]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --along in there.  Any rate, somebody heard about it and invited me to New York [New York] to appear on 'What's My Line.'  Now, obviously, wearing a hat as I'm doing and so forth, I'm very conscious of clothes.  So I went to Joseph Magnin [Joseph Magnin Company, San Francisco, California] and asked them to dress me for this appearance, which they did, and all this beige and white blouse and ultra-suede.  (Laughter) And so when I went to New York, we had a rehearsal behind stage--backstage.  NBC [sic. CBS], I think it was NBC, and as we were all gathering back there, a man came over to me and said, "Would you like to meet my boss," and I said, "Yes, I'd like to meet your boss, bring him over."  Nerve, and he brought over Governor Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] and I (unclear) the introduction, and then blanking out said, "And what do you do in Georgia?"  (Laughter) And he tried to tell me.  Well, then we were called in and when he was in, he was a mystery guest and they did not guess him,  somebody said he was a bible salesman, I don't know what, but they didn't guess him.  Then they got to me and the questions pertained to fairy tales, and they didn't guess me, and it got really funny because they got so annoyed with each other and themselves that they couldn't guess the answers to the questions that were being proposed, and I'm sitting there looking absolutely horrified, and they said, "What do you do," you know, was a part of it.  And somebody said, "She gives fashion news on the, on the television in San Francisco [California]," which you know, Joseph, was a good plug for Joseph Magnin, but they didn't guess and then we were, of course, all backstage again and there was Governor Jimmy Carter, and we had to line up to go out and I said, my mother [Erma Caskie Morris] will never forgive me if I don't shake Arlene's [Arlene Francis] hand and he said--Joan Fontaine was there, too, he said, "I want to speak to Joan Fontaine," or something like that.  Any rate, I should have preceded him on going on the stage but nope, they, he was quite a gentleman, insisted that I go first and I did and I got out there and I looked at the audience and they were going (gestures).  I couldn't imagine, and they were doing this at me, all these strange signals.  Well, eventually everything was over and I got the elevator and one of the people said, "Didn't you know, we're from California, we were telling you, we were proud of you," (laughter).  So now I do that (gestures) anytime that's--that means you and I, you know, I'm telling you I'm proud of you.  So that was my television appearance.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 326441
Speaker 1: There is somebody else in--very important in your life besides the governor, your husband.  Could you tell us something about him?
Speaker 2: Very much, very much so.  We met very interestingly.  We were both on the board of Booker T. Washington Community Center.  That's when I say, involved in the community and so--
Speaker 1: Here in San Francisco [California]?
Speaker 2: Yes, here in San Francisco.  I'm a non-driver so people used to vie to bring me home and then Len [Leonard Jones] began to bring me home and he had, he had lived here all along and had had a very interesting life.  He was a [U.S.] military brat.  His father was a Buffalo Soldier and so he grew up partially in Kansas, but they got out here to Berkeley [California] and after World War II [WWII], then he stayed and went to school at the university (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Excuse me, for young children, could you explain what a Buffalo Soldier was?
Speaker 2: A Buffalo Soldier was a soldier of African American descent who was in a platoon out on the prairie and the Indians [Native Americans] called the black soldiers Buffalo Soldiers because of their hair.  They said they had hair like buffalos and so they were, that was the name of honor for them to be a Buffalo Soldier.
Speaker 1: Do you know this, excuse me, what his father's name was?
Speaker 2: Why, Leonard Jones.
Speaker 1: Oh, no, your, his father?
Speaker 2: His father.
Speaker 1: Oh, he was a junior, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then, and so he went there and he grew up in, mostly Fort Riley, Kansas.  He went back to his sixtieth high school reunion and very glad and they all knew one another plus he, there was someone who was in the first grade with him and many, many years ago, she and her husband came to visit San Francisco and she called every Leonard Jones in the book until she found us.  And so now Pearl Rice, she is now a widow and she and Len were in the first grade together at Fort Riley, Kansas but she and I are still good friends.  You know, we talk and we send cards back and forth so that's a very close relationship but it also says something about the two of them that after all those years, she was still looking for this friend and he remembered her immediately and it just started really good relationships.  As Rice, she is, was married to Otha Rice, who was stepfather of Norm--who was father of Norm Rice [HistoryMaker Norman Rice], who was mayor of Seattle [Washington] so it was kind of a little funny circle but anyway, that was (unclear).  So any rate, Len then came out and went to California, went to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], during which time he played on the football team under Pappy Waldorf, the legendary Pappy Waldorf, and he was a guard, was a guard.  I did not know him much during those years and that was one of the years that they went to, the Cal [University of California, Berkeley] team went to the Rose Bowl.  They didn't win, but they went and that was a very important thing.  The University of California meant so much in Len's life and they had been really, opened the world to him in many ways so he gave back in lots of ways.  He was elected and he was one of the vice presidents of finance for the alumni association and he was always included.  We were always going to dinners at the chancellor's home when Bowker [Albert H. Bowker] was there and other things he was involved in on campus.

Speaker 1: He [Morris' husband, Leonard Jones] was in finance and started with Trans-Bay [Trans-Bay Federal Savings and Loan Association, San Francisco, California], which was--
Speaker 2: He was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) a saving and, savings and loan here at--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, back at Cal [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], I'm sorry, back at Cal, he started something that's important.
Speaker 1: Well, later.
Speaker 2: Oh, later, okay.
Speaker 1: He was with Trans-Bay Savings and Loan, which became Fidelity Savings and Loan [Fidelity Savings and Loan Association, San Francisco, California], which became Citicorp [Citicorp Savings, San Francisco, California], so he was with Citicorp when he passed away in 1993.  We were married in 1971.  He had been married before, but had no children.  And so we were married from 1971 until 1993, and we lived here in this house.
Speaker 2: How did you get married?  Where did you get married?
Speaker 1: Hawaii.
Speaker 2: How'd you end up--
Speaker 1: We got married in Honolulu, Hawaii.  One of my children's librarian, my Chinese children's librarian, Jenny Lo [ph.], had married and had moved to Hawaii.  We were getting married there so there wouldn't be a whole lot of fuss and stuff and she, Jenny, I tell you, you train the children's librarian and you really 'cause Jenny's son, oldest son, Kan Ming [ph.] is my godchild, so I'm Kayee [ph.] to the Chinese children in her family.  Anyway, she investigated churches and all around and chose the church.  We were married in the Unitarian church, however there, and we married in Honolulu, and then came back here and did have a reception here, after all, which was quite nice and we moved here in this building and I have lived in this building ever since.  He, in his devotion to the University of California [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], during the civil rights, real pressures during the '60s [1960s], he founded the Black Alumni Club of the University of California, and that was the first ethnic organization.  Now you've got a Chinese and Hispanic, but the Black Alumni was the very first one.  And so he was so dedicated to it.  Oh, they used to have a big dinner and he'd sit at this table and address all those envelopes, wouldn't even let me help to stamp them and worked with that organization and stayed very, very involved with the university and was on other committees.  Now when Chancellor Tien [Chang-Lin Tien] started his Incentive Awards scholarship, Len [Leonard Jones] was one of the group with him and when he died two years later, they dedicated that scholarship to him and then asked me to serve and I served a full, a full term on that committee and had been involved now, well, Early Childhood [Early Childhood Education Program, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] is coming along, and that's going to be something special and Mary Ellen Himmel, who's director of development, has involved me in various aspects, so I'm looking forward to the Early Childhood.  The chancellor started under Berdahl [Robert M. Berdahl] and now the new chancellor's [Robert J. Birgeneau] carrying it on.  So I hope to have approval (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, what exactly are they going to do with Early Childhood?
Speaker 1: Well they have built, they had the groundbreaking last month for a new building and they're going to have the preschool children there and it will be a research as well as a childcare for children but it will be a unique and very fine, I'm looking forward to knowing about it and, because I want to know what are they going to do with books.  It's important; they've got to have books over there (laughter).
Story_ID: 326443
Speaker 1: What are some of your favorite children's books?  Just, I know there are millions--
Speaker 2: That's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) but the top three, four?
Speaker 2: 'The Little Prince' by Antoine Saint-Exupery [Antoine de Saint-Exupery] is children's, it is fantasy, but it is also adult because it is sophisticated knowledge and I've learned it, I learned it by heart in French because I kept buying it and giving it away so I learned it to tell.  As a book, it is certainly one of my favorites.  It has the phrase that I use so often in telling, ending speeches because "It is only with the heart," says the--the fox told the Little Prince, "What is essential is invisible to the eye," and I have liked using that phrase.  That's one I like.  I, I really, I could look over there and I couldn't tell you what I like best or what I remember.  I have enjoyed all of the books about children's literature.  The people who have written, like 'Only Connect[: Readings on Children's Literature'], which is Sheila Egoff from Toronto [Canada], 'Margin for Surprise[: About Books, Children and Libraries'], Ruth Viguers, who was from Canada.  It's the working with children and books, and I like the books about them.  'Summoned by Books[: Essays and Speeches by Frances Clarke Sayers'], which is Frances Clarke Sayers, 'Lose Not the Nightingale' [Frances Clarke Sayers] she says to children's librarians, keep the faith in other words, and oh I've been on other committees like Association for Childhood Education International and we had, and everywhere there were children, I'm seeing that book, that's why I'm telling you that, and [HistoryMaker] Walter Dean Myers is really quite a favorite author of mine these days.  Virginia Hamilton was a favorite and I knew Virginia and now Jaime [Jaime Levi Adoff] is grown because I knew Virginia when she and Arnold [Arnold Adoff] were first married and now to think that Jaime's grown (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's their son?
Speaker 2: --and that Lee [ph.] is over there in Germany and is grown and is singing and let me see who else.  Those are the African Americans I have liked, and I'm just drawing a real blank.  Among one of the things that I always enjoyed was mysteries and I started reading those in Cleveland [Ohio].  I could tell you, you know, if they said that if a person was found underneath the table, well I could tell you what book that was from but I've always liked the British or the French emigres in French and the Peter Wimsey [Lord Peter Wimsey], the British, and now I'm so fond, I'm going to say her name, Donna Leon, who writes these wonderful stories of Venice [Italy] and the police in Venice and because her stories are not only sophisticated but highly intellectual and for some reason I like that challenge and she talks about the waters of Venice, too, which are fascinating.  I've never been to Venice, but it's really fascinating. And then I like the Alexander McCall Smith who writes 'The No. 1 Ladies' Private Detectives' [sic. 'The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency'], and, you know, those, oh, I've read all six.  Aren't they marvelous?  I just love those books, and I bought the others of his books, 'The Philosophy Society' [sic. 'The Sunday Philosophy Club'].  I haven't read those yet but Precious Ramotswe, oh I--wonderful African women, the traditional African women, common sense, with the big lap that she could hold children on.  Oh, just wonderful stories and so I have read all of those and because I've read so many children's books, I haven't had a chance to, you know, really read adult books so now I'm catching up with the adult books.  And those two, Donna Leon and Commissario Brunetti [Commissario Guido Brunetti] in the Donna Leon books and when he gets a call to go to the crime scene, he comes down and gets in the police boat (laughter), and they go on the canals of Venice and it's Italian society and in an interesting way and I have really enjoyed those two authors, very, very much recently.  I haven't read too much in the adult fiction, I--or adult African American.  I've read thoroughly when, for years, I've read Rayford Logan, I read Sterling Brown, I read the people who aren't current now but I've read them all and Carter G. Woodson and in depth because I liked them.
Story_ID: 326444
Speaker 1: --You said you don't read a lot of current authors, but I know you're really interested in what's happening in the world.  You're into hip-hop now.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  (Laughter) I'm going to learn hip-hop.  I'm going to learn with Tupac [Tupac Shakur] and I have met Wu-Tang [Wu-Tang Clan].
Speaker 1: That's right, it's over on the other side.
Speaker 2: Oh, Wu-Tang, I went to hear him speak, and I am very much impressed by Wu-Tang and Jamake Steptoe [sic. John Steptoe], who's a children's author, oh, comes to the farm for the various meetings and things we've had there at Children's--I haven't talked about that, the Children's Defense Fund, and he always brings along this tape recorder and music and he tells me what to listen to.  I have not yet learned it, but I'm trying, and then at this last wonderful meeting at the farm, which was the Proctor Institute [Samuel DeWitt Proctor Institute for Child Advocacy Ministry], now the farm is Alex Haley's farm in Clinton, Tennessee, it belongs to the Children's Defense Fund and Marian, every year, [HistoryMaker] Marian Wright Edelman, has the Proctor Institute, named for Samuel Proctor, who was president of Virginia Union [Virginia Union University], I believe, in Richmond, Virginia, and it, this is in his memory.  So this Proctor Institute invites people from the community, various ministers and other people who are working with children, are being advocates for children for time at the farm, which is just a glorious experience.  People stay in some of the cottages on the farm and they stay mostly in motels around.  Also at the same time are the students from the Freedom Schools, for the Freedom Schools.  These are college students who go out and teach the Freedom Schools in the summertime and there are about two hundred of them and they stay in the University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee] dormitories.  And so it was Sam Moss, oldest Moss, the third [Otis Moss III], whose sermon this year included literature from the Greeks through hip-hop.  I am so impressed, I am so impressed and I bought the tapes and can't tell where I have got one.  I know I've lent one to someone, she's got to send that tape back but I just, it was wonderful and it's not that, I know people think hip-hop is evil and it might be but I don't know because I haven't had a chance to understand it and learn about it and I want to learn about it before I say, no I don't believe in hip-hop, but it's the language of this generation and if you're going to stay current, I used to say to the children's librarians, now look at it like this, you're right in the middle, you've got one foot in the past, one foot in the future and so somehow you're standing up, but don't forget you're always five years, there's a generation in the life of a child and we have to think always five years ahead.
Story_ID: 326445
Speaker 1: What are your views on the current field of children's literature, or children's librarians are?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Public lib--
Speaker 2: Children's librarians are caught up as everyone is, in the technology.  And so, of course, they make great use of the technology at--within their work, the reference and all that sort of thing.  I know very little about that, although just as I left I had set up the ordering system for children so that you could switch it over to computer ordering and I did that because I had, as a pattern, the Toronto Public Library [Toronto, Canada] was already into it, and they sent me all the information, how to do it, so I left it for them.  So now, everything is dependent on the technology.  The words are technology, computers, literacy, visual literacy, hip-hop.  I don't know, I think the technology is a means toward an end, and yet at the same time I was listening to a broadcast about the iPods today and what the iPods can offer.  So when you think iPod and communi- and computer, you're thinking very differently.
Speaker 1: And books.
Speaker 2: I haven't learned, I haven't figured out how to think that differently.  For a while, when I had, I wouldn't even let anybody know I could type.  I had a secretary.  I didn't dictate to her, I wrote the letters out but I never typed and then you get into the computer and, of course, you have to type but I had a computer in 1980 when Adam Osborne did the very first portable computers and I had a portable computer and that came out of meeting Adam Osborne at the English-Speaking Union [English-Speaking Union of the United States] conference on the state of the language, and that was, that was 1980.  Mary Ellen Himmel was executive director.  So I got a computer right after that and that was a wonderful, wonderful computer but, of course, you couldn't get on the Internet so--
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: --I had to discard that but to come back to books, I should be going in November to a meeting of the curriculum committee for the Freedom Schools and I was talking to Robin Salley [ph.] and saying I haven't been reading enough.  The literature these days is very raw and violent and I would like to find a way through it, but I don't think you can really judge what a book is like unless you're really working with children and I have not been working directly with children so I don't have that instinctive feel plus, you know, the children just vibrate.  You get the feeling from them.  They may be telling you one thing but you know that it's not what they mean.  So a lot of these new books are very, very raw and people would say, but we want to read about people who are like us and I say, look, if you read one book a week from the time you're five years old, we won't even talk about before five, if you read one book a week, that would be fifty-two weeks, and if you read from five to fourteen, then you are eight years old, eight years of reading, eight times fifty-two is only, now my arithmetic is gone--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --eight times fifty-two is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 466.
Speaker 2: 464, yeah--
Speaker 1: --466 [sic. 416].
Speaker 2: That's 466 books for eight years of reading.  We, let's say five hundred because people may have read to you before and you are fourteen years old, you've read five hundred books, or come in contact with five hundred, five thousand new books are published for children each year.  Do you see why it is important what you read?  You don't have time to read everything that's published but you also can't move away from books entirely and so I don't know what the iPods going to do to these children or what the e-Book is going to do, either, because I don't think they are any e-Books yet for children.
Speaker 1: That's books that are on electronic, digitized books, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, you know, Stephen King, everybody knows he did an e-Book, but I don't think there are any for children, and I should feel very sorry.  I would not like to see 'Peter Rabbit' ['The Tale of Peter Rabbit,' Beatrix Potter] on an e-Book--
Speaker 1: Tell me about holding a book.
Speaker 2: --you've got to hold it in your hands, and so that's some of the things.  As far as libraries are concerned, they're busier than ever and people are actually reading books, although you get the feeling that they're not.  I don't know what the stock markets says about publishing and so forth.  I don't think they're, oh, they're doing all right but they probably aren't making these huge, huge profits.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: But they are also publishing a great many books that have a Disney influence, and so it is very interesting if you can get a fine art influence in the publishers--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that you're dealing with.
Story_ID: 325090
Speaker 1: You love to travel--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you've been to, I know you've been to Africa and you've been to London [England] and Paris [France].  Could you just quickly mention a few more places that you really loved to, to go to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I would, yeah, I am, I really need to get back to London.  I really had a fascinating time in London by myself and I go to Paris alone.  People look at me and say, "You travel alone?"  I do travel, but then I have friends where I'm going.  I would not be in the city where I didn't know anybody and you can always find somebody to know but I loved Paris, every minute, everything about Paris and my very good friend is Mamie Wheatley Brown, [HistoryMaker] Anne Brown's sister. I loved--
Speaker 1: And Anne Brown is--
Speaker 2: Anne Brown is the first Bess in 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin].  She sang the Bess to Todd Duncan's Porgy, and then I go to Munich [Germany] to see my friends in Munich, and we would go around in Germany and so I have good friends there.  And then this past year, I went to Cape Town [South Africa].  I went to a conference at IBBY, International Board on Books for Youth [International Board on Books for Young People] in Cape Town and came back and mentioned to the--National Coalition of 100 Black Women that I'd like to gather a few books and send them to the Delft Public Library [Cape Town, South Africa].  Well they made a project out of it and it was incredible and wonderful.  We sent one hundred black books from 100 Black Women to the Delft Public Library in Cape Town, South Africa and I've been to other, I've been to Senegal, one of my favorite, favorite countries and I love Nairobi [Kenya] and I've been to Loo- I've been to Togo, and I've been to the Ivory Coast [Cote d'Ivoire] and I've been to Liberia, and those countries on the (unclear).  I have not, you know, have crossed the border to Mexico and I've been to Canada.
Speaker 1: My.
Speaker 2: If next year maybe I can get to Beijing [China] because International Board on Books for Children will be meeting in Beijing and I would hope to go there.  There will also be, for the first time, a Conference of Librarians of Color [Joint Conference of Librarians of Color], which will be in Dallas [Texas] and I would like to go there, otherwise my sister [Mary Morris Pettiford] is in Richmond, Virginia and when I get on an airplane, no matter where I go, I usually come back to Richmond, Virginia and I have loved that.  As I said, it's been an interesting life and it has been much, much longer than I thought, but I keep going on and on and we have good genes is what people say, and the doctor says we--, "You're going to be here."  Well, I'll be here a while longer.  I've got shoes and clothes that I want to wear--
Speaker 1: And you've got your hats.
Speaker 2: --oh, and then, of course, I mentioned clothes that I want to wear out and hats.  I'll never be able to wear all the hats I want to but I started in New York [New York].  Of course, as a middle westerner, you wear hats and you wear them in New York and when I first came to San Francisco [California], they, people wore hats.  Now I wear them truly for a practical reason because if I am out and in any open public facility, if there is an air conditioning vent in the whole room, I'm under it, and so I wear them (laughter) a little bit as protection against the cold but I just like them.
Speaker 1: What's your title?
Speaker 2: Madame Chapeau--
Speaker 1: Madame Chapeau.
Speaker 2: --which the Alliance Francaise conferred upon me in an evening meeting and the award, the prize for that was three hats from three designers.  So I have three hats from three San Francisco designers in my closet.
Story_ID: 325091
Speaker 1: The Western Addition [Western Addition Branch Library, San Francisco Public Library, San Francisco, California] is going to name their children's room after you.
Speaker 2: In the future (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What other plans do you have for the future?  Could--
Speaker 2: Well, I need to stay home a while because I need to really go through papers and get things discarded and get things organized at, not decided where all these owls are going, nor have I decided where all the books are going plus I have papers and while, right now, nobody's interested, five years from now, somebody's going to do a dissertation and needs some of the stuff I've got.  So I've got to figure out where to put many of these different things.  I have given the Cleveland Public Library [Cleveland, Ohio], though, the papers that I had when working in Cleveland [Ohio] because those were in Richmond [Virginia] and I was able to get them.  I have the New York Public Library [New York, New York], which I have not yet given to them and then, of course, everything that goes along with San Francisco's [San Francisco, California] out here.  They have duplicates of many of the things that I have so I don't have to give them and I can give the duplicates to somebody else but any rate, then those are some of the plans but really, going places comes up.  As I said, I should be going to the farm [in Clinton, Tennessee] in November.  In May, I won a prize.  I never win anything.  I have always worked for it.  I won a round trip ticket on Southwest Airlines [Southwest Airlines Co.] to any place they go.  So I've got to use it before it expires.  So I will do domestic travel.  I'm really not planning to go abroad anymore.
Story_ID: 325092
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a catalyst who made a difference and that could extend anywhere, in any area where I have been in contact with people but I would hope that it would benefit children no matter what.
Speaker 1: Well I'm going to thank you.  This has been wonderful.  It was so, I'm so delighted to have met you.  It's been a great honor.  I'm going to thank you for being so gracious by letting us come into your home and move everything around and just talking with you.  It's been wonderful.  Thank you so very, very much.
Speaker 2: Well it has been that way for me, too (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Speaker 2: --and I want to say that, there I go, covering up the microphone.  It's a wonder I kept my hands fairly still during all this time which is really kind of amazing but this has been a fascinating, fascinating time--
Speaker 1: Well, good, I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Speaker 2: --and I just am so proud of the kind of thing that you can do and the way people respond, and I'm responding to you in this way, and to you, too, Scott [Scott Stearns], only you're over there, and it has been a wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: Well, good, I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Speaker 2: And I think the whole concept of The HistoryMakers is an unusual concept, which is really of the time.  It is needed because a lot of people who've made a difference and who should be remembered and who are going to be remembered will be, where there is a reference to them, where there is a source because it's important, so important.  I think of all the different people I've known, all the books I've known and things like that.  So, thank you very much (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Thank you, thank you.
