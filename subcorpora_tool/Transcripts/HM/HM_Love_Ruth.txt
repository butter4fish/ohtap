Story_ID: 60422
Speaker 1: Now, I'd like to start out by, let's talk about your mother [Burnett Love], and I'd like to have her name and what you know about her background and where she grew up?
Speaker 2: My mother was Burnett Love, born in Oklahoma.  I was born in the same house she was born in, in Oklahoma; Lawton, Oklahoma.  And she was one of the younger of five children, I guess, next to the baby, I guess, in the family.  She grew up in a very enterprising family.  Her father was much older.  Her mother taught school, and her father taught school, after a fashion, and that doesn't mean they had to go to school to teach school, but she grew up with a real thirst for education and was very interested until she met my father [Alvin Love], and life changed considerably.  She was married rather young and moved to a rural part of Oklahoma, because by that time they were living--they had moved from Lawton into Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] and what have you.  Then she moved to a small town, Tishomingo [Oklahoma], where three of my siblings were born.  Then they moved to California.  Primarily looking for that rainbow in the sky, and she worked along with my dad, he was a contractor in Bakersfield, California, and she worked along with him.  And I would say she was my first mentor.  She had a profound impact on me.  I never once felt I couldn't do something because she--she had that core of steel, as it were, you are as good as anybody else, you are as smart as they are, don't bring me any Bs, just bring me As, you know, this kind of thing, and it was very, very helpful, very, very helpful to me.
Story_ID: 60423
Speaker 1: Did she [Burnett Love] share with you, or did you know much about her family and the background or the history of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting.  I knew up to the point that the ancestors became white, and then she didn't want to share anymore about that.  You know it was really something she was very embarrassed about.  But I knew her father, you know, I knew a lot about him.  And I knew her mother, less about her mother's family, because you can't go very far without running into slavery and all that that meant to her.  But her father [Andrew A. Williams] was born in slavery.  That's how--was born in 18, was it 50 something.  Anyway, the story goes that he ran away. He was a boy and his mother was enslaved and he was helping his mom carry water, she had--she had a pail in each hand and one on the head.  And so he decided to help her cause she was struggling.  And it was discovered and he was chastised and told, tomorrow you'll have a job to do.  And in his little child's mind, I guess he was supposed to be nine or ten years old, that's the story.  He said if I have a job that means I'm a slave, so he ran away at that early age and had some really horrible experiences.  But ultimately, found his way to Oklahoma, this was in Mississippi.  Found his way to Oklahoma and worked at all kind of jobs, first for food and then for education and what have you, and helped to start Langston University [Langston, Oklahoma].  So it's a very, very rich background from his standpoint.  He went back some years later and--to get his mom and she still thought she was enslaved, this was after the Emancipation Proclamation [1863].  So he brought her to live with him, but she couldn't quite adjust to up north, if you can think of Oklahoma as being up north.  But I know a lot about--about that side of the family, but I don't know nearly as much about my maternal grandmother.  I knew her brother.  I don't know very much else about them.
Speaker 1: And when you said that there was this (unclear)
Speaker 2: Yes, well, she came to live with me.  She passed away five years ago, but she lived with me for ten years, so I got--I was able to get into some of that.  In fact, I recorded her, I taped her.  I've been looking for the tapes, upstairs someplace.  But she--she said that, and these are stories, so you don't know the complete validity of them, that her grandmother, her maternal grandmother, was the daughter of the slave owner, and I don't know whether there was ever a marriage to anybody else, but she had a number of children, including my grandmother.  And mother said that she always disliked the fact that she was actually raped and impregnated.  And so she--she didn't--she didn't want to talk very much about it, but she did tell her children about it in her later years.  Now, my grandmother told my mother in her later years, and my mother told me in her later years.  It was very interesting how it was passed down.  She didn't go into a great deal of detail.  She did have a photograph of this woman though, of which she gave to me.  All of my childhood I had never seen that photograph.  I mean, it is amazing that this was sort of kept.  And it came out at a family reunion when I was trying to do some family research.  And I had quite a lot on my dad's side, and I said, well, now let's get into these Williamses and this side, and she went back and looked up a trunk and found all these things that she shared with me.  That her grandmother knew she was a slave, even though she could pass, she refused to pass.  She absolutely refused.  She refused to pass.  And I guess she got an education by his sending her away to school someplace and for that period of time, I think, she did pass, but not--it wasn't something that she did on a daily basis, that was not her lifestyle, which was very interesting.
Story_ID: 60424
Speaker 1: Do you know if there's any evidence of American Indian in your family?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Cherokee, on my dad's [Alvin Love] side, his grandmother, whom I knew.  His grandmother died when I was a sophomore at the university.  So she was a (unclear).  We didn't have no idea of the age.  I mean she was just always old.  And she was Native American, she was Indian Cherokee, partially, enough to have gotten land and had a big farm that she ran herself.  So that's very much a part of the family.  And she talked about it a lot when we would trusk(ph) to Oklahoma to visit her.  She would have a lot of conversation and periodically would make Indian food and serve us.  But most of the time she cooked soul food.  But she did make some kind of corn meal dish and that sort of thing for us.
Story_ID: 60425
Speaker 1: Now, your father, can you give his name and tell also a little bit more about his growing up?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Alvin Love.  He was born near Tishomingo, Oklahoma to Edward and Ida Love.  He was the second of thirteen children.  And he had not much education, but a great spirit, a very enterprising man and knew early on that you could never make a real living just going to work, you had to own something.  And so he instilled in us this philosophy that in addition to whatever your work is that you enjoy and what have you, you should own something, in addition to your house, you've gotta have property or you gotta have a little business on the side, you've gotta do something else.  And it's very interesting cause all of us did, we went to school and whatever, but you always had something else that you were tinkering with.  An interesting story about him, his brothers and sisters were in Oklahoma, of course, and every year, during my childhood, one of them would come to live with us.  And they would live with us for sometimes up to a year, bring their children and you know all would come and live.  And I would watch him show them how to make it in California, how to work, how to save your money, open up account, bank account here, a checking account, savings account and then he would suggest that they rent a place.  And we had rent houses, if something was available, they would rent that.  Then he'd say, you ought to buy something.  But it was--(unclear) not to ring.  I think there were only two that did not come out to live with him.  Now all of those people, so you can see over a period of years--I don't ever recall living in our home without having someone else living with us.  It's amazing.  Actually, as an adult I grew to really appreciate it.  As a child I didn't think much of it, cause I didn't want to share my bed, my room.  But it really is a wonderful thing that he did for his family and with his family.  And he didn't think he was putting himself out.  That was just the way you do it.  If he needed to go down and get them, he'd go down and get 'em and bring them out.  He had a good spirit in that way.
Story_ID: 60426
Speaker 1: Now, do you--you said your parents actually--do you know how they met?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  My father's [Alvin Love] oldest sister had married and moved to Lawton [Oklahoma], near Lawton.  And his brother, just immediately under him, went out to visit her and decided, well, he would stay.  And somehow this brother, this Uncle Albert, we called him, met my mother's brother, and they became life-long friends.  I mean life-long friends. So my dad's mother [Ida Love] said, you go out and see what's going on out there, why is he staying out there, you know?  Look after your brother, your little brother.  And so he went out to look after his brother and met my mother [Burnett Love].  And he met my mother when he came to the house to see about his brother.  So that's how they met.  And he said, immediately, he knew that was the person he was going to marry, immediately, but she didn't know that, but he knew that.
Speaker 1: And was she younger?  You said she was--
Speaker 2: Well, she said they married young.
Speaker 1: --Young, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know the age.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, you were--you said you were born in Lawton, but you actually moved away when you were an infant.  So you really don't have any memory?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have no memory of it.
Speaker 1: And your parents moved because it was a--you know, they were looking for more opportunities?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, no, they moved to my father's home area in Oklahoma first, and that was enough to motivate you to move to California or any other place.  I mean, that was a powerfully motivating factor in getting out.  Their first house, though, I saw, he built it down in rural Oklahoma, and it lasted a long time, you know, lasted a long time.  But I can see why California would look very good.
Speaker 1: And do you know how they ended up choosing, did they come to--
Speaker 2: No, my father came first.  You know that was a tradition.  The man would go out and sort of test it out and see, sort of feel around and send money home and then eventually go back and get the family.  So that's what my dad did.  I think he worked in the Richmond Shipyards first and then somehow migrated to Bakersfield [California] and was really able to make and save quite a lot of money by standards, so he would say.  And he went back to get the family.
Story_ID: 60427
Speaker 1: And so you have really no memory of the--you were still young to have memory of them?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, no, I remember coming--I don't know exactly, but maybe six or seven.
Speaker 1: And do you remember how it appeared to you at that age?
Speaker 2: How?
Speaker 1: California, Bakersfield, how it appeared.  I mean, how--cause you know sometimes--
Speaker 2: Well, we were--and I don't quite remember how we got there, but we were at my grandmother's house in Oklahoma.  Maybe we came up to Oklahoma--up to Oklahoma City [Oklahoma], I don't really know how we got there, but we were there when we moved to California.  And we weren't staying there long 'cause I don't have a recollection of that.  But I know that he [Alvin Love] came and moved us in a truck.  And when I got to California, it seemed vast to me.  It just seemed bigger than anything.  I mean, it just--it was like the wilderness.  Part of that had to do with driving through and seeing all the desert and you know that sort of thing.  But when we arrived in this place called Bakersfield, it just seemed enormous to me.  It just--it wasn't rural, but it wasn't urban either, it was just big.  And you know in my little mind it was big.  And my mother [Burnett Love] and dad knew this one family there, because they were friends of my mother's mother, my grandmother.  So we had, you know, someone that we knew and they--dad had made contact and they had gotten us a house and that sort of thing.  But I just thought it was the biggest place in the world and when they talked about going to school, we thought, oh, it's so far, you know.  And we--it wasn't far, now that I realize it, it wasn't far.  But it just seemed to me, it was just huge.  That's my biggest recollection of coming to California.  And you have all this mysticism about California anyway in those years, you know, that everybody was rich.  Now that was one big disappointment, because I didn't meet any of these rich people right away, and I thought, well, where are they?  These people don't look rich and I don't know how I expected them to look, but I didn't have the impression they were wealthy, and so I was a little disappointed in that.  The other disappointment I had, I didn't see very many orange trees.  And I had been led to believe there were oranges everywhere in California.  I didn't see any for quite some time.  So that, those are some of my recollections.
Story_ID: 60428
Speaker 1: Now, in your family, there are--you have four other siblings, right?
Speaker 2: They're all deceased.
Speaker 1: Can you give their names in chronological order and where you fit in?
Speaker 2: I'm number two.  My brother was Alvin Love, Jr. and then immediately under me was Alfonso Love and then Alfred Love and my sister was Ida Love Barrington.
Speaker 1: So all the boys had As.
Speaker 2: They were all As, A-L.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They liked those A-Ls, but they were named after somebody.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were all named after somebody, uh-huh.
Story_ID: 60429
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, do you---let me--if you take yourself back to those early days in California, can you say what sight, smells or sounds really remind you of your childhood, growing up?
Speaker 2: What sights.  I have very strong feelings about a sound, my father [Alvin Love] getting up at the crack of dawn, walking heavily through the house every morning and it had to be five o'clock, or something like that.  Now that's a sound that's very familiar.  The thump, thump, thump through the house.  And I don't know why it was necessary to walk so many times back and forth through the house.  That has very profound memories for me.  Smells, oh, wonderful.  My mom [Burnett Love] was just a specialist at making homemade rolls.  And coming home from school and to have that aroma meet you at the door was just wonderful.  So we'd bring in other kids because we knew she was baking that day and it was just a wonderful aroma.  That's a smell that stays with me today.  Mine don't quite smell like that, I don't think, but I got the recipe.
Story_ID: 60430
Speaker 1: Now, the other thing, what would you say you were like as a young person?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was very different from the way I am today.  First I was shy and I was quiet and I think primarily because I was a reader, so I used reading to escape from anything I didn't like and I used reading to find happiness and travel and I'd travel through books and I, oh, I just did everything through books.  So I was always sitting someplace reading.  That's one thing that I remember.  My mother [Burnett Love] would say, I don't know if you're really shy or you just think you don't have anything important to say.  Well, that got me to talking.  If she thinks I don't have anything important to say, I'll have to show her a thing or two, you know.  And I think that was her strategy--I think that was her strategy, because by the time I went away to school, she said well, there was a time when I wondered if you had any friends because you didn't talk, now you talk entirely too much.  So it was kind of a little joke in the family.  I was a very obedient, to use an old-fashioned word, child.  I didn't want to disappoint my parents.  And because I was one of the older kids, they instilled in us this responsibility to do well because the other children will follow what you do.  So my brother and I always had this heavy load we were carrying that you had to excel.  Now, sometimes he would stray away, he would react against it more than I.  But at the same time there was a lot of stroking and a lot of encouragement too.  I mean, it wasn't just, you know a harsh thing.
Story_ID: 60431
Speaker 1: My mother [Burnett Love] was very close to me and my sister [Ida Barrington].  We were like three peas in a pod.  I mean she would--she hovered over us, you know, take us where we needed to go.  Make sure that we had what we needed, she was really very much involved in our lives.  Sometimes I think the boys felt to the exclusion of them, but she wanted her girls protected.  And so she did everything possible to see that that occurred.  I guess I was studious, I would say.  And I always knew that I would go to university, even though my eighth--I went to a school where you graduate from the eighth grade and you go to a four-year high school.  When I went to my high school, the first day, the counselor said, somehow I don't know how she determined this, except with bias, but she said, well, I'm putting you in this--this track.  I had never heard that word, that--this track, because you won't be going to college, so you can learn domestic science.  I said well, what is domestic science?  And she said oh, that's learning to cook.  And so I said, oh no, no, I already know enough about that.  I don't want to do that.  And I said, but I am going to college.  And she said, oh, oh, I don't think so.  She said, I don't think so.  And I said, well, I think so.  And she said, well, why do you think so, and I said because my mother and father [Alvin Love] say I have to go and they expect me to go.  Well, see, we puttin you in this class.  So I came home that day very disillusioned with high school, I was ready to be a drop out.  And my mother said, don't take the bus in the morning, I'll drive you to school.  Well, you don't want your mother driving you to school, you know.  But you know, had she not done that, I probably would have dropped out, you know, I probably would have, because this woman was determined.  Now I learned something from this experience.  My mother didn't go to see the counselor, she went to the principal, and she said, you wait here, and I was so embarrassed because the kids see you walking with your mother in high school, you know, and that supposed to be grown up.  But when she came out, somehow the counselor had gotten into that office.  I guess it must have been another door or something.  And just automatically, I was placed in the top track.
Speaker 2: And years later, years later, I was giving a speech to the California Guidance and Counseling Association.  And so I was telling them about the enormous responsibility they have to lift the horizons of students and to nurture them and to push them to succeed and to go into territories unknown and blah, blah, you know.  And I said because I had an experience that could have really damaged me, so I told the story.  In the middle of the story, I looked back there and there she sits.  I thought the woman was long gone from this world.  And there she sits there, old.  I didn't call their names, I just told the experience.  And I said I often asked, what would have happened had my mother [Burnett Love] not gone to school, because there were a lot of mothers of my peers who did not go to school.  I said, I really often ask that question and I also asked how many other youngsters were guided into these lower tracks of elementary school math and cooking and sewing, not that there's anything wrong with that, but  you--you have lots of options, you have a choice.  Well, afterwards there was great applause and what have you and afterwards, she came up and waited until everybody shook my hand and she said do you remember me, I said, oh, yes, I remember you.  Because somehow she wasn't my counselor anymore, they assigned me to someone else, who was a wonderful woman who became a friend of mine all these years.  She said you know your mother really taught me a lesson.  I said I'll bet she did.  She said you know I had never known any black people who had gone to college, so I just assumed they didn't want to go.  And I said well that's a pretty--pretty narrow assumption.  She said, oh, I know, I know that.  And I said, what exactly did my mother say to you, because my mother never shared with me what she said, you know she just--she fixed it and said all you do is study.  Well she said my mother said a lot of things, but the thing that she remembers, she says, I have some other children that are coming along.  I will see that they do their work, but you see that they get in the top classes, if you have anything to do with it, 'cause they're all going to university.  Now if they do anything they shouldn't do, I want to let me know, but don't ever assume that my children will not go to school.  And she said it was like something lifted my eyes. I just didn't know it was possible.  I said so you didn't really think black children had the ability to go to school?  She said, I guess that's really what I felt at the time.  So then I asked her well what was your behavior afterwards, and she said, oh I--I definitely had a different view afterwards.  And she said my mother referred her to some book.  I don't know what book she asked her to read.  But that was an interesting experience, which really is a pivotal thing in my life, 'cause I could have gone either way, and of course, my brothers and sisters came along and they avoided that woman, that name.  If she were assigned to them, they got rid of her right away.
Story_ID: 60432
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe family life sort of growing up, any favorite stories or anecdotes, you know, things that happened?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we were--the children were very close in age.  There was only--we had five children and there were six years' difference between the youngest and the oldest, so they were busy with those six years, kids, kids, kids.  So that meant we were, you know, we were very close in age and we played together a lot.  In fact our neighbor child would say, you know, you Love kids have such a good time.  She was an only child.  And she says you act like you don't need anybody else, 'cause we had a basketball hoop, and you know, we just did things together, so then we begin to include her.  We didn't know she felt that way.  But I think that's one of my favorite memories is playing together and talking together and then doing homework every night around the dining room table.  You didn't get out of that, no matter how you tried, everybody sat around, after you played, after you've eaten and all that, you had to do your homework.  That's, that's one of the things I remember in the house.
Story_ID: 62688
Speaker 1: You were telling some anecdotes of family life, were there any others?
Speaker 2: Well, this is, this is kind of an experience.  For a number of years, during the summer, we would pile in the car drive to Oklahoma.  And I vowed if I ever became an adult, I would never drive longer than a 100 miles, and I don't.  Because we'd sit in the car, after we ate the fried chicken and all that business, and sang and worried my parents to death then we'd get irritable because it was too long.  And in those days you couldn't use the restroom facilities, they were the black and white, no, colored and white, and all that nonsense.  You couldn't stop at the restaurants and, you know, all that so it was a hassle.  So we'd get enough gas to go as far as we could.  My dad [Alvin Love] knew exactly where you could stop and that sort of thing.  But once we got there, we enjoyed ourselves, you know, we really enjoyed it.  We would visit my mother's [Burnett Love] family and then we would visit my dad's grandmother, cause his mother died early.  We would visit, you know, this Indian lady and have her tell us all these wild stories and scare us to death.  But I remember those very well, because when we were coming home, we were joyous.  We loved being there, but we loved coming home, and we always had a car.  We always had a car, but they worked very hard, I must say, my parents worked very hard.  And we often had new cars.  Now we didn't have everything we needed, we weren't rich at all, we weren't even middle class.  But somehow if we were gon take long trips, he would save that as a priority.  I'm not going in any car, it's gonna break down the road, and sit on the road with my children, because he was very conscious of the racial situation, and he didn't want us exposed the harshness of that, unnecessarily.  You know, he would explain it to us.  But that's one of my pleasant memories, both pleasant and unpleasant, when we would be agitated because we hadn't gotten there yet, and we never liked to go through Texas, because it was too big and you couldn't get through.  So we'd always say, go the other way, you know, if you go one route, you don't go through it and you know that sort of thing, but I don't take 'em, I don't take these long trips in cars.  That instilled in me, no, no, get on the plane.
Story_ID: 62689
Speaker 1: Now the other thing, what elementary school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Lincoln Elementary School [Bakersfield, California].
Speaker 1: Lincoln Elementary.  Okay.  And was there any teacher that influenced you there, or what was that experience like?
Speaker 2: The teachers there were just okay, with the exception of one, Miss Fray was absolutely my favorite teacher.  And she--afterwards I realized she was the favorite teacher of everybody who had her, in my family, and in other families.  She was a wonderful teacher.  She was, she was kind of old then, but I guess, maybe seventh grade, sixth, seventh grade, she taught social studies, but she started every class by reading to us about ten minutes.  And we weren't accustomed to people reading to us like that.  So I would sit--and she read about Les Miserables, that's when I first learned about it.  And she'd stop just at the part where you'd want to know.  And then the next day, she'd go--oh, it was just wonderful.  But by the time she finished reading, you were ready to do whatever she said.  And she would draw parallels from that book, was it fair that John Valjean stole a loaf of bread and what kind of justice--so we'd get into the lesson for the day.  She was a wonderful teacher.  I'm sure I had other good teachers, but they don't stand out in my mind the way she, she does.
Story_ID: 62690
Speaker 1: Now you said you enjoyed reading?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: When did that love of reading sort of come about, was that something that you know you think your mother [Burnett Love] instilled in you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it was from my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah, I think it was from my mother.  She would have these little sayings about what reading does for you, you know, reading makes a ready person.  If you want to know anything, read about it before you try to discuss it, don't talk about things you don't know anything about, so go look it up, you know.  She had all these little things that motivated you.  And she always allowed us to go to the library.  The library, in my little community, was at the "Y", at the Y--WYMCA cause we had this little long building and they had the books.  And so she'd say, go to the library and get some books and read on the weekends and you know, after you had your chores and all that, cause you weren't going out anyplace, so reading became something you could do.  That was another experience in childhood that was very meaningful, we had a "Y" worker, a Manley Johnson, who was a young man just out of university and he just had all kind of activities for us at the "Y" and including the library.  This is where I learned to make my first public speech, really was at the "Y".  He would build your confidence and he loved the fact that my mother looked after us.  We could not even walk--it was only maybe three blocks from my house.  My mother would take us in the car, or she'd have one of my brothers walk us down there.  I mean, that shows you the protection that she--they say they can walk by themselves, but she, no, no, you have to be with somebody who's gonna protect you.  And it was not the most positive community, you know, a lots of things could happen, so she wanted to be sure.  But whenever we were there after nine o'clock, she came to get us.  She would sit there until it was time for us to go.  We never walked there alone.  I've never walked those three blocks, even as an adult alone.  So there's something about that.  But as fate would have it, because the library was so important, and everybody knew that I was really one of the ones who would help them order more books and that sort of thing, my hometown named the library after me, a county library, which was very nice, very, very nice.  I feel very honored by--of all the honors, I think having a library named after me is just so special, just a wonderful thing.

Speaker 1: Now what was Bakersfield, as a community, what was it like to grow up there?  Was it--you know I'm just wondering--was it, was it--Were there black and whites, was it more diverse, you know.  It seems more in that part of the country, there's a more diverse community, but I just wanted--
Speaker 2: The black community was fairly segregated.  With--there was a black community then there was a Mexican-Hispanic community, and sometimes there was mixture, but there were very few whites in our neighborhood.  And you didn't go downtown that much except to shop.  Bakersfield [Califronia] was populated by people from Oklahoma, Arkansas, a little Alabama and therefore people brought their southern habits with them.  And there was a good amount of discrimination there, in lots of ways, restaurants and that sort of thing.  My father [Alvin Love], I recall my father taking us out to dinner, which was very unusual in those days, but he took us out to dinner and the waitress just ignored us.  So finally, my father asked for the manager, and then they gave us a seat right away.  So we ordered--we looked at the menu, we didn't know how to order the--he said whatever you want, order it.  And after we ordered it, and they were about to bring it out he stood up, he said let's go kids.  And that was to teach us, he said, you don't ever let anybody mistreat you.  Now they can do whatever they want with that food, but we're not eating it, and I'm not paying for it.  How do I know what they've done to the food?  And that was a very interesting thing.  We said well why didn't you just walk out?  Oh, no, no, you have to teach lessons.  So that was one of the lessons he taught.  And I think from those kind of experiences, I learned how to stand up for my rights and how to articulate my concerns without getting loud and boisterous, but you know, make your points in whatever way you could make your point, and express your displeasure when something is not right for you, and without giving a long lecture on it.  That's kind of what we did.  And we went to another restaurant and had dinner.
Story_ID: 62692
Speaker 1: You know when you were saying you are a reader, what kinds of things did you like reading at that time in your early years?
Speaker 2: Oh, I read like "Little Women" and all those kind of books, yeah, I read all those classic kind of books.  And my mother [Burnett Love] insisted that we get some books about black people at the library.  So she said where are the books about George Washington Carver and all these kinds of people.  So we started ordering them and then I read all those, you know.  But that's when I first read about black people doing things, you know, 'cause you certainly had nothing at school, absolutely nothing.  I didn't have a black teacher.  I didn't have a black teacher at all.  No, I have not had a black teacher.  But then she began to buy us some of the, some of the books.  But we would have to go to Los Angeles [California] to get the books 'cause they didn't have them in the stores.  So we had relatives in Los Angeles, so when we'd go down there, we would buy some books and bring them back.  She really wanted us to know about who we were as black people, without being overbearing about it, you know, she wanted you to be proud of it and the things that we'd done and the accomplishments against the odds and what slavery meant and what it had done to us.  And you know as I look back on it now, it was a very rich--rich experience because, you know, you don't think your parents know all that much, but now that I look back, they were very smart, you know when I--when I look back on it because your sense of self-worth, your esteem, your pride in who you are and the way you look.  It grows out of what your family affirms in you as a child, and my mother would always say, you're beautiful and you look good, so stand tall.  I was tall so I wanted to (indicating leaning over) you know.  Oh, no, oh, no, she'd say.  Look how graceful you are, skinny, skinny little thing, you know.  I didn't think that at all.  But you know she kept telling me, pretty soon I began to believe it.  You know, so it was really a very positive affirming kind of thing.  Now you didn't want to get on the bad side now, she could--she could have another side, but she was really very good as far as exposing us to the variety of accomplishments of black people, but not to the exclusion, she liked the other books as well, she wanted you to know a lot about people.
Speaker 1: Well, that's pretty good and it probably harkens back to her teacher, you know, training and also from the south.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Yeah, see she knew a lot about that from her father.  See he was a staunch race man, staunch race man, having come out of slavery, you know, he was (unclear).  And he died you know, she was an adult by the time he died, but she learned a lot from him and she passed that along to us.  She'll talk about slavery and one of her frustrations was that you couldn't find any books about slavery.  They didn't have them for children to read.  We couldn't find any.  But she'd tell us these stories, so we felt we knew a lot about it.
Story_ID: 62693
Speaker 1: So what were the things she [Burnett Love] would say about it, I mean, her perspective on it and where she positioned it?
Speaker 2: First of all she--she felt that there's a tendency for people to need to have someone to step on. That's how she characterized it.  She said, just a lot of people feel that way, they don't call it slavery, but people, some people need to feel superior to other people.  And they're not all white, she said.  So don't ever carry yourself in such a way that you feel you have to step on, she would use that word, and you envisioned putting your foot on these persons.  You don't have to live that way.  And she felt that slavery grew out of a need to exploit what was perceived to be the physical strengths of Africans.  And you know, she didn't embellish it the way we do today, but she said they were strong and they could take the sun and they could take the work, and she had it right about the Indians.  She said and the Indians didn't want to do that so they--she wasn't sure whether the Indians didn't outsmart them by saying we're not gon' do the work or whether they couldn't do it.  She said now people say they couldn't do it, I think they could do it, they didn't want to do it so they didn't do it, and I think that was pretty smart.  They didn't allow themselves to get suckered into--into that.  And she always made it a lesson for us, don't ever take advantage of people.  And she always felt that people who own slaves and who felt superior to other people, never going to heaven.  And oh she would--she would--she would wax eloquently on that one.  How can you possibly get in heaven and you're hating people, or you're feeling superior or something and she would--we'd all say, oh, really, really, they won't go to heaven, well, there will not be any white people in heaven.  She said oh, sure, not all white people are bad, you know, 'cause we went to a church that was integrated, which was very surprising in Bakersfield [California].
Story_ID: 62694
Speaker 1: Even, so--let me understand this, Bakersfield [California], was it--wasn't it black and white?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: It was black and white but there was a segregated black community that was there, okay?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But now, how did you end up going to a--
Speaker 2: Well, it's a very narrow sectarian church, very narrow.  And it's always been interracial.  I think it was founded in Missouri or someplace.  It's a Church of God and they have all these more don'ts than dos, you know, and my mother [Burnett Love] never bought into all those don'ts, but her mother went to that church, so we grew up in that church in Sunday school.  They were good people, honest, you know and that sort of thing, but there were always black and whites.  And most of them were not necessarily in the mainstream of Bakersfield, they were sort of out of the mainstream, you know, almost like a cult.  It's almost like a cult because their don't list is so rigid that most people would be set apart by the things that you were prohibited from doing.  And my mother would argue with them and say there's nowhere in the bible you can find that.  And you know she was very fashionable, they didn't think that was appropriate, so she just ignored that.  She accepted what she could in the church and she, "No, my children are not going to dress like little old women and men.  They're going to wear appropriate clothes."  So, she would--she would really take the minister to task, or whoever, some of the older sisters in the church.  It was a very interesting experience, because you learned the good things they had, but we  never--we never bought into all those other things, you know, how you dress, whether you wear lipstick, whether you went to the movies, whether--you--you can't play baseball, my mother said, nonsense, just nonsense.  She was pretty logical and pretty independent in her thought processes, you know, now that I look back on it.  At the time it was just mother.
Story_ID: 62695
Speaker 1: Now, when you--you went to--you said the junior high went up to eighth grade and then--.  So what was the high school?
Speaker 2: The high school [Bakersfield High School, Bakersfield, California] was a very large high school, thousands of kids, cause my graduating class was over 500.  It was very--very interracial, and you had friends, all kinds of friends there.  But we didn't, we didn't have a lot of visitation.  We didn't--we really came home and did our work, you know what I mean, we couldn't hang out with the kids too much.  We had to work.  At home we had our chores and then we had to do our homework, and by that time it's time to go to bed cause my father's [Alvin Love] gon' wake us up at this awful hour in the morning.  But it was a--it was a good academic school, I think, for people whose parents insisted that they get a fair chance.  I don't think it was automatically that.  But I think there were a few parents like my mom who really sort of pressed them, and we did well.  There are a lot of sort of outstanding people who went to that high school, Earl Warren, for example, the Governor, the Supreme Court Jurist, is a graduate from our high school, a number of legislators went to the high school there.
Speaker 1: Can you give names?
Speaker 2: I'm just trying to think of them.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the high school?
Speaker 2: Bakersfield High.
Speaker 1: Bakerfield, okay.
Speaker 2: There was a East Bakersfield and a West Bakersfield and the East Bakersfield was kind of segregated, it was almost all white.  The West Bakersfield, we just called it Bakersfield High, was very pluralistic, quite a mixture, and some good, really good teachers, really very good teachers, if you were in the certain track, (unclear) for the bad teachers if you were in the other track.  There were a lot of clubs and organizations, as I recall, that you could join after school.  They were kind of interracial council, or something like that.  I don't think I joined anything other than the intercultural, interracial thing, I joined that.  But my mom wasn't too big on our staying after school doing things.  She really thought you should come home after school, so we didn't do too much of that.  My brothers played sports, so they could stay, but we didn't do too much at the school, but during the school day, there were--I really enjoyed high school, I enjoyed it very much.  It was challenging and the teachers took particular delight if you studied, they really loved that so, so the teachers liked you, if you did well.  I don't know how they treated people that didn't do well, but I felt they were really fair to me.
Story_ID: 62696
Speaker 1: And what other things were forming you as a young person.  Are any other experiences, you know, in high school that were sort of forming you in what you were--
Speaker 2: Well, I think that experience at the "Y" has a lot to do with the kind of person I am.  Manley Johnson would say, we're going to have this program and Ruth is going to speak.  How can I get out of it, I don't know how to make a speech.  Well, he said, come here, I'll show you.  And then he'd go, one, two, three, this is how you make a speech.  Then I'd tell my teachers, my English teacher, you know I made a speech, and oh, really, well then you make a speech for us.  And so you know you get brought into it.  But he would give you these experiences that you never ever had.  Now he tried that with acting and you know I'm not into that, I said, oh, no, no, no, I don't want to do that.  But some of the kids did.  He had social dancing and he taught you that, how to do grooming, I mean, a lot of the social amenities, he really stressed and he brought his young wife in and she would help.  And then he got a lady in the community who was very good at that.  So that was really, apart from school and church that was the center of our activities, because you didn't have any great cultural activities in Bakersfield.  So your life was really the "Y", school, church and home, that was, that was it.  And you didn't go downtown to the big "Y" I have no idea.  I've never to this day gone into the YWCA on YMCA downtown Bakersfield, after all these years.  I just don't go.
Story_ID: 62697
Speaker 1: --Now, what about church, what dom--denomination were you?
Speaker 2: Well, that's what I was telling you, it's a Church of God, it's called the Church of God.
Speaker 1: Oh, Church of God?
Speaker 2: Not Church of God in Christ.
Speaker 1: Christ.
Speaker 2: It's very quiet, very--
Speaker 1: Proper, it's more proper.
Speaker 2: --Uh-huh.  Humble but proper, pride themselves on being honorable people, work hard, not flashy but just appropriate, that's the way they were characterized.  But as I say, we were a little different from them because my mother [Burnett Love] didn't adhere to all those rules but we were accepted because they liked us, I guess, or liked my family and so we were accepted.  But even today when my mother came to live with me, she attended one of these churches in Oakland [California], when she came to live with me and it's interesting.  It's changing though, it's changing.  But it did have a good influence on us in terms of your moral character, your belief system, your values.  They extended on what you were taught at home in a very good way, I think.
Story_ID: 62698
Speaker 1: Now when you--when it's time for you to go to college, how is the decision made about where you're going to go and what you know--
Speaker 2: That's an interesting question.  I was all set to go to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and about a week or so prior to my leaving, my father [Alvin Love] announces to my mother [Burnett Love] in my presence, I found out that Berkely has 20,000 students and most of 'em are hippies, and this girl doesn't have any business going to a school like that, she's too young.  I was sixteen and you know.  Now he didn't say anything to me, he was talking to her, and I'm ready to go.  So I don't know if he investigated afterwards, 'cause I was very enthusiastic.  And all I knew was that Berkeley was a pretty place and you know that sort of thing.  I didn't even care about the academics I was just--wanting to get away from home.  And he said, all we can't have it.  So then they called me over and I was livid.  Oh, I was really upset.  And I said why didn't you tell me two or three months ago, I can't get in any school now.  Now I'll just have to stay home, you know.  And he said, well it's not the worst place to be, you know.  I said, well, I thought to myself, I'm going to college somewhere.  So I went to school the next day and I told my history teacher.  I said, you know, my father says I can't go to Berkeley because it's too big and they're a lot of hippies and they're not behaving properly and all this sort of thing and he doesn't want me to--to be mixed up with them.  She says, he's right.  Well, I was livid with her too.  She says I thought you wanted to be a teacher, and I said, I do, and she said, well, you don't want to go to Berkeley to be a teacher.  That's not a place you go to be a teacher.  I was so upset with her I didn't know what to do.  And I said, well, where do you go to be a teacher, she said well you go to one of the state universities.  And she said I went to San Jose State [University, San Jose, California].  I'd never heard of San Jose State.  And she said that's the best school in the state if you want to be a teacher.  And I said but it's too late to get in, she said, you want to go, and I said, yes, where is it?  And she told me where it was.  It's away from home, yes, I want to go there.  So she did--she worked her magic, and in a day or so, I was enrolled in San Jose State, and that's how I got there.  That's how I got there.  My mom took me up and I stayed in a dorm cooperative and it was a good experience, it was a good experience.
Speaker 1: --Now, why, why had you wanted to go to Berkeley?
Speaker 2: Because I'd heard so much about it and I read so much about it.  I didn't know anything about Berkeley.  I didn't know--I got their catalogue and it seemed so glamorous, you know those photographs they just want--.  Now, interestingly enough I didn't feel the same way about UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], and I'd seen UCLA so much more because we were in Los Angeles, much more than we were in the Bay area.  But there was something about Berkeley that just stood out in my mind.  You know how you form these opinions.  I didn't know anybody who'd gone to Berkeley.  I just had this opinion about Berkeley and USA was there, I could have gone--It didn't--didn't even dawn on me to want to go.  It's interesting how things come to your--your attention and--I'd read about it, I know that, I had read something about--in a book or something.  And then I sent for the catalogue and I loved these pictures and you know, it was big and the hills were roll-y and all that and so I wanted to go.  I wasn't even looking at the academic program.
Speaker 1: Had your older brother [Alvin Love, Jr.] gone away to college?  Had he gone?
Speaker 2: He went to Bakersfield Community College [Bakersfield, California] and then he dropped out and became a very successful businessman, very successful.  But then went to night school and all that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 62699
Speaker 1: Now how far is it [San Jose State University, San Jose, California] away from Bakersfield [California]?
Speaker 2: Well, it's about--it's about forty miles from Oakland [California], so it would be about 300 miles from Bakersfield, uh-huh.  Nice little community then.  It's big now but at that time, it was a very nice community.  The only disadvantage of San Jose at that time was that I was the only black girl in my dorm and I think we had maybe six or seven on campus.  But now it's very different.  We had athletes, black male athletes, but they paid us no attention at all.  So we just ignored them too.  But that was the one disadvantage.  But as far as the studies, she was absolutely right, because when I graduated, I was so confident as a teacher, I just felt I was the best teacher in the world.  And that they had taught me, you know, all these various techniques and you know philosophies and I was exposed to a variety of philosophies about teaching, so it was a good school, it was a good school.
Speaker 1: And did you find, 'cause that's really your first time away from home on your own, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And so how was that experience, did it take any getting adjusted to?
Speaker 2: Well, I was so anxious to be away, as most kids are at that age, I would have liked it better had there been a friend that was with me, you know.  I kept looking around but then none of my friends went away to college at that time.  The year later they did, a couple of them, and they went to San Jose.  But I was already--I had gone through that first year.  There was a young lady in Fresno [California] who became my big sister. They had her write to me because we were from the Valley, as it were, Fresno, Bakersfield, and we are still friends today, we are still friends today.  But she sort of looked after me my first year there.  And they were nice to me, it was a very nice place.  We had to work part-time in the co-op, it was a co-op dorm where you worked.  I think everybody worked for meals, you paid the rent, but we did so much work for our meals, so I don't know how many hours, but I know I had to work some period of time every day.
Speaker 1: And did you--
Speaker 2: And I liked it.
Story_ID: 60445
Speaker 1: [Between] you and your brother [Alvin Love, Jr.], how old is he?
Speaker 2: About a year and a half.
Speaker 1: A year and a half, okay.
Speaker 2: But he thought he was like five years older than me.  You know, he said, she doesn't know how to do anything.  I have to help her with everything.  She knows, I have to help her with this, I have to help--you know he'd just make a big-to-do of that.  But he was a big tease all the time, all the time.
Speaker 1: But that doesn't explain how you got--sixteen you had to skip maybe two grades?
Speaker 2: I skipped two grades.
Speaker 1: Two grades, okay.  And when they skipped in those--in that time, was the teacher, would they just sort of decide they were going to put you in another grade?
Speaker 2: Well, one time they did it in the middle of the year.  You know they had like 4A and 4B or something like that, and I think I was in 4A, that's the beginning and then they put me up to 4B, that was like a half a year.  It didn't make much sense to me.  I didn't really know I was skipping, you know, it was kind of, you know, we're moving her up.  And then I took these after school classes.  Now, my mom [Burnett Love] did like that.  I learned Spanish after school.  They had this teacher that would come in and teach Spanish, so I enrolled in that then they had a special poetry writing teacher and I enrolled in that, so they gave me credit and somehow then that made you go to the, I think, the last time it was up to sixth grade or something.  I went to sixth grade before I was supposed to go to sixth grade, something like that.  But I didn't pay much attention to that you know.  Because I didn't like it too much because my friends weren't there, and these people seemed old to me and so it really wasn't--it wasn't all that pleasant to be put up there in those grades.  I mean, I didn't fully appreciate the meaning of it, you know, academically, because my friends weren't there, that's what I felt about it.  I didn't think the work was all that hard now, I must tell you I didn't think the work was very hard.  Now that I look back on it, it was pretty good.  But then we were working hard and that was a standard.  You didn't know there was a way not to work hard, you know what I mean, you thought everybody went home and studied for two or three hours.  Then I realized my girlfriends (unclear), we don't do that. At night we don't go home and study.  You gotta study every day?  Every day.  Friday too? Friday too. You can't go to the movies?  No, I have to study.  So I thought that's what everybody did.  So you develop this habit, you know, and if something was difficult, I could ask my brother.  My brother I thought knew everything.  And if something was hard in science or math, I could ask him and he could tell me.  I didn't really ask my parents, I really asked him.
Story_ID: 60446
Speaker 1: I want to--I want to put this time period in context, because you graduated from high school [Bakersfield High School, Bakersfield, California] in 1954?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Were you aware of events around the country or you know sort of the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --Was there much, okay?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had what we called a community radio.  And there were two things that people listened to cause some of the people didn't have radios.  They had them but they didn't--I don't know what they used them for.  They weren't--I don't know, they came over to our house.  We had this screened-in back porch, and we would listen to the civil rights stuff and would listen to boxing.  Those were the two things that I remember people coming over to hear about.  And what do you think about such and such and you know that sort of thing.  Now the first civil rights leader that I remember hearing about was A. Philip Randolph, that's the one that I heard about, and maybe it's because trains always fascinated me and this--creating this union, you know, and my dad [Alvin Love] was talking about that a lot too.  That's the first one.  Anytime he would have anything on the radio, we would all listen.  And then we got TV and we would watch it and that sort of thing.  And they would explain that these are people who are risking a lot to fight for rights.  Well, why don't we have the right to, anyway, and then they'd explain that to us.  So, yeah, we were aware, we were very aware.  And in a way, we're taught to assume some responsibility for making the community better.  They didn't call it civil rights.  You can't--you can't just go to work, come home and have a good household, you really gotta do something in the community to make it better.  And justice was a major thing.  If there is any inequities, they didn't use that term, even, but any inequality, then what can we do about that. So whenever we would face discrimination, which we did, quite a bit, then that got to be--it would end up being a project.  They'd say now why don't you go and volunteer at such and such and see if you can do something to help the situation, you know.  It was kind of an inductive way of getting you involved in things.  Now, I appreciate it, at the time I couldn't figure out why I needed to go do that, I mean, it didn't make any sense to me at all, but you did it because, you know they thought it was a good idea and you had to live there.  So, so you did it.
Story_ID: 60447
Speaker 1: The other thing, since we're dealing with where you grew up, you know, you spent a good amount of time here in Chicago [Illinois], and I'm wondering if you think the environment that you grew up in how it formed you versus how had you lived, you know, your early life or your formative years in Chicago.  I'm wondering if you have a sense about that?
Speaker 2: Well, there's no way to be prepared for Chicago, particularly if you're in a high profile position.  But I must say that the early years taught me not to back away from something because it was difficult, and to assume responsibility for my behavior and to differentiate between other people's problem and your problem. And for example, when I first came to Chicago and there was a little rumbling, you know, the first black and the first woman and all that business.  Well, I didn't pay that any attention at all, because that's not my problem.  My problem is to run a school district and to be sure that the kids learn.  I skipped over a lot of layers. And I remember the politicians used to say, she's from the bush league, she doesn't know.  When I would answer them about the patronage, which I don't believe in, I would say, well, now I'll check on what vacancies we have and you have the person apply for these jobs.  Well they thought I didn't know what patronage was, I knew what it was, I wasn't participating in it, unless I just had to, you know.  But I found Chicago very challenging, and I do think my experiences as a child helped me a lot to know what commitment is and to seek out those people who could be allies in the process.  And to know when you're up against a hard rock and know when you ought to back off, you know.  Now, I learned those very early or sometimes as my dad [Alvin Love] used to say, sometimes you let somebody think they won because you want to make another point.  It was very interesting.  That really came true a lot of times in Chicago, like with the Board, I'd say, okay, they could have this one, they could take that one, because my ultimate goal is this and this and this.  And so from a strategy standpoint, growing up in a little town like Bakersfield [California] taught me a lot.  And maybe it wasn't Bakersfield so much as my family, you know and their relationships with people, taught me a lot about how you negotiate your way in the world.  And you don't always get your way.  You have to know when to back off, when to really stand firm, you know, this is the hill I'm gonna die on, no, I won't move one inch or sometime, most of the times you do move 'cause you can move.  So those are the kinds of things that I think are not taught in schools that should be taught in schools because most of your life you're negotiating something with somebody for something.  And really it ought to be built into the curriculum. It just simply ought to be because where else will you learn it unless you're knocked down a number of times and have to you know get up the best way you can.
Story_ID: 60448
Speaker 1: Now, were you aware when Brown versus Board of Education passed?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Was that something that was discussed, or did you--
Speaker 2: Oh, everybody was talking about that, uh-huh, oh, yes.  I think we thought that it was a good idea that black children be allowed to go to the school that was best for them.  And part of that had to do with our going to the South and seeing--and having kids tell us that they can't go to that school because that school is white, but they have to walk pass and go way over here.  And we just thought that was the strangest thing in the world.  And we just saw that a lot of times.  Or even though from the city there was an all-black school, Douglas High School, and my cousins said they go to this school.  Is it a good school, it's okay.  But there is X-school, Edison, I think over here and we can't go there if we want to.  You can't even though they live near Edison and that just seemed so foreign.  So we thought it took a lot of courage for Thurgood Marshall to do what he did.  And oh, did I ever get books on Thurgood Marshall.  I really got some books and read about his life and that sort of thing.  It was discussed a lot and we had two or three sort of social activists in Bakersfield [California], and one of them lived not too far from us, so she was always--and so she was gonna get the schools in Bakersfield to be truly integrated, desegregated and that sort of thing, but I don't know how far she was ever able to get with that, because it was more residential in Bakersfield, so it's hard to make a case when it's residential.  I don't think she got too far with that.  But we were very aware of some of the issues and we were also aware of Earl Warren's role in it, because he'd gone to our high school, so the teachers all talked about it.
Speaker 1: So there was a great deal of pride?
Speaker 2: Oh, they still took credit for making him the Governor of California, they didn't vote for him, making him a member of the Supreme Court, just like they take credit for everything I've done.  Oh, they did it all.  When she became superintendent in Oakland [Califronia], oh, yes we raised her, we know.  And Chicago [Illinois], we told her not to go there, but since she's going, she'd gonna be good, you know they just take credit for everything, and which is really wonderful.
Story_ID: 60449
Speaker 1: Now when you--when it's time for you to graduate from San Jose State [University, San Jose, California], have you decided what area you want to teach in or you know what grade level, I mean has that--is that part of the--
Speaker 2: But you were trained to teach at all grade levels.  So I taught, I have taught at all grades.  You know I taught high school, middle school and elementary.
Speaker 1: --Did you have a preference when you came out about what you wanted?
Speaker 2: I wanted elementary--upper elementary, you know like the sixth grade.  I think it's because so much happened to me in fifth and sixth grade, you know, I kind of wanted to see what these little girls and boys were like at that level, but I really enjoyed teaching.  I taught at all levels primarily because people would push me along and say, we want you to be an administrator, I said, I don't want to be an administrator.  We want you to be an administrator so you have to teach at all levels if you're going to be an administrator.  So they push you into this and give you assignments and that sort of thing.  Then I went away to England.  I earned a Fulbright Scholar.  And I went away and I taught and lectured in England--
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: Oh, in--
Speaker 1: You graduated in 1958.
Speaker 2: --In the '60s [1960s] I went to England.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was a wonderful experience, a turning experience in my life because I learned more about the United States when I was in England than I ever knew in this country because I had to interpret the United States to foreigners.  And it was a very interesting experience. Every weekend I was in Italy or Germany or Switzerland making a speech somewhere.  I never knew I'd give so many speeches.  But they would ask, you know, and pay your transportation or a little fee.  Of course I was earning American salary and the dollar was booming over there, so I had plenty of, you know, financial resources for a change.  And then I taught in various levels there, I loved it, it was a wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: How long were you there?
Speaker 2: A year.
Speaker 1: A year.
Story_ID: 60450
Speaker 1: And how did you come to apply for Fulbright [the Fulbright Program]?
Speaker 2: Well, now, you know somebody else asked me that.  In fact, my mother [Burnett Love] asked me, why would you want to do this.  Oh, she just thought that was the worst thing for me to do, cause she, you know--you know, she liked having you around, you know. I believe that the superintendent of schools who had been the personnel officer when I was hired in Oakland [California], I think he mentioned to me, someday you ought to try to go to a foreign country with Fulbright.  I said what is Fulbright, yeah, that's the person, yeah, he's the person who told me, well, I'll send you some information about Fulbright.  So then I applied to go to Africa, and they said we don't have any exchange programs in Africa.  I said you don't have any exchange programs in Africa, why not?  Well, we just haven't developed them yet.  Oh, I was just fit to be tied.  Well now they do.  And shortly after that they began to have them.  But I said well, if I can't go to Africa, I'll go to an English speaking country, at least I can understand the language.  So I chose the United Kingdom.  And the person who came to take my place, you know, we had an exchange, was not--did not take my place cause I was teaching in a low-income school area and they didn't want her to be in that area, so they put her in the bourgeois area.  So in coming back this man who had exposed me to it, he's now the superintendent, and so I said well I insist upon going to the school where she is so that I can see how she has interacted with the students, cause she's gonna come back to her school where I am, the last three months.  Well, he didn't want that at all, and he and I had hot letters going across through the mails about this.  And I said otherwise I just won't come back, I'll just stay on the payroll or something ridiculous that I said to him.  And I don't know somehow, I said, oh, I'm going on a trip around the world when I leave.  Some friends are coming over from Oakland and we're gonna go a trip around the world, and by the time I get back it will be X date and I'm just gonna show up over at this school.  See I knew he couldn't answer me.  I had no address.  Isn't that mean?  So I said, I'm just gonna show up.  Well I understand that he was calling my apartment, my sister was there, to see when I was arriving, if I had arrived, cause he didn't want me to go and show up over at this school without his having cleared it.  But by the time I got there he had cleared it.  But you can't imagine the hassle.  They don't have any black teachers, I said well, that's too bad.  If she can come--if I can go to her little old school in England, she--I can go to this school here.  And I was just trying to make a point.  So I finally did that.
Story_ID: 60451
Speaker 1: So th-that experience abroad opened you up in many ways?
Speaker 2: Oh, it opened me up to the world out there and the differences, culturally and you know that sort of thing.  And the misinformation people had about black people.  I mean the ignorance is appalling.  So I took it upon myself to be the ambassador of information, you know.
Speaker 1: So what were some of the--can you describe some of the misinformation?
Speaker 2: Well, stereotypes.  We didn't know that black people went to school and graduated and become educated and we didn't know--you know, all of these kinds of things.  And you speak English very well.  I mean all--just stereotype after stereotype that I'd have to straighten them out on.  And is it true that black people cannot do math, you know.  Then I'd have to cipher.  Well, what about science and I'd have to go back on all these little books I read, I'd cite these people who'd done this that and the other, doctors and what have you.  But it was amazing to me that most of them had been exposed only to our servicemen, the only black people they knew were black servicemen.  And I was really surprised.  I was not prepared for that.  I really, you know, you really just think that people abroad, they know, you know, but they had some stereotype.  And I have to tell you some of the Americans who go over there perpetuate those stereotypes.  And I learned that as well.  Because when I was over there I would run into Americans who were on tour or something.  You're a Fulbright? Well how did you get to be?  I mean so--so alarmed at that, you know.  So it was--it was an interesting experience in lots of different ways.
Story_ID: 60452
Speaker 1: Now, you know what I also found interesting was that you said that you wanted to really go to Africa--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --First, right--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --Before.  Okay.  And that's--had you had much con--why the interest in Africa because still a lot of black people never really associated with Africa?
Speaker 2: Well, I had read enough, it certainly hadn't been because people talked to you about it.  I had read enough to know that our ancestors came from Africa.  And I wanted to see where they came from.  I had this burning desire to see where they came from, one, and two, I wanted to--to go to Liberia because the slaves had--I mean the free men and women had founded that country and I thought I just can't believe this.  This is fantastic.  So if I can just see it.  And so it's no accident that the first place I went when I left England was Liberia to see--I just wanted to see the country, just sort of be washed in it, you know, immersed in it, you know, you just wanted to--you really wanted to see what was going on, and how could they've done it, such courage and they just started with--like their bare hands and their brains and made a country, you know.  I was just fascinated with that.  And then the second place I went was Ghana, which now I have adopted as my home, you know, I have property there and I've been there thirty-some times now.  So--but I've been all over Africa.  But I just had this desire to see what these special people, 'cause I believe the people who came across the middle passage were really special people, and those who made it to this side were extraordinary.  You know they were extraordinary mentally, physically, emotionally 'cause you know those that couldn't make it died or were thrown overboard or committed suicide.  And so when my nieces and nephews tell me we can't do it cause it's too hard, I say, oh no, we don't even talk about something being too hard because look what we have been through.  And I give them this story, so, oh, yeah, we know.  They know now they gonna get the history lesson.  So I just--I just always wanted to know and see for myself.  But I tell you going in the slave dungeon has to be the most frightening experience that I've ever had.  And even though I've gone in a number of times, I still find it just very shattering, you know, to think that here they were clustered in here, no windows, no ventilation, limited food thrown down to you, no facilities, I think, oh, my God, we are strong people.  It really just forces you to accept what human beings can tolerate.
Story_ID: 60453
Speaker 1: So you went from England.  Did you go England back to the [United] States?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  I went from England to--I went on a round trip around the world.
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a friend of mine came over from Oakland [California] and we went on a trip around the world and it wasn't very expensive.  It was wonderful.  We went to Africa.  We went to a number of African countries, across-- even to Kenya.  We crossed Africa to Kenya--
Speaker 1: How long was the trip?
Speaker 2: Six weeks.
Speaker 1: Six weeks?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What is your family thinking of this?
Speaker 2: They thought I had lost my entire mind.  They thought this girl has just absolutely just gone bonkers.  She's gotten over there in England now and she's not satisfied with that, now she wants to go around the whole world.  She can't be satisfied with just going to Europe.
Speaker 1: [BRIEF INTERRUPTION]
Speaker 2: What year were you doing this traveling?
Speaker 1: Early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Early '60s [1960s], okay.
Speaker 1: And we went across Africa, it was a wonderful experience.  We went to Ethiopia, we went to Egypt, went to Ethiopia, Sudan.  Sudan, it rained the whole time we were there, and all we did was to sit out on the front of the hotel and watch the rain.  We didn't see anything, it just, I mean just poured, just gushed down.  Then we went to, straight across to Kenya, Tanzania and then we got over into Pakistan and Afghanistan and all those places.  We went to all--most of the country, Vietnam, everywhere, and Japan, I mean we went--Thailand, Thailand, Lord Thailand.  Thailand was a beautiful place, but we stayed in the worst place in the--where lizards were all on the ceiling like this.  I looked up I said, oh, I can't stay here.  They had nets over the bed to keep the mosquitos out.  Who's gonna get the lizards out, said they don't come down from the ceiling.  I said but what if they do?  What am I supposed to do with these lizards?  But I had said to Audrey, my friend, I said, well, I was talked into booking this by the travel agency because it was inexpensive.  And I thought by this time our monies would be running low, which they were, and she said but you just should have gone to hotel.  You're staying in some (unclear).  This is a dump.  I never slept at all.  Oh, God and these things with these feet.  We've had some experiences.  I really should write that.
Speaker 2: What's so fascinating is that these are two women traveling in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then in Japan, went all around Japan.
Story_ID: 60454
Speaker 1: And so you come back after this here--
Speaker 2: And I go over to the school.  But they let me stay at the school about three months then they promoted me.  I became a counselor and a consultant and then a director and then the state hired me to--what did the state--the state wanted me to, oh, to establish programs for minority kids around the State of California.  So I did that for about a year and I was on leave from Oakland [Unified School District, Oakland, California] so I was gonna come back and then Wilson Riles.  Do you know that name?  He used to be the [California] State Superintendent [of Public Instruction].  He's the first black state superintendent, well the only black state superintendent.  And he says, Ruth, I want you to head up Title I.  I said oh that, all that money?  He said yeah, I want you to develop--be the Bureau Chief [for Program Development in Compensatory Education].  There was no bureau chief my age. I was--I mean every bureau chief's white hair, you know ready to retire.  And I said, really, he says, yeah.  I'm gonna be the head of it, and you'll be the bureau chief cause I got to trust you.  You'll make it go.  So we devised this wonderful program and got a hundred million dollars and we thought that was a lot of money.  Oh, we were just carried away, and I mean we developed some programs and became part of a national model.  It really came--parent involvement, was the only thing to talk about in education at that time.  All kind of things, and measuring kids' achievement academically and the reading and math thing and all that.  It was wonderful.
Speaker 1: --Can you put this time in some historical context.
Speaker 2: It was a year after I had gotten back from England.
Speaker 1: A year after you got back--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  I got promoted right up to the State--
Speaker 1: --How did you get promoted that quickly?
Speaker 2: --Well, because I worked at the State for a year, so it was two years after--
Speaker 1: Two years, okay.
Speaker 2: --Going around setting up these programs for minority kids.  And then I was gonna go back to Oakland where--
Speaker 1: Is this in '62 [1962]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963]. Great. Okay.
Story_ID: 60455
Speaker 1: And then Wilson [Riles] said, you know, this money's coming to California--
Speaker 2: But you know what, I want to go back there.  Had you been politically involved?
Speaker 1: Uh-uh.
Speaker 2: How did you know him?
Speaker 1: Oh, because he was at the State [of California] too.  See there were very few people worked at the State, black people.  So Wilson was there, Paul Lawrence was there and I was there, that's it.  And I was there only temporarily 'cause I was on leave, and Wilson Riles was heading something called Intergroup Relations, they had him in some little cubby hole, a little cubby hole.  And I think Paul Lawrence, Dr. Lawrence was doing something in higher education there.  So there were only three of us in the whole State Department of Education.  And so, naturally, they introduced me to Wilson, so we--I got to know his wife and we became fast friends.  And he said, oh, you are really dedicated, and he said you know a lot about education.  He said I've been off in this Intergroup business for all this time so I've lost the curriculum instruction thing.  So now he was politically wired, I wasn't politically wired at all, but he says, now this money gonna come and we had a superintendent, a State Superintendent, Max Rafferty, who hated teachers and he wrote this book "What They're Doing to Your Children"  and he--it was stupid stuff.  So, he put us out of the building.  I went into my office one day and all of my things were out in the hallway, so I called Wilson.  I said Wilson, somebody has taken all my things out of my office and put them in the hallway.  He said, they taken mine too.  That's all right, he says, we will--we will make something out of this.  So we leased another building, a whole building with the State money and we're getting ready for this new program.  So we wrote legislation and Wilson had such respect at the legislature and then I was gaining respect because I'd go over and give testimony and they were getting to know me, but I was much younger so they really listened to him.  He said we gon' write some legislation, we're gonna set it up so when the money comes in '65 [1965], we'll be ready, it'll come to us.  I said we can really do that?  You just watch me.  And I got a real lesson in politics.  So we wrote this legislation so that the money came directly to this Department of Compensatory Education that we had set up in law, so all of the money came in there.  He said now you (unclear).  He said now--I said what are you gonna to be doing while I'm doing all this work.  He says I'm gon' position myself to run for State Superintendent.  Really, I said, he said--I said do you think you can win?  You just watch.  I've never seen such in my life.  But do you know he won he was superintendent for twelve years.  He won.
Speaker 2: That's pretty--
Speaker 1: I learned so much about how you position yourself to do things.  See, I'm not very good at that, things just sort of happen to me, you know, I let 'em happen, you know, I don't really position myself, career wise.  You know, I just work hard then things seem to happen.  But there's nothing I really wanted that badly.  You know I didn't aspire to head New York City Schools or anything like that.  So it was a good experience.  So, and we did a lot of good.  I will say he really gave good leadership, though, for that program.  And I could do whatever as long as the kids were doing better and you know that sort of thing.  And the nation adopted a lot of our strategies, then they [U.S. Office of Education] hired me away--
Story_ID: 60456
Speaker 1: I think we're--we're doing the right thing.  We [Love and Wilson Riles] thought we were in God's calling, you know, we really thought we were doing what we were supposed to do.
Speaker 2: Now, let's about--so let's talk about it and sort of where things were.  You were trying to really take the task of making education equal?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: You know based on poverty, not color but poverty.  And so what was the plan that you developed there [California State Department of Education] as a group?
Speaker 1: We developed a plan, you had to recall in the '60s [1960s] the talk was over and above more than you have in the basic program, so that was a philosophy rather than reforming the program as we're now talking about systemic reform.  We were not talking about that, we said give them extra, is it after-school program they need to catch up with math and reading, is it some specialized books they need, what is it they need.  So our plan called for additional instruction, additional services, motivational techniques, more parent involvement, informing the parents about where the kids are, how they are achieving, what they could do to help, those are the kinds of things that we did.  We bought a lot of interracial text books with Latinos, blacks and what have you, unheard of in the school.  We brought all kinds of things into the school that they had not done before.  We had a lot of emphasis on teacher training to help teachers see that those kids have potential.  Because you see one of the biggest problems we have in education is the expectations that adults have of children, children of color, children of poverty that there is the sometimes unspoken perception that children who are poor, children who are black, who are brown, have a limited ability, and therefore can't learn.  It may not ever be spoken, but the way one interacts with them, you know, that it's down rather than up.  And so that's what we were trying to counteract.  And then we give leeway for them to create some approaches in addition to doing what we said in the guidelines, they had some flexibility to also come up with innovative ways.  And some very exciting things came out--came out of that.
Story_ID: 60457
Speaker 1: So, can you talk about it?
Speaker 2: Well, for example, we were talking about individualized instruction, that was the big thing in the '60s [1960s].  That's individualized instruction based upon what children need.  Well, some of the people came up with small group instruction.  Children learn better when they're in co-op groups as opposed to this individuals, so we said, fine, let's go with that, you know, so.  That was one of the main things that came out, let's work in little groups.  Also they found that the lack of reinforcement at home mitigated against what they were doing at school.  So we had groups formed in communities.  These teachers came up with this and principals, and let them study together in the communities as opposed to always being at school.  We actually set up programs in communities for kids to do homework and what have you.  Those were some of the ones that come to mind readily that they brought to our attention.  And also this notion of release time for teachers to be trained.  We said let's give every week half day, so a teacher can know--learn how to teach more effectively.  They're professionals so let's treat them, why should they always have to go after school when they are tired.  So those are some of the innovations that came out of it.
Speaker 1: Now, were you looking at early childhood education or was that the--
Speaker 2: No, it's a pre-school through high school.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  So Head Start was that a part of your--
Speaker 2: No Head Start has never been in the State Department of Education.  It's always a separate program.
Speaker 1: It's always--
Speaker 2: But we mirrored head start in many ways.
Speaker 1: --Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 60458
Speaker 1: And you worked with Wilson Riles on this for how long, how many years?
Speaker 2: Five years.
Speaker 1: Five years.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you're having some success, you're gaining some attention.  California is sort of leading the country in many ways, right?
Speaker 2: At that time we were.  We're not doing so now.
Speaker 1: Right, right. But I mean before.  Well, that's a whole nother thing, right?
Speaker 2: You don't want me to get on that one.
Speaker 1: That's right that was before these propositions we start passing.
Speaker 2: Thirteen.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Well, yes and we gained a lot of attention and we shared of lot of what we were doing with other people, particularly, the federal government, so much so that they would take our guidelines and reformat 'em and send them out for everybody to use.  And we were very pleased with that because we were getting some successes in terms of the students.  Our problem was that we didn't have enough money, even though it was a lot of money to reach all the poor kids of the state, so we were reaching about half of the kids with that money and we were always asking for more, but you know, not much more was forthcoming.  But the things that we did, I would have to say in many situations are still going on today, which really is very gratifying, it's very gratifying.  You can go back to a school and do you remember when you asked us to do x and x and x, we're still doing that and our kids are doing well, you know.  It makes you feel your work was not in vain and that's an important thing for an educator to feel that all those late nights, early mornings, travelling around the state made a difference.
Story_ID: 60459
Speaker 1: So really in many ways, you had long since stopped teaching in some respects--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --And you had because you know an administrator, you know, a promoter or whatever?
Speaker 2: Kind of an advocate.
Speaker 1: Advocate.  Advocate for teacher reform.
Speaker 2: You see I wanted to teach.  That was my career goal I wanted to be the best teacher of whatever I taught.  And I think I was a good teacher.  I became convinced--people convinced me, I should say, that I could have more impact if I were--on more people, i.e., students if I had another role, cause that's the only way they could get me out of the classroom.  And I said I'll try it for a year.  I was always trying something for a year then I'd get suckered into it and then I'd end up doing it.  So that's how I really left the classroom.  And then you see you initiate our program and well it did reach more kids, and it did reach more teachers, and it did reach more parents, so you could see, not instantly, but within a short period of time the impact of what you were trying to do.
Speaker 1: Now things like new math were developing around that time--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes.
Speaker 1: Right?  Okay.  Where did that originate out of, do you remember?
Speaker 2: That was back East, yeah, it was Connecticut, I want to say Connecticut or New York, one of those states.
Story_ID: 60460
Speaker 1: Now, so still this is the late, what do you do next?
Speaker 2: After the [California] State Department [of Education] I--well, I got married, and I went to Washington, D.C. to work for the U.S. Department of Education.  I headed the national Right-to-Read Program and stayed there a few years and minding my own business, solving the literacy problem and Oakland, California Board members would show up in Washington to take me to lunch or dinner.  And I said why is so many of them coming.  And they said, well, you don't get it.  We're trying to recruit you.  I said for what?  Well, we want you to be our superintendent.  I said, oh, I don't want to be superintendent, that's not what I want to do.  Well, superintendents don't do much and I just said all kind of terrible things about superintendents.  And I said and furthermore, do you know what happened to the last superintendent in Oakland?  He [Marcus Foster] was assassinated by the SLA [Symbionese Liberation Army] and you want me to come there, after you all killed this man?  And I was just being terrible.  And of course they knew me 'cause some of these people were on the board when I was there.  They stayed on forever in those years.  And finally, one of my favorite board members said--he said now listen, these people have talked about all kind of people throughout the country and they are set on you 'cause they have watched your career.  And everything you do you succeed at it as far as the students are concerned.  Now somebody may argue with your strategy but the impact on students is without debate.  They want you and they want you because you know Oakland [California], but you're also an outsider, you haven't worked here for a long time.  So why don't you at least do them the favor of just coming and talk to them.  And you don't have to take the job, just talk to them.  That was a trick.  So I said, oh, okay, I'll get a trip to Oakland, sure.  I'll come and talk to them.  I had no intention, no intention of taking that job.  I structured some questions to ask them 'cause I wanted to know what they thought.  For about three or four hours we talked and talked and I asked them questions then they'd asked me questions.  I ended up taking the job.  So that's how I became a superintendent.
Speaker 1: That's a--that's a big deal too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is.
Speaker 1: For so young.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 60461
Speaker 1: Now, did it help--did your Washington, D.C. experience help you in knowing about resources or things of the federal government?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Well, the Washington experience is an experience that every educator ought to try to have.  You learn how policy is really formulated and misformulated.  And you learn financial resources, people resources, I know who's around the country, who can do what, you can call on people, so it was very helpful.  And it had--it helped me tremendously as superintendent.  I mean for example, before I went to Oakland [California], I said okay, I'll set my conditions, you all want me, don't fill any positions until I come.  I want a team of people in here to assess the status of education before I get here.  I want to know what it is.  You all can't seem to tell me, this school is doing this and so I got these people from around the country.  They came and spent, I don't know a long time assessing.  And you know it was just very helpful to have that global perspective.  It was helpful to the district, they liked it too.  So when we came in, we came with completely to restructure because they had--by this time all these monies, that federal monies and state monies that districts had gotten had sort of buried the basic program.  You couldn't find a basic program, there was no basic program, there was a Title I, a Title II, a Title V, there was no program.  So we had to restructure the whole thing.  And so we started from scratch developing a total curriculum for the district, involving the people there and then experts came in and worked with various teams.  Every school was involved in developing.  We had to completely redo the whole thing, plus there was all of this feeling of guilt because of Dr. [Marcus] Foster's death, you know, they felt we allowed this to happen.  He was a wonderful man, tremendous man and had been killed by this foolish group, so they were very protective of me you know I had security everywhere.  And I--oh, please, get these people away from me.  But it was--it was a rough time, you know that was a rough time.
Story_ID: 60462
Speaker 1: I found that we had to get them to feel good about their city [Oakland, California] and themselves.  So we started to bring in people, this was all part of a grand plan, who would say, Oakland is important, you all are important.  The first person I brought in was Alex Haley and this was two weeks after Roots had been televised.  And I tell you he lit up that district like nothing else.  And the students had to read about him and write something before they could see him.  They could not just go to an assembly.  I said, oh, no, no, no, you have to--you have to study about this man and what he's done.  And we had district-wide competition and we wrote a book about him that we presented in poetry, narrative and what have you.  It was just wonderful.  He stayed two and a half days.  He was our scholar-in-residence.  And the students got to meet him, I took him to the airport, you know.  It was really a good program and then we followed that with Coretta [Scott] King came.  So we had every six weeks, we would have another person come, and it did, it lifted their spirits.  They said all these people are coming to Oakland to see us.  Dr. King's wife is coming, oh, really.  They were just so thrilled, you know.  We'd have--we'd have them speak at the auditorium then go to schools, speak at schools and then we had something, "Face the Students", where the students interviewed them and it was broadcast live over our closed-circuit television.  So they had a chance to really--everybody got a chance to see them, you know, eventually.  And who else, we had James Baldwin, we had Secretary of State who was a Latino man, we had Rosalynn Carter and she just wowed them and then invited me to bring our choir to the White House, which I did.  Eighty percent of them were on welfare and we went to the White House to sing.  Oh, it was just wonderful.  So it got some people feeling good and then teachers said, you know, these kids read more about these people you bring here they ever read in these books we have.  So they started feeling better about it.  And I--I just--what I'm trying to say is you have to take some unusual steps when you have an unusual situation.  That was a very unusual situation.  Had I just gone on and said okay, we're just gonna reform.  Reform, well you gotta get people to want to reform.  So by this time now they're getting enthusiastic about it, let's change our curriculum, let's do this, and so that's when we got a big grant and we gave release time to people and they developed it, and it's theirs, it's not mine.  I'm not imposing it on them.  I said but you gotta have standards.  By the third grade every child has to read.  If not, there's an intervention right away.  You don't let them to go to fourth grade, fifth grade, sixth grade.  So we set some broad standards and then they could fill in.  And it really worked very well they reached the national norm on the test after what, four years.  They reached a national norm, but it was hard work.  You give your whole life to it, you know, you give your whole life to it.
Story_ID: 60463
Speaker 1: --move on about this, but I--just because this is very familiar with you, I mean, what state was Oakland [California] in at that point, you know when you said it had a case of identity issue and just for people who don't know California--
Speaker 2: Well, because Dr. [Marcus] Foster, the superintendent, had been assassinated.
Speaker 1: --And talk about that.
Speaker 2: The SLA, you know, the Symbionese Liberation Army had targeted different people in the state, high profile, people to assassinate.  Don't ask me why.  So  they--he was one, and they were successful in assassinating him at the school board, I mean he got out of his car and they just got him and shot his deputy, didn't kill him, but shot him.  So that made Oakland feel so badly, how could we bring this dynamic, the first black superintendent, the man is killed.  You know, it was just, I can't tell you what it did to the psyche of a city.  Everybody just felt miserable, you know, we're failures, we let this happen to this man.  And this group, and they didn't know who this group was, I mean it wasn't a lot of information about the Symbionese Liberation Army until they kidnapped Patty Hearst then everybody knew who they were.  So, they were trying to find someone that was tough enough but also who was instructionally oriented that could come in and really boost the district and also see that the kids would learn and they know that I'm a stickler for students learning.  So I think that's part of the reason that they went after me.  Cause I certainly wouldn't ever gone after them.
Speaker 1: You were what age at this point?
Speaker 2: Thirty.
Speaker 1: Thirty?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 60464
Speaker 1: Now, I had no intention of ever leaving Oakland [California].  I was gon be there ten years as superintendent then I was gonna do what I'm doing now, have my company and teach at the university and have fun.  I had already decided I didn't want to be a college president.  They had offered me that.  No, no, I didn't want to do that, they just raise money, you know, I didn't want to do that.  When Chicago [Public Schools] came along, and that was after six and a half years and so for a year, Chicago, kept sending me this, I said it's too hot in the summer and it's too cold in the winter.  I don't want to go to Chicago [Illinois].  And then finally they convinced me that I should go.  The board gave me a raise in Oakland [California], they did all kind of things.  And you know the board members escorted me to Chicago.  They said now we're just loaning her to you.  She's not staying here, you know.  I thought that was really nice.  But I got here in Chicago and I liked it.  I liked the challenge and I think the challenge was that the kids weren't achieving, and people had lost faith in their ability to achieve and the city was losing faith in public schools.  And I'm a public school advocate, you know I just believe in education for the masses.  And if it's bad, let's make it better, you know.  Let's not give up and come up with all these schemes to privatize and all this business, let's just make these schools better and it's not all that complex.  Here's some good teachers, some caring parents, good administrators, some curriculum that's workable and you can have a good school, and I really do believe that every school can be a good school, no matter where it's located.  There are too many examples of schools in ghettos that are good to say that they can't be.  So that's why I came to Chicago, and I really came to stay one term.  I was--you know, Chicago is a great city but I'm a western--I'm a western woman, you know.  But I must say that I found the challenge very invigorating because Chicago is such a fantastic city and because there are so many resources here.  When I asked for people to adopt the school and Mr. [Jay] Pritzker comes forward to adopt a school, Arthur Rubloff comes forward to adopt a the school, I mean you have people who set an example for others then we can get all of our schools adopted because these people adopted them.  We had very good relationships with the corporate community and the grassroots community and that's very unusual, usually, it's sort of one or the other, but we were able to bring them both together.  And we created a lot of programs, and I think made a lot of difference and here again we reached the national norm.  So even though it was difficult and the politics aside, if you keep your eye on the ball, you can do--you can achieve a great deal.  If you get mired in the politics and let that get you down then you won't get anything done.  And you could do that.  It would be possible to work in job and never, never do anything for kids because of all the political miscegenation that's going on, well, you just have to know what your goal is, and I think that's the important thing.
Story_ID: 60465
Speaker 1: Now, let's talk a little about the politics and, I mean, Chicago [Illinois] is a much different city than Oakland [California]--
Speaker 2: Oh, for sure.
Speaker 1: --And there was a lot of controversy about your appointment.  In fact, didn't several people, black people from Chicago, make a visit to you to beg you, can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, Jesse set that up.  [Reverend] Jesse Jackson [Sr., HM] set up, I think, four or five black women to come in full length mink stole coats to visit us in hot weather in Oakland.  I just had to say that 'cause it's so funny, it is so funny, and I was very nice to 'em.  I invited them in, we had a nice meeting, invited them to lunch and they--I told them what my position was and I didn't seek this job, but I'm not walking away because of one person or two people say I should.  And then I didn't think Reverend Jackson chose the superintendent, I don't think that's his role.  I said now I know Reverend Jackson, but I don't think that's his role and it wouldn't affect me whether or not, you know, my decision is not predicated on whether or not he accepts it or not.  I would like for him to.  So one of the persons, the others all said well, I understand your position, 'cause I took a long time to explain to them how this came about.  I said I'm not trying to take this job away from a black man.  That's not my--I don't even know this person.  And if Chicago hadn't come after me, I certainly wouldn't have gone after Chicago.  Only one person said, well, I wish you wouldn't come because it would split the community.  And I said well I don't understand that.  So she explained it to me and I think to some extent that probably did happen, temporarily, but by the time I left the community was very supportive.  Because I think they saw I was seriously interested in the students.  But it was very controversial, and I think that's partly because the fires were being flamed because you see the agenda was if I didn't come, by default, Reverend Jackson's candidate would get the job.  Well, that wasn't going to be.  When I learned that that wasn't gonna happen, if I hadn't come, I know who they were gonna hire.  It was someone else and it wasn't a black person.  And I said well, I had to think about this and I had to pray about this, cause I don't need this problem, you know, cause really I hadn't stayed my ten years in Oakland, which I planned to do.  So I really thought about it and actually one of the Oakland School Board members said to me, privately, he said, now you know we don't want you to go, and we think you should stay here.  But you won't get an opportunity to work in a city the size of Chicago very often.  And at your age, I'd take it.  If I were you I would take it, and with your experience.  And we would welcome you back.  I said well you know I'm not coming back now.  If I go, you know that I'm not going to come back to Oakland as superintendent.  He said, oh well that's the--that's the only problem, you know.  But we probably talked and he really influenced me a lot about taking--I said well you know I have this controversy with Jesse and you know I don't want to have a big fight with Jesse, and he said, well, you gon have a fight with somebody.  Because whatever you do somebody's going to be upset.  So you know how to deal with that, he said you know how to deal with that kind of thing.  And I don't think the people in Chicago will reject you, you know, because of Jesse's opposition.  I said well that's his city though, you know.  He don't run the city you know.  So really it was my board member who really helped me to sort it out and decide to come.  Now, I didn't like having--having Jesse always oppose me.  In fact, Andrew Young [HM] scheduled a couple of meetings and tried to bring us together you know and--I can see his point though that here he had a candidate.  What he didn't know is they weren't going to hire his candidate anyway, and I tried to tell him that.  He said but you didn't listen to me.  I said, well, I didn't.  But since then we--you know, we resolved it.  But I don't like people telling me or anybody you better not do this.  I said now you know that's a good way to get me to do it is to say I can't do it, because you're not in charge.  You're not in charge of this.  It would be better to say you'd be great at it.  But why don't you finish your tour in Oakland?  That would be a better technique for me and I probably would have stayed there, you know.  So it was an interesting experience.
Story_ID: 60466
Speaker 1: Now, what did you find--what shape did you find the school system in?
Speaker 2: Terrible, terrible, terrible.
Speaker 1: Was it different than what you had found in Oakland [California] when you came back to Oakland [Unified School District]?
Speaker 2: I had never seen--it was different.  I had never seen so many students underachieving so poorly, you know on a mass scale.  And you know--you know, Chicago's [Illinois] such a resourceful city, places to take kids, I mean, there are just so many things you can do.  But I was really surprised at the low academic achievement.  But I also realize that you had to work with unions and you had to work with politicians and get them on your side.  And I think we were able to build some confidence with the union and a relationship with the union head at that time.  And we were able to get them to focus on some academic things.  The work conditions are important, I don't minimize that at all, very important.  But at that time they were striking every September no matter what, whatever the issue was, go on a strike, delay the opening of school, it doesn't make any sense.  So we were able to resolve some of those issues.  With the politicians I think as soon as the test scores started going up, they backed off of some of their criticism.  They weren't critical of what I was doing in the school system, they were critical that I didn't acquiesce so easily.  You see I think in most big cities the school's budget, the school district budget exceeds that of the city and that's problematic.  The superintendent's salary exceeds that of the mayor and that's problematic and I understand that, but there isn't anything you could do about it unless you want to take a lesser salary, you know.  And I don't believe the schools should be so politicized.  I believe the school, I'm not a purist, now, I understand, I'm pragmatic, but I don't think you can compromise away your school system. Then you're not doing your job, you should just fold up your tent and go home.  And just because someone is very powerful doesn't mean you have to give in, and you know, let them do whatever they want to do in your school system and put people there that are not qualified.  I mean, I just don't believe in that.
Story_ID: 60467
Speaker 1: Now you--who were the significant players here, you know, I just want you sort of to paint the picture as it--as it was, you know, and you talk about the unions, there's the mayor, I mean who were the players that were significant in your world?
Speaker 2: Well, there were lots of them.  There was Mayor [Jane Margaret] Byrne and then Mayor [Harold] Washington, so I worked both of them and then there was--whew, jeez, it's been a long time since I've thought about this.  There was Mr. [Edward] Vrdolyak and all that group.  And sometimes the schools would get caught in their own political thing.  They'd want you to take sides.  Well, I made it a point, both in Oakland [California] and in Chicago [Illinois], not to take sides politically.  A superintendent cannot afford to be a part of some politician, you know.  I'm with anybody who's going to help education.  And I try not to get into partisan thing, although privately I have my partisan feelings, and I act on those in the voting booth.  But those were the people who were making a lot of noises and fighting and a lot of--I've never seen so much protracted dissension in my life, and I thought frankly it was a waste of time.  I mean, I really thought all of that energy with these very brilliant men and women could be better spent doing something to improve the lot of Chicago.  That was my private--that was my private feelings about it, and I tried not to--I tried not to voice that too much.  I just tried to stay out of the way of the fire as it were.
Story_ID: 62700
Speaker 1: The mayors of Chicago [Mayor Jane Margaret Byrne, Mayor Harold Washington] weren't accustomed to an independent thinker, and I think it was a shock to the nervous system to have someone say, "I'm sorry, can't do that".  There's some things that occurred in Chicago [Illinois] that I would never say publicly that really--I'd be sitting in prison if I did those things.  I wasn't going to do 'em, I don't care what they said or what they did, they could take the contract, who cares, you know.  It really is disappointing and that was disappointing, I must say, to find--see it's one thing to be political, it's another to be corrupt.  And I think, you know, one has to be very careful about that, and if you're a public person, you work a long time for your reputation.  That's really all you have is your good name and your reputation, and if you're going to throw that away, for some politician, you know, please.  You know, no job is worth that, no job is worth that.  So, you know, I just did what I did.  And I think they were a little surprised that I wouldn't just wither up and die, you know.  Look, I had a plan when I came here.  It was an exit plan.  I have a plan for implementation and I have a plan for exiting, and I know what I'm going to do next, you know that's all in my head, because I wouldn't make that kind of radical change and come here naive and think I'm gon stay here ten years.  I would never think of staying in Chicago ten years or anybody else would stay ten years because it's not the kind of place you would--you would do that.  You know you try to make--you try to make changes the first two to three years because you know by the fourth you gon' be in trouble.  Now any superintendent, anywhere in the country, in a big city knows that.  So you really have to make changes.  You know, the average tenure of a large city superintendent is two years.  So to stay here four years--now I have to say that the [school] board was a bit of a pain.  What can I say?
Speaker 2: Who was on the board?
Speaker 1: Oh, God, I try to forget that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I tried to put it in--I tried to put it in the casket where I never have to think about it again.
Speaker 2: Who was on the board, though, some of the people, do you remember some of their names?
Speaker 1: Well, they used to call themselves the (unclear).  That's what they used to call those three women that worked somewhere, something, I don't know.  I really don't want to call their names publicly.
Story_ID: 62701
Speaker 1: But the other thing is, did you find, I mean, in Oakland [California] you got carried in sort of a carpet--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --You know.  A magic carpet, welcomed back, you know--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, local girl comes home.
Speaker 1: --Right, and taking over, you know.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now here [Chicago, Illinois] you came in on--there were sexism--sex--sexist overtones, meaning that here you were being pitted against Manford Byrd [HM], right, black male, black woman, taking black males' positions.  And I'm wondering if that whole thing sort of permeated your time here or you--did you feel that or did you feel it an irritant and did you rose above it?
Speaker 2: Oh, I felt I rose above it, because had I not risen above it, I wouldn't have been able to do anything.  Now this is what I mean by allowing people to have their own problems and differentiating between what's mine and what's theirs.  Now I can't own the problem that Dr. Byrd wanted to be superintendent and thought he deserved it.  I probably thought that too.  I wasn't hiring superintendents and neither was Reverend [Jesse] Jackson [Sr., HM].  And I felt once I came here that some of those people who had spoken out so harshly really became very strong advocates for me because they could see that I wasn't playing a political game and that's very clear that--and nor was I gonna back off because somebody's gonna call you names and all that kind of business.  And then I have a history, I didn't just all of a sudden become an educator in California, I mean in Chicago.  I have a history and people know about my fairness, my sense of justice, my support of black men, my support of black women, my--my feelings about equity and all those kinds of things.  And a lot of things happened that were not supportive of what I was doing, but I know how to get around that, you know, and I know how to isolate somebody if they keep on, you know, I mean, I'm an administrator, so I know how to do certain kind of things.  So that's what I found I had to do in Chicago that I didn't have to do in Oakland.  But I was pleased, I must say, with a number of people who came around to support what we were about.  And in fact any of number of them have told me, you know I really wasn't for you when you came, but you really held your ground and I didn't make an issue of it.  If nobody else mentioned it, I never mentioned it.  And I didn't back away from it, but I just--that wasn't going to be my agenda.  My agenda was the 500,000 kids in the school system, that was my agenda, and seeing what we could do to educate them.  I think it wasn't handled very well from the outside.  I mean if I were on the other side and I had a candidate, I know a way that I--I would have handled it differently.  But then we all have our different ways of doing it.  And I don't think you can hold that against people, you just have to move on.  And I said well he'll [Manford Byrd] have a turn when I leave, and he did.  I--for two years.  So that's fine with me.  I mean, I don't have a problem with that, but I think to consciously, as I say, mau, mau about it, I just ignored it.  And pretty soon people stopped covering it, stopped even asking me about it.  The press--by the time I left, they didn't even ask about it.
Story_ID: 62702
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, what do you think the systemic problems are with Chicago Public Schools and I was wondering if you have a comment on that, if there's any, you know, things that you think differentiate it from other big city school systems or are they all sort of the same?  And then--so, I'm wondering if you would comment first on those systemic problems?
Speaker 2: Large city schools all have systemic problems and they're usually very similar and that is that the poorer schools get the least qualified teachers, have less parent involvement and have less support from the central office.  That's systemic throughout this country, unfortunately so.  But it is being turned around, because now people realize you can't forget about a whole segment of a population here, you know.  You're going to be judged on how all of the students--and that's one thing that's come out of the reform movement is that a superintendent now is judged, not on just the top schools, but on all of the schools.  There was a time when they just looked, oh, look at our wonderful schools and people would talk about them.  Now it's, what is your total city, what does it look like?  So I don't think Chicago [Illinois] is any different from any other big city in that regard, and I think now Chicago has a lot of innovative programs and I hope will mean that students will get a good chance at excelling, which they can do and they certainly have the ability to do it.  Also, Chicago has people who are really interested in the schools and who really care a lot about public education, who have a long history of being devoted to it and who are willing to work on their behalf.  I was just really surprised and pleased at the number of people who would come to the [school] board meetings and we just came out to support what you're trying to do for the children.  I mean they didn't have any axe to grind, they just wanted better education, that's a decided advantage, it's a very decided advantage.
Story_ID: 62703
Speaker 1: Now, the role of blacks in the school system, that's been sort of a tumultuous role, though too.  I know that there had been a period of time that, way before you came, where black teachers couldn't get--I don't know if this was the same in Oakland [California], maybe that's around the country, where they could only get hired as substitute teachers, you know permanently, but they couldn't get on permanently and there's been sort of you know the feeling that you know there was a large minority population, but the people in charge were really not concerned about the kids.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: That was not a--your--your, I mean, but I'm just wondering if you have any commentary on this, you know this system that you're experiencing?
Speaker 2: Well, the schools, the public school systems reflect the community and it's not surprising that, historically, black teachers have not faired very well in the public arena because the community is reflected in the schools.  And community people bring their views, and community people become principals and superintendents and district directors.  I think it's fair to say that over the last ten years that has really changed substantially.  It started a long time ago, but when a person of color, an African American is in a position, you could be sure that if you do your job, if you're worth your salt, you're gonna see to it that there's equity in employment, there's equity in promotions, and you can--you can do that without even being dogmatic.  The person you put in there is, you know, to do that job is going to understand that.  And you ask the right questions.  For example another area is the contracts, the contracts can go to all non-minority people in addition cause almost 50 or 60 percent minority.  Well, you can stop that, and you have to stop it.  And we were able to do that.  So it's possible to make those changes.  You see, some of the systemic changes you can make, you don't really have to talk about them much.  Just have your policies implemented and have a way of holding people accountable for those policies.  And I think that black teachers now--I don't think there's parity, but it's closer than it's ever been.  It not parity because there's still people in charge at certain places that if you had two people equally qualified, you'd choose the majority versus the minority.  But I think we're closer to having parity, and in the 21st century, we ought to have total parity.  It's inexcusable, it is inexcusable.  There are schools in this country, now, not saying in Chicago, where the population, student population, is like 90 percent black or 90 percent Hispanic and not one black teacher in the school and not one Hispanic teacher.  Oh, that's unacceptable, intolerable.  And I think people are rising up about that.  And I think it's changing, cause people know now that even though you're not at school very often, you don't have to tolerate those kind of things.  And after all, these are public schools, they belong to the people.  And so they should reflect the people.  And I think we're getting there, all too slowly, I must say.
Story_ID: 62704
Speaker 1: Well, when you--can you comment about your time from leaving Chicago [Public Schools] until now?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the work that you've been doing.
Speaker 2: I did exactly what I planned to do.  I started a company here in Chicago [Illinois].  First I worked for ABC WLS, doing commentary for a year, as I started my business [RBL Enterprises, LTD.].  And I really enjoyed being in Chicago with the business because we're a national company so, it's much easier being in Chicago than being in California.  California's so far from everything.  So we do searches for superintendents, we searched Atlanta [Georgia] several times, Rochester [New York], Dallas [Texas], getting big-city superintendents placed.  We also publish a newspaper for kids on black history called The African American Chronicle comes out once a month, with a teacher's guide and goes in schools all around the country.  It's very exciting, we really enjoy doing that.  And then we help schools that are underperforming, those schools that need a little help, 'cause we believe the locus of control is at the school.  So we have a team of people who just work with schools to get them to assess their needs and their strengths and help them develop an action plan to move forward and to upgrade.  That's a major part of what we do, in addition to training and that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 62705
Speaker 1: What--I want to ask you questions about just education, your philosophy on the whole--you're a very strong public school advocate.  And there has been increasing over, you know even the time since you lift Chicago [Illinois], increasing push for charter schools and you know and even the whole faith-based initiative, you know.  And I'm just wondering what your thoughts are about that because a lot of people feel that the public school system has really failed kids and there's a huge amount of money you know, stuck in administration and very little getting down to the children and the things they just failed.  And you know and I'm wondering what your comments are about that?
Speaker 2: Well, there's no doubt that the public schools are in disarray in far too many cities in this country.  It's really inexcusable.  And I'd be the first to say that.  I mean, it's more than embarrassing; it's almost criminal, because kids don't get a second chance at childhood.  So when they go through school, they ought to have the best education possible.  So I'm a very serious critic of schools that are not performing very well.  On the other hand, I believe that some of these political gimmicks are not designed so much to improve education as it is to draw the dollars away from public schools.  Let me tell you what I mean by that.  The people who are pushing vouchers for example, taking the money from public schools, following the kids, are not people who would have ever in the days of desegregation allowed a black kid or Hispanic kid to go into that school.  Were there no dollars, they wouldn't--they wouldn't have those students in their schools, and that's what's troubling to me.  You see, it will not solve the problem to have a few of the smartest black and Hispanic kids go over to a middle or upper middle class school, that's not going to solve the problem in public education.  What about all those that are left behind and what's going to make the difference in those schools?  So it's not about creating an elitist system for the smartest black kids or the smartest Latino kids, it's about making systemic change in the system so that every school, no matter where it's located, no matter the color of its, or the language of its student population, will receive excellent education with the best teachers.  And that's what we're missing in this whole business of creating vouchers and creating that.  We know that you can take fifteen or twenty underperforming kids who are very intelligent and bring them up.  We don't have to send them over, we know that.  The real challenge is to take all the kids of all the people and bring them up.  And when the voucher people want to take the whole school and put them over there then I'll be for vouchers.

Speaker 1: Now do you--since you've been in education for really forty years, and there have been during that time different theories about how to approach it, different strategies, what are your sense about--are you a basics person, because remember you said you know I got to Oakland [Public Schools, Oakland, California] and there were all these special programs (unclear), what is your feeling about what needs to be done to get, you know, schools sort back on track in terms of the strategy that should be opened?
Speaker 2: I teach at the [San Francisco State] University [San Francisco, California] as well.  I teach administrators and people who are going to be superintendents and directors.  And one of the things I try to impart to them is that unless we have a very basic program, without all of the fuss of extra monies, unless we know what the mission of the school is, what the goals and objectives are, academically and support services, I'm not just a three-R person, I mean I believe that we teach a lot more than that in schools, but we've got to have that core of basic skills taught to kids.  First they have to learn manners, they have to learn how to get along, they have to learn values as well, and how to relate and those kind of things.  I guess I feel very strongly that with all of the advent of different funding, we sort of loss the soul of what public schools were about.  And that is to be sure that children receive an academic education that prepared them to live in a diverse world, with all kinds of people, and I think that's where I stand on it.  I know that's where I stand on it.  I think that we fail miserably sometimes at doing that.  They come out illiterate in high school.  Imagine spending thirteen years of your life in something and come out illiterate, I mean that's unforgiveable.  I mean, a teacher has to take responsibility for what is taught.  And every year, no matter how hard it is, if that kid isn't failing, you got to take a look at what am I not doing?  Now, it may be that the kid is not there enough, or whatever, but you've got to point that out long before June and see if we can't find a way.  See I believe that we ought to be creative enough to have interventions throughout the school year.  If this kid's falling behind, okay, you must stay after school so many days to catch up, or you must come earlier in the morning or you must go to summer school.  I think we have become too lax and too permissive.  And you know, permissiveness can get you in a lot of trouble because you lack standards.  We really have to set limits for kids.  That's why we're adults and they are children, they need our guidance.  And I don't mean in any harsh way, but I think we have to, one, realize that the kids have the ability to learn.  Most kids who go to school, 95 percent of them can learn anything we teach 'em.  So we gotta believe that, know that they have the intellectual ability, even though they may not be dressed well, even though they don't speak English very well, even though they may have manners that we don't like and speak to us in ways that are inappropriate, we've got to see the potential there.  And if we see the potential in the kid, we will teach the kid so that he or she will make substantial progress.

Speaker 1: And you see--you see things happening in a positive way?  I mean, I'm just trying to understand the intersection between society ills and you know where because there's only so much that a school system is capable of taking on.
Speaker 2: I don't have blind faith about the potential of schools.  I do believe deeply that schools are labor-intensive, therefore people will have to make the difference.  And I think it's a combination of selecting the right people to go into education, selecting the right people to lead them, to be the leaders in education, whether the principal level or the superintendent's level and selecting teachers who really see it as a mission.  It's more than just a profession, it's a mission.  And we have to pay them more.  I think we have to pay people responsibly, I think we have to hold them accountable for what they do and I also think we ought to insist that parents be parents.  I don't think the school should take on all of the responsibility of parenting the kids.  I don't think they can do that.  I don't think it's our role.  I believe that we ought to be sure those kids leave the schools with excellent writing skills, speaking skills, reading skills, mathematic skills, computer, be technologically literate and aware.  But 'some of those things we have to say to parents, look, you have to do this cause they are your children.  I don't mean that in a callous way, I know that we all have hard luck and we need help, but I think in the last thirty years the schools have taken on all of these responsibilities that are not theirs and they haven't done what they are charged to do, and that's teach children.

Speaker 1: Are you happy you came from your telling earlier, I don't think on camera, but about the long history in your family in terms of education and the fact about your going back to your, it was a great-grandfather or grandfather?
Speaker 2: Grandfather [Andrew A. Williams].
Speaker 1: Grandfather.  And how he was an educator and kept moving, you know, it kept getting destroyed and he kept rebuilding the school.  I'm wondering has someone who's obviously dedicated their life to educating youth, what your thoughts, I mean, are you happy about the decisions you've made, are you satisfied with the progress, you know, the things that you've been able to accomplish in your life?
Speaker 2: The thing that I'm most proud of in education is that wherever I've gone, I've made a difference in terms of student performance.  And I think that the record is pretty clear, in Oakland [California] and in Chicago [Illinois], but even before that in the State of California, where we developed programs that really showed people it can happen.  You see people have to feel that it's possible before they can actualize it and teach.  And at the U.S. Department of Education, I was still a very student-focused person.  Wherever I've gone I don't lose sight of the fact that my job has to do with what happens to kids and I'm pleased, I'm pleased.  I wish I could do more and even now when I go to school, I tend to see it as an educator, not as a businesswoman, you know.  When I take a contract, it's more as an educator than a business person.  Sometimes it's not a very good business decision.  But my first priority is to make it possible for kids to have a chance.

Speaker 1: Dr. Love, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That children that I influenced in various positions are far better off than they would have been without my being there.

Speaker 1: And what do you still want to do with your life?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting question.  I want to write more because when you're in administrative jobs you don't have time to write as much as you'd like.  I want to write more.  I still speak a lot around the country.  And I want to build a bridge between African Americans and Africans.  I do a lot of work in that area related to education, of course.  And I'm going in two weeks with a group of forty-six and we have adopted a village and we're helping the school.  We send a container with lots of books and computers and this sort of thing.  But I want to have that connection.  Everybody else has a homeland, and I think we need one.  And I think--it's my own ethnic pride that leads me in that direction.  And we learn a lot from Africans and they learn a lot from us.  So that's the other part of my life's work.

Speaker 1: What does she [Burnett Love] think?
Speaker 2: Oh, she was very proud, yeah, she was very proud.  But she also insisted on keeping my feet firmly planted on the ground.  She was my biggest supporter, she was also my biggest critic.  And that was very good.  That was very good for me.  Her support can be summed up in this way.  When I was in Oakland [California] as superintendent they were--the teachers were protesting something.  You know, they were gonna, threatening to go to on strike or something.  My mother called a press conference at our house to tell the teachers to leave her daughter alone.  So she was my great defender, she was my great defender.  She knew me very well, she knew me very well.
Speaker 1: Okay, thanks, Dr. Love.
Speaker 2: All right.
