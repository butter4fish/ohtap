Story_ID: 494631
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Otis Myers] side.  And we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Dorothy Brown [Dorothy Brown Myers], Dorothy Louise Brown.  And she was born in Virginia--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Buckingham County [Virginia], I think around 1917.
Speaker 1: Okay, about 1917?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and her father was George Brown and her mother was Melissa Edmunds [Melissa Edmunds Brown].  Melissa married George Brown.  They had five children.  My mother was the oldest, and she had four brothers after her.  Her name was Dorothy and her next brother was Russell [Russell Brown], James [James Brown], Freddie [Fred Brown] and Lester [Lester Brown].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how far back can you trace that side of the family?  Are there any stories that go back to the 19th century or before slavery or the Civil War?
Speaker 2: Well, I have a story on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Well, let's wait now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so on your mother's side, is there, are there any stories (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother's side, as far as I can go back is really my grand- George Brown and Melissa Edmunds coming out of Buckingham County.  My grandmother's mother was named Alice [sic. Susie Edmunds].  And I remember her.  That's as far as we can go back there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that would take us back to the latter part of the 19th century, I guess, around 1880s, 1890s--
Speaker 2: Oh, boy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) 'cause your mother was born 1917.
Speaker 2: --that takes back, (unclear), that only takes us back to early, early 1900s.
Speaker 1: Well, if your mother was born in 1917--
Speaker 2: Seventeen [1917].
Speaker 1: --and her mother, you knew her mother.
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother--her grandmother--my grandmother was born 1898.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, and you said you knew your grandmother's mother, right?
Speaker 2: And her grandmother was Alice, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that would take you back to--
Speaker 2: That takes it back, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so are there any stories passed down from that side of that family?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, there's more on the other side.
Speaker 1: Okay, but on this side (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's about--I don't have too much there.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know what that--this side of the family was doing, you know?  Were they farmers or did they work--
Speaker 2: Coal miners, they came from west, from--my grandfather, George Brown, came out of Virginia, and his story was that he was a little musician, playing a harmonica, playing the accordion, about sixteen years old.  And he went to a supper, church supper to play music, and the band played.  And a little white girl found him interesting, and winked at him.  And they had to get him out of town.  And that's where--one of the reasons why he got into West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Now, he was originally where?
Speaker 2: It was Buckingham County, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, in Virginia, okay.  Okay, okay, so that's a story that's not, it's not unusual for those days.
Speaker 2: No.  And he went to a little church supper, playing his harmon- accordion.  And the little girl winked at him.  He didn't wink at her.  She winked at him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Any other stories from that side, 'cause all these stories are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that was his story, and then the rest of it was stories that I know from when they worked in the coal mines in West Virginia.  They all came into the coal mines of West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Now, was that--did they like those coal mining jobs?
Speaker 2: My grandmother always found it miserable.  She's always told the story as a young girl coming into West Virginia with hopes, you know, getting married and everything.  And at that time, West Virginia was nothing but mountains and roads and mud.  And she, and when she went up in the coal--Cabin Creek [West Virginia], and my grandfather worked in the mines, and he had to go with a little small hole back in the mountain, three feet, to lift coal out.  And you live in a shack with no rug on the floor and windows and one light bulb down in the middle of the room.  And you carried the water and throw dishwater out the back door and all that kind of stuff.  She found it very hard.  She used to always, always laugh about it because when you go up to Cabin Creek, there was a turnoff, off from the road.  And that little turnoff where you go up in there, she would all--she had a special name for that turnoff.  Every time she would turn that turn, and she'd go up into Cabin Creek, she had a special name for it.
Speaker 1: What did she call it?
Speaker 2: She called it Sling Shit Hollow (laughter).  It was really Cabin Creek Hollow, but she had that name for it.  I have to say what that name was (laughter).  She didn't want everybody to know that's what she gave it, but she would always whisper and say, "We're now going up to Sling Shit Hollow."  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, all right, so, did your--so what coal mining company did they work for?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Carbon [Carbon Fuel Company], one of 'em's name was Carbon Fuel and one of 'em was, name was Wyatt Coal Company, my grandfather worked for.  I remember now, Wyatt Coal Company in Laing [West Virginia], yes.
Speaker 1: Wired Coal Company?
Speaker 2: Wyatt, W-A-Y-E-T-T [sic.], something like that.  You making me remember stuff that I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, it's W-A--I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sorry, W-A--
Speaker 1: Wyatt Coal Company, W-A-Y-E-T-T, something like that.
Speaker 2: Oh, Wyatt.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Wyatt.
Speaker 2: Okay, Wyatt Coal Company.
Story_ID: 494632
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Dorothy Brown Myers] talk about growing--what it was like for her to grow up in--now, did she grow up in Cabin Creek [West Virginia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, my mother grew in--she came there as--I think she was a young girl when she came to West Virginia.  She was young, maybe a preteen, and the rest of them was born there.  My Uncle Russell [Russell Brown] was born in Virginia.  The rest of 'em was born in West Virginia.  So she grew up there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she grew up in West Virginia, okay.
Speaker 2: In West Virginia.  She was born in Virginia, but grew up in West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I was born.  And she met my father [Otis Myers] in Virginia, in West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Now, is that Cabin Creek or in Laing or--
Speaker 2: Well, Laing is in Cabin Creek.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cabin Creek is a long hollow, about thirty miles.  It's named from the creek, and alongside that creek are many little places.  Each one got a name.  Every two miles, the name changes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's interesting.  When you talk about a hollow, you're talking about a valley like.
Speaker 2: In California, they call 'em canyons.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we call 'em hollows.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it's really a--between two mountains, whatever you wanna call that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your mother go to school in Cabin Creek?
Speaker 2: They all went to school there in Laing, West Virginia there.  And I remember them telling me of the one-room schoolhouse that they went to which was named Wake Forest high--junior high--Wake Forest School [Laing, West Virginia].  And by the time I was born, it was built, and it was another--it was a--the school with nine long hallways, it was a big school.  But when they went, it was a one-room school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was she able to finish school?
Speaker 2: No, they went--I think they had junior high level, most of 'em.  My grandmother had a third grade education, but she was a very smart woman.  But she only had a third grade education, but she taught us everything.
Speaker 1: Okay, you have any stories about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Melissa [Melissa Edmunds Brown], not that I can think of right now.  Melissa, Melissa Avery.
Speaker 1: Well, what kind of things would she teach you?
Speaker 2: Well, she taught about how to go to the bank.  She taught me how to use the post office, how to write checks, how to write letters.  One thing she always told me about public speaking, and she took me to church, and she said, now it's time for you to speak, do your poem, and you got to stand up straight and speak well, kind of a presentation.  And I've always remembered that.  And I think that has, has followed me down through the years, just that little basic stuff she said about stand up straight and get your poem together and put your feet together and speak, became very important on down, when I paid money for teachers to tell you that.  My grandmother already told me that, when you went to acting school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --and they'd tell you all that.  But she had already told me that.
Story_ID: 494633
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name was Otis Lewis Myers [Otis Myers].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in New London, North Carolina, I think around 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I'm not quite sure, around 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, my father was born in New London, North Carolina, and my Aunt Gene [Argene Myers Jacobs]--there was two of them.  And his father was Buren Myers and his mother was Laura Mae Myers [Laura Atkins Myers].  She married--she was Laura Mae, and she married Buren.
Speaker 1: Now, how do you spell Buren?
Speaker 2: B-U--B-U--B-E--B-U-R-E-N, Buren, B-U-R-E-N, Myers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She married him, Laura Mae, and she had one sister named Minnie--Atkins, Laura Mae Atkins.  And her mother, I have her grandmother.  Her mother was--I have the pictures of Maggie [ph.].  Her grandmother was born in 1857, Maggie--I don't know.  We don't have a last name for her.  And her daughter, which is my grandmother's mother, was born in 1860-something.  And then my grandmother's mother was born in--my grandmother was born in 1898 [1898], '99 [1899] or something like that.  So I can go back to Maggie who was born in 1857.  And she purchased--she was, she was born a slave.  But she was freed, 1863 during the freedom.  She purchased a house in New London, North Carolina.  And that house came down to my mother, my uncle--my father and my aunt, Otis Myers and Gene Atkins.  And my Aunt Gene, my aunt--my grandmother sold their house and bought a house in Albemarle, North Carolina.  So the family moved to Albemarle.  And my grandmother died there in that house.  The land was sold, and I took some money from that house and put it into a house that I built in West Virginia, which I finished in 2003 or '01 [2001], something like that.  So I took that money, so actually, in the house that I have in West Virginia now, some of the funds that caused it to be, came down from Maggie from 1857 that she was born in 1857.  And she purchased that house in New London, and they rebought in Albemarle, and I took some of that money when we sold the land, and put it into the house that I just finished in West Virginia (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So it's a legacy that's lasted--
Speaker 2: The house in West Virginia is a legacy--
Speaker 1: -- for three generations--
Speaker 2: --that goes back to 1857--
Speaker 1: --four generations.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's something.
Speaker 2: It's got some of that energy in it.
Story_ID: 494634
Speaker 1: Are there any other stories from that side?  Now, you mentioned that one of your relatives might have been involved with John Brown (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then my [paternal] grandfather, my grandfather Buren [Buren Myers] had married my mother--my grand, my grandmother.  She was an Atkins [Laura Atkins Myers], and he was a Myers.  And he says that his people came down into the valley 'cause they knew of John Brown, and it was the John Brown movement, and they left the South and went further north up in North Carolina and West Virginia.  And he said that his, he got his name, Myers from his father who got it from his father, which was his grandfather.  And he said that his grandfather was a brown skin--was a brown skinned man, and his father was from Germany, he had said.  But he was a brown-skinned African American man.  So you know, in America, if you were--it was only two kinds of people in America, white and black.  So if you had a white parent, you still were black.  They hid that.  So he was a black man.  But he had a, just--his father was German.  But you're not allowed to say that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Myers is, you know, usually a Jewish name, not always, but--
Speaker 2: Jew--German Jewish, and when I say German, I meant German Jew.  They didn't know the difference.  They didn't know the difference themselves.  They were German Jews, Myers.  And so, he spoke the language, and so he spoke it to my grandfather.  Well, my [maternal] grandfather George [George Brown], my grandfather was babysitting me, and I found out that he spoke German.  Of course, I didn't know that he spoke German 'cause I didn't know anything about it.  But as a child, babysitting, he talked to me in the language.  And I grew up saying, (speaking German) "Vo ganz," "Guten tagen," and "Was ist zu essen," for food, chow talk and stuff like that, that my grandfather gave me.
Speaker 1: (Speaking German) "Was ist zu essen," hah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so when I went to school there, they didn't know what to make of me speaking German in West Virginia.  So they thought I was retarded, really.  But I was, I was bilingual.  And I still remember the early words.  I can carry on a baby conversation, but then later on, I studied German in school, the grammar.  And so I was able to understand what he had been saying.
Speaker 1: Now this is just--not to jump ahead too far and get too far off track, but it's interesting 'cause I know that August Wilson who's--you've been in many August Wilson plays, if not all of 'em.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: August Wilson's father [Frederick Kittel, Sr.] is German, I'm thinking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's what I heard, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you all ever talk about that?
Speaker 2: I think we mentioned it a couple of times, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause he speaks a little (laughter)--
Speaker 2: He speaks German.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Right.  His father was a German baker.
Speaker 2: And I didn't know that, and I had a good relationship with him.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, any other stories about--now, you say--so the family, the stories of the family came--he came to join John Brown?
Speaker 2: Well, he always said it.  We laughed.  And he always said that his father was a, was a colleague and fought with John Brown for freedom.  It could have been true and it could have been an exaggeration, could have known him.  I think he probably had aspirations and knew him, heard about him or close to him.
Speaker 1: It's worth investigating 'cause John Brown, when he arrived--he arrived there about six months before the raid.  And he and his staff, he had like a group of maybe twelve, fifteen people, and they tried to cultivate, like the surrounding area, the people who were enslaved and well, the free blacks in the surrounding area.  They tried to get them to--they had to find out who is who, who they can trust, and then try to get them involved in the, the raid--
Speaker 2: Right, so that was, so--I never disbelieved him.
Speaker 1: So many people who heard about the raid or was told about it, didn't participate in it 'cause they knew what was gonna happen, which is exactly what did happen to John Brown.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, that's--it could be.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So it could be true.
Speaker 2: He always said that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's about all the stories.  The furthest we can go back is there on my grandmother's [Laura Atkins Myers] side.  And I have the pictures of her, my--that's my great-great-great grandmother.  I have a picture of her in my new home, and I have a picture of my grandmother's grandmother in my new home.  And my grandmother--right down the line.  I put 'em--I have a special wall for them.
Story_ID: 494635
Speaker 1: What did your father [Otis Myers] say about growing up and how did he end up in West Virginia?
Speaker 2: Well, my father ended up in West Virginia because he was going to school there in New London, North Carolina, and they would walk home from this country school, he and his sister, my aunt [Argene Myers Jacobs].  And the black kids had to walk home, and there was a school bus for the white kids.  And they drove the school bus by every day, and they would holler out the windows and say bad things, and so stuff happened.  And my father got tired of it.  So one day, he went and got his father's [Buren Myers] gun and laid in the weeds.  And when the school bus came by, and they called out bad names, he shot in the bus.  And, of course, they had to get him out of town.  So my grandmother [Laura Atkins Myers] sent him to West Virginia to live with his father, and that's how he got in West Virginia and he came into West Virginia and got a job in the coal mines running from North Carolina.  Just like my grandfather [George Brown] on my mother's [Dorothy Brown Myers] side had to run, he had to run.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was tired of being taunted.
Speaker 2: He was a young kid.  I think he was, just going into junior high school, elementary school, young man and he laid in the weeds and shot at, he shot in the school bus.  It was going to school.
Speaker 1: So, okay.  Now, that's an interesting story 'cause it--I mean there's another theme in 'The Piano Lesson' [August Wilson] about the, you know, the yellow dog, the ghost of the yellow dog.
Speaker 2: Ghost of--yes.
Speaker 1: --about black people being victimized but also fighting back--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in ways that people, the whites didn't understand.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you never knew, yeah, well, they always fought back.  Yeah, it wasn't easy to tame us like, to get us in the shape we're in.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean sometimes I think people think that we were always so passive.
Speaker 2: Well, they're whitewashing it now, making it sound like, you know, everybody was so nice and Jackie Robinson was the friend of all.  Well, they don't know, Jackie Robinson, they treated him like a dog, spit at him, everything else, the people he worked with.  But now they're gonna make it like he's everybody's hero.  Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is everybody's hero.  Frederick Douglass is everybody's hero.  In Frederick Douglass' day, he couldn't walk down those southern towns in the streets.  But today he's like, oh, we love Frederick Douglass.  Come on.
Story_ID: 494636
Speaker 1: What did your father [Otis Myers] say about growing up, so he, you know--now, did he grow up in West Virginia (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he came there and mostly I know is that, that got him to West Virginia, and the rest of his life was there.  He became a West Virginian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they only went, they only went, only went back to Virginia every now and then.  It wasn't a place they went back every year.  They talked about it, but it was like--we was in West Virginia, but Virginia was like it was a thousand miles away.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a difference in attitudes in those days between the people, the white people in West Virginia and those in Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yes, I--West Virginia, see, West Virginia broke away from Virginia in 1863 and went with the Mason-Dixon, across the Mason-Dixon Line.
Speaker 1: With the Union--
Speaker 2: So there was always some things in West Virginia, as I remember.  The schools were separate but because the way we lived in those camps--if you wanna use the word integrated--they didn't use the word integrated at that time, but you may find a camp, a group of homes, beside the mountain.  And you may, saw one camp and it may have been all, a white camp.  It may have fifteen houses, but it may have been one black family there.  You may go two miles down the road, and you see another bunch of houses, and it may be five houses, all black people and maybe one white person.  You may go two miles, and you see another one, it may be ten houses, and it may be half-black and the other end half-white.  And that's the way West Virginia was laid out, and they were all coal miners going in the coal mines.  And when they came out of the coal mines with all that dirt on 'em, growing up as a little kid, I really didn't know the difference.  And I can remember very vividly when my, when I was not allowed to play with my little white friends anymore.  I remember the day that we had built our little dollhouse, crazy house out of cardboard and leaves.  And we had been playing in this playhouse, having so much fun.  And I remember when my little girlfriends--two of us, about six, six years old, when her uncle came out the house and, and looked at her and told her something.  And as a kid, I didn't know what it was, but now I can look back and tell you.  I felt it then.  And he was telling her that she could no longer play with us.  I didn't get the words, but I felt it.
Story_ID: 494637
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story that's passed down about how your parents [Dorothy Brown Myers and Otis Myers] met?
Speaker 2: Not really.  My father lived at a place called Nabob [West Virginia].  It was about a mile up the road from Laing [West Virginia], and he worked with his father [Buren Myers] in the coalmines.  My mother lived in Laing with her four brothers.  My grandmother [Melissa Edmunds Brown] had left the home 'cause she had gone to New York, and she had left my grandfather [George Brown].  So my mother was there with her four brothers.  And as I hear it, that's where my father married her and moved to Decota [West Virginia], which was another mile up the road.  And that's where I remember, my first memories.  I was born at Laing, but we moved, my father--one of those company houses at a place called Decota, D-E-C-O-T-A.  And we lived there, where I had my early childhood 'til about seven or eight.  My father died when I was nine.  But I remember up until eight, he was very sick, eight, when I was eight years old.  He died of cancer when I was nine.  But I remember six and seven and eight.  I remember him very well.
Speaker 1: Now, did your father have a chance to go finish school?
Speaker 2: He worked in the coal mines.  He was a coal miner.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very--
Speaker 1: How young did they start?
Speaker 2: Oh, you started, they started in the in coal mines at sixteen and seventeen.  He was a very energetic, singer, dancer, but he worked in the coal mines 'cause that was all that was for him.  If he had been born at another time period, I think he probably would have been an entertainer.  But he had to go back in the coal--but he was a machine man, which meant that he sat on a machine that cut the coal, which was a step up from having a pick and shovel loading the coal.  He would cut the coal, and then the men would load it and put it in the cars and send it outside of the mines.  So his job was to cut the coal.  And that seemed to have been a little prestigious, more prestigious than using the shovel.
Speaker 1: So did he have a chance to be above ground?  Was his job above--
Speaker 2: Nah, it was in the mine, had to go in--you went in the mines to cut, what they called cutting the coals.  The machine goes in and cut so you got a mountain of coal.  And the machine go in and cut at the bottom, cut about a foot out.  So when you put the dynamite in the coal, and it blows, you cut the bottom out so it has a place to fall.  If you don't cut that out, it just blows and it just stays there, but if you cut about a foot out the bottom--
Speaker 1: It drops it.
Speaker 2: --it drops.  So his job was a machine cutter, and he bragged about that 'cause he sat on the machine.  And they would go from a place cut the coal and then go to another one.  And the men would blow it out and, and dump it.  And he would come back when they needed a new cut.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did he--was his salary a little, I mean his pay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, as a machine guy, his pay was a little higher, a little more prestigious.  That was, you know, another little hierarchy.  And he was able to get that because his father had been a machine man.  And then it was handed down to him that he was a machine man.  I remember very clearly, my grandfather's friends being Italian.  At that time, the blacks and the Italians in the unions and things were very close.  And the stories my grandfather told me, the Italians and the blacks had united because the other whites treated the Italians like they were dogs and the blacks.  They were Irish, and had come to America, but they were no longer Irish.  You know, once they got here, they become white.  So they were just white now.  The Italian hadn't gotten white yet.  They were still Italians (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard that.  There was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were still Italians.  They hadn't become white.  They were still Italians, and so the Italians and the blacks had to kind of, had a little brotherhood going there with the--to protect themselves in the coal mines there.  And then when the Italians became white, the blacks were left by themselves, and we're still by ourselves.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's something that's an interesting concept.
Speaker 2: And that's the story they told me too, and they told it to me just like that, how the Italians and the blacks had this relationship.  They had to fight for each other.  And then the Italians got, became white later on once they'd be, you know, sent into the country and all. They became white.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, yeah, that's interesting.  I think a lot of people would be surprised that a lot of the Southern Europeans weren't considered white when they first came over here (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When they came here.

Speaker 1: When you consider--well, tell us about the personalities of your parents [Dorothy Brown Myers and Otis Myers].  And tell us who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, my father, I remember him and his buddies.  I remember him going in that coal mine.  I remember him getting one, having one of the first automobiles.  It was a 1940--his father [Buren Myers] was a 19--they were, they were Chevy [Chevrolet] men, Ford and Chevy men--Chrysler.  No, they were Chrysler men.  The kind of car you had was very important.  And they were Chrysler men.  So they always bragged about having a Chrysler.  My father had a Chrysler.  He worked hard in that mine.  He was a young man, and he got sick with, with cancer early and died at thirty-three.  But I know holidays and all, he and his friends, they would go from house to house, like at Christmas.  And they would call on people, "Hey, wake up.  It's a holiday."  And they'd go in.  And they would eat food, and they would dance, tell jokes and put on a little show.  And then go to the next house.  There was no TV.  There was very little bit of radio, definitely no TV, no radio.  So people communicated.  So what they did, they would go from house to house telling jokes and dancing and dancing in the yard.  And people go, "Here come Otis and his friends."  They would dance and cut up a rug and they'd get 'em a drink and go to the next house and eat a piece of cake and talk and holler and scream and dance a little bit; go to the next house.  And that was kind of his job to cheer the people up.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was like the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he was, he was the--
Speaker 1: --main--
Speaker 2: --star in the rolling show, from house to house.  And I kind of grew up finding, you know, holidays we would go from house to house, the little camp.  And we'd go from house to house.  We all had the same looking little house, mud in the yard and broken-down steps.  But we'd go from house to house and eat and talk and play and cry, fight, whatever we did.  But you went from house to house, dancing.  I remember that.  People used to kill hogs, have hogs that they would--animals that you eat, that you buy, pork chops.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And they had their own hogs they would kill.  And the people who had their hogs, when time to kill the hog, they would all kill 'em on the same day so they could all help each other.  And we would all stay out of school.  All the kids, we'd stay out of--we know that, the day that Mr. Cogwell [ph.] is gonna kill his hog and mister what's your name is gonna work with him to kill his hog.  And they were all gonna get together and have a hog killing.  Wasn't no school that day.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: We stayed home so we could be part of that almost ritual ceremony.
Story_ID: 494639
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you more about that kind of thing in a minute, but I just wanna know what was your mother's [Dorothy Brown Myers] personality like and who do you think you take after the most between your two parents (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I said--now, I didn't, my mother wanted--she told me she wanted to be an actress.  I have a lot of my mother's attitudes, and I have a lot of my father's [Otis Myers].  I had four uncles.  I had two--when I had--when I remember, I had my grand- four grandfathers.  And I had a lot of men that I grew up with and my neighbors, their fathers and grandfathers and uncles.  So my world was filled with a lot of men 'cause see the coal mines had a lot of black men that they needed men to work.  And there was plenty of work.  And there were these single men that would come and I remember the older men was, "I'll get you a job."  And it was very easy for the single man to come and be around a couple of days and the man take him up there, and next thing you know, he come back home and say, "I got a job."  He was so--he got a job.  We were so happy for him.  And it was very easy for a young man to get a job in the coal mines.  And he could go ahead and get him a girlfriend, play on the ball team, see him at the club, you know.  Sunday, he may go to church.  Saturday, you may see him at the club drinking a beer, you know.  And so you emulated him 'cause he had a job now.  And he might even have stayed there and got married or he just might have been a single man, you know, where he was a good catch for every--for the girls, and played ball.  But there was a lot of hope, and there was a lot of communication.  I thought the little world we lived in, I was so happy.  We would go to Charleston, West Virginia, thirty miles away.  And one person had a car.  We would all pay two dollars, one dollar down and a dollar back, and go to Charleston, whoever had a car.  And we'd go to Charleston and shop and everything and have a good time in that great big city of Charleston, West Virginia.  But by the end of the day, we wanted to come back up Cabin Creek [West Virginia], up there in that mud.  I'd go to Charleston and have a good time and see my mother get her hair fixed.  And I got to wait while they get their hair fixed.  That was boring, to wait three hours while she get her hair fixed and my grandmother [Laura Atkins Myers] get her hair fixed.  And then my treat was to go downtown there and get a hot dog and go downtown and shop.  And then we'd come home.  And I would love to go to the big city, but we also loved to return to our little mud pile.  We were comfortable.  We knew people and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, happy, pretty much happy--
Speaker 2: --there was a lot of church, there was a lot of fights and everything else, but people looked for each other--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna ask you about that.  You're actually answering the question before I get to 'em.  But I wanted to know--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --who you thought you take after the most between your mother and your father, before I move on?
Speaker 2: That's what I'm kind of puzzled between.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Now that I talk about it, I think it's really down between the two of 'em, 'cause my mother tells me she wanted to be an actress.  I didn't know that 'til I was grown.  I assumed it didn't--I didn't make no assumption.  Then I realized that my father was an actor when he went around from house to house singing and dancing and what he called tap dancing, stomping, a little bit.  He was, he was doing what, what actors do.  They were going around cheering people up.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: And they went from house to house cheering people up.  That's what an actor does.  And that's what he did.

Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory, the first thing that you remember?
Speaker 2: I always say I can remember having on a little blue dress.  I don't know whether someone told me that or not.  But I kind of remember it, maybe 'cause at that time, you know, little boy babies wore blue dresses and little girl babies wore pink dresses.  And I don't know whether that's changed or not.
Speaker 1: It's easier to get to their bottoms, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they always wore a little dress.  So I think, I said, I always said I remember that little blue dress, but maybe someone just told me that.  But I remember walking with my, one of my uncles.  And he picked me up and carried me a little while, and then he put me down and made me walk for a little while.  And I remember thinking, when is he gonna pick me back up.  I remember that.  I must have been four or five.  Oh, now, you making me think.  I remember sitting down in the, playing records.  And one of the first people that I've ever heard sing on a record was a lady named Sister Rosetta Tharpe.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: One of my [maternal] grandmother's [Laura Atkins Myers] artists, who played guitar.  She sang gospel music and she sang blues.  And that was something for a person to mix gospel and blues at that time 'cause the gospel music was God's music and the blues was the devil's music.  And you didn't mix the two.  And this lady had a nerve to mix the two, so you know they gave her a rough time.  But I remember her.
Story_ID: 494641
Speaker 1: I remember playing with--I remember Lena Horne being one of the pin-up girls 'cause my uncle was in World War II [WWII].  And Betty Grable and those people were pin-up girls.  And the black boys couldn't put the white pin-up girls' picture in their foot locker.  So the government gave a pin-up girl to the black boys, and Lena Horne told me this story herself.  I had a chance to work with her later.  And she said, they gave, Lena said, "They gave me to the black boys as their pin-up girl."  Now the black boys had someone they could put in their foot locker.
Speaker 2: Now, that's interesting.  I never knew that before.
Speaker 1: And that's how she was--became so popular.  She was given as a pin-up girl to the black boys in World War II, Lena.
Speaker 2: Was she the only black pin-up that they--
Speaker 1: Yes, she was.  There was Betty Grable and, and Carmen Miranda and all those people were the pin-up girls.  Carmen Miranda was a Cuban woman.
Speaker 2: So if a black soldier put Carmen Miranda up, what would happen (laughter)?  Was he (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Well, I think she was Cuban--I don't know.  At that time, they, you know, Carmen Miranda has a history of working with black people and all.  And, but at that time, she had to go along with that white establishment.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I'm not so sure how they worked that out.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's interesting.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  I didn't know the government actually issued the pin-ups to the black soldiers, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, World War II, my uncles and things told me, it was during World War II that there was no entertainment for the black soldiers.  So the government, the [U.S.] military told the government, would you please do something for the black soldiers.  And that's why those two movies was made, 'Cabin in the Sky' and 'Stormy Weather.'  The government made those movies for that particular reason, told Hollywood to make those movies for entertaining the black troops.  And Lena Horne was the star of both of those movies.  And she was the one that they gave as a pin-up girl to the black soldiers.
Speaker 2: And I've heard also that when they, when those movies would tour the South, they would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They always took her out, and she had a--she told me that.  I worked with her on 'A Different World' for two weeks.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She wasn't the image that they wanted to show.  She was too positive, you know, too--
Speaker 1: Well, she was--period, she was a black woman, period.
Story_ID: 494642
Speaker 1: You started telling us a good, doing a good job of this already, but what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights, sounds and smells.  We lived up in Cabin Creek, up between the mountains in West Virginia.  But for some reason, I seem to have been a--very aware of the outside world.  I don't think we were ignorant people at all.  We had many, many stories of people who had gone away to look for success and we always loved to think when they didn't make it and had to come back home--when they went to the big city up there and had to pay five cents for a cup of coffee, we thought that was terrible.  And then they had to come back to West Virginia with us.  We thought that was good (laughter).  I remember those stories.  I remember people going to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], Cleveland [Ohio], Columbus [Ohio].  Those were big places for us, and coming back to West Virginia, putting on airs, like they had really been some place.  But for some reason, we were little country people, but we didn't miss a beat.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the educational system there in West Virginia, in Kanawha County [West Virginia], there were separated schools with the whites and blacks, but we would go to separate schools and then get off the school bus at the same stop.  And then the blacks and white would play together all evening 'cause we lived beside each other but went to separate schools, but come home and play together all, all--
Speaker 1: Would actually ride on the same bus too?
Speaker 2: Not--different buses to go to school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Different buses, okay, but--
Speaker 2: --but get off at--it was the same bus stop.  One bus stop there, the next bus stop there.  We'd get off different buses and then play together all the way home 'cause my next-door neighbors was two little white girls.
Speaker 1: Okay, what other sights and sounds and smells?  What were the sounds?
Speaker 2: The sounds.  Up in that hollow, what was the sounds that we had?  People hollering, dogs barking, car horns.  Every--once every year, there was a show called 'Silas Green from New Orleans' would come up.  And they would pitch their tent, and we would go down there and see this show in this tent that they had pitched, and these girls dancing and these people telling jokes and performing.  And we just looked forward to that every year, every, every summer.
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you--now, that happened every summer?
Speaker 2: Every summer, the 'Silas Green' show would come--
Speaker 1: I've heard of that show, 'Silas Green.'
Speaker 2: And the carnival would come.  And we'd go to the carnival, had about three or four rides, the hobby horse and a Ferris wheel, and a pair of swings.  That was a big carnival if you had three, three rides.  That was a big carnival.
Story_ID: 494643
Speaker 1: When you would go to see 'Silas Green' ['Silas Green from New Orleans'], did you--did his show inspire you in any way to want to be a performer (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was, it was a time that we felt so good 'cause here was a black-owned show, came in town, pitched up their tent, and it was ceremonial 'cause in the morning we would go down and watch them pitch their tent.  And you had about twenty or thirty strong black men standing around this tent, getting ready to go to work.  And this one great, big dude, he would stand on the side, and he would sort of lead the song.  And when they got the, everything laid out, he would start singing.  And he would hoot, and the tent would raise up, step-by-step, and he would sing 'em until it raised up to the big top.
Speaker 1: What would he sing?
Speaker 2: Like a work song.  He would say "Ah, oop, ah, oop," and they'd pull on the robe every time he'd hump it, they'd pull on the rope, and the tent'd go, "Hoof," and he'd holler again, and they'd go, "Hoof," and the tent go up, "Hoof."  And finally that tent was up to the top when it would fall in place, click.  The band would start playing, and that was--the band would start playing then, and then we would run home and get ready 'cause the show was gonna be that night.  But that was a ceremony.  And then we would go down there and they'd put on a show that night, and in that big tent.  And the whites would sit on one side, and the blacks would sit on another side, and straight down the middle, you had--this side was black and this side was white, and up on the ramps was white, up on the ramp that was black.  But right down, that's the way it would be.  And we'd be up in that place, packed up in there.  And it would be a show, and everybody just had such a, everybody looked forward to it.  All--the whites and blacks looked forward to it.  I really didn't understand much about segregation at that time.  I just looked up and saw that the whites was on one side, we was on another.  But it wasn't no big thing to us because we didn't--we wasn't segregated.  We just looked up and saw all the white folks on one side.  Outside was that too, so it was separate, but we didn't feel like we was inferior.  In fact, we felt good because the whole thing was owned, was black owned, that came in.  So we felt good to show--and I remember one of the young ladies went off with the show, one young girl, one young lady fell in love with one of the musicians in the show.
Speaker 1: A white girl?
Speaker 2: No, this is an all-black show.
Speaker 1: All right (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And she left and, left with the show.  We thought that was a big thing.  And the next year, we were, we were anxious to see, when the show came back to town, that she was with the show.  And, but she was with the show when it came back to town that next year.  And now, she was not only with the show, but she was a dancer, and one of the main dancers.  She had had a whole year under her belt, and she was the star of the show now.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what was her name?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I can't remember her name, but I remember--I'm looking at her face now.  A beautiful, beautiful girl that went off and danced with the show.  But I still--but I can remember myself--now, I must have been about ten years younger than she was, but I can remember myself having some kind of knowledge that I wanted to be in show business.  And I was so proud of her going off with that show.  But it wasn't quite what I wanted.  Now, what did I know the difference?  I didn't know any difference.  But some way or another, I just--I thought it was cute that she was doing that, but I wasn't so impressed about her having a long future in it.  Now, where did I get this information from as a kid, to think that it was a great deal that she was doing--with this show, that she was going away with, but it wasn't such a great deal either because, you know, what she gonna do for years later on.  I don't know why I'm thinking that way.  But I was correct.
Story_ID: 494644
Speaker 1: When you mentioned the work song, you know, it reminded me of the scene in 'The Piano Lesson' [August Wilson], when you all are sitting at the table (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, a work song.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and, you know, we interviewed Dwight Andrews [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Dwight Andrews] in Atlanta [Georgia] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --who worked on the music for that, and we talked about that song.  Now, was it, were there a lot of work songs when you were growing up that black people would sing as they did their work, in the mines and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I--not that, well, I guess you could come 'em work songs.  My [paternal] grandmother [Laura Atkins Myers] would hum all the time around the house.
Speaker 1: But when the men were doing something like you were just describing, raising the tent--
Speaker 2: No, what I described there, that was a novelty to see that huge man do that, bringing that tent.  Now, I've ready how that happened in history, how people did work songs.  But the coalminers, they sang, but I don't think--it wasn't like a whole unit of people working on one project, and you singing for a rhythm to make it easier.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: See, and you got twenty men working on one project, if everybody's singing, and you're leading, the singing is not for the purpose of singing.  It's for the purpose of moving the energy on time.
Speaker 1: Well, it's for both, I would think.
Speaker 2: Both, yeah, to be--to move, yeah, to give you energy to work, yeah.
Speaker 1: Keep the spirits up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Timing and all that, yeah.
Speaker 1: --as you do all that.
Speaker 2: So, but that wasn't the kind of work that--we were there, we--in the coalmines, it wasn't that kind of work.  So I say, we were different from Virginia.  The coal mining people--'cause Booker T. Washington was from West Virginia, salt mine and coal mine.  He walked five hundred miles through, down in Virginia to go to school.  So West Virginia has a little different flavor from Virginia.  We always thought West--Virginia was the flat land, and West Virginia was the mountain land.  So if you was a slave in Virginia, and you were running from slavery, you had a rough time running on flat land from a horse with a man setting up on a great, big four-legged horse and he's got spears and looking like a giant running you.  But if you made it to the mountains--that's where we always felt we were different.  If you made it to the mountains, you couldn't run that horse up in the mountains.  So that equalized things.  So the man had to get off the horse.  And when he did, you had a chance then of getting you a club and fighting him man-to-man.  That's why John Brown wanted to use the mountains.
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's exactly right.
Speaker 2: For cover.  If you made it to the mountains, he had to get off that horse.  And when he got off that horse, you had a good chance of whipping him.
Story_ID: 494645
Speaker 1: Did the coal mines have a particular smell?  We were talking about sights and sounds and smells.  Did it smell different at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A cave.  You know how a cave smells, kind of air, fresh, is the air kind of fresh, stale air that kind of comes out or fresh air, cool air.  I've been around many coal mines, especially when they were not working.  On Sundays and Saturdays, we boys would go up there and roam around the coal mines and go inside and look around.  We wasn't allowed to go up there during the work days 'cause it was dangerous.  But when the men wasn't working, we'd go up there and go all through and look at it.  That was one of our hobbies we did on Sundays.  And I would smell--it's a cave.  A coal mine is a cave, to go back in the mountains.  And caves have that damp, hollow, cool smell.
Speaker 1: But there's no particular smell in the neighborhood of--that had to do with the processing of the coal or anything?
Speaker 2: No, noise because of the--we had noise because of the tipple where the coal goes through and they wash it and change it.  We get a lot of noise, a lot of dust.  And when that tipple, when that tipple wasn't running, it was kind of lonesome.  On Sunday, there was no tipple, so it was kind of lone--we were so used to that tipple running.  It was nice to hear that tipple running.
Speaker 1: It was like a conveyor or something like--
Speaker 2: Conveyor belt with the coal going on it, yeah, and you hear the men working.  It was like, okay.  But when the tipple wasn't working, it was like, oh, ain't nothing going on.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I was an only child.
Speaker 1: Now, that's kind of unusual for those days, right, wouldn't you say?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a only child.  Yeah, I was a only child for my mother [Dorothy Brown Myers] and father [Otis Myers].  My mo- I think my father had another boy which my mother and them never did claim because I think the woman that he had the child by was also married, had a family--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --husband and family and other children.  But I think he was my brother.
Speaker 1: So your father passed away when--
Speaker 2: I was nine years old.
Speaker 1: Nine years old, okay.  And he died of cancer you said?
Speaker 2: He died of cancer.
Speaker 1: Was it lung cancer?
Speaker 2: No, it was in his, it was in his rectum.  He had piles, and as I know now, they operated on him, and they cut his intestine too short, 'cause there was nothing we could do about it at that time.  They cut it too short, and he had to have a colostomy come out of his side.  He was a young man, thirty-three years old.

Speaker 1: Now, was church a big part of growing up?  I guess it was.  You mentioned it before (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, now that you mention it, there was a little church up there.  I remember, I remember the first time I was going and seeing my father [Otis Myers] get the Holy Ghost.  And my mother [Dorothy Brown Myers] and I was there.  And I'm wondering what was going on with my father.  And they had him up on the front row on his knees.  And he was just praying and the sisters was beating the tambourines and just crying and praying.  And then my father got up, and he was okay, testifying.  I didn't know what was going on.  But that's when my father got the Holy Ghost.  But this little church there that we grew up in 'cause there was not many other activities.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: All of 'em was called Baptist church (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you don't know which Baptist--what the name (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All I knew, it was a Baptist, it was a church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were Baptist churches.  We had church twice a month because we couldn't afford to have it every Sunday.  So the preacher went to our church twice a month and went to someplace else the other twice a month.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was the janitor.  I would clean the church and make it warm for the Wednesday night prayer meeting.  And I would go get coal and wood and make a fire and sweep the church.  And then my [paternal] grandmother [Laura Atkins Myers] and all her older friends, they'd come in and pray for a couple hours.
Speaker 1: Now, you were the janitor when you were a teenager or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, then, then I would clean the church for Sunday school.  I was the janitor for the church.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, but you said earlier when you were a kid that you got a chance to speak in public at the church.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was part of it.
Speaker 1: Were those your first public speaking opportunities?
Speaker 2: Yes, Sunday school programs, Easter egg program, Mother's Day programs, those kind of things, where you learn to present yourself to the public, Christmas programs.  And there was a lady named Mommy, Ms. Daniels [ph.]. She was a drama teacher.  I didn't know she was a drama teacher, but she was a Sunday school teacher.  And she put on plays, and that was my first introduction to the theater was with her.
Speaker 1: What was your first role?  What did you play first?
Speaker 2: Oh, I remember doing, doing poems.  We did Easter--poems for Easter, Mother's Day poems (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you remember any of your--
Speaker 2: --Christmas poems.  I can't remember any of those, but I remember for, I remember me choosing a poem for black history, and I did Langston Hughes' poem, 'I, Too, Sing America' ['I, Too'] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 2: --one of my first poems I did.
Speaker 1: 'I, Too, Sing America,' right.
Speaker 2: 'I Too, Sing America.'
Speaker 1: Yeah, Langston Hughes.
Speaker 2: And then another one of my poems that I start doing was the poem, 'If-' by Kipling [Rudyard Kipling].  "If you can do this, then you'll be a man, my son."  'If-' by Kipling.  I became famous for doing that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'If-' was a popular poem in the schools in those days.  Did you ever do 'Invictus' [William Ernest Henley] later on?  I know that seemed to be real popular in the--
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: 'Invictus,' the poem, 'Invictus.'
Speaker 2: I don't remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, but--okay, so, you got a chance to--did you get a chance to take some kind of--did they allow the youth to take some leadership roles in church and do some, or organize--
Speaker 2: Oh, we sat junior choir, went in junior choir and, yeah, we felt part, I felt part of the community.  We had the junior choir and the Sunday school, and we'd have the Easter egg hunts and the picnics.  And the adults would be with us.  Easter was a great time 'cause we would all be at church on Easter Sunday, but Easter Monday was important 'cause looked like to me everybody stayed home on Easter Monday, and that's when we did the Easter egg hunt.  See, we would dress up on Easter, keep your clothes clean.  Then Easter Monday, we could play ball and go Easter egg hunting and do all those things that you didn't wanna do with your new clothes on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So Easter was always two days, one day with new clothes and the next day, we played.
Speaker 1: That's interesting because recently, they had the White House [Washington, D.C.] Easter egg hunt, and I just noticed for the first time that it's on Monday, after Easter.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we always had it on Monday.  Easter, you walked around dressed up on Easter Sunday and then Easter Monday, you had the Easter egg hunt and the ballgame, and you played.

Speaker 1: What about music in those days?  Was--were people still playing stringed instruments in the mountains there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there was, there was music, piano in the church.  People had guitars, and we heard--I grew up hearing country and western on the radio.  But the rhythm and blues, my mother [Dorothy Brown Myers] would go to town and buy the records.  On the radio, you didn't hear them.  You only heard the rhythm and blues--you only heard the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we heard Louis Armstrong and those people, Fats Waller and Marie Knight, I remember.  Like I said, Rosetta Tharpe [Sister Rosetta Tharpe] and then I remember Mahalia Jackson came on a little bit later, much later.  But Marie Knight, Marie Knight was back there with her.  Those are the records we heard.  'Lawdy Miss Clawdy,' remember that?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And those kinds of records.  We'd go to Charleston [West Virginia] and pick 'em up on Saturday, and we had new music all week.  There was a new song come out every week.  And you did--they would, "Did you get the new record?"  And you'd get it and play it, and people come to your house and everybody in town would come to your--"Y'all get a new record?"  We'd have a house full of people looking at the new record that night.  We'd have a party.  We'd come from Charleston, and people see us coming from Charleston, and, "Y'all get a new record?"  "What did y'all buy in Charleston?"  And they come to your house to see what you bought in Charleston, and you end up with a house full of people with a party (laughter), playing the record that you just bought.
Speaker 1: It sounds like you had a real close-knit community of people.
Speaker 2: It was, it was.  And some of those people are still there.  They're dying off, but their children don't know about it, but they were a close-knit people.  And I look back now, it was really community.  I mean they fought and did everything, but when time come to help each other, they would--they talked about each other, low to each other, did all that stuff to each other, but when time would come to help each other, looked like they were there.
Story_ID: 494648
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your school?  Where did you go to school first?
Speaker 2: It was called Wake Forest junior high school [Wake Forest School, Laing, West Virginia].  That's the same school that my mother [Dorothy Brown Myers] and them had gone to, that one-room school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right now--
Speaker 2: --but now it was a beautiful, it was a beautiful school that had from first grade to ninth grade in it, had a lot of rooms, lots of windows, and a lot of space, beautiful school.
Speaker 1: Now, did you enjoy school?
Speaker 2: I thought school was just delightful.  I enjoyed school.  I enjoyed school, and then I enjoyed going to church on Sunday, and I would get that energy and it would last me all week, what I got in church on Sunday.  It would last me all week 'til I get back to church on Sunday, that energy that the people was giving with the singing.  It wasn't so much that it was religion.  It was that energy.  And then I would come right down the road and, and Mr., Mr.--he had a house and up under his house, he had a little juke joint with a piano.  And they made, they made beer and sold it and partied.  Well, I'd come from church and hear that music, and then go right down to hear Mr. Boone [ph.] and them up under their house, hearing the devil's music.  And I'd start dancing again.  So they would laugh at me and say, "Ooh, he up there dancing in the church.  Now, he come right out there dancing the devil's music."  But it all sound the same to me, just they changed the words from baby to Jesus.  In church, they said, "Jesus," and out in the streets, they said, "Baby."  And all of it sounded good, so I'd be in church shouting.  Then I'd go down there, and they be--they be partying at Mr. Boone's.  I'd go over there and party with them too (laughter).  People said, "You're not supposed to do that.  You're supposed to be a Christian.  You've been through."  I didn't know the difference.  It all sounded good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm still that way.
Speaker 1: Now, who were the most popular artists in those days?  You named some of 'em, but--
Speaker 2: Those was the ones that I--yeah, Marian Anderson.  My uncle introduced me to Marian Anderson.  I remember he brought a record of Marian Anderson home.  We didn't have but--only people I remember that we had that was famous was Lena Horne, Marian Anderson, Joe Louis--that's about all we had.  Those were the names we had.
Speaker 1: Those were the most famous black Americans--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in those days.
Speaker 2: Then Billy Eckstine came along 'cause my uncles and them loved Billy Eckstine.  I remember my uncles loving Billy Eckstine and Frank Sinatra too.
Speaker 1: Was there much live music, I mean in terms of the clubs and stuff around there, and, or--
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't so live.  There was the records that we got.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't see too many people playing music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Even our church, we had a piano, but we didn't have nobody that played it.  So if someone came and played it, it was an oddity.  But most churches had a piano player, but we just didn't, we didn't have one.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Favorite subject in early school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I liked 'em all.  I had a wonderful time in school with the teachers and it was just a play thing to me.  And I was adjusted.  I loved my teachers, I loved my classmates.  I still remember them.  I had a good time.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher or favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: I had so many favorite teachers.  I remember my second grade teacher, Miss, was--her name was Miss Beamer [ph.].  And I remember I loved Miss Beamer so much because she was, she would give us stories about the Indians [Native Americans].  And she'd take a table and make a whole Indian village.  And we learned all about the Indians, how they built their wigwams and took care of the babies and the water and would make it out of clay and wood and trees.  And we thought we was in that Indian village.  And then she would make a Dutch village.  We'd all have the little wooden shoes and the windmills and the canals and the ducks and the geese.  We would make that village.  So I really did, making those little villages on the tables.  It was like, and our class was like living in those villages.  And now I see how important that arts and crafts was.  I actually felt like I was living in an Indian village by making that village.  And then we'd make that village of the Dutch village, and I felt like I knew all about the tulips and the Dutch because of that.  And I found that my education in West Virginia, I've never had to apologize for it.  And I was saying in that area of West Virginia was Kanawha County.  It was very famous because there were some black teachers there that were so good.  Miss Alfreda Mitchell, Miss Turner--she taught there in the public schools in Charleston, West Virginia for years, Kanawha County.  Alfreda Turner, and she taught English, and she was famous for making you get that grammar, subject, verb, pronoun, all of that.

Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: So I went to high school, which was a school called Washington High School [Booker T. Washington High School, London, West Virginia].  It was a school for the blacks, and then that school was integrated and the blacks went to the--all the blacks went to the school called East Bank [East Bank High School, East Bank, West Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was integrated while you were there?
Speaker 2: I went to the [U.S.] military and it was integrated.
Speaker 1: Oh, but you were in the military by the time that--
Speaker 2: By the time I was in the military when the integration--they was doing all the integration.  I was in the military during the part (unclear) integrated.

Speaker 2: Lon--naw, Washington.  It was a little, little place over there named Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was at London, West Virginia, Washington--was it named for Booker T. Washington?  Naw, it was called Washington High School, but it was at London, West Virginia.  Maybe it was named after some Washington--
Speaker 1: 'Cause it is a black school, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it might have--you know, possibility.
Speaker 2: I don't know if it's named after Booker T. or not.  It might have been named after Booker T. 'cause his house is not too far from there, not too far.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's from that same area?
Speaker 2: Down the river, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how'd you do in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, I dropped out of high school at eleventh grade, and I went into the military.
Speaker 1: Well, what happened in the eleventh grade?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [Otis Myers] was dead, and my mother [Dorothy Brown Myers] was sick.  You know, you're too old to be a boy and not old enough to be a man.  And that's a crucial period for young men.
Story_ID: 494650
Speaker 1: And I went to Cleveland [Ohio], and I was working in Cleveland and trying to go to school there.  And I was working at a drugstore, and they brought in a German man that could not speak English and had him working alongside me.  And because I knew a few German words, I taught him my job.  And then they gave him my job.  I was a young kid, sixteen, seventeen--sixteen.
Speaker 2: So you didn't know that that was gonna happen if--
Speaker 1: And they took this German man and put him beside me, sweeping the floor and all.  And I was so anxious to make friends with him 'cause I knew some German words from my [maternal] grandfather [George Brown].  And he was so good to talk to--he was so glad I spoke German, and he didn't know nothing.  And he didn't know he was white.  He just knew he was a lost person who needed help.  And I was helping him.  And we had a wonderful couple of weeks until they finally told him that he was white and that he could not--what his relationship had to be with me.  And I remember going to work that day and seeing a whole change of attitude with him.  And I looked in his eyes and I knew right away that someone had been talking to him, and now he was changed.  And I didn't change words.  I just looked at him and saw it and went on and, and adjusted to it 'cause I knew what it was.  I knew now that he was no longer a German immigrant, but he was white (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, now, tell me, now, why did you choose Cleveland?  Did you have relatives in Cleveland?
Speaker 1: Well, Cleveland was a place that when the mines was going out there in West Virginia, a lot of people went to Cleveland, Columbus, Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  That's where they went.  They going to Cleveland for work.  They went to Pittsburgh, they went to Columbus, Ohio (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Were those all the--
Speaker 1: --they went to Dayton, Ohio.
Speaker 2: Dayton.
Speaker 1: So you had those choices to go to.
Speaker 2: Were they like on a railway line, you know, was there a direct railway to Cleveland or something?  Now, how'd you get there?  How'd you get--
Speaker 1: Well, my uncles went up there for work in the steel mill, and they talked about Cleveland and the big city.  So then I ended up following one of them there.  And I end up, you know, working in the Karamu theater [Karamu House, Cleveland, Ohio], and then I ended up going back in the [U.S.] military.  But--
Speaker 2: So this is about 1951?
Speaker 1: Oh, fifty--naw.  Oh, I finished high school [Booker T. Washington High School, London, West Virginia]--I would have graduated high school about '58 [1958], something like that, fifty--then I went to the military.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right, yeah, sixty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So I went into the military with--
Speaker 2: --this is '60 [1960]--
Speaker 1: --an eleventh grade education.  And I finished my GED [General Education Development] there in the military.  And--
Speaker 2: So this is around '61 [1961] I guess, if you're sixteen, you know, and so it's 1961, yeah, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I came out of the military and went to college, finished college.
Speaker 2: Now, I didn't wanna zoom past the military.  But you were in Cleveland, I guess, around 1961 or so, working.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, fifty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, if you were sixteen and coming out of the eleventh grade, unless you were--
Speaker 1: Late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Late '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, you're even younger then.  You were about fourteen or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  I went into the military, I was about seventeen.  I was--I lied about my age.
Story_ID: 494651
Speaker 1: So what year did you go in the [U.S.] military?
Speaker 2: I think about '54 [1954], '55 [1955], about '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: No, that would have made it--see, if you were born in '45 [1945], '55 [1955], you'd be ten years old.
Speaker 2: I was born in '35 [1935].
Speaker 1: Thirty-five [1935], okay, all right, okay, that makes difference (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now that gets us back in the ballpark.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so, okay, so that puts us--all right, I got you.  All right, so about, okay, this is in the '50s [1950s].  So you went in the mil- did you go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Military, late '50s [1950s]--
Speaker 1: --in the [U.S.] Army or the [U.S.] Air Force--
Speaker 2: --yeah, '55 [1955], Air Force.
Speaker 1: Air Force, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I came out and finished college.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you choose the Air Force?  I know it's a better choice, but did you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother [Dorothy Brown Myers] didn't want me to go in the [U.S.] Navy because she didn't like the way their pants was made.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And I didn't wanna go in the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] 'cause they were so tough.  So they said the Air Force would be better for me, flight and get the Air Force.  It was exciting.  Aeronautics was coming into play then, so that was my choice.
Speaker 1: So where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: And I was very fortunate that I had my basic training here.  Then I went and stationed at Tachikawa, Japan for two years.  And I was in a flight unit and got chance to fly all over the Middle East, Far East and Hong Kong and Korea and Japan and come back to Tachikawa Air Force Base [Tachikawa Airfield, Tachikawa, Japan] in Japan.  And that was a wonderful time for me to get to know the Japanese people and explore--it was wonderful.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Tachikawa?
Speaker 2: T-A-C-H-I-K-A--Tachi--it's a time, a long time since I spelled it, Tachikawa, T-A-C-H-I-K-A--
Speaker 1: --W-A?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Tachika--K-A-Y-W-A [sic.].
Speaker 1: All right, okay, so any stories about the Air Force or did you get a chance to do any theater in the Air Force or any acting?
Speaker 2: Well, I did.  It was a gentleman in the Air Force there that organized a group of us on the base in Japan to sing Negro spirituals.  And he was from England.  I forget his name.  And it was about eight of us, and we went all over the Japan to the schools and college singing Negro Spirituals.  And I would do James Weldon Johnson's poem, 'The Creation.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Air Force base in Tachikawa, Japan, they were, and it was seg- you know, the segregation and integration that was going on in America, well, the whites had taken that same attitude to Japan.
Story_ID: 494652
Speaker 1: And the [U.S.] Air Force base [Tachikawa Air Force Base; Tachikawa Airfield, Tachikawa, Japan] was integrated, but when you went off the base to the Japanese, there was one gate, the front gate, and it was a back gate.  Well, the black boys went out the back gate, and the white boys went out the front gate.  So the front gate, there was a bunch of prostitutes out there the boys went to.  And the back gate, there was another bunch of prostitutes out that way.  So--
Speaker 2: So it was a set of prostitutes for the--they were all Japanese prostitutes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All Japanese, and they worked at different gates, at different--
Speaker 2: But some dealt with the white soldiers--
Speaker 1: And some dealt with the black, and it depends on what weekend it was.  Some would switch up.  One weekend, you know, one weekend, they was at one gate, and one weekend at the other gate.  But see that stupidity that Americans had, that they carried with them.  I ran into that stupidity.  I thought I'd gotten away from it, but see, people carry it with 'em.  So these, the whites from America carried it right with them.  Well, I was, I was initiative in getting the Far East changed because I had trouble with a first sergeant and a friend of mine who had a master's degree, black man with a master's degree, had came into the [U.S.] military because he had had problems.  And now he was there and he wish he had gotten out 'cause he came in so quick with a master's degree.  And he was like on a level of a sergeant.  He was miserable.  But he wrote letters complaining about how they were treating us.  And then one day I was gonna be court martialed for being ten minutes late, and he wrote a letter and told me to take it to the IG [inspector general].  I took the letter to the IG, and started a whole procedure.  I had been ten minutes late and was threatened with a court martial, and here was this white kid had been late, and late and they rubbed him on the back.  And I reported this, and because they were in the process of trying to change those ways, southern ways that these whites had carried with them over there, they wanted to integrate.  And because he had written all those letters to his congressman, they were aware and alert.  So when my complaint came through, the authorities jumped on it, and they took the Air Force base, and they put it off limit from the officers to the--lowest man to the highest man in Tachikawa, Japan, military Americans could not go off the base.  And they went out to the city and made it clear to the people, the merchants that any American that came out there, if you mistreated them, that your place would be off limits.  So if any American came in your place and you mistreated them, your place would be off limits to all Americans, and that you were not to treat any blacks or whites different.  They--the Japanese was told that.  And the back gate was closed down, and we all had to go out the same gate.  And that, we did a--I was instrumental in getting the Far East changed in terms of that kind of a policy.
Speaker 2: Now, who--do you remember the name of the black officer that helped you?
Speaker 1: He wasn't an officer.  His name was Smitty [ph.].  And he was a young man, had a master's degree, but he came in with two stripes because he had had a problem on the outside, and he was running.  And now he wished he hadn't of came in.  But he wasn't an officer.
Speaker 2: Okay, so he was an enlisted man like you.
Speaker 1: He was an enlisted man, had a master's degree.  And he was the initiative in helping me think about college and getting me prepared for college.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's quite a story.  Yeah, we've heard other, you know, I mean accounts of the same kind of thing with the two separate sets of prostitutes, some Japanese merchants who would wait on black and some won't, white.  You know, so, you were instrumental in shaking all of that up.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I shook it all up.  And the Japanese had fallen in line with it, like any people will do.  To get that dollar, they'll fall in line.
Speaker 2: Okay, so when did this all this place?  Do you know the year for all this?
Speaker 1: Well, that was what, late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Late '50s [1950s], okay--
Story_ID: 494653
Speaker 1: When did you come out of the [U.S.] Air Force (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I came out of the [U.S.] military and went--I came out of the military in '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I finished up college and then came to New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you came out in '58 [1958].  Now, you said, Smitty [ph.] helped you decide on college (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the military, talking about--he introduced me to classical music.  He introduced me to philosophies.  He introduced me to art and poetry.  I traveled all over Japan.  I first--my opera, I saw it in a Japanese opera, the Italian opera done by Japanese people.  The first time I heard Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven] and Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart], I was in Japan.  So my mind got stretched with him there 'cause at that time, the Japanese were into the classical music of Beethoven and Mozart.  And now, it's all jazz, but they had taken to that, and once they heard jazz, they put that down and went running to jazz.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you used the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I used the G.I. Bill to come out, and went to school on the G.I. Bill.
Speaker 1: So you were probably able to finish high school in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I finished my GED [General Education Development] in the military.  After basic training, I went to the library, no air conditioning, hot and I took me a course in English and math to prepare myself for the GED.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And all my buddies were going to the PX [post exchange] drinking beer every night, and I decided I was gonna finish my high school.  And I finished my high school.  I was so glad, and I was--then I start taking college courses on the campus.  So when I went to college, I already went there with college courses.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when time come to get out of the military, I was happy to be able to go to college with about twelve credits.  And my friends that I had been in the military with for four years, they came in with a tenth grade education, and they left out with a tenth grade education.
Speaker 1: Okay, so where did you--when you came out, did you go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) West Virginia State College [West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay, West Virginia State.  That's a school that has a lot of famous--
Speaker 2: It was a land grant school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, yeah, well, it's easier to see why you chose West Virginia State 'cause it's in your home state.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Tuition's probably lower there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was an in-state student.  And I had the G.I. Bill.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you have a favorite subject--I mean did you major in--
Speaker 2: Well, I majored in sociology and psychology, and I was interested in the theater, but I didn't major in theater 'cause I wanted something to fall back on.  But I ended up with a major in sociology, a major in psychology.  I ended up with a minor in philosophy and a minor in German.
Speaker 1: Was it--did German come easy for you after--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I had spoken it as a child.
Speaker 1: German, okay.  All right, so did you have a favorite teacher at West Virginia State or--
Speaker 2: Oh, Mr. Clark [ph.].  He was my drama teacher.  He saved me.  Dean Kelly [James Kelly, Jr.] was the dean of men and he was my philosophy teacher.  And he really helped me through my early teenage years of identity and trying to identify myself, that college adjustment.  Because of Dean Kelly and Mr. Clark, I wouldn't have made it, that adjustment, that freshman adjustment in college.  I wouldn't have made it if I hadn't had those adults who understood and helped me to make it, to adjust.  That's why I understand young people going to college and having, flipping out.  By the time you're a senior, you're kind of cooled out, but a lot of kids in freshman and sophomores do all kind of things, commit suicide, and running off, all kind of problems.
Speaker 1: Well, was it, was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That kind of thing went on at my school, and I was one of those kids.  And I was saved because of those people who kept me part of the community and kept talking to me.
Story_ID: 494654
Speaker 1: Tell us about your current project with the Tshaka Ensemble [Tshaka Ensemble Players].
Speaker 2: The current project that we're working on is a project called 'Footsteps from Before' [Lou Myers].  And it is a project of a play that we did twenty-seven years ago, and our group was the Tshaka Ensemble, performing theater group.  We did several pieces.  We did the classical Greeks and we used 'Medea' [Euripides] as our piece to introduce.  We did the Shakespeare [William Shakespeare], and 'Julius Caesar' [William Shakespeare], where we got into Rome [Italy] and all that period.  We did a thing on the African kings where we--the empires of Africa.  We had each king represented to talk within our theater group.  And then we did 'Footsteps' which are these, Booker T. [Booker T. Washington], Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, all the people here, characters that we did.  And the next piece that we're adding in our workshop is an August Wilson piece.  So all of the people that's playing these parts are able to teach all of those their--they're gonna be the instructors of Tshaka Ensemble.  And we're building a corporation as we're building the theater.  So I'm here, kind of global business incubation.  We've been doing the research for the last twelve years on trends in economics, trends in wealth building and this is one of the projects that, an idea that's to be turned into a project that can be wealth building.  Wealth building is different from riches.  There are a lot of rich individuals.  When we say wealth building, we mean the community.  We mean the community building wealth.  When we came out of slavery, we were interested in building wealth, not riches, hospitals, hotels for our people.  That's what we were interested in building.  And we, you know, been bywayed in that, going off the track in that, bombed.  We've had Tulsa, Oklahoma.  We've had 450 black settlements, would have been towns, that were destroyed.  So we have all that history, and the reason why we're using 'Footsteps' from before is that we're going back and tapping into the intelligence so we can see what was the problem-solving process of our people, how they solved their problems with their thinking.  We can use that same thinking to move to the future because history have been so distorted that we need to go back to get a clear picture so we can go forward.  And that's a good thing that this project that we're working on is doing that.  And we are partnering with this institution here which is City College [City College of New York, New York, New York] and Ms. Gloria Thomas, she's a member here.  She's one of our partners.  And we're also getting ready to partner with St. Martin's Church [St. Martin's Episcopal Church, New York, New York] who has a theater.  And our theater group is gonna be the theater group that's gonna take charge of that theater.  And we're the Tshaka Ensemble.  The first play we're gonna do is this play.  These are the characters sitting here behind me, and I want to introduce them to you, their names and the characters that they're playing and also some of the things that they're doing, gonna be doing with the Tshaka Ensemble.  So first we have over here, we have--just start from anywhere.  We have on the left, right there we have Cedric Washington who's playing--oh, this end, this corner.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Move the mic over.
Speaker 2: And he's playing Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, and he's a founding member of the Tshaka Ensemble.  We've been together thirty years.  And he will be mainly our, one of our technical directors in our theater with our film and anything that comes under tech, technology, filming and so forth, he will be the one that will be at the think tank.  So this is really a think tank.  Then we have Sojourner Truth there, which is Verdelle Smith [Asbury Verdelle Smith], and she's in music, writing.  She'll be our member there, in music and writing, and doing Sojourner.  And we have Robert Turner here.  He will be our artistic director in directing, one is technical director and one is the other director.  Jimmy [James Garret], there, he's in law and so he'll be more of our manager to manage it.  And then Lloyd [Lloyd Goodman] there, he's one of our instructors, teachers, and Cormac [Cormac Marnell] here in the back here, he's in technology.  He's doing John Brown, and he'll be doing lighting and technology.  Any questions we have in electricity or technology, he'll be able to know who to go to so we can have that information.
Story_ID: 494655
Speaker 1: So I'd like for Sojourner Truth to tell us something about her, and your name and who you are and what you're playing and something about Sojourner.
Speaker 2: (ASBURY VERDELLE SMITH):  Well, my name is Asbury Verdelle Smith, and I'm playing Sojourner Truth who was a woman of faith, a very strong, determined woman.  She was very creative.  She wrote her music, and when she spoke, people listened.  She had--she was a woman of integrity.  And she valued the truth above all.  One time, there was a rumor out about her that she was a man, disguised as a woman.  So to set the record clear, when she was speaking in Indiana one evening, she went forward to the audience and she said, with a loud voice, she opened her shirt and let them see her breast and said, "Ain't I a woman?"  She would go to any length to express the truth.  She was deprived of really having a love relationship with her children because, as you know, during that time, they sold from place to place, master to master.  And she did fall in love with a neighbor's slave, but they were forbade to be with one another because he found out she was sick.  And she could well have been pregnant during the time because shortly after they were separated, she had a child, and then she married and had four children.  They say five children, but she had one child when she was, when she was married.  But I particularly liked Sojourner and associate myself with Sojourner because we had a lot of things in common.  She was a preacher.  I'm a preacher, ordained minister.  She couldn't write, but she created music and songs out of her head, as she said.  She was also an evangelist.  She traveled a lot.  She got the call on her life just as she was--as emancipation was coming about.  She got a call on her life to go out and preach, to walk--go all over preaching.  And that's what she did.
Speaker 1: And it was one of the main things she did.
Speaker 2: (ASBURY VERDELLE SMITH):  Main things.  She was a traveling evangelist, yeah.  And she eventually was able to get a son that was sold illegally into slavery, Peter, to have him brought back to her.  And during the latter part of her life, she was re- I say, re-associated with or organized again with her children.  And she died in Detroit [Michigan].  And that's about it, I wanna say right now (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, and then we--let's go to Booker T. Washington.
Speaker 2: (ROBERT TURNER):  Hi, everyone.  My name is Robert Turner.  I played, play the role of Booker T. Washington, the founder of Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee State Normal School; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  And Booker, Booker T. was a powerful individual, a very intelligent man.  And he basically came out of slave--because he grew up slavery.  But the controversy around Booker T. Washington was that speech that he made in Atlanta.  And I remember, like one of the lines in the play goes, goes like, he--Booker T. says, "That was an incident in my life which seemed to have excited the greatest amount of interests and perhaps went further than anything else in giving me a reputation.  Now, I refer to the speech in which I delivered at the Atlanta Cotton States [Cotton States and International Exposition], an international exposition in Atlanta, Georgia in 1895."  And when he goes on and continue to talk about that speech, he would say, "Cast down your buckets where you are.  Cast them down amongst my people who have without strikes won labor wars, tilled your fields, cleared your forests, built your railroads and cities and helped bring forth treasures from the bowels of the earth."  So that's basically the philosophy of Booker T. Washington.  But Booker--and, and many of the so-called black Republicans at the time, Booker T. was able to command a lot of funds.  I mean a lot of things had to go through the Tuskegee--go through Tuskegee Institute in terms of being approved.  And, and Booker T. received funds from the North, as well as the South and founded many of the black colleges, you know.  So he had a very interesting life, and Booker T. died in 1915.  And, and he's left a legacy.  And one of the things that Mr. Myers [HistoryMaker Lewis Myers] talks about in terms of building hospitals and that--this is the kind of stuff Booker T. was talking about, talking about back then.  Thank you (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 494656
Speaker 1: Let's go to Bill Robinson.
Speaker 2: (CEDRIC WASHINGTON):  I was nine years old when I did my first full (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Cedric Washington.
Speaker 2: (CEDRIC WASHINGTON):  --production.  My name is Cedric Jose Washington, and I'm portraying the character, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, one of the most profound dancers ever, that ever lived.  He was nine years old.  He danced in the South before the war [World War I, WWII].  He was also one of the best dancers to ever touch and grace the film stage as well as community.  He ran backwards as a trait that made a lot of publicity coming his way.  And he also--well, he worked as a people's person more than anything.  Yes, we wear the masks.  We were not allowed to be ourselves so we had to pretend.  Yes, we were not allowed to break away from the stereotype, the happy, funny, lazy, shuffling, Jim Crow character, a character created by white folks.  Yes, we wear the masks, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson.  Discovered, discovered by who?
Speaker 1: Fantastic.  We have John Brown.  And that's--
Speaker 2: (CORMAC MARNELL):  My name is Cormac Marnell.  I play John Brown.  John Brown was a very strong man.  He felt that he was, he was fighting for a people who could not fight for themselves.  And I'm gonna do a little bit about him.  "Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way.  Take the stumbling block out of the way of my people.  The fatherless race; for what is a child whose parent cannot protect them?  Born into a world where their life is forfeit to the wishes of the white man.  His spirit, his life broken before he is born.  He, it cannot be but the slave, the slave cannot break his bonds.  So we must step forth and help them with this problem.  We must step forth into the breach and take them by the hand, take them and help, help our brother, help free him."  Thank you.
Speaker 1: Good.  And we have Nat Turner.
Speaker 2: (LLOYD GOODMAN):  Hi, my name is Lloyd Goodman, and I play the character of Nat Turner, who was a preacher who led a slave revolt in 1831.  "We must get out from under this bondage by any means necessary.  God did not intend for us to suffer.  You see some of you younger people have not heard about the homeland because the white folks will kill us if they hear us speak about Africa."
Speaker 1: Okay, and W.E.B. Du Bois.
Speaker 2: (JAMES GARRET):  Hi, my name is James Garret, and I play the character of W.E.B. Du Bois.  W.E.B. Du Bois is one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century.  He believed that the black man will, would be able to get out of the dark ages through education.  He was very privileged in the fact that he was able to get an outstanding education for a black man, for a white man too.  And Du Bois, he was the first black man to receive his doctorate at Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and his--one of the great thoughts, things that he said was the fact that the, the greatest problem that will face America would be the problem of race.  Du Bois said that the American Negro must support a school of arts and letters which will preserve its history and its culture and add to the great treasures of human accomplishment rather than let this marvelous and unique experience of the black race in America be distorted or even lost to memory, as it threatens to be today."
Speaker 1: And we have two other characters that's not here.  That's Frederick Douglass and Marcus Garvey, and Gregory Anderson [Baba Keino Anderson] is playing Frederick Douglass, and Thaddeus--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Birkett.
Speaker 1: --Birkett [Thaddeus Birkett] is playing Marcus Garvey.  And Marcus Garvey, what he would have--Thaddeus would have said if he was here that Marcus wanted to get it straight that he did not mean for all black people to go back to Africa.  He was not trying to get everybody to go back to Africa.  But he was saying that we did need to do what the Europeans do.  We need to have our artists and teachers and brick builders and architects, people like that to go back to Africa and build infrastructure.  That's what he was really talking about.  He was misunderstood.  Of course, we know Frederick Douglass, and his famous things that he said that he did was, "Agitate, agitate, agitate."  And his, especially his stories on how he was educated by looking at, listening to the white kids come home from school, and finding out what they had learned and asking them, giving 'em candy, asking them what did the teacher teach 'em so he could he could learn.  That was one of the things we really wanna pass on, how the education of Frederick Douglass.  He tells that, that came down.  Gregory Anderson is doing that part.
Story_ID: 494657
Speaker 1: So these are the people at the Tshaka Ensemble [Tshaka Ensemble Players] and this is the organization that we'll be going into a new building, that we're gonna be in partnership with the church and putting our theater in there.  And we're gonna be doing historical entertaining pieces that are historically entertaining.  We wanna do pieces that's gonna help the mental illness of our society by going back, and that's what 'Footsteps' ['Footsteps From Before,' Lou Myers] does and all these other pieces, go back to a time when we were sane, so we can map out our future.  And that's the thrust of what the, what the Tshaka Ensemble will be about, live entertainment in, in Harlem [New York, New York] that's gonna be popping.  We want--when you come by there, we want you to smell that something is going on in there other than just a little isolated poem somewhere, that it's a hot piece going on in there.
Speaker 2: So the Tshaka Ensemble is a continuation of something you started a long time ago.
Speaker 1: Thirty--these people are--we've been together--when did we organize, about '75 [1975]?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 1: Seventy-five [1975].  I didn't realize that.  And they've gone off and done all kinds of things, professionals in their own right, and we're here with building a corporation that--so we can pass this on.  We know that you can be ever so smart, but if you don't have the institution to hold it in.  So if we have a institution, we can hold our information.  And that's what we'll be building.  As we're building a product, we can also build the institution so we can come back and do another product.  So that's the trends in business that we're talking about.  What we've been researching in the trends in business, the first trend was the, the cotton, agricultural area.  And we, as black Americans, missed out on that because we were the trend.  It was built on molasses, slave, cotton and we were part of that trade.  So we missed out on that.  Then we come into the manufacturing age where they went in and start manufacturing things.  Well, we had to clean the manufacturing places up after they went home.  But we couldn't work in them.  My fathers couldn't work in the factories, but they were janitors.  And that was considered a good job, to clean up after everyone else went home.  So when Ford [Henry Ford] and Rockefeller was building their cars and all that, we did--we could not participate in that wealth building.  So there's always been rich people, and black rich people, but black wealth, no, because the money goes out and makes someone else's community wealthy.  We're talking about wealth building, not riches.  And what, I guess--that's what, that's what we're--our thrust is about.
Story_ID: 494658
Speaker 1: Sir, well, tell us about what happened in college.  Now, you were living on campus, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, and what happened?  What was the crisis?
Speaker 2: My college years was filled with crisis at--my crisis was identity and religious crisis 'cause I had come from a religious background, and I had--I was studying philosophy.  And the questions that I had to ask then, I'm finding that people are asking those questions now, about Christians and Muslims and all that.  Those are the questions that I asked at seventeen and eighteen.  And, of course, asking those kind of questions to people there in West Virginia, thought I was crazy.  And I asked questions that they didn't wanna hear me ask about Jesus and about God and about all of that.  They didn't wanna hear that.  And I had to have those answers.  And I was just, you know, studying philosophy and I would study one thing in the morning and go to church that evening.  And I would get so confused just trying to tie it together.  But I'm so thankful that I did struggle because now I'm kind of calm, and I'm finding that the world is asking questions that I, as a young man, suffered through.  There are many people my age, fifty and fifty-five, have no idea what a Muslim is.  They're, they're sixty years old and their Christianity has never been challenged.  And now people are coming and saying and telling them, well, your Christianity is no more better than my Muslim.  And they never heard this before.  So when you get to be that age and your whole life is shaken underneath you--I had my--shaken at sixteen and seventeen, where my underground was shaken.  I remember I was at a religious emphasis week, and I was talking the Bible was the last word, and everything 'cause that's what I had been taught.  And one of the professors got up and let me know that I did not have the last word.  And I had to regroup myself.  Well, I thought I had the last truth.  They told me that the Bible and Jesus and this was the last word and everybody had to do it.  And I found out that I didn't have the whole truth.  That was earthshaking, but I pulled through it and--
Speaker 1: So at that time, I mean, how did it affect your actions in school?  Did you feel--or what did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was a crazy freshman.  I was in the mental institution for two nights.  There was a little hospital there.  I was one of those disturbed students.  If it hadn't been for some of those great people that helped me, and they took me up to see what, to check me out and put me in Highland Hospital [Charleston, West Virginia] for two nights, you know.  I was taking a course in abnormal psychology, and I was in theater, and I was a curious person.  Well, I wanted to take a course in abnormal psychology, I wanted to see what crazy was.  So I was experimenting.  See, I wanted to go to the crazy house so I could see what crazy people was really like.
Speaker 1: So what did you do to--
Speaker 2: Well, I pulled my clothes off and ran across the campus and hollered and screamed.  And (laughter), they came and got the nurse and took me to this hospital.  Well, now, I'm in this mental place, and I'm studying this course in abnormal psychology.  Now, it's time for me to really see what's going on.  And I have this story to tell.  I was there two nights, and my mother [Dorothy Brown Myers] came down and they was--my mother was kind of crying 'cause her son was in such, had such problems.  And they left it at one night.  The next night I was there, so when the shift changed, there was a nurse and an orderly. And the orderly was a black man, a huge black man about 200 pounds, 250 pounds.  And the nurse was a white woman, and she was a little thin woman, about big as a toothpick.  And they were a team.  Now, I'm there by myself with just them.  And I begin to ask them some questions, you know, being smart.  And I'm a college student.  This nurse is professional, and she gonna look after me.  I'm smart and she's smart.  I start asking smart questions, and she went and got the orderly, and the orderly came to me and told me, said, "I'll whip you."  And I'm looking at this great, big man telling me he's gonna whip me, and I'm saying, "What did I did for you to whip me?"  "I'll whip you."  And then I noticed, I looked at the nurse to try to say to her, well, I know you're not gonna let this man whip me.  I'm a college student and we're professionals.  And she looked at me like, I'm gonna let him whip you and every time he whips you, I'm gonna enjoy it.  So I looked at those people, and I said, they are a team.  He's gonna whip me, and she's gonna get a thrill.  And I woke up.  I went back to my bed, sat on my bed, shut my mouth up.  And my mother came for me the next day.  I left, and I haven't had a problem since because those two people showed me how crazy the outside world was.  I wasn't as crazy as I thought I was.  Here was this crazy orderly, and this crazy nurse that had this crazy situation going.  He's gonna whip me and she's gonna enjoy it.  I knew then that they was as crazy as I was.  And I came out of that (laughter), that crazy house, and I--tell you the truth, I haven't had a problem since.  I've been angry (laughter), I've had some fights, but I haven't really had a problem since 'cause I realized then that the world was not my friend, and I had to go after it for myself.  And from then on, I've been doing my own independent thinking.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, when did you--
Speaker 2: I was a junior in college, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you finish West Virginia State [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia]?
Speaker 2: I finished West Virginia State, of course, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 494659
Speaker 1: What did you do next?
Speaker 2: I came to New York [New York] and started working, pursuing my acting career, and working for the board of education [New York City Board of Education; New York City Panel for Educational Policy], worked for the city, worked for different children programs.
Speaker 1: All right, now, I would imagine that, you know, a new, a young actor starting off in New York, they've gotta find another kind of job.  So you said you worked for the--
Speaker 2: Well, I came, and I worked in, so I worked for the city (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you teach?
Speaker 2: --of New York.  I worked at the board of education.  I worked for the department of social services [New York City Department of Social Services; New York City Human Resources Administration].  I worked for the department of recreation [New York City Department of Parks and Recreation].  And I pursued my career.  And then I met a group of, called Negro Music In Vogue, a fellow named Granville Lee.  And I went on tour with him, narrating the history of jazz, the history of music.  We went to colleges all over America.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I read some place that you play the clarinet.  Did you learn how to do that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My first instrument in college [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia], in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, London, West Virginia], was the clarinet.  But I was, it was too--I played it, but I wanted a bigger sound.  It was too small for me.  So then my band director, he gave me a trombone, the baritone, the trombone.  I was happy with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The clarinet was too small for me.  I was a big boy.  I wanted a bigger instrument.
Speaker 1: All right, so, okay.  So did you--okay.  So you toured with a black--Negro Music In Vogue.
Speaker 2: Negro Music In Vogue.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a jazz band.
Speaker 1: When you came to New York, did you go over to the Negro Ensemble Company [NEC]?  Were they up--
Speaker 2: I auditioned to the Negro Ensemble Company.  They were doing a play called 'The Blacks' ['The Blacks: A Clown Show,' Jean Genet], and [HistoryMaker] Douglas Turner Ward was gonna give me the part to understudy the character of a villager.  Lou Gossett [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.] was playing the lead.  Cicely Tyson was in that play.  It was, it was done in the Lower East Side in New York City.  And out of that came the Negro Ensemble Company in that same spot, St. Mark's Place and 2nd Avenue.  And from that developed the Negro Ensemble Company.
Speaker 1: St. Mark's Playhouse [New York, New York], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was it like in those days from your perspective?  You know, you hear a lot about the early days of the Negro Ensemble Company and all the great actors (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I got to New York--they was right there at the beginning of civil rights, and everything was opening up.  And Negro Ensemble Company was opening up.  Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was making his great things, great changes.  The flower children, all that was happening.  The Vietnam War was letting out.  All that upheaval and stuff was going on.  I was in New York during that period, that whole blur like, performing and travelling with Dinizulu and His African Dancers--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that I worked with for twelve years and narrated African dance and African culture.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dinizulu [Kimati Dinizulu] is somebody--Dinizulu, a native New Yorker?
Speaker 2: Was Dinizulu a native New York- yes, he was.
Speaker 1: All right, do you know his given name, I mean his name he had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His name was Gus Dinizulu.  His first name was Gus, and he became a nana.
Story_ID: 494660
Speaker 1: Off camera I was asking you about Karamu [Karamu House] in Cleveland [Ohio] 'cause you mentioned it before, and we got off track and didn't talk about it.  But just briefly tell us what happened when you were--this is before you went in the [U.S.] Air Force when you were a teenager (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is before I went in the Air Force because our people was going to Cleveland looking for work in the steel mills, and I had an uncle and thing there.  And I went to Cleveland, and because I was interested in theater, of course, I found the Karamu, and there was Miss Ann Flagg.  She was from West Virginia, and she was a teacher there.  And she had me in her junior department.  And Ann Flagg at the Karamu that I was in her junior department.  And she had me to take a audition for my first professional play, 'Take a Giant Step' [Louis S. Peterson].  It had been on Broadway.
Speaker 1: Now, 'Take a Giant Step' is also the play, I think, that Lou Gossett [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.] starred in--
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: --in New York [New York], right.
Speaker 2: In New York.
Speaker 1: He originated the role.  So--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --here you are, you're in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Cleveland--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --auditioning for that same role.
Speaker 1: Right, and when you get to New York, you become the understudy for Lou Gossett.
Speaker 2: In 'The Blacks' ['The Blacks: A Clown Show,' Jean Genet].
Speaker 1: In 'The Blacks.'  This is interesting, just kind of following, you know.  So, yeah, that's interesting.  So now, back with Negro Ensemble [Negro Ensemble Theatre, NEC], now, so you were an understudy with 'The Blacks' and then you--
Speaker 2: Well, they wasn't a company then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Doug [HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward] offered me the role, but I wasn't able to take it 'cause I was--just gotten here and I was in my--married, and in--that's when one of my marriages, my first marriage fell apart because I was gonna pursue theater.
Speaker 1: Did you marry a New York woman here?
Speaker 2: I married a Connecticut girl.  She was a nurse, and we settled here in New York to work and make out, but my acting didn't work out with the time thing.  So we, with love, we departed.  We remain good friends.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so what was your first big break in theater here?  I know you got involved in the theater first, right, before television (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--well, yes, I did, 'The First Breeze of Summer,' and I got my Equity [Actors' Equity Association] card with the Negro Ensemble Company.  And I did Leslie Lee's 'The First Breeze of Summer.'  I got my equity card, and we did it at the Negro Ensemble Company and went to Broadway.  So it was my first Broadway show.  We played at the Palace Theatre [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And then to Broadway, and then ironically, I think that was your first television show too.
Speaker 2: My first Broadway and the first television show.  And we did that for Channel 13 [WNET-TV, New York, New York] television.
Speaker 1: Now, that was on television, it was in 1976.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I remember seeing that, and it was a big deal because to see the Negro Ensemble on television (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Company on television.  I think it was the only play they ever did on TV, wasn't it?
Speaker 1: It may not have been.  I know the first one (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, that's two they did, yeah.
Speaker 1: --it was a big deal when it came on though--
Speaker 2: It was a big deal.
Speaker 1: --all over the country, we--people talked about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 494661
Speaker 1: So what did you do after 'First Breeze of Summer' ['The First Breeze of Summer,' Leslie Lee]?  What are some of the other highlights of your stage career?
Speaker 2: Well, I did 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,' August Wilson.  I, the original (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is about 1982, '83 [1983]--
Speaker 2: Might have been, the original.  I did the original.  Then I did 'Piano Lesson' ['The Piano Lesson,' August Wilson]
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of August Wilson, that collaboration and most--I mean we've interviewed [HistoryMaker] Lloyd Richards and we, we haven't interviewed Charles Dutton [Charles S. Dutton], but that collaboration involves like usually Lloyd Richards getting a script at Yale [Yale School of Drama, New Haven, Connecticut], and then, you know, the Yale Repertory [Yale Repertory Theatre, New Haven, Connecticut] gets it together (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, August--Lloyd had a workshop up there, the Eugene O'Neill workshop, and there were playwrights who submitted their plays and actors went there and performed.  Well, I was invited there as one of the actors to perform the year that August had submitted his play, 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,' and Lloyd was beginning to work with.  And his play came out of there that--it went in the year--the next year I was there.  I was there about three years.  So I was there when he was working on it.  And then I was there, then I--when he went to Broadway.  And I understudied, didn't play Broadway.  And then 'Piano Lesson' came along, and we worked it up in the workshop up there, the Eugene O'Neill Workshop [Eugene O'Neill Theater Center, Waterford, Connecticut].  And then it went to the Yale Rep, and went on the road with it, all over the country, and it came back to New York.
Speaker 1: So this is--so, well, how--you've been in quite a few August Wilson plays.
Speaker 2: I did 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.'  I've done 'Fences' [August Wilson] up in New York, up in Rochester, New York, and then I've done 'Piano Lesson,' and now I'm doing 'King Hedley II' [August Wilson].
Speaker 1: Now, in 'The Piano Lesson,' you know, you play the piano and sing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, do you play the piano?
Speaker 2: I play the piano.  I play the character Wining Boy, and played piano, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looked like you were really playing to me.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I play.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did you start playing when you were younger?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started playing a little bit in church and I'd go down and play, and play a little of this, little chords.  And I kind of taught myself to play.  And then I studied with the McIntosh Series [ph.] out of Carnegie Hall [New York, New York], that I studied with the series, so I know theory.  I'm well trained in theory now.  And I can play the--I can play, I can pick up any sheet music and play it.
Story_ID: 494662
Speaker 1: Yeah, give us some of your thoughts on the August Wilson plays.  You've been in so many of them.  I mean how do they--do you have any reflections on what those plays are like, and what they're about?
Speaker 2: Well, these, all of his characters are talkers.  They talk.  August has his people talking, talking, talking, talking.  And then another thing, they repeat themselves.  They talk like people do in conversation.  They talk, and then they'll say it in another way.  So you've really gotta be a sharp trained actor with dialogue to work with August Wilson's stuff.  Just like they have the trained actors who does Shakespeare [William Shakespeare], and they train.  And they go off and they listen to speeches that other actors have done who did Shakespeare and how they did it and how they preserved it.  That's what we need with August because August's characters are such that if you interpret them wrong, you could interpret them so easily and give the wrong impression, change the whole thing of the play.  So our young people need to play the period, understand the period and play the period for what it's worth and don't add all their imaginative creativity they think someone did.  But they need to stick with trying to tell the play.  When you do a Shakespearean play, you go there and you try to listen to what the other actors did, what period it was in, what did he mean?  They study that so they can get it right.  Well, we need to be that, that religiously in getting it right for August Wilson so that his work does not become misunderstood and misinterpreted.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're saying just like Shakespearean--
Speaker 2: It's very important.
Speaker 1: --the Shakespearean community studies the period of time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The period in time--
Speaker 1: --and the culture of Elizabethan--
Speaker 2: The culture of his plays.
Speaker 1: --England, to be able to understand--
Speaker 2: His plays.
Speaker 1: --the script.  You're saying that people need to study, to be able to do it, you have to understand African American--
Speaker 2: What was happening to the black man in America that he was writing about, not what you think was happening to him, but what was happening and play that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so--well, give us an example of something that, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, one good example in his last play, 'King Hedley' ['King Hedley II,' August Wilson].  He has a cat which is talked about, a black cat, that belongs to Aunt Esther.  And this cat dies, and my character, who's Stool Pigeon, buries the cat.  Well, my director, who was younger than me, he says, well, you got a relationship with this cat 'cause it's Aunt Esther's cat.  You should be holding the cat and talking about the cat.  Well, see, his interpretation is that I should be holding the cat 'cause it's Aunt Esther's cat.  As an older man, the real deal is a black man in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], would not pick that cat up on the street.  He belongs to Aunt Esther.  He wouldn't pick that cat up.  He might throw the cat a piece of meat because it's a special cat 'cause it's Aunt Esther's.  So the director said to me, "Well, you bury the cat.  Isn't he special to you?"  I said, "That's why he's special 'cause I bury him.  If he was not Aunt Esther's cat, I wouldn't even bury the cat."  I hate to make it sound so harsh, but the cat would lay out on the street, cars would run over him until his eyes popped out, and he would not get buried because he was nobody's special cat.  By being Aunt Esther's cat, he got buried.  But as far as me picking him up and holding him, no.  So that was a misunderstanding, that he just thought that this man would hold--a black man ain't gonna go pick up no stray, no cat on the street.  In fact, the cats not gonna let you pick him up (laughter).  So how's this young man, he wants you to pick the cat up and talk with the cat.  The cat wouldn't allow that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) This is a homestead cat, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but this young, this young man thinking they know everything, and, "Oh, but the relationship between you and the cat, and I got to build this relationship 'cause I've been taught in school that if I'm gonna be a good director, I got to build relationships."  Well, you got to build it, but you got to know what you're doing, the period.  You need to study the period.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The relationship can be all wrong in another period.
Story_ID: 494663
Speaker 1: Now, have you ever been told that you're--offstage, you're a lot like the characters you play on stage, and it doesn't seem to be a lot of difference except you have, you can speak two or three different languages, you can read music.  You do a lot of things that the characters can't do.  But you do--your presentation is very much--
Speaker 2: Well, as an acting teacher, you know what I would tell my students is that you use yourself.  You use your instrument and, "So a man thinketh, so is he."  So when I'm playing another character, I think like that character.  The body doesn't change.  But my mind changes.  I can't live that character.  I can't even quote that character when I'm off stage.  Sometimes, I don't even like the character or scared of him.  I played one character that frightened me to death.  His name was Whipping Sam.  And he had one eye and a patch eye, and he tap danced, but he worked in a brothel.  And his job was to (laughter) whip the girls for the madam, and keep 'em in line.  And I played that character.  He had a pinstriped suit and somebody had hit him in the eye and knocked his eye out, and he was one of them men like that.  And I had fun with him on stage, but when the show was over, I was scared to put the clothes on.  I took the clothes and put 'em in the back of my car to take 'em to the cleaner.  I wouldn't even put 'em up in front with me.  I put 'em in the back of the car (laughter) to get 'em cleaned.  I was afraid of Whipping Sam.  But I could play him.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  The character became so real to you that--
Speaker 2: I was scared of him.  I wouldn't go near that character when I wasn't in the theater 'til the time to get ready to go on, I could go on and do Whipping Sam.  I loved it.  He tap danced and sang and he did it, but he had a dark side.  And I had to play the dark side because it was a fun piece, but there was a dark side about him, and I felt it, and it creeped in.  And I felt it.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it had to be a dark side to him if his name was Whipping Sam, and his job was to keep people in line by whipping 'em.
Speaker 2: To keep people in line, and he had fun whipping 'em, but the one thing about him that he didn't hurt people.  He didn't hurt the girls.  The madam would pay him to go up there and whup 'em and straighten these country girls out.  And he'd go up there and act like he was whipping 'em (laughter).  He'd be hitting the, hitting the wall, making her think he was whipping 'em.  So he was a nice guy, and I said, "Well, how could he be a brutal person if the girls liked him?"  So that was a contradiction.  My director said, he was a brute, he beat the girls, but the girls liked him.  So why would they like him?  So I--as a, as a person, I had to figure out with the character, why did they like him?  They liked him because he really didn't beat 'em.  He made the madam think he was beating them.  He was upstairs doing something else.
Speaker 1: We're gonna leave that alone (laughter).
Speaker 2: We'll leave that alone (laughter).  But he'd make the madam think he was beating 'em.  So when they saw Sam coming, they say, "Oh, Sam."  They were glad to see him.  But he was one of them weird characters that I put in the back of my car.
Speaker 1: What play was this?  What play was he in?
Speaker 2: It was called 'Fat Tuesday,' [Roger Furman and Dee Robinson] and I did it at, in New York City [New York, New York].  I did it with Roger Furman's theater [New Heritage Repertory Theatre; New Heritage Theatre Group].  It was theater group there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I won the AUDELCO [Audience Development Committee, Inc.] award for playing that role, one of the first awards I've ever won.
Speaker 1: Okay, and AUDELCO is the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) AUDELCO--
Speaker 1: That's the black audience.
Speaker 2: That's a black audience award for off-Broadway.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you know Hazel Joan Bryant?
Speaker 2: I knew her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And AUDELCO was started by Vivian Robinson, the AUDELCO award, and Mary [Mary B. Davis].  And I knew Hazel.  She had a theater group.  Michael Whitaker had a theater group.  He was part of her thing, uh-huh.  There were a lot of groups around.
Story_ID: 494664
Speaker 1: Have you had a chance to do much theater outside of New York [New York] in other cities and (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I've done regional theater.  I've done 'Piano Lesson' ['The Piano Lesson,' August Wilson] all over the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did 'King Hedley' ['King Hedley II,' August Wilson] in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: I know 'Piano Lesson' was done in Chicago too.
Speaker 2: And I've done colleges--I'm doing my jazz and blues, one-man show ['Just A Little Bit Something,' Lewis Myers], I've done colleges all over America.  I've done nightclubs, including the Hollywood, the Hollywood Hotel [Los Angeles, California] there on Hollywood Boulevard with my nightclub act.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you do in your nightclub act?
Speaker 2: I do blues and sing.  I play the piano and I sing and tell stories and cabaret.  And I performed in Paris [France] and Germany and Madrid [Spain].
Speaker 1: Okay, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It ain't no 'Different World,' and 'Different World,' the TV show that I did in the late '60s [1960s], '70s [1970s], no '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: So it was in the '80s [1980s], yes, right.
Speaker 2: Eighties [1980s].
Speaker 1: Started in the late '80s [1980s], I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, late '80s [1980s], TV show.  So when I go to Europe, they know me in Germany, and they know me in France and they know me in Spain 'cause the show is in those different languages.  And I performed in Spain.  I performed in Germany.  I performed in France, French.  I read, I read French.  I read Spanish, and speak street Spanish.  I read the masters in French and my [maternal] grandfather's [George Brown] German.
Speaker 1: Now, well, tell us about--now, the 'Different World' is a spinoff of 'The Bill Cosby Show' [sic. 'The Cosby Show'].
Speaker 2: Of 'The Bill Cosby Show.'
Speaker 1: Right, and I think you had a role on 'The Bill Cosby Show' first.
Speaker 2: I had a role on 'The Bill Cosby Show' where I got fired from the hospital.  And then when they were putting 'A Different World' together, Bill Cosby told 'em to find a spot for me.  I did his show, and I was fired from the hospital.  He was Dr. Huxley [sic. Cliff Huxtable], and I had been training in, as an actor, and I was this serious actor.  And now I'm doing this comedy on a series, and they were laughing.  And I didn't know the difference.  I thought they were laughing at me.  And I did the scene, and the people just laughed.  I thought they were laughing at me.  I was so devastated, and Bill Cosby said, "Do it again."  I'm saying, do it again?  They're laughing at me.  But they laughed me right on into a contract.  I was this serious actor.  I said, "Oh, they're laughing at me.  What am I gonna do?"  And then I found out that it was a good thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the--you went from 'The Bill Cosby Show' to the spinoff, 'Different World' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Different World'--
Speaker 1: --about a black college.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You played a cook on a college campus, right?
Speaker 2: I played Mr. Gaines [Vernon Gaines].  He was the cook there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was the mentor, the cook, took care of the children.  I had known a man named Andy [ph.] at West Virginia State College [West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia].  He was like that.  He made hot bologna sandwiches and cheese sandwiches, fed us all those--through those years when you didn't have money and the cafeteria was closed.  You could always go to Andy and get a hot bologna on credit.
Speaker 1: That's right.  A lot of the campuses have somebody there--
Speaker 2: Somebody there.
Speaker 1: --that takes care of the students like that.
Speaker 2: Took care of the students.
Speaker 1: Well, more than one person, but--
Speaker 2: More than, but they took care of me.
Speaker 1: That's the attitude of the--
Speaker 2: Yes, they took care of you.  So if you had a problem, they would find it out, and you'd go talk to the dean, and the dean would help you out.
Speaker 1: You know, they say that black college [HBCUs] enrollment went up significantly--
Speaker 2: Twenty percent with 'Different World.'  When 'Different World' went on the air, black college enrollment went up 20 percent.
Speaker 1: Because the trend had been for black students to get away from black colleges, go to the big state schools or the white private schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it went up, and just college in--blacks started going to college, period.  And then right after that, the, the tuition was increased.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's interesting.  I think that the warmth that you probably portrayed, you and Glynn Turman and other people on the show portrayed, as being (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It encouraged a lot of people to go to those institutions, wanted to go to them, yes.
Speaker 1: And what's interesting is that that is basically a--you find a warmer atmosphere for black students--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on black college campuses.  So it wasn't a candy impression.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, it was real, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you felt you were playing a role of somebody you actually--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we had a college day, and I sat--no, it was real.  Yeah, we were down with it.  It was fun.  Everybody knew it was real.
Story_ID: 494665
Speaker 1: What about your film career?  Now, what--
Speaker 2: Well, then after that, I begin to do a little, you know, little small roles.  One of the first ones there was Ty Cobb, with Tommy Lee Jones, was directed by--
Speaker 1: Oh, 'Cobb,' right, 'Cobb.'
Speaker 2: --Ron Shelton.  And then that got me, I started doing other stuff.
Speaker 1: Now, in 'Cobb,' the movie opens up with you, right, walking down a road, away from Ty Cobb's house, I believe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I was getting fired from Ty Cobb, cussing Ty Cobb out (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Now, the interesting about it is Ty Cobb, the great American baseball hero was probably one of the most racist and hateful individuals ever to--
Speaker 2: He was a hateful person.  I guess he was a racist.  He hated everybody.  But his daughter hated him.  His daughter didn't wanna go see him.  So, you know, I think sometimes we give too much cadence to people who call themselves racists.  They're just, you know, evil, ignorant, nasty people.  And whether you're a racist really doesn't matter.  So it doesn't matter whether he was a racist or not.  He was a miserable person, and he didn't like people and people didn't like him.  So I wouldn't even give him the credit of being a racist.  His own daughter didn't like him, so who cares?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty--I agree with you.  So--
Speaker 2: A misunderstood man.  You know, we put a racist--I think it's giving him too much.  He was a misunderstood man.
Speaker 1: And you often play characters that have, are kind of folksy, but they also have like a down-to-earth, tell-it-like-it-is, quality.
Speaker 2: Well, I try to give 'em that because I'm Lou [HistoryMaker Lewis Myers], you see.  And like I tell my students, you bring what you bring to the character.  So the character is gonna be me 'cause it's in my body, but he may not think like me.  "So a man thinketh, so is he."  I can change my thinking and play that character.  But when eleven o'clock comes, I leave that character in the theater.
Speaker 1: Or in the dry cleaners (laughter).
Speaker 2: Go in the dry cleaners (laughter).  I pick him up at seven o'clock, and I leave him there at eleven o'clock.  That's what I try to tell my students, you know.  I don't carry it home with me.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite role of all the roles that you've played?
Speaker 2: They were all my favorite when I did 'em.  They were--each one was different and exciting 'cause it was a different part of life that I would be doing.  So, and it was all part of me.  So how could I measure one over the other?
Speaker 1: Do you have a role that you would like to play?  Is there somebody you would like to play or kind of a person you'd like to play that you haven't played yet?
Speaker 2: No, but I like to explore Jesus in, from the earthly, from an actor's point of view, from the earthly thing.  I think that'd be a character that hasn't totally been explored, and, you know, a char--it's a character.  And I say that, when I say Jesus, as a character because he was one of the greatest cabalist teachers of metaphysics and one of the great practitioners of metaphysics.  He practiced what he preached.  And he taught metaphysics.  He taught what--"So a man thinketh, so is he."  He taught that we were all sons of God.  In his day, there was a common statement that if you studied in that--and you say, I'm a son of God, it was like a sorority.  So when he said, I was the son--"I'm the son of God," he was referring to this, kind of a club that he belonged to, "I'm a son of God."  And anyone who studied that called themselves the son of God.
Speaker 1: Representing a level of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, something like that, a level in the heart of study.  He was the son of God, the study, yes, 'cause he's entered into God's studies, the son of God.  They didn't mean that he, himself, was saying that he was set aside, different from other people.  We're all--and that's the angle that I like to study Him from and seeing Him in that light, I have embraced Him much more than I've ever embraced Him.
Story_ID: 494666
Speaker 1: Just one more question about acting, what is the business like now for black men?  What is it like?
Speaker 2: Bleak.  You--how many black men do you see?  How many sex symbols you see?  How many old, white men you see as sex symbols?  Sixty, seventy, still sex symbols.  Black men, over thirty, how many you see, sex symbols?
Speaker 1: Well, you got Denzel [Denzel Washington] is still popular.
Speaker 2: Well, there's one, Denzel, but, see, we'll always have that--if people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And Samuel Jackson [Samuel L. Jackson] (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --came from outer space and saw our problem on earth, they say something is wrong with that one black ant with all those white ants, and he's fine, but let three of those black ants come there and see what happen.  That one black ant, he's running the company.  But with three of 'em come, they lynch that one over there.  Say, what's going on?  And why are those black ants thinking that they have achieved so much, that they have proven to the white ants that I'm good enough to sit beside you?  Isn't something wrong with that picture?  Who's crazy?  The white ants or the black ants or are both of 'em crazy?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you just described a common, a saturation point theory that a lot of black people have about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: One is okay, two, get a little--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --three, maybe not.
Speaker 2: So who would--you'd look at our problem on earth, you'd say what's wrong with those--something's wrong with that.  Somethings wrong with that when people are bragging, I'm the--he's the first, he's the first black to do this.  What you--to do what?  Who kept him out in the first place?
Speaker 1: So is it tough to--now, you've been in quite a few television shows and movies, playing character roles, and is it tough to find significant work in the business these days?
Speaker 2: You know, I wouldn't know whether it was tough or not because I didn't have that much sense to think about it.  I just did what I did, and they gave me the job, and I did it.  I don't look around now and see that it was tough.  I wouldn't know whether it was tough, easy or what.  I go to auditions and they call me back or they don't call me back.  I don't hear from 'em no more or they call me back and say, you got the job.  I know I'm not giving you much on that, but that's about the best I can say.  And I understand the business, how rough it is.  But for me, I never interpreted it that way because I never let myself be a victim.
Speaker 1: It seems to me that, you know, just looking at your career from the outside, that it was not for black theater, you probably would not be able to do--
Speaker 2: Oh, it got me--the black theater did get me started.  I did Negro Ensemble Company [NEC], that kind of stuff got me in.  And touring.  I went on my own with, like I say, Negro Music In Vogue and all.  I was doing colleges and schools and things.  I wasn't working in theater.  I'd come back in New York [New York], and everything was auditions.  So I kept busy.  That's why I do cabaret now.  That's why I wrote this play 'cause I had been busy doing stuff.  And if a play came along, I could get in fine.  But instead of me sitting there waiting for it, I went to schools, jails, colleges, senior citizens, dog pad, anywhere and put my little show on.
Speaker 1: Now, what did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to every school in New York three times.  In West Virginia, I've been to junior high, high, elementary schools and all over the country.
Speaker 1: Now, what advice would you give young people today trying to get in--young black folks, trying to get in the--
Speaker 2: Into acting?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It's to get as much basic education as you can, get your college, get a master's if you can, study as much as you can, much history as you can, be as broad as you can.  And your health thing.  No one tells 'em that.  But eight shows a week is nothing to play with.  So you got to be healthy to do eight shows a week.  So you got to home and rest.  You got to sleep.  You can't run the streets and do theater.
Speaker 1: So what people think, after the show you go out and party all night, and that sort of thing, it doesn't--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, it doesn't work together.  All the while, it just doesn't work.  You party, then you see what happens to you.  In a few years, you'll be, you know, you're looking like teeth and everything else falling out.  Lena Horne said to me, she says, "Lou [HistoryMaker Lewis Myers]," she says, the party--I said, "Lena, you look so fabulous.  How you do it?"  She says, "They haven't had the party yet that keeps me there after twelve o'clock."  I said, "What?"  She said, "They haven't had that party yet.  They haven't had it yet.  They haven't invited me to it."

Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: The hope, and it's what I'm doing.  We're building a corporation of the future, at the Global Business Incubation [Global Business Incubation, Inc.].  We're a research center that's been seeing why the wealth has escaped the African American community?  Why aren't we, why are we in the conditions that we in--and to correct it.  Well, we believe that the only reason why we're in the condition that we in is we don't have the infrastructure.  It's not our intelligence.  We don't need no more religion.  We don't need no more bleaching cream.  We don't need our hair changed.  We don't need to prove anything.  We need to buy and sell from each other.  And we need to buy and sell from each other so that we can segregate ourselves--and I use the word segregate in a good way, segregate so we can buy, build ourselves long enough so we can partner.  We need to build our store, and then invite someone into the store.  But don't invite them in before we get the store built.  We need to own our own hotel and invite them to come in.  And then go to their part of town.  We need to have a Chinatown, and we need to go to Chinatown and party with the Chinese people.  And then we need to go back to our town and say, now, y'all come up here and party with us and treat them like they're gold, treat them like they're children of God when they come to our part of town.  But we need our own hotel, our own restaurants so we can invite them to it.  So we need to build our own infrastructure and be able to partner.  We need our own banks, not because it's a black bank because we're part of the body that the blood needs to come through.  If we're the leg, and you put a tourniquet on, the blood can't come through.  You got to cut the leg off.  So if we're the African American community, and the blood doesn't come through, which is money and wealth, you either got to cut the leg off or the whole body gon' get sick.  So what we're saying is that we're saying take the tourniquet off so that the blood can flow through the community.  And that's not protest.  We don't intend to sing 'Kum ba yah' or protest.  It's just being.

Speaker 1: I was saying off camera, I just take note of the fact that you actually live in Harlem, not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I came to Harlem [New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: --five blocks from where we are.
Speaker 2: --year before last when I came here to do 'Color Purple' ['The Color Purple'], and I got an apartment here at 127th Street and Convent Avenue.  It's very lovely and the people in the area, they know me.  They know Mr. Gaines [Vernon Gaines] from TV.  And I come in the subway, they holler at me.  And you know what's so wonderful.  They are wonderful.  They let me know that they know I'm there, but they still don't bother me.  But they let me feel like, that we know you're here, we feel you, and don't bother--I feel so comfortable.  I come in at, late at night, and a bunch of teenagers over across the street, just raising all kind of sand.  I'm way over there, and one of 'em hollers out, "If you don't quit messing with me, I'm gonna call Mr. Gaines on you."  And I'll speak to them, one o'clock at night in the summertime, they out there.  And I'll go on in.  And they're just as wonderful and speak.  I'm wondering, where is all this danger?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a tradition in Harlem that I'm glad to hear is still, still like it was.  I've always heard that from people who lived here.
Speaker 2: I'm wondering, where's all the danger?  We had the snow the other night, and my friend was taking me to work, and we had a flat tire and the snow and the rain was so bad.  It was so bad, man, that weather, and it's so slick.  And he had a flat tire.  And he pulled in the gas station at 116th Street, and I had to get out and catch the bus to go on to work.  And I felt so sorry for leaving him there.  And before I got down to 42nd Street, he done called me and told me that he was ready to go.  Somebody came along and helped him with the flat tire, some brother came out of church or somewhere and helped him with the flat tire, and he gave somebody else two dollars and they took him here.  Before you know it, he was back in business.  If he'd have been downtown somewhere, he'd have been stuck.
Speaker 1: So Harlem isn't dead yet.
Speaker 2: You know what?  I'm finding it, not only Harlem, but everywhere, I mean I go places where the biggest racists are supposed to be, and I'm finding wonderful people, you know.  I'm not naive, but I see miserable people.  And underneath there, on subways and everything, you find the sweetest people just trying to struggle.  You find a New Yorker up under there, trying to pay their rent, trying to struggle.  And if you take the first impression of 'em, you may run once you look at 'em, and you say, "Ooh," scared.  But when you hear them, you find underneath that is just a--maybe I'm just into a fantasy world 'cause I'm meeting just wonderful people.
Speaker 1: So you consider yourself an upbeat kind of a person, basically?
Speaker 2: I don't know what I consider myself.  I've been working on myself for a long time.  I don't know what I am.

Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on what you've--everything that you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do again, if you had to do it again?
Speaker 2: If I had to do it all over again?
Speaker 1: Would you do it over, yeah, do over?
Speaker 2: I'd do the same--there's a couple of things I'd do a little different.  There's a couple of little affairs I might extend, but for the most part, I think I'd do the same thing over.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't wanna go back.  I don't want--I wouldn't wanna go back in another life and live over again, oh, no.  I wanna go on.  I wouldn't wanna go back.  But I, if I had to go back, I'd almost do the same thing, maybe one or two little things.  Other than that, it would be the same.  I have no regrets really.  Even some of the fights and things I had, I think I'd go back and have that fight again (laughter).  I even had a good time doing that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So, (laughter) or hit 'em upside the head a little bit harder than I wanted, didn't get a chance to hit 'em as hard or something.  But, you know, we're friends, you know, but I've been blessed with that, yeah.

Speaker 1: Likewise, if you look at everything you've done today, as we sit here today, what do you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I really don't know.  What would be my legacy?  Ooh. I don't know.  I've been so much all over the place, someone else would have to say that.  I, I've grown to the point that I can see mankind.  I'm trying to see and I do see the whole, and I see myself as part of the whole.  And the more I concentrate on that, I find myself elevated in terms of how I see people.  I do see people as what they could be, rather than what they are.  I don't see people as their--that they are.  I see them as to what they could be.  I hate to use that word, god.  I'm not a religious person, but when I see the best in them.  I laugh to myself sometimes 'cause I see such great people.  And yet the person I'm looking at, I know is (laughter), is, you know, full of shit.  But the person that I want them to be, I see a beautiful person underneath that.  And if they just had the ego in check and a little instructions, I think they'd just be just what--through the, the way God looks at you and could we be arrogant enough to think we know how God looks at you.  I think God has a tough job of loving each one of us.  Now, how do you do that?  Because we're all the same, piece of the same dough.  So I try to look at the world as a circle and we're all one, one bucket of water.  So how you gon' take one drop of water out and say that it's different.  So anytime I have a human problem that I have to solve, I go back to that, one water--drop of water in the ocean, is still as much water as the other water.  So what are you talking about?  So when I'm dealing with human beings, I deal with 'em that way, say, what are you talking about?  One drop of water is the same as the other drop of water.  So now, so, now, answer that.  And I'm back to square one, is that, no matter whether they're good or bad or what, I am back to square one, is that they're who they are.  And I'm learning to accept them as that and see them in that perfect light.  And it has helped me.

Speaker 1: Now, I haven't asked about your family.  Now, are you currently married?
Speaker 2: No, I have a--my son is twenty-eight years old, getting, taking his--Melvin Myers, taking--and I have a grandbaby, Brayden [Brayden Myers].  And Melvin is taking his CPA [certified public accountant] for this week, and is in accounting.  He's a wonderful young man, and my mother [Dorothy Brown Myers] is still with me, and my family is small now.  I had a daughter that I left in Japan that I never saw again, a military man, that kind of thing happens.  My family's kind of small now, but my son and my mother and some good friends.  And I don't think I'll marry again.  I think I'm gonna have another fling, another love fling.  I'm looking for one, but I don't think I'll marry.  I think I'll fall in love and go crazy one more time.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Fall crazy in love, one more time.

Speaker 1: Is there anything that we haven't talked about that we need to, that we just have to say today before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, what I'm involved in today is, is rebuilding the African American community and the reason why I say African American, is because that's the part that needs to be fixed.  It's not because I think African Americans are better than anybody else or whatever, but I'm African American, and if I start at home, if I help African Americans, I'm helping the world.  So if I wanna help Chinese people or anybody, if I help African Americans, it's gonna help the world 'cause it's gonna make it a better world.
Speaker 1: Now, are you working on another big project like 'Lackawanna Blues' [Ruben Santiago-Hudson] or something like that right now?
Speaker 2: No, I'm getting ready to go to a little movie in the South.  I forget the name of it.  I'm starting the 29th of this month.  I'm working on a movie called 'Indelible' [ph.] that's being done in Harlem [New York, New York], and it's about a black scientist.  So there're several projects that I'm working on, but, you know, the big exodus movie or something hasn't come for me yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And maybe I'm supposed to just do--but I'm comfortable.  I, you know, I don't wanna stay one way 'cause I've learned something.  "So a man thinketh, so is he."  And what you say will come true.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Certainly, and I know it will.
Speaker 1: Now, my last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't want 'em to sing and dance and say he had fun, and I don't want no funeral.  I want a memorial if they want to have it.  And if they don't, they don't.  I'll slip away.  I like to just do my show and I have a picture of myself laughing at myself, being in the middle of Broadway on a show somewhere.  And it say, "He died"--and the light, but he didn't fall 'til the lights went out.  He was standing on stage center, and he's already dead, but he didn't fall 'cause the lights was on.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And soon as the lights went off, he fell. But as long as the lights was on, he was standing there smiling.  If he--he was already dead, though (laughter).  He just didn't fall (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Sir, it's been a pleasure.
Speaker 2: That's the way I wanna go (laughter).
