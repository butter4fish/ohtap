Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your mother, Mr. Lucas, starting with her name and where she was born and her background growing up, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: My mother, Minnie Hendricks Lucas, was born in Spring Hope, North Carolina, Nash County.  She was the mother of fourteen children, seven boys, seven girls.  She was a domestic.  She did, she took in washing, cleaning, and she did farm work in the fields, picking cotton, tobacco, corn and all those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: And did she ever share any stories with you about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, a major story she shared with, with me growing was that she could not read and write because she couldn't go to school because they had to work and take care--they were sharecroppers, and they had to take care of other people's children so that they can go to school.  So it was quite fortunate that she could educate most of her children.  So the one that she regretted most was she wanted to read and couldn't read.  And so she was always showing us pictures and what not.  And for birthdays and whatnot, she would say, I can't read that, so did you put me any money in my birthday card?
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Well, she was--she had a great deal of integrity.  She was, she always treated people with respect.  She had enormous sense of humor.  She always had the capacity to laugh and make serious things seem rather common.  She was very concerned about the way the kids looked, and she kept her house immaculate all the time.  And she never went to bed until it was late, until everybody else had gone to bed.  But she did give you a lot of confidence.  She was a very secure person, and you felt secure around her.  And she always checked on her kids, even though she was not educated herself, she was constantly asking the teachers and the preachers and everyone else in the community about her children and did they behave properly.
Speaker 1: And did she share any other stories with you about growing up?  I know you shared one with us, but any other stories, I mean about her, her brothers and sisters or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Well, the major thing that she was always happy about the fact that at Christmastime she was always able to make presents for everybody.  So we all expected to get things from the store, what she called store-bought presents, but she made things with her sewing machine and with her hands and whatnot.  And initially, we'd all be very sad that we hadn't gotten anything.  But once they, they became so practical that we were able to laugh about them years later.  And the other thing was, she always--we were always excited about her cooking.  And she cooked so well. And she made it a point at holidays and Christmastime to make a cake or some kind of food that accommodated the needs of every child.  If you, if you wanted a pineapple cake, then she made you a pineapple cake.  If you wanted a chocolate cake, she'd make you a chocolate cake.
Story_ID: 18545
Speaker 1: And what about you father?  What can you tell us about his fath--your father, starting with his name and where he grew up, and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: My father was Russell Lucas, and he grew up also in Nash County, Spring Hope, North Carolina, and he was a lumberjack.  And he did not do a lot of talking.  He was a very quiet man, and you never wanted to do anything to get, to get Russell Lucas, my father, upset with you.  So we, we had a pretty, pretty stern life with him.  So he did not take any back talk at all.  And he did--you did not--if a child came home with a story that you behaved wrong in school, then you were in for a great evening of what I'll call pure hell because I remember getting lots of little switches for my father growing up for things I had said or done.  But--and my father could read and write.  My father could do math.  In fact, he could do geometry.  He was a very bright man, and he helped us with our homework when he could, but, you know, he worked almost seven days a week, and--but he was also a person that people in the community came to for advice.  And we lived in a very segregated community at the time in North Carolina.  It was very--walking a, a really narrow path to stay out of the way of, of white kids who could have caused us a great deal of trouble.  So we managed to develop through him the kinds of behavior pattern that kept us out of trouble.  But he also demanded a, a lot of respect from people based on his own behavior.  But he was aware that he was in a, a segregated community where black people had to take a back seat.  But he taught us an enormous amount of pride.
Speaker 1: And what do you know about his background and his growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, he grew up on the farm.  His parents also were sharecroppers.  He did go to school off and on.  I mean he attended school out of a nine-month school year--I think he went to school about three or four months out of the year.  The rest of the time was devoted to work.  Their recreation consisted primarily of making toys out of sticks and things they found in the woods and whatnot.  He also loved to hunt.  I mean, matter of fact, part of, part of our food was not from Safeway [grocery store] and those places.  It was from rabbits and squirrels and other things that the hunted in the woods.  So--and the same was true of my mother [Minnie Hendricks Lucas] during the spring and what not, we, she would pick berries and, and peaches and, and all those kinds of, apples and we canned fruits that lasted the year round through the winter months.  So, and they didn't earn that much money.  We also raised a lot of poultry and a lot of hogs, not to be sold but for our own consumption.  So we had what was call--what was called a smokehouse in which we would kill pigs and salt them down.  And that would preserve the food for the whole year.  I mean in those days we had no refrigerator.  I think as I grew older we got a, we finally got an icebox where you could buy a block of ice and put it in this box.  And it managed to keep things cold.  But by and large we, we lived with none of those conveniences until I was in the, high school.  We had, we, we really didn't have electricity.  We lived by lamp light and fireplaces and wood stoves.

Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestors?  What do you know about your ancestors?  Do you know if they were free or if they were slaves?  How far back can you trace your ancestors?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandfather was, was--well, I don't know if he was, I don't want to say he was free or not free, but he, he lived a, a great deal of taking care of white people.  Although he lived, himself and his, his family, and their home was a log cabin.  And they were, they were not slaves, so I don't go back further than my grandfather.  But my older brothers and sisters, they can go all the way back.  They can tell all kinds of stories--tales, but I can't.
Speaker 1: And what can you tell us about your maternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well, they were wonderful people.  They, they took part of their own savings to help us, help my mother [Minnie Hendricks Lucas] and father [Russell Lucas].  They're kind of vague too, quite frankly.
Speaker 1: What about your paternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: Oh, they were good people, wonderful people.  They saved their money and what extra money they had to buy things for us, to pay for our school books.  You know, most of us, when we were going to school back then, we shared books.  We never had our own brand new books.  I never saw any brand new books until I got to be a junior or senior in high school [at C. C. Spaulding High School, Spring Hope, North Carolina] because the books that we got, we got from the white kids that were handed at reduced prices.  But my paternal grandparents, they got those for us.  So they had a sense of, basically, they had a sense of education and a commitment that we would live better than they lived.  So that was the thread that held this, this family together.  So, you know, everybody in this family of fourteen, except the first two kids who died, all went to school and the majority of them got a college education which was a miracle.  That's because these grandparents had this commitment to, to making lives better than what they had.

Speaker 1: And Mr. Lucas, what's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory of growing up is, is probably the first time that I was given the opportunity to leave Spring Hope [North Carolina], the little village that I grew up in, and go to town.  The first time I went to town and saw street lights and to see cars and to see all these buildings, it was unbelievable.  And then I went from living in the rural area to Spring Hope, the time when my father [Russell Lucas] took me from Spring Hope to Rocky Mount, North Carolina to take the tobacco to be sold that we had raised that year.  And I went on the back of a pickup truck.  And it was windy and what not, but it was the greatest ride in my life.  I was about, I don't know seven, maybe eight, and I went to Rocky Mount.  And going to Rocky Mount was like going from here to London [England] or Paris [France] or Moscow [Russia].  It was, I couldn't believe that a city could be so large and where did all these cars came from, and where did all these people come from.  And where did all these things in the stores, all these clothes.  And, and I went to a food market where they had canned foods and, and all kinds of these things.  It was incredible.
Speaker 1: And, and can you share some other memories with us?  Describe what family life was like.  You know, what was daily life like in your house?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened, we'd get up, we'd get up in the morning about 5:00 o'clock to get ready to go to the fields.  And that was from the moment that you--that you were able to pick cotton.  All of us would get ready at 5:00 o'clock in the morning.  My mother [Minnie Hendricks Lucas] would have been up by that time and prepared our lunch pails.  So we took our food to, to, to the fields.  And we would be loaded on the truck where the, the white driver would come and pick us up on the back of a huge truck and take us to the fields to pick cotton.  And we would pick cotton until sundown, and then we'd all weigh the cotton, the man would pay us.  We'd get back on the truck, and we would come home.
Story_ID: 18548
Speaker 1: We were talking about what daily life was like, and you had talked about you'd all get up at 5:00 o'clock in the morning.  You'd get picked up, you'd come back. And now what would happen when you got back home?
Speaker 2: Well, when we got back home, we'd, you know, we'd all have to wash up.  And there was no, there was no bathtub.  So we all would get this--each of us had a--we'd take a turn, but we had a tub, a pail where we would get water from the well, and each of us would take our turn and wash up for the night.  And then we would have our dinner.  In this case, with my age, there were about seven or eight of us, that we would sit around the table and eat, get a meal.  And there was no such thing as, as leftovers.  You know, there was no passing the bowl because what happened is my mother [Minnie Hendricks Lucas] would have already passed out what you were going to get.  So there was no such thing as leftover food.  The only time we had leftover food is when we had those Sunday church brunches when the minister was coming, which my mother prepared all kinds of food for that one, once every several months sort of thing.  But--and then we would, we would gather around the stove and my father [Russell Lucas] may or may not decide to tell us a story or may decide to tell us that we were gonna get something new in the house.  I mean you'll get new piece of furniture or it may, in fact, be a new radio because we had one of these tall, two-feet radios that we all sat around and listened to, to fights and daytime serials that used to be rebroadcast, like 'The Lone Ranger' at night.  And we would hear those.  Now-a-days, you know, you have to see everything visual.  Back in those days, the radio was everything.  The radio was magnificent.  And all of us didn't have a chance to get up to the radio so we'd have to rotate.  If it was your radio evening, then you got a chance to, to hear the radio.  If not, you'd have to go on and do something else.  But, as a rule, during the winter months, it was a lot different because my parents really believed when it turned dark, it was time to go to bed.  So went to bed really early, and, and bed could be fun till your parents told you, you couldn't talk anymore because in a, in a queen-sized, in my family you would find at least three people sleeping in that same bed.  They'd try to segregate the boys and girls, but you shared the bed.  Every, everything was, was shared.  There was really no ownership of anything.  And clothes were never thrown away.  I mean they were just, they were just passed down.  And the big form of recreation for my mother was quilting.  They had a group that they used to quilt during the tobacco season when the tobacco had been barned.  And they would grade the tobacco part of the day, and the rest of the day, when they finished, they would quilt.  And they would make all these beautiful quilts and, and they were more than just bed quilts.  They made quilted clothes too because many times the pants were really quite patched.  And since we lived in the rural area, and had to go to school with also, African American kids who were from the city, we called, from the town, whose parents were, there was always an African American child whose father was a physician or a preacher or a teacher or owned a community store.  And it was really quite painful for those of us coming from the rural area to the, to the town to the schools where we had these patches and these hand-me-down clothes.  But, so I always competed against that kind of physical thing in the classroom because in school, I didn't have to worry about patches.  It was a case of brains versus brains, and I usually did pretty well.  So I commanded my respect from them by doing my homework on time and, and getting good grades.  So I, I had that kind of respect.  But it was a, a very difficult thing.  And I can remember my mother used to fix lunch for us, and the city kids used to have all kinds of nice lunches, peanut butter and ham sandwiches and what not.  But we just had biscuits, and frequently, nothing in them.  And so it was, at lunchtime, you were not prone to go off and eat with other people.  You'd sort of go off to the side and eat your, whatever you had because it was pretty tough.  Of course, when I got to, when I got middle high school [C. C. Spaulding Elementary School, Spring Hope, North Carolina] it was different because then I had brothers and sisters who had then gone off to college and were back, and we had started to earn more income from field world, and we started to get things.  And the first things I knew we had a new, new bedroom suite.  And eventually, my mother even got a washing machine.  I can remember getting that washing machine.  She just loved it because she had been used to, all her life using a washing board, where she had to scrub those clothes and lay them out on the grass and what not.  So when we got our washing machine, I guess when I was a junior in high school [C. C. Spaulding High School, Spring Hope, North Carolina], it was like getting a Cadillac or getting a new car.  So it was a big--every possession that we acquired, material, was a big thing in our house because we'd never had it before.  And, and all of us were required to have, have extra jobs.  So we, we, we had extra jobs.  We used to go out and pick berries.  When my mother had gotten all her stuff together, we'd go on our own to pick berries and sell those.  And I used to, I used to shine shoes.  I used to wash people's cars, and I could earn, back in those days I was earning, sometimes I earned as much as a dollar a week, which was an enormous sum of money back then because, you know, a loaf of bread was only three cent.  So it was a, it was a family of enormous pride.  And we always, we always took great courage or great feeling of achievement because we were in a family with a lot of girls, and, you know, none of the girls ever got pregnant.  And back in those days, if you were to get pregnant, that was like death.  In fact, my father was very strict with girls.  He used to pay me--we, we, we lived near, we were a mile, let's say a mile and a half from the town of Spring Hope [North Carolina].  When I say I'm Spring--I don't mean we lived in Spring Hope.  We lived near Spring Hope.  So you couldn't tell people you lived near some place so you were from Spring Hope.  So when I, when my sisters got to the age where they could go out, so my father, my father always controlled his girls.  My mother would, would let them do things so my father would let them go to the movies.  And, and, and they would go to the movies, and--but my father would pay me to, to trail them to make sure they went to the movie, and they'd do things to--they didn't do anything they should not be doing.  So I got paid, and it could be two cents or five cents to follow them.  They never knew that till years later, but I was checking on them all the way.
Story_ID: 18549
Speaker 1: You asked me about the things I liked growing up.  In our movie they--in our town [Spring Hope, North Carolina], they had this movie.  It was segregated, and the blacks went upstairs, and the whites went downstairs.  I never understood why they were letting the blacks go upstairs and downstairs was so good because we were overlooking, we were in the balcony, overlooking the white people.  So it looked they would have taken the balcony and put us on the ground.  Well, I know it was terribly stupid, but we did it anyway.  But the point I'm making is that once a week we got a chance to--growing up, we got a chance when we were teenage boys in the sixties [sic, 1940s], we got a chance to go to a movie on Saturday.  Now, that was providing you did nothing wrong during the week.  You did all your chores.  You picked the amount of cotton--even when we went to pick cotton, we had an allocation.  Either you picked--for your age, you had to pick a hundred pounds.  If you didn't get your hundred pounds, you might be two things.  You certainly won't be going to the movie on Saturday, right?  And secondly, you probably was gonna get a little beating from your father for not carrying your weight.  But anyway, when you did everything properly, picked your cotton, did your chores, then you can get this five cents to go to the movie on Saturday.  So we would--the movie opened at 11:00 o'clock [A.M.] on Saturday.  You had to be back before dark.  So we would go to the 11:00 o'clock movie and stay until 6:00 o'clock in the evening.  We, we would have seen that movie seven or eight times, and it got, it was just each time, we were so starved for that kind of entertainment, each time it got better.  And these were serial movies in which you never knew what was gonna happen to the person.  He'd be falling off a cliff, and they wouldn't let you know until the next week what happened to him.  So what made it exciting is you'd go to these movies.  You'd see what happened to the star in these serial movies, and all week, you'd, you'd bet each other about what was gonna happen to the fellow who fell from this cliff.  So it was, it was continuous entertainment all the time.  So it was, it was a great, it was a great life.  And to this day, I'm a movie fanatic.  I can never get enough of movies, and part of that grow out--grows out of the fact that that was a major form of entertainment growing up as, as a kid.
Story_ID: 18550
Speaker 1: Could you give us the names of your siblings, including their birth order, including yourself?
Speaker 2: Oh, my oldest--now the two oldest kids in my family, I never knew them because they died the first six weeks of birth.  But my oldest brother was Joseph Lucas, the next person in line--and he was a, he was a streetcar switcher in Washington, D.C.  In the old days, we had streetcars in Washington.  So someone had to switch these streetcars from one line to the next.  And that was his job.  He could barely read, but he was very good at it, and my next oldest brother was Dwight who was, worked in the commissary of what was then called the (unclear) equal to hot shops in these food exchanges these days.  So he worked in the commissary there.  And my next brother was, oldest brother, was Cornelius Lucas who happens to live very close to here who's eighty-five and still alive and well.  In fact, he was here last week doing some babysitting for my daughter.  So he's still going strong, and the next brother is, was Russell, who now has Alzheimer's who was the sort of person in the family that held the family together all the time.  He did everything for all of us.  And sort of overnight it happened to him.  His daughter went off to, graduated from Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts].  His, his sons went to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] and what not.  So each generation did a little better than the next.  And then my next brother was, my next oldest sibling was Sadie who took care of all of us growing up.  And then came my brother, [Arthur] Artie, who was a lawyer, graduated from North Carolina State College [later North Carolina State University] in, in Durham [sic, Raleigh, North Carolina].  Then there's Richard was is a, who's a businessperson.  He was a schoolteacher, a retired schoolteacher, owns a cleaners and national market, very successful business.  And I have a sister, Dorothy, who's retired here in Washington, retired from the D.C. school system.  And, and I have another sister at North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina] who worked for the Department of Agriculture in North Carolina, retired.  And I have a sister who's, Hazel, who's deceased, who's--died two years ago from cancer.  But my sister stayed in North Carolina.  Her name is Augusta.  And she's really involved in sort of North Carolina politics and whatnot.  She's really a go-getter.  She has a daughter who's a big business executive, and she has another daughter who's a pediatrician.  And I guess that's everybody.
Speaker 1: And where do you--?
Speaker 2: Well, there's Minnie, Minnie Lucas, who's also deceased, who also was a school teacher.  My family is full of school teachers.
Speaker 1: And where do you fit in the, in the twelve?
Speaker 2: I'm the youngest boy, and I'm, and I'm seventy.  As of this interview, I'm seventy years old.  I'll be seventy-one in September.
Story_ID: 18551
Speaker 1: If you will, Mr. Lucas, tell me a little bit about what your community was like growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, we lived in the, obviously, we lived in a, we lived in a, a segregated community [in Spring Hope, North Carolina], but we all--it was a competitive community because, you know, there was only so much work to do.  So the, the blacks who did the best work got most of the work and got the best of the work.  So we thought we were the best black family in that community.  So, but it was a wholesome kind of thing because we all talked about how much money each family earned from taking care of tobacco, farming and what have you.  And the, the kids, we grew up as kids--one of the major entertainments that we had at seven, eight and nine, ten years old--ten year olds, were watching cars.  We used to get on the bank of a hill and count the cars that go by.  You'd count all the red cars, you'd count all the black cars, who counted the most cars get the prize.  Then we had a, we did a lot of--we shot a lot of marbles, you know.  We had, boys played marbles.  We'd draw a ring and put the marbles in the ring, and we'd shoot to see who would win the most marbles.  That was a major form of entertainment, watching cars, marble shooting and, and hunting for birds with what we called bean shooters.  We would make our own slingshots to kill birds with.  So that was another--we'd go in the woods to kill birds.  And that was another form of entertainment.  Another form we did a lot, we used to go trapping for rabbits.  We all had rabbit boxes, and you'd make your little rabbit box, and you'd put your little food in, and in the morning, you'd go to see if you caught anything.  And another thing, we did a lot of fishing too cause we, we would go fishing and set our hooks, and the next day you go to see if you caught anything.  So fishing, hunting and watching cars, shooting marbles, were big forms of entertainment for us.

Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the sound that, the, the smell that, that reminds me of growing up is honeysuckle.  I mean we had lots of those.  The smell was magnificent.  The sight is that, that causes the fondest memory for me is the railroad tracks and the trestle where the train crosses the place where it takes on water, which was near my house.  It was just unbelievable how this snop--stop would cause, pick up this water and put it back on the train, and the train would take off because, you know, at that stage of my life I didn't understand the steam engine and all these things that, that made things run, but it was--I recall to this day how wonderful it is to go back to North Carolina, walk down those same tracks and go to the place where they used to pick up the water.  And, so that's the best sight.  And the sound is the same sound.  It's the sound of that train that came past our, our house cause we lived near the road, and the train tracks were near there.  And it was just magnificent.  And even today my, my grandson, he's only three years old, he loves the train. (laughs)

Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about what the C in your name stands for and why you go by--?
Speaker 2: Well, I tell people the C mean, it's, I'm committed, that I'm courageous, and I'm careful (laughter), and I'm sometimes cunning.  But the C really is, is Cleotha, and, and I always had--when I was going to graduate school, people used to say I couldn't have a name like that.  And I used to ask my mother [Minnie Hendricks Lucas] why she gave me a name like that, and she said she just ran out of names there were so many of them.  And, and so when I got, when I went to the [U.S.] Air Force, I just dropped the name, picked up the C, and I never got permission from anybody.  I just did that, and, you know, the rest is history.  But everybody's always asking me what that C stands for.  And I, and you're one of the few people that I've told that.  And now, that's a matter of public record.
Story_ID: 18554
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about the elementary school years.  Do you remember the name of your elementary school and some of your teachers there and what that was like?
Speaker 2: Well, the name of the school was Spaulding High School, Spaulding Elementary School [Spring Hope, North Carolina].  The elementary and high school was combined.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that, Mr. Lucas?
Speaker 2: Spaulding, S-P-A-U-L-D-I-N-G.  It was named after C. C. [Charles Clinton] Spaulding which is one of the greatest insurance men in the insurance of black people.  When he grew up--when I grew up, if you didn't know who C. C. Spaulding was, from Durham, North Carolina, Durham North Carolina Mutual [Life Insurance Company], then you didn't know anything about black history.  C. C. Spaulding, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Phillis Wheatley, Marian Anderson, these were people who were on the walls of our school.  And you grew up with--they came alive in our auditorium.  So that's what we grew up with.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your teachers from elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember.  Well, in the, in the first grade, I had this teacher called Mrs. Mooney (ph.), and she was famous for paddling you when you got in trouble, when you was talking out of class or when you were pushing somebody in the line.  And I will never forget her, and I had my share of spankings.  Then I had a, I had a sixth grade teacher, seventh grade teacher by the name of Charlie Brown who incidentally, is still alive; not so articulate any more, but who was a wonderful teacher.  And it's, before I got, when I got to the seventh grade, it's through his inspired leadership that I really became a student.  I mean I really worked hard.  Our library only had fifty or sixty books, and I had read all those before the year was over for seventh graders.  And--.
Story_ID: 18555
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I graduated [in 1951]--when I graduated from high school [at C. C. Spaulding High School, Spring Hope, North Carolina], I must have been the second or third in the class.  I had, I had all kinds of scholarships, but I, I (laughter) decided that I was going to the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, which was then called Maryland State College in Princess Anne, Maryland, to play, of all things, to play football, although I had a, I had a scholarship in, in chemistry and I don't--commencement, I got all kinds of things.  But I had heard about this school that had this famous black football team, and my high school [Spaulding High School, Spring Hope, North Carolina] didn't have football.  The white high school did have football because we couldn't afford uniforms.  And they never wore out their uniforms to the point they would have given them to us.  So I decided look--I always liked football.  I mean I, I mean it was a big thing in North Carolina.  We didn't have a team, so I said, "Look, I'm gonna go to college, and I'm gonna be a football player."
Speaker 1: Let's go back one second, Mr. Lucas.  Let's talk a little bit about junior high school and high school--.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --starting with junior high school.  What was junior high school like for you?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I was, you know, we, we, we--I got involved in as much, as many things as I could get involved in, that my parents [Russell and Minnie Hendricks Lucas] would let me get involved in.  I played, I played basketball in junior high school, had a girlfriend in junior high school.  I mean it was a big thing, this girlfriend of mine.  I thought that, that nothing in the world was--and this was really a special girl because the, the sad part about my junior high school romance was, I was in love with this girl, but she didn't know it.  And she had no idea that I, I was. (laughs)  So, you know, in my mind that was, that was my girl.  And the only reason that she even considered me as a human being was that I was really a very good student, and it was difficult to ignore me.  But she never said that I was her boyfriend.  It was in my mind.  So I grew up for--here I went from junior high school to high school thinking that this girl was my girlfriend.  So that was--and it contributed to the way I looked because I did try to improve on my looks, the way I looked.  I, in fact, there was a little store near the school where the kids were permitted to go to buy things at lunchtime.  And I'd save my money so that I could go to that store at lunchtime and not have to eat these little cold biscuits that my parents had sent with me in my little brown lunch bag.  And I used to buy little sugarcoated buns, and I used to give them to this girl.  And, for that, I never did really get a great deal because it, it was--I only went to her house once to see her.  And I think that was really under false pretenses.  It was a, it was a--it wasn't a big disappointment, but it was--I was saddened by the fact that I'd spent all this time in love in junior high school and a year of high school thinking that, "Look, this is my lady," and it, it didn't happen.  So that was a big disappointment for me.  And then I wanted to play baseball, was not a very good baseball player.  So I decided that that, "Look, I can't play baseball, but I can keep baseball statistics."  So the coach gave me a job of keeping the statistics, and so I got a chance to travel with the baseball team.  We didn't have buses.  We went away in people's cars, so every--the white high school had buses.  They traveled on a baseball bus.  So that was a big thing.  And then, then the biggest thing in high school for me, when I went from junior high school to high school was that I was involved in dramatics and public speaking.  And I, for my high school, I won every public speaking contest they ever created, state, anywhere, you name it.  If I showed up to speak, then the other people knew they were involved in a lost cause.  So I had a reputation for being a good public speaker.  And, and my mother used to be alarmed that, at the fact that I would be out in the yard screaming and hollering.  She thought something was wrong.  I would be out there doing my public speaking on a little stump.  And that was a big part of, big part of high school for me.  I mean I was not, I was not a good athlete, although I played basketball, and it was--I wanted to be a great basketball player and, and that grew out of the fact that I was inspired by the fact that my two older brothers were, were fantastic basketball players.  In fact, had they come along in this day and age, they might have been with the professional basketball team.  That's how good they were.  And I wanted to, I wanted to do that too, but I decided that, my, my hands skills were not so great.  So I just, I resorted to the books.  And now, I mean, I was really, I read anything I got my hands on.  And I was stunned when I went off to the university to find out that people had all these newspapers and all these books.  And I couldn't believe--I used to, when I, I used to get in the library and just walk amongst the stacks just to feel so good around books.  And even to this day, I buy books where sometimes I never read anything but the cover because I want to--I'm addicted to books.  And one of the greatest problems for me with my kids is that I want them to read and read and read.  And we live in this electronic age where no one reads any more.  So they say they're downloading the 'New York Times' and the 'Washington Post' [newspapers], so, you know, it's not the same. Anyways, that was high school for me.
Story_ID: 18556
Speaker 1: I also developed a sense of inequality in high school [at C. C. Spaulding High School, Spring Hope, North Carolina].  I had some sense of justice, and I discovered that black people were being screwed, long before Brown v. the Board of Education [of Topeka, Kansas, 1954].  We, now, we, we had a gymnasium made out of tin.  It was put together during the Work Progress Administration [1933-1939].  It was a, it didn't even have heat in it.  We played there in the wintertime with no heat, had no seats.  Everybody had to stand up during the game.  I mean it was horrible.  We had broken down buses that may or may not get to school on time.  We had hand-me-down labs with hand-me-down books and what not.  And it was just, it was terribly unfair, but we--and I got to, I got involved in that unfairness because when I got to be junior in high school, I also joined the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And I got involved in the NAACP to the point that I went, I became a state-wide youth representative from North Carolina.  I went to NA--NAACP conventions, so I was turning into--by the time I got to be a senior, I was, I was really becoming radicalized, but not in a, not in the direct action sense in terms of, of demanding seats at lunch counters and what not.  I'd, my, my protest was preparation, was that I was gonna get so prepared when I met them on new ground, they would know they had met their match.  So I went off to, I went off to college--.
Speaker 2: What, what was it like participating with the NAACP back then?
Speaker 1: Oh, it was a different NAACP of Ruby Hurley.  He was in charge of all the youth nationwide.  It was, it was Thurgood Marshall.  It was Kelly Alexander who used to be the President of the NAACP, North Carolina.  He was fury, I mean these were real authors.  At an NAACP convention, you could feel the pulse of black people, and they were all great speakers.  And we--I started a voter registration drive in Spring Hope, North Carolina.  I--.
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: Oh, 1949, 1950, early '50s [1950s].  I was --.
Speaker 2: Did you meet any resistance?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I met resistance. (laughs)  My father [Russell Lucas] got calls and my, my, my parents got calls.  "Now, what is this boy doing?"  But it was so bad then as it was in places like Mississippi, but I, I took people to register.  I went, I went and got them and took them downtown to register.  So I was, I was an agent for the local president of the NAACP, who was really John Douglas Williams.  I'll never forget his name.  He was a fit and fiery guy.  He had, he had guts.  He was a "Great balls of fire' person.  I just adored him.  And I kept records for the NAACP.  I registered people to vote, and I went to their national convention.
Speaker 2: What did your parents think about your activity with the NAACP, this new activism within you?
Speaker 1: Well, my, my, my father was afraid for me, but he supported me.  I mean in the sense that he let me go to meetings and what not.  But nothing of the sort that happened to Emmett Till could have happened to me because I was taught you didn't look at white woman.  You didn't look that way.  If a white woman's on one side of the street, you get on the other side of the street.  I mean it just was, it was, it was--I knew my place.  But inside of my mind, I knew that, you know, that one that this would change by preparation.  And parents really, even though my mother [Minnie Hendricks Lucas] couldn't read and write, she knew what preparation was because every time I earned, or any other member of the family earned any honor and brought that honor home and shared it with my mother, she was enormously proud.  And when--I can remember us doing the play, I think it was 'Sense and Sensibility', or 'Little Women' or something, but my mother went to that, that play.  And my brothers were always in operettas.  We had an operetta every year in elementary school [C. C. Spaulding Elementary School, Spring Hope, North Carolina], and my mother was always there on the front row.  And she had an enormous sense of pride, and she would save her money to get the dress and hat to go to that play every year.  And it was a great liberator for my father to even permit us to go away to play basketball.  He finally consented for his daughter, his girl to play basketball.  That was a big decision because they had, they had to travel--from their high school to another high, you could travel as far as fifteen miles to a basketball game at night in a car, some place else, with men around.  So he was, he was, he was dogmatic about some things, but he was also capable of change.
Story_ID: 18557
Speaker 1: So let's talk a little bit about your years at [University of] Maryland Eastern Shore [Princess Anne, Maryland].  And tell me a little bit about what that transition was like, just in terms of coming from the South to the East, and just what were your experiences like at Maryland Eastern Shore?
Speaker 2: Well, I got to Maryland in the summer [of 1951] because you remember I was leaving high school [C. C. Spaulding High School, Spring Hope, North Carolina].  I'd turned down all these scholarships to go to St. Augustine [Saint Augustine's College, Raleigh, North Carolina] and Shaw [University, North Carolina] and all these other schools, all black schools because that, in those days, black kids didn't get scholarships to white schools.  So I went, I said, "Well, no, I'm going to Maryland State, famous football team.  I'm going down there to play football and earn me a scholarship to play there," because I was a big sports fan too.  I mean we're talking Florida A&M [Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] , I'd heard all about that.  So I got my, my stuff together.  And, you know, you could only get into the eastern shore by taking a ferry.  There's a bridge now to the eastern shore, a bay bridge, but we had to take a ferry.  So that was a new experience.  "How in the hell am I gonna get over there?"  So, I took this ferry.  I got the bus over there.  I'd registered and all that stuff.  So I went there in August when the football team was practicing.  I signed up because they had these walk-ons.  And I walked on, and Coach [Vernon] McCain, who was the coach at Maryland then, Eastern Shores, said, "We don't have any scholarship, but if you want to, if you want to come out and practice and play with us and earn a scholarship, maybe you--we'll let you."  So, remember, I knew nothing about football.  So I was reading about football and trying to imagine how to get down in the proper stance to block and all this sort of stuff.  So it was enormous--because I believed that I could do anything if I made up my mind.  Now, this was the greatest mistake I've ever made in my life.  Football season had started.  I had very little money, didn't have tuition, but I got, I got a job in the library, paid for my tuition, and I could stay on the football team.  So they needed players just to--well, they called them dummy players.  They needed players to run against--the real football players had to run against somebody, so I was one of those players that, that had to, to serve as members of the opposing team, which was pretty rough.  I got beat up pretty bad in that, that summer, but I was so determined.  So when the season started in September, and I'd enrolled in school and whatnot, and I was ready cause I had my uniform, and we had a picture-taking ceremony.  They'd given me a uniform, and I, I got my picture made.  And I sent that home to my parents [Russell Lucas and Minnie Hendricks Lucas], my mo--they were so proud that their son was at the University of Maryland State College [later University of Maryland Eastern Shore], playing football.  They didn't know I just had a uniform on, wasn't playing anything.  So anyway, all week we would, we would practice as the opposing team.  So I got a chance to play during the week because they had to beat up on somebody.  So I was the person who was getting beat up on.  So that went on for the first game.  And the second game they were playing, I don't know, Brooklyn College [Brooklyn, New York] or somebody, and they got so beat up, the, they beat this team so bad, they let me in.  The score must have been a hundred to nothing.  So I did get a chance to play this one game.  And so then we got a chance, the next week we were going down to Norfolk [Virginia] to play Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio], and we had to travel, you know.  And they would post the names of the persons who played and practiced the best during the week to take the trip to Norfolk to play Wilberforce that night.  Can you imagine all those bands and all those photographers and the 'Afro [American'] and the 'Journal Guide', all these newspapers taking these pictures.  This was just great stuff.  So I said, "I got to make this trip.  I got to make this trip because people are gonna be reading about this game."  Well, I didn't make the--when they posted the names in the gymnasium, I was not on that list.  And I was heartbroken.  So I went to the coach.  The coach said, "Well, you have worked hard this week.  If you, you get in your uniform, if you can catch a bus down there on your own, you can suit up."  Ah, that, that was really rough.  I mean the idea was to decide to go, but not let anybody know that you were gonna go only because the coach said you could go ahead and go commercially on your own.  I, I went.  I didn't play, but I got, I got suited up.  I ran out on the field.  I sat on the bench.  I was in the pictures, but I didn't play.  So when we got to Princess Anne [Maryland], you know, I got back late because I had to catch a bus to get back.  When I got back the next day, I decided that, "Well, this is not for me."  So I, I decided that, "Look, the semester is gonna end.  I can get myself a scholarship."  So the semester ended.  My grades were so good, they gave me a academic scholarship.  So the rest of the time at Maryland, I was going to school free, but I made the football players pay for that though.  So we had a grading system at University of Maryland that was--Eastern Shore, that was, professors graded on the curve.  And so the highest grade was an A, right?  So if the highest grade was seventy or eighty, you got an A.  And there were a lot of football players in my class.  And they used to come to me and said, "Look, whatever you do, don't set the curve too high."  So for those first month, two months of the second semester, the classes that I was in, they had no chance cause I tried to score a perfect score every time.  So eventually, the coach asked me, said, "Look, what are you trying to do to our team?"  So I backed away a little, but I had my--football players came to me then to help them with their studies.  So it was a reversal of roles.  So I had lots of friends, so that was, that was a big change for me.  That's when I was--and I was also president of the student body the next year, and I edited the college newspaper.  So I had everything, that--I mean I just had the whole thing.  Then I didn't have much of anything cause the end of my sophomore year I left school, I quit.  It was the end of my sophomore year [1953].  I just left in the middle of the semester.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Cause I wasn't learning anything.  I was just getting good grades.  I mean there at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore [Princess Anne, Maryland], and, you know, even a moron can learn the psychology of getting good grades, you know, remembering things and all that.  So I said, said, "This is not for me."
Story_ID: 18558
Speaker 1: I left--,
Speaker 2: And what did you do?
Speaker 1: --my junior year [at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, Maryland], two weeks before the junior, first semester of my junior year ended [1953].  So I lost the whole semester by leaving school.  My mother [Minnie Hendricks Lucas] didn't even know I left.  I just left.  I came to Washington [D.C.] and, to live with my brother, one of our brothers.  And I was--I didn't know, I was down on Pennsylvania Avenue, and I saw this big sign, said, "Join the Air Force and see the world."  That's what I did.  I joined the [U.S.] Air Force.  I went everywhere.  I went to, you know, I was--I did my basic training in, in New York.  Then I went to Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi to study electronics.  I thought, I thought I would be in electronics.  So I went down there in the middle of Biloxi, Mississippi was Keesler Air Force Base, but on the base, it was desegregated.  And a lot of the professors there in math and science came from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], they taught there.  They were brilliant.  So I left Keesler Air Force Base and got assigned to Tripoli, Italy, Tripoli and Africa and Germany.  I went to Germany first, then to France.  And I was stationed in Chaumont, France.  I got on this plane in New York and flew to, flew to Europe.  I'd never flown before in my life.  So I was not at Maryland State College, but I was getting a first-class education.  I was seeing the world.  I was on a plane, on a plane flying to France.  And so I got in the Air Force and I started doing things.  In fact, I was, I was--in addition to being an airman and regular Air Force work in radar and radio electronics, I was also the, the base track coach.  I never ran track before in my life.  The commander said he needed a track coach.  I said, "You got, you got a book?"--and the next day I was teaching track.  And so it was a great experience for me because I was at this base, and on the weekend we would go to Paris [France].  I learned French while I was in France.  You know, I was just a young boy.  I was seeing Paris.  I was on the Champs-Elysees.  I mean how could you compare that with being in school at Maryland Eastern Shore, there with all those farmers and football players.  This was great.
Speaker 2: What did your parents think about this decision?
Speaker 1: My mother was a, my mother, my mother's major concern was, she was disappointed that I was leaving school, but she was, also wanted to know was I healthy?  Was I--are you okay?  And so, my mother wasn't into grades as much as she was, at that point about my being healthy.  So--.
Speaker 2: And your father [Russell Lucas]?
Speaker 1: My father, my father thought I was out of my mind.  I probably was out of my mind, looking back, but at the time it was a crazy thing to do, but I did it.
Story_ID: 18559
Speaker 1: Mr. Lucas, let's pick up when you made the decision to go back to [University of] Maryland Eastern Shore [Princess Anne, Maryland] to complete your degree.  Why did you make that decision?
Speaker 2: Well, I--.
Speaker 1: What year was it?
Speaker 2: Well, it was 1950--I think it was '56 [1956].  I felt, you know, I felt this bond to the university, and I felt now I was, after four and a half years in the Air Force, I felt sophisticated enough to deal with the university, and, and to understand that educations really are won and lost in the library.  That's where you gain an education, and you know, you, you learn, you, you--I came back to the University of Maryland to learn, not to be first in the class or to get grades and what not, but just to learn about life and, and the things that make up my whole thought process.  So when I went back to school, I was a mature veteran who knew what things were all about.  So all the pinochle and card playing and football was just, was gone.  I was there to--.
Speaker 1: And when you graduated, what did you do next, and what year was it?
Speaker 2: I graduated in '59 [1959].  And I met my wife [Freddie Hill Lucas] when I went back to the University of Maryland Eastern Shore.  And she was a chaperone for the Alpha--it was a honorary fraternity, and she was the advisor for it.  And I met her, and I was older than she was.  And I was walking back from a classroom to another part of the campus with her one evening, and I said, "You know, I'm gonna marry you."  She thought I was crazy (chuckle).  And I was living off campus.  I didn't live on the campus.  I could never have gone back to live in a dormitory with kids.  I was beyond that.  So I, that was--I got this degree from the university.  I got myself a wife out of the university.  So it was a pretty good deal.  And then I left, when I graduated from Maryland Eastern Shore, I came to Washington [D.C.], and went to work for the Defense Department [U.S. Department of Defense].  I guess that was then, I went to the Defense Department.  I was a management intern in the Defense Department, and I was the first African American management intern in the office of the Secretary of Defense.  There was none before me.  And it was a, and it was very difficult system to crack.  And so I left there and I went to graduate school at AU [American University, Washington, D.C.], got a Master's degree [1961].  I was also a research assistant for the Democratic National Committee during that same period.
Story_ID: 18560
Speaker 1: When did you start wanting to learn more about Africa and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: I stumbled on Africa quite frankly.  What happened was that I was at the Democratic National Committee.  John [F.] Kennedy had just--.
Speaker 1: About what year was that?
Speaker 2: Oh, what year, what year did Kennedy come up?  I think it was '60 [1960], that Kennedy won for president.
Speaker 1: 1960.
Speaker 2: He had won the election.  I had been at the Democratic National Committee as a research assistant, working then for the Chairman of the committee and [Louis] Lou Martin, who's a famous African American.  And when Kennedy won the election, I said, "You know, hell, I've been here working at the Democratic National Committee.  I need a job."  So Lou Martin said, "Why don't you go over to the Peace Corps, tell them I sent you, and talk to [Robert] Sargent Shriver about giving you a job."  So I went there, and I went to see Sargent Shriver, and he sent me to the General Counsel.  And I went up to see the General Counsel about this job.  He said, "What can you do at the Peace--you don't anything about the Peace Corps."  I said, well-- (coughs).
Speaker 1: Carey, pause for a second.  Thanks Carey.
Speaker 2: So I went over to the Peace Corps, sent there by Chairman of the Democratic National Committee and Louis Martin who was 'Mr. Democrat' for black people, assigned to the White House.  And I said, "He sent me.  I got to have a job."  He said, "Well, General Counsel said why don't you go down and talk to the director for Africa?"  I went down there.  They said, "Well, you know, we don't have any choice.  I guess we have to give you a job."  So they said, "Well, we're gonna assign you to the Togo desk.  That's a country in West Africa, Republic of Togo.  You're now Assistant Desk Officer with Togo."  I couldn't believe it.  Here I am working for the Peace Corps, you know, cable tracking from all over Africa, all kinds of things happening, you know what I mean, because I was used to politics, domestic politics, not international politics.  So in Togo, the country director for that country was having difficulty.  He was not doing a good job, so the word came from Sargent Shriver, said, "This, this fellow you got down there, Lucas, we're gonna send him to Togo to help out."  And I said, "They got to be kidding.  To help out?  To Africa?"  You know, I'd lived in, in France and Germany, and I'd even been as far as Libya which is North Africa and on the Med [Mediterranean Sea], but to Africa, south of the Sahara?  And you know, we still, back in those days, had some distorted pictures of what Africa was all, a lot.  I said, "My God, all the animals, all the people, acting like"--even though I had a college education, I mean Africa is still remote.  No one was teaching one course on Africa when I left college [from the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, Maryland].  So they said, "You got two weeks, you're gonna be going."  I had to get a passport.  I never got a passport before, had to get a visa, and then they said, "Be reminded that when you get to Togo, you gonna have to drive a jeep [automobile]."  I'd never driven anything.  I never had a car before.  So I went out there on Rhode Island Avenue [Washington, D.C.] to the Jeep places to learn how to drive.  I had to learn how to drive.  I had to get an international driver's license.  I got a international driver's license.  I learned how to drive, and I went to the Republic of Togo in West Africa, all within two weeks times.  I had landed in Togo--.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seven--19--in the mid-'60s I guess, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what were your first impressions of Africa?
Speaker 2: I was shocked.  I was shocked at how distorted, how distorted the information that I had gotten on Africa.  One, I was in Africa a whole year before I saw any wildlife.  Two, and when I got there, I landed in Lome, Togo, which is a former French colony, and one of the loveliest little cities on the west coast of Africa.  It was, I mean I couldn't believe it.  And then the people who were running the country were black people.  And the people who were in the stores were black people, and that was the first time I've ever seen a white minority.  That was really, that was news, and that was good, that was cleansing.  So, I just--I, I fell in love with this, this country.  I became a quick study, and the country Director there got recalled and eventually fired.  And I was named the Acting Director for this whole country.  We had about seventy volunteers there.  I mean they were from, they were from everywhere.  They were from University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey].  They were in their early twenties, and, you know, by this time I'm in the, I'm in the mid-thirties and single.  So I just, I just took over the thing.  I just, you know, I just--I mean I'm service involved, means I'm giving people counseling.  I'm defining people's jobs for the--I'm meeting with the government to see whether or not this job was well-defined and whatnot.  I'm negotiating country's agree--country agreements.  I'm trying to keep the government from taxing our salaries and whatnot.  I'm involved; I'm a Foreign Service Officer, this guy from, Spring Hope [North Carolina], by way of Maryland State College [later University of Maryland Eastern Shore].  He, I mean he's in charge over here.  And believe me, I was in charge.  I mean I ran this thing.  I knew everybody, in and out of the government.  And, and what happened there was that, it was delicate because when I took this job on, and a man got fired, a few days later, the Republic of Togo had a coup d'ètat and their President [Sylvanus Olympio] was killed.  So I was in a country with a new government, and I'm in charge.  So they, with the new President, they sent for me because they thought we were spies.  So I had to defend the integrity of the Peace Corps.  I did that apparently.  So I stayed on, and, and did, apparently did all that because about six months later--maybe a little longer, maybe a year later, Shriver's, Shriver's Director for Africa, Ben Franklin Williams [sic, Franklin H. Williams], who was a, one of the African American ambassadors to Ghana and economic and social counsel to the UN [United Nations], he was at the Peace Corps at that time, sent, sent me a cable, and Shriver sent me a cable, said, "We want you to go in Niger with some people," and the French say, Niger, which is up in the desert.  I mean you got to be kidding.  Niger is a big country the size of California and Texas combined.  And it was 102 degrees there in the shade.  It was hot, it was just below, part of the country is part of the Sahara Desert.  So I said, "How can you do this, man?"  Shriver sent me a cable back saying, "C. Payne, it's Niger or nothing."  So I went to Niger which was a--and the day I landed there on the plane, I never knew a place could be so hot.  I mean this place was hotter than hell.  And they had eight volunteers there as opposed to seventy-eight in Togo.  So it was a entirely new experience, but it was a liberating experience for me.
Speaker 1: And then you also started to see some of the differences in the different countries in Africa at this time as well?
Speaker 2: There was a wide contrast between Togo and Niger and Benin and Ghana.  I mean it was the--there were levels of poverty and levels of developmental capacity, how well the French had colonized their former colonies, and how well the British had done their colonies.  So you could see a--but it was the contrast of people.  That's where I learned that African Americans really come in all colors.  And I learned in, in Africa and West Africa in those first five--four years the enormous cultural contribution of black people, both in literature, both in the arts, both in sports.  I mean it was an enormous eye-opener that I had been hoodwinked.  I mean I had been taught that, you know, black people were inferior, and then it was in Africa that I found out that we had a great civilization, and that even in Timbuktu, Mali, there was a, there was a great civilization there when Europe was running around in rags.  And that has been part of my story at Africare, is being able to convince American blacks that they have a great heritage, and to get blacks in America to go to Africa, go to Kenya, go to South Africa instead of going to Paris [France], London [England] and France.
Story_ID: 18561
Speaker 1: So let's talk a little bit about your involvement with Africare.  How did you become involved with Africare and become involved in co-founding the organization?
Speaker 2: I got involved in Africare because of my experience of eleven years in the Peace Corps.  Remember I was in the Peace Corps longer than anyone, black or white, in its history cause I was there six years before they passed a law saying that you could only stay five years, and the law was not retroactive.  So I was in there eleven years in Africa, both in Africa and in Washington [D.C.].  So I had this, this background in the Peace Corps that took me all over the continent.
Speaker 1: Why found Africare?
Speaker 2: What happened was that I became addicted to helping Africa, in the villages, in the culture, in the people.  It became my way of life.  Africa was my Israel, you see what I mean, and I knew then and there that I would never wind up in the corporate world; that I would never wind up in the classroom because I'm so people-oriented, and I'm so committed to, to people in the villages and whatnot of Africa.  Maybe that grow out--that grows out of my background in North Carolina.  I came to have enormous respect for people.  In their villages, even though they didn't have any formal education, they had so much wisdom.  And any time you wanted to be inspired and renewed, all you had to do was go speak and talk with a village chief.  And I discovered something else in Africa, but by the time that I had left America, we were, we were all involved in mass communication, television, movies, radios and everything. In Africa, at the time when I arrived there, the principal form of entertainment was conversation, storytelling in villages.  You would listen to chiefs talk all night with stories.  And it had to be a great experience because you got to remember that ninety-eight percent of the Peace Corps was white.  And we couldn't get white volunteers out of the Peace Corps because they were experiencing something that was absolute, wonderful.  The casualty was that there weren't many black Peace Corps volunteers because they couldn't afford to go and live on these seventy-five dollar a month readjustment pay because their parents had to repay for their college education so that other members of the family can go, and they could pay back to back.  So the Peace Corps never had a large contingency of black people.  It was a great experience though.
Speaker 1: Now--.
Speaker 2: And then, then it goes to your question.  As a result of that experience in the Peace Corps, I came to be the co-founder of Africare, which is comprised of ex-Peace Corps volunteers and staff working for the same cause, but a different compensation.
Speaker 1: And a different, somewhat of a different mission, wouldn't you say?
Speaker 2: Well, the mission--before we were Peace Corps volunteers working in villages.  Africare became a development organization.  We worked in villages, but we also built roads.  We built schools.  We put in water systems.  We created micro-enterprises, and the majority of our staff and, overseas, were Africans.  They weren't volunteers, so we were--by the time I left Africa, we were in thirty-some countries with 250-some projects.  We were working all over Africa with few exceptions.  And then when I got to meet people like [Nelson] Mandela and others and [Léopold Sédar] Senghor and others, all of the African leaders, old and new, I had met and so it was different.  It was a different kind of experience.  It was this diversity, and that's why I became so involved with Africare because I wanted to get African Americans involved.  It was the only African American organization working in Africa.  I mean that's the, that's a great success story, but it's also a tragedy.  We should have hundreds of African American organizations, health and other fields, working all over the continent of Africa, but we have been so brainwashed, and that the literature and the films are so distorted on Africa that sometimes our own people don't want to go because they have, our young people have visions of Africa being so primitive; their schools, everything is so bad, where most of Africa is a lot more modern, their cities than we are.  So, but the point is this civilization of culture, of things that are accomplished.  When I went to see David Rockefeller one time about a grant to Africa, and I looked on his wall and he had an African mask that was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Had I seen that, and had I dropped that mask on the street of the ghettos of inner-city Washington, nobody would have picked it up because they would have thought it was a piece of trash.  This culture, this thing called Africa.  And that's where our great hope is.
Story_ID: 18562
Speaker 1: Now after thirty years with the organization, do you feel like you were successful in bridging the gap between black Americans and Africa or do you, or do you feel like--?
Speaker 2: Now, that's unfinished work, but even though it's unfinished work, we made a significant contribution.  Just take one organization for example, the Links or the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority], they have Africare projects.  They have their people, The Links [Inc.] have a big water well project all over Africa.  They've dug wells all over Africa.  They've gone to visit people in Africa.  The AKAs have gone on trips in Africa.  The Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta sorority] have gone on trips in Africa.  The Omegas [Omega Psi Phi fraternity] have gone on trips in Africa to watch and see their projects.  So for the first time, because of Africare, we've gotten an involvement that we never had before.  We had TransAfrica [Forum], but TransAfrica was direct lobbying to get the [U.S.] Congress to pass laws that would be more favorable toward the African countries.  But we have involved people in Africa.  And the only way to get involved in Africa, you also have to write a check for programs, that Africare needs funding.  It also means that we have to get the government to do more programs with Africa and for the first time, Africans are coming to the conclusion that their continent is not gonna be independent until black people in this country is independent.  And black people in this country are not gonna be free until Africans are free.  We are a country founded on diversity.  We are made up of people from other places.  If you think because you are black, and that you can go to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] or Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] and feel free without knowing anything about Africa and appreciating Africa, then you are one of the most uneducated people in the world.  This is a country made up of people from other places.  Either you have a culture of heritage that you are proud, then you are lost in America.  And by the fact--by the way, there are a lot of African Americans with Ph.D.s and high, other higher education who are lost because they don't know who they are.  Whatever you think you are, you are African, and if you get away from that, you've got serious psychological problems.
Speaker 1: But is that part of the problem, that too many people want to disassoc--too many African Americans want to disassociate themselves with Africa, and they really don't see the connection between themselves and Africa?
Speaker 2: Well, that's, that's part of the problem.  And part of the problem goes to school curriculum.  Any time you, any time, you're a superintendent of a school or a PTA [Parent-Teacher Association] or what not that does not have part of this curriculum, the history of Africa and what it means, then you're not getting a good education.  Just stop to think for a moment. Nigeria alone has a hundred and thirty million people in Nigeria.  And Nigeria has something to give to the world other than its oil that we're interested in.  It has enorm--when you look at the culture of the Igbo, Yoruba, and Hausa people, not to mention to the lesser racial groups, these are enormous contributions.  We've never been able to appreciate it, you see what I mean because our definition of dance, our definition of culture, our definition of dress, these are American definitions.  I'm not saying that we don't respect those.  We should, but the bottom line is that in America, if you don't respect your own culture, no one else will respect it.  So therefore, when we get involved in the educational system, we have to insist that in the schools and churches and whatnot, part of the curriculum can be about Russia and Europe and Asia, but part of that curriculum need to be about Africa, beyond the slave trade and certainly have a discussion beyond just--there's something else in Africa other than AIDS [Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome].  We now talk only about AIDS, and it's a problem that need to be solved.  But Africa goes on with an enormous contribution to the world.
Story_ID: 18563
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about how things changed over the past thirty years, just how it was initially in 1970, and how Africa was, compared to how Africa is now in the twenty-first century?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the biggest thing that's happened in Africa is that Africans themselves have grown up.  I mean, the Africans, you got to know, when I got to Africa, the colonization process was just ending, but the colonizers were still there, behind the scene, manipulating the government and trying to manipulate the cultures.  That has changed.  I mean Africans are saying, you know, we may not have much, but what we have it ours.  And if we do it right, we'll have as much as they have.  So you've got this confidence that's been built up in Africa because now we have Africans that come here and have more pride than we have because they have a sense of their own culture, you see what I mean.  And for God sake, you can never measure Africa by a taxi driver in your city or some taxi driver from Sierra Leone or Kenya or Nigeria.  That's not Africa.  Africa is a--I don't want to sound culturally arrogant, and I don't excuse anything that goes in Africa, like corruption or anything else, but Africans didn't invent corruption.  Africans, Africans have corruption, but they don't, they don't have things as big as Enron [Corporation], you see what I mean.  So we have to get past that thing.  You have to get past, what is the definition of beauty for black people, you see what I mean.  So we've had a different value system, and we've been taught a different value system.  But we're beginning--and that's the big challenge for black people, is that pride and insist that we need to educate our white brothers and sisters about this continent too because that's part of where their racism and prejudice grows out of this sense of superiority.
Speaker 1: Are people more willing to accept and understand Africa a little better now, you find, or thirty years ago in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Now, the change has been slow, but the change is coming.  I mean I'm seventy-one, but I'm convinced by--I'm convinced over the next twenty-five years the flow of African Americans to Africa will be the likes of which you've never seen before.  Even Dr. Leon H. Sullivan had started that movement of people going back to see Africa because we get--that's because the Internet is here.  The informational system.  In Timbuktu [Mali], you got a man there who can barely read and write, he's got, got a computer in front of him.  They got Internet cafes over there so you're beginning to make--the communication revolution is making all of these changes.  And let's face it, by the middle of the century, America and the world will be color, and the minorities of people will be white.  And you won't have those--even in places like Brazil and Bolivia where you have the minority controlling eighty percent of the wealth, ninety percent of the wealth, but in the hands of white Latinos, who came from Spain or some other place, that's gonna end.  It's, diversity is on its way.  And even for us, the Hispanics are here.  They're part of the culture.  That's what makes America great, and that's what's gonna make Africa have its place.  It's coming.
Speaker 1: But change also has to take place on, on a government level as well.  How good of a job do you think Africare has done in terms of communicating the same message to our leaders, to the president, to Congress, etc.?
Speaker 2: Not well enough.  I mean part of our problem is that we, Africare is a non, Africare itself is a non-profit organization, non-political.  So we haven't been political.  We've just been doing our development so we can have our tax exemption.  And that was a disappointment that, that TransAfrica [Forum], our major lobby, has sort of stepped away.  But now we have to change that.  We have to say that it's wonderful to have appointees in the government like [U.S. Secretary of State] Colin Powell and [National Security Advisor] Condoleezza Rice and some others, but that's not good enough.  We have to get down into the bowels of the State Department and the Agency for International Development [US-AID], the Department of Labor and whatnot, having quote, "Blacks at the top," but no blacks at the bottom, in the middle won't get us there.  So we, we are looking, we have to insist on governments where we, as black people, pay taxes, that we are active participation, participators in the real decision-making process at every level.  That is the challenge.  That's the challenge for the current administration, and that's the challenge for the next administration, current or new.  It's because as taxpayers simply put, we're not taking it any more.  It's coming.  "We want to be a part of the future."
Story_ID: 18564
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about some of the challenges currently facing Africa, corruption, civil war, and AIDS [Acquired Immune Deficiency Sydrome], the AIDS epidemic.  How are those challenges impacting Africare's mission and work?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the HIV [Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus] AIDS crisis impacted everything because the disease is touching every aspect of African life in most countries because the, the teaching staffs are being depleted because HIV/AIDS.  The military is being depleted because of HIV/AIDS.  And so we may be working with a counterpart on a project one day, doing wonderful work, and the next day he or she is dead or been told that they got AIDS, and they can't come to work anymore.  So that project stands a chance of being eliminated.  And then on top of that, there are literally thousands and thousands of kids who are orphans there because their parents have died, especially in places like Zambia and what not, South Africa and other cases.  But there, there--Africare and others have been lobbying hard to enhance the level of assistance for, for this disease in Africa.  And there, there have been some, some breakthroughs in the sense that the administration did appropriate fift--promise to put fifteen billion dollars in this disease in Africa.  So that's a major breakthrough for us.  And no one has been more inspirational in making it happen than [U.S. Secretary of State] Colin Powell.  He really has worked and seen the impact of this disease and the same is true of [James] Jim Wolfeson, head of the World Bank.  So we are, while our projects have been impacted by this disease, there are now finally some real breakthrough for trying to conquer this disease.  There--the other problem is being able to, to buy low-cost drugs, and there's been a struggle in the pharmaceutical industry to get drugs to Africa, Africans with this disease, that they can afford.  But there's a 125 million people impacted with this disease.  So that now it looks like this week there's going to be a breakthrough where drugs are gonna be made available at a cheaper cost and some cases, no cost.  That would mean a lot.  So--.
Speaker 1: What about civil war?
Speaker 2: Civil war continues to be a major problem for Africa.  There's still a question of--we call it tribalism, it's ethnicity, ethnological wars.  A lot of work's been done on it, but not nearly enough because, you know, we fought them, and we're still fighting.  We have tribal wars and south versus north, east versus west.  And we change that by changing the way people are represented nationally in the [U.S.] Congress.
Speaker 1: Does that hurt the cause though, and the mission of Africare?
Speaker 2: Corruption, wars because there're so many displaced persons in Africa who left their village because of war, famine and what not.  So we have to get control of the arms that are going into Africa, and we have to do something about Africa's poverty.  Poverty creates wars because someone, some group try to take what another group owns or racial group not being able to share what's in the next village because the next village may have water.  They're not entitled to just that water themselves.  They need to share that.  One part of the country may be well equipped to grow certain agricultural products; other part may not, so you have to learn to share things.  So the big problem facing the continent, which we are working on, is managing diversity, getting Africans to work together, an enormous challenge.  Let's say if you get the Hausas of Nigeria, the Yorubas and the Igbos all to work together for the same cause, then Nigeria would be one of the strongest countries in the world.
Speaker 1: How do you do that?
Speaker 2: Well, you do that by--one of the things you do is that when you make resources available, you don't make them available to one group.  When you train one group of women, you just don't train Hausa women, you train Hausa women, Yoruba women and Igbo women.  And you do things, you create projects in which people are forced to work together because the biggest problem facing people in Africa is the same problem that face us here at home.  There's a lack of communication.  When you look at the fact that on Sunday morning America, the churches are white and black and Hispanic and Asian.  No one is talking to each other.  People at the top talk to each other, and they talk officially, but socially, they never get together.  You cannot build a multi-culture, non-racial society unless people are speaking with each other.  So all of all programs of foreign assistance should be influenced and governed by how they bring people together.  See, in the past, we just talked about, "Well, we'll help this group or help that group."  But when you do that, you reinforce racial differences.  You could have racial pride in Africa, one race at a, at the same time making sure that their work could have mutual respect.  That is a challenge.  That's the challenge for this administration and the next because how do you make Islam and Christianity work together?  How do you make dark and white people work together?  That's the challenge in Africa.  That's why Africare programs are staffed by the people from an interracial group.
Story_ID: 18565
Speaker 1: Of all the administrations you have worked with over the past thirty years, who do you think as been the biggest friend to Africa, and who did you enjoy working with the most, which administration?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd be--I, I would have to--and I really enjoyed, I mean [U.S. Presidents] Lyndon [B.] Johnson had his deficiencies, but I enjoyed that administration.  I enjoyed working with [John F.] Kennedy.  I think [Bill] Clinton is, had some real concerns for Africa, but I'm also, I'm surprised and pleased that, in this administration [George W. Bush], in terms of assistance to Africa, it's been the best that we've had in a long time because we now created this, under [U.S. Secretary of State] Colin Powell, this millennium challenge administration, which the administration is making five billion dollars available to those countries that have low corruption, good governments, no wars, equality and opportunity.  So we never had--that's larger than all the aid programs we ever had in the past.  And that has been inspired by, by Powell and others.  So, and that, then we created the, we created the African trade bill, started under Clinton and then continued under this administration.  But these are breakthroughs so it's hard to say.  I mean with Clinton we had enormous access to him.  I mean I did, had a lot of access because I went on personal missions for him.  But when, when George Bush, Sr. [sic, George H. W. Bush] was here, I traveled on numerous occasions with him to Africa.  He had a real concern and commitment for Africa.  I think for the first time, with the releasing of [Nelson] Mandela [in 1994], and the renewed awareness of African Americans of what we ought to get for Africa, this next administration, be it Bush or Clinton--Bush or [U.S. Senator John F.] Kerry, the point is, we're gonna insist on Africa's share of this pie, the likes of which we've never done before because you got eight hundred million people in Africa.  And the color of the water is changing, and Africa has vast resources, but what Africa needs most is again, the question of poverty.  Africa is rich, it's resource rich, but it's the people who need help.  They need jobs and we have to help create jobs.  Now, our relation--our foreign policy toward Africa must become the same as our foreign policy toward Europe and toward Asia, you see what I mean?  You got people in the Department of State and other places, they work all the time on these other countries--France, Germany, you know, Russia.  They're in our national interests.  And what we're saying is that we're gonna have to devote more resources--not just financial resources, but thought processes of how to help this continent.  I think the change has started, but black people have to be a lot more aggressive regardless of the administration that's coming to power.
Story_ID: 18566
Speaker 1: What about the changes in South Africa that you've witnessed over the years?  Can you just briefly share your thoughts on that?
Speaker 2: South Africa is a miracle.  No one said that South Africa would never be free, but it is free.  And we had, you know, we, South Africa, gave the world Nelson Mandela and people like Desmond Tutu and whatnot, and this country has taking one of the most racist societies in the world and making it work.  It's not there yet, but you have to look in the past in order to look into the future.  There was no hope in the past.  Now, there's real hope.  What South Africa has to do is what lots of countries have to do in the third world, is that you cannot have the majority of a small minority in the country, controlling more than seventy-five percent of the wealth.  It won't work because that'll create chaos.  So that's the challenge for [Thabo] Mbeki, but also it's the hope because South Africa has showed the world that we are capable of building a multi-culture, multi-racial, non-racist society, where race doesn't matter.  And the, and the only people that matter racially in South Africa is a few people at the top who don't believe yet in the Nelson Mandelas of the world, but they gonna have to believe or they gonna be left behind.  So that's the great hope.
Story_ID: 18567
Speaker 1: Do you ever feel any resentment or face any criticism from African Americans who say, there are, many of the same problems exists here in America; poverty, AIDS [Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome] in the African American community.  So the time, the money and the effort that Africare devotes to the, dealing with those issues in Africa should be spent with dealing with those issues in America?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I get, I get that frequently.  People say "We haven't lost anything in Africa.  We need help here at home."  Well, we do need help at home, but you're not gonna get that help at home until people begin to respect us as a black culture, you see what I mean?  That becomes important, and we need to get Africans to do that too because you got to remember, all of the money being made in Africa from oil, from agriculture, from imports and exports, African Americans are not making it.  Some of them are, so we've got to get African Americans involved in a vested interest in Africa.  So therefore, we got to ask, we got to ask Africa to--when they decided, for example, to, to make oil allocations, when they decide to have timber shipped somewhere, they need to be talking also, not just to white people, but to African Americans also.  So the only thing we have an obligation ourselves to organize our communities so that we can take advantage of the economic opportunities in Africa.  There are vast--when you look around you, what do African Americans own in America?  Do they own IBM [Corporation]?  Do they own Chrysler [Corporation]?  Do they own General Motors [Corporation]?  They don't own them, they invest it.  In Africa, they would get a chance, now what?  To start things new.  The Irish came to America, and they built things.  So we got to get our kids and our young people and our investors investing in Africa, and we got to get Africans to understand, they're not going to be world players in the global community unless they can take advantage of this historic connection of thirty to forty million African Americans that they have not yet taken advantage.  When they understand that political connection, then the foreign policy between Africa and the U.S. will change.
Story_ID: 18568
Speaker 1: Why did you decide to step down from Africare, and when, when did you make that decision?
Speaker 2: I spent more than thirty-two years there, I decided to step down because the work, the work at Africare was just tremendous, you know.  I mean I was getting there at 6:00 o'clock every morning and leaving there at midnight and still had plenty of work left.  So, you know, after thirty-some years of doing something, it's time to step aside and give somebody else a chance.  And that's part of the problem with, with change.  Most black people never leave jobs until they're taken out on a stretcher.  I mean I left while I still have some health left.  I'm still working, and I'm still a member of the board of Africare, and so it's time for, it's time for new leadership.  Anybody who's seventy years old, who's running an American organization, NGO [non-governmental organization] or whatnot, and the African American community need to resign tonight and give young people a greater opportunity to work.  This is an enormous challenge, enormous excitement so you need ideas, and that's why I left.
Speaker 1: What do you think of your successor, Mr. [Julius] Coles?
Speaker 2: Well, I think he's doing a good job.  I think, I think this is new for him because he's been in that bureaucracy where everything runs on rules and regulations, and, and, you know, with a non-profit organization like Africare, is that you've got to be sure that the people that you work, that you inspire them.  You got to be able to inspire people.  So this is really--Julius Coles's challenge is to inspire the workforce.  And I, I think he can do that.  He's in a learning phase.  This--I mean Africare was a way of life for us.  We ate, slept the thing night and day.  People like Joe [Joseph C.] Kennedy who came there at the beginning with me, Kevin [G.] Lowther, Alan Alemian, these are people who believe in the organization.  They've put blood, sweat and tears there.  So the new leadership has to take advantage of all these people who are committed because it cannot be a job.  When you work for the Federal government, by and large, it's a job.  When you work for Africare, it has to become a way of life.  You can never be too tired to go to a church to give a speech, to visit someone in a village, to go see a village chief and whatnot on a trip, to go see some African dancers, to go and visit a mother who's lost her son or daughter to HIV/AIDS, to develop some appreciation for Africa's culture, and to understand our responsibility as, as Africans is not just to Africa.  We have to build this bridge to our black communities and show them what their ancestors are all about.  You got--if nothing happened from our interview, you got to have pride in Africa.  It's a country that's founded on communalism.  As I said before, diversity.  If you live in America, and you're not proud--and you're African American, and you're not proud of Africa and your culture, the psychologically, you have a real problem.  You--our kids can't have that unless we have dialogue, unless they see things about Africa, that they understand both its geography, its culture and its leaders.  When they understand that, when they walk into a room, they will know who they are, and they can reach out to their white brothers at the middle of the century because they're going to be the majority, people of color.  It's coming, so we have to get them ready.  And we have to work in the schools.  We have to work in the churches.  We have to work in community groups.  We have to reach out to people.  That's the name of the game for black leaders.  They got to reach out, male and female to our young people in America.  If you do that, and we need to share Afri--we got to be Africans going to our churches, ambassadors, ministers and what not, speaking in our schools because that's the connection.  So if you are an African American, and you've never had an African in your home, I mean that speaks volumes to how screwed up you are, you see what I mean?  If you haven't read one book about Africa, you haven't one poem about Africa, you know nothing about Africa's culture.  And then you say you are educated because you have a Ph.D. or Master's degree or you work for a major corporation.  No way.  That's one of the things that I admire about the Jewish community.  There's no question--what makes them so strong is their great appreciation for their culture and their great unity.  And that's what black people have to understand, is that we don't need to talk down and against each other.  We need to be working together, encouraging people, even those that we don't like sometimes, encourage them to get to the top.
Speaker 1: How do you think your career with Africare, what impact do you think it's had on your family?
Speaker 2: Well, my daughter, my youngest daughter wound up as a U.S. Protocol Officer for Mrs. [Hillary Rodham] Clinton for seven years traveling with her and the president [William J. Clinton].  She's now at the Hotel George in Washington [D.C.], as a sales manager--her degree is in hotel hospitality and management.  She loves people.  And when, if I were going to a hotel to, to talk to somebody, I'd talk to her because you get the first-class treatment.  You get emotion.  You get feeling, and that's what the thing is all about.  That's what all of my kids have.  They have feeling and they have respect for other people.  They love people.  I mean they got a degree in loving people.  It doesn't pay a lot, but they, they care for people, and I think that's true of--one of the reasons I married my wife [Freddie Hill Lucas] is that she cares, and she reaches out to people.  And that's the thing that, that black people never give up.  That's what they have to translate.
Story_ID: 18569
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean I'd like to, like for people to, to--in Africa and the villages and every where else to think that everything I had, every ounce of brain and talent that I had, I gave it to help make Africa better and to get Americans more and more to appreciate this great continent.  That's what, I want people to say, "C. Payne Lucas, he didn't know a lot about America, but he knew something about Africa," not everything about Africa, 'cause it's good to remember, that's part of the problem.  It's fifty-one countries, 800 million people and several times the size of the United States of America.  I want people to know that every time I set foot in Africa, I tried to make Africa better.

Speaker 1: I just hope I got another thirty or forty years to work it on Africa and getting Americans involved.  I'd like to see hoards of African Americans going to Africa, but I also would like to see hoards of white kids going to Africa to see more than just the wildlife of Africa.  I mean I know less about wildlife in Africa.  I would give anything to go to a game park in Africa to see some wildlife because I've been going to Africa to work with people.  I think the flow of traffic to Africa must embrace black people, one and two, we just get as many white people to go that understand that black people have a great culture; that it's not all in Ireland and the Queen of England.
