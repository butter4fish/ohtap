Speaker 1: All right.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Billy Joe Evans, B-I-L-L-Y J-O-E E-V-A-N-S.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now is there a story behind why you're named--is, is your name officially Billy or--?
Speaker 2: My legal name is Billy Joe and I don't know of any story it's just a good old southern name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: People talk about black and white but we black share the same name reservoir as did the white.  So I think Jimmy Carter's [James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr., 39th President of the United States] brother is named Billy Joe or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, August 18th, 1942, Macon, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm professor emeritus of chemistry at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor].  So I guess my occupation is that of a professor.  My area of interest is solid state chemistry and magnetism.  So at the University I taught courses in inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry and occasionally but not often, general chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is October 22nd, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: At the present time you're in my residence at 810 Oxford Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan in the campus area of the university.

Speaker 1: Before we go into depth there are five lightweight questions that we always ask that only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--?
Speaker 2: Well I have actually three but if you only want one I'll give you one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's, my favorite is banana pudding.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Not, I don't have a strong preference but I definitely don't like a lot of brown.  I would say if I had a favorite color it's probably gray or a blue that's not very dark.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes, my favorite time of the year is -- depends on what part of the country I'm in.  But autumn tends to be my favorite time of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Does it have anything to do with school beginning in autumn or--?
Speaker 2: A little bit.  I'm always excited about school and the campuses are so nice in the autumn, somewhat quiet, the leaves are falling and one can walk the pathways comfortably.  I grew up in the south so the spring wasn't really my favorite because it got hot very soon, very quickly.  And so by May, it was really too hot to be in the rooms and we had no air conditioning so I guess that's why autumn is my favorite time of year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Europe.  Almost anywhere in Europe is a favorite place of mine though I tend to like the German speaking countries, Austria, parts of Switzerland and of course Germany.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite phrase or saying?  I'm sure I do and I guess one of them might be and this comes from my teaching, who told "jew" that as opposed to who told "you" that.  Who told jew that.  [Laughter].
Story_ID: 22971
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side and we'll start with your mother's side so we don't get them mixed up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Mildred, M-I-L-D-R-E-D Owens, O-W-E-N-S.  That was her maiden name, Mildred Owens.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born December 2nd, 1920.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: In Fitzgerald, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Fitzgerald, Georgia.
Speaker 2: That's an unusual town.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: It was actually a planned city.  It did not evolve. It was founded in the late 19th century by a land speculator from Indiana who wanted to set up a town in which both the northern and--union and confederate veterans could live together.
Speaker 1: Well did the experiment work?
Speaker 2: Not really.  They, initially they pledged to not grow cotton because of the implication for the labor market.  But they did in fact grow cotton and I suspect that my mother's family was there because of that.  The people who moved there didn't know anything about how to grow crops in the south and so they depended upon blacks to teach them how to farm in that area.
Speaker 1: So this is created by this land speculator--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as a place where union and con--former union and confederates could dwell in peace--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --without cotton as a--?
Speaker 2: Without having cotton there because of the legacy behind cotton.
Speaker 1: In the (unclear).
Speaker 2: But they didn't stick to it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's an interesting place (unclear).  So your mother then, her family came there to help deal with the cotton after they decided to--?
Speaker 2: Right, that's my speculation because the whole family moved away from Fitzgerald to Macon [Georgia] where I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side?   Were they--?
Speaker 2: I don't know very much about my mother's family.  I can only go back to my great grandparents.  They would have been an Allen--the name was Rawls, Allen Rawls and I believe my great grandmother was named Martha Rawls.  As far as I can tell my great grandfather was as very strict person, probably worked as a laborer.  But the--my mother's generation as well as the generation before her seemed to have revered him.  So my speculation that he was a very strict disciplinarian who ran his house well but without a lot of resources.
Speaker 1: Allen Rawls.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: R--A-W-L-S?
Speaker 2: R-A-W-L-S, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is your family any relation to the Rawls in Chicago?
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: Reverend Rawls and--?
Speaker 2: I would imagine not because I know all of the descendants of that parentage and they all moved to New Jersey.  You probably read the book by [Isabel] Wilkerson on 'The Warmth of Other Sons' about the migration and so I think this family migrated on the east coast up to Newark [New Jersey] rather than to Chicago [Illinois].  But on the other hand where they--there's some land that's still owned in the town and my wife and I pay taxes on it and there are some Rawls still there.  So it may well, there may well be a connection.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we've not explored it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I thought I'd ask that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And now, so your mother's family owned a--now your grandparents, what were their names?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was Martha, same as her mother and Powell, Powell Owens, P-O-W-E-L-L.  My grandmother I knew very well.  She lived in Macon.  My grandfather on my mother's side, I did not know him very well.  He lived in Sanford, Florida and he came to visit us on two occasions and on one occasion he stayed with us for about two or three weeks.  But he was not a strong presence in either my life or my mother's life.  My grandmother had children by a number of different fathers and I think she must have had about five girls.  And my mother shared her father only with one other of her sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now by your mother's family eventually owned some land in Macon--
Speaker 2: In Fitzgerald.
Speaker 1: --and in Fitzgerald.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they didn't own any land in Macon.  I think they came to Macon to work in some of the mills.  Macon was a big mill town.  We had lots of cotton mills in Macon even when I was a--growing up there.  There were maybe three or four very large cotton mill operations in Macon.  So I think they left Fitzgerald to come to Macon for better work opportunities.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did your mother have any--so then her family was associated with the cotton mills in terms of work?
Speaker 2: That's, at least in terms of what my grandparents did.  Her family was a family of women and they tended to do domestic kinds of work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother have a chance to go to college herself?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I think my mother finished elementary school and may have started high school but she did not complete high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was, of course everybody would say this but she was, she had a good mind but she wasn't very well schooled.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your mother ever talk about her aspirations, an occupation that she dreamt of doing?
Speaker 2: No, no.  My mother had eight children and so her life was consumed almost entirely of raising the eight children.  And she died at a very early age.  She died when I was sixteen so she never had the opportunity of having a life when she wasn't raising children and able to reflect back on what, back or reflect forward on what she might have done.
Story_ID: 22972
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to move to your father's side.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well my father has two names.  His birth name was Niles, N-I-L-E-S Roundtree, R-O-U-N-D-T-R-E-E.  And that was a name given him in Sallis, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Sallis--I--?
Speaker 2: S-A-L-L-I-S.
Speaker 1: S--?
Speaker 2: --A-L-L-I-S, Sallis, Mississippi, which is near Kosciusko [Mississippi].  That's Oprah Winfrey's home.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Down on the Pearl River I think.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was part of a--they owned about eighty, maybe eighty-eight acres of land themselves and they farmed it.  And I met both my grandmother and my grandfather on my father's side.
Speaker 1: And what were your grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: I just know the name of my--and do I know the name of my grandfather even?  I better not hazard my grandfather's name.  I think it may have been Jesse.  Jesse is a family name.  We have several generations of Jesses in my family.  I do know that my grandfather was a casket maker in addition to farming the land.
Speaker 1: Casket maker, okay.  Now I didn't ask you what your father's birth date was.
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father's--my father was born, don't hold me to the month but he was born in 1890.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was thirty years older than my mother when they married.  He had a--his first wife died and he married my mother after that.
Speaker 1: Now you said that he had two names.
Speaker 2: Yes.  The name I grow up, that I grew up with is Will Evans, W-I-L-L E-V-A-N-S.
Speaker 1: Now what's--
Speaker 2: That's a name that he, he changed his name legally when he moved from Mississippi to Macon, Georgia.  There is some controversy about what the circumstances were.  My father was a railroad man, he was a fireman and he went to correspondence school to be a fireman.  So he worked for the Illinois Central which was the main class A1 railroad in Mississippi.  For many years they had just a shovel for stoking the fire box on the steam engines.  But once they got the automatic stoker there was a screw that would feed the coal into the fire box automatically.  The whites wanted the jobs.  And so when the fire, when the black firemen could not be intimidated and just quit, they would shoot them when they stopped to get water or coal on route.  And my father says several times he was warned by the dispatcher they were waiting on him and so I think he didn't go out on those occasions.  But on one occasion he did go out and by the way the interstate commerce commission authorized a black fireman to, to carry a weapon because of what was going on.  And I think on one occasion my father did go and it's said that he shot a white man and so he had to leave Mississippi.  And at that time the Central of Georgia had a connection with the Illinois Central.  So he left Mississippi and moved to Macon to work on the Central of Georgia Railroad.  And he had a daughter by his first wife and she moved to Macon.  He, his whole family, he and his wife and daughter moved to Macon but his daughter did not change her name.  So she was Lillian Roundtree and he was Will Evans.  So when people asked me if I'm related to any Evans I can tell them categorically the only Evans as to whom I'm related are my brothers and sisters and their children.  I'm not related to any other Evans'.
Speaker 1: That's quite a story.  That's quite a story there but that's the kind of story I would guess that a lot of people would tell something like this but they don't remember, it's not passed down.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Those were the times where that kind of thing is easily imagined.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it also happened during my life time too and maybe we'll get to that at some point.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: So my father's family was very different from my mother's family.  They were landed, they were both boys and girls in my father's generation and most of them had reasonable lifestyles though the women tended to end up in situations in which their husbands were sharecroppers and that was not good.
Speaker 1: No that's a bad (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: Some assistance through--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well worse than that, one--I have relatives in Flint [Michigan] and one of my family names is Otha.  So my brother is named Otha and my uncle in my father's generation was named Otha and then my brother had a child, a son who's named Otha.  And Othas, Otha was the son of a, of one of my father's sisters and they sharecropped.  And whenever he talks about the sharecropping he, he virtually starts foaming at the mouth on how bad things were for them.  And I guess they were part of the great migration that's talked about so much.  So they moved from Mississippi to Flint and all of his brothers and sisters are in Flint and they worked in the automobile industry there.
Speaker 1: Is there a story that you remember that Otha told that--?
Speaker 2: He would, he was the one who told me about the sharecropping.  He, I think the sharecropper, the person for whom they sharecropped was named Crawford.  He said they just could not survive under that scheme.  I don't know the circumstances under which they left but I know that he and several of his brothers all moved to Flint.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now your father then, he was--did he have a chance to go to school himself or--?
Speaker 2: As I said he went to correspondence school to be a fireman.  But my father actually made about as much money as a school teacher did when I was a child growing up in Macon.  So his job was considered one of the more reliable jobs that a black man could have during the 40s [1940s], 50s [1950s] and early 60s [1960s] in the south.  There were no black firemen in the north.  Those jobs were too good for blacks.  It was only in the south that there were black firemen and that was because I guess someone considered it below them to shovel the coal into the fire box.
Story_ID: 22973
Speaker 1: Now sir, now is there--so your father [Will Evans] he attended correspondence school and I guess the proper question now would be is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No.  We can only imagine my father was thirty years older than my mother [Mildred Owens] when they married.  And so I would imagine that what maybe attracted her to him was the fact that he had financial stability which she could not have found in a black man of a similar age to her.  But she called him Mr. Evans and he called her Mildred.  But throughout all of my year of the fifteen years that I was with the two of them, she always addressed him as Mr. Evans.  So there was that age difference that was reflected in how she responded to him at least in this one dimension.
Speaker 1: You know that kind of reminds me of the book '[The] Color Purple' [Alice Walker]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --where the husband is referred to as Mister and the woman by--
Speaker 2: I, I've seen the movie but I have not read the book.
Speaker 1: Not to suggest that's what your family (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And my father's daughter was actually older than my mother but we were one family.  We really didn't behave like half brothers or half sisters.  My father--her name was Leonora Forte as I indicated and my father called her Baby and so that's what we called her, all of us called her, she was just Baby to all of us.  And she had a big, took a big role in our family.
Speaker 1: Oaky, so did they meet in Macon [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I'm sure they met in Macon, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So he had--
Speaker 2: And they sort of lived in the same general neighborhood.  My father actually bought land in Macon.  I think he must have bought about two acres of land and he built a house, a brick house, must have been completed in the early 40s [1940s] though daddy never lived in the house.  His daughter lived in the house.  But daddy lived with mama.
Story_ID: 22974
Speaker 1: Now when you think about your parents' [Mildred Owens and Will Evans] personalities, temperaments, their mentality, their habits, their, how they walk, how they talked, how they look, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I probably take more after my mother than my father in terms of my temperament.  In terms of how I behave in my career professionally, I'm more like my father.  My father had to be rather combative in his work situation.  He was the only black man on the train and they would be on the train for as many as sixteen hours and that, and people wanted his job.  So he had to be doubly careful but on the other hand he was combative.  He would call them mo hunchers as opposed to the "MF" word.  MF words get you in trouble but no one can get you for calling you a mo huncher where the mo stands for mother.  So he would call them mo hunchers to their faces.  There was nothing too much they could do about it.  But he would scare the hell out of us occasionally.  He would have a little too much to drink and he would get a call, they had a dispatcher to call the firemen to come out on, to go out on the road.  He'd get a call and he wouldn't be quite as sober as he should be.  And my mother and, after we got older, we would be forcing him to eat coffee grinds just to get him back alert so that he wouldn't lose his job because all they wanted to do was to find an excuse to fire him.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so he was under a lot of pressure.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah and I suspect that's partly why he drank a bit more than he did.  But he was not an alcoholic but he still drank a bit more than he did.  But he was respected for his work.  They called him fire boy.  It's sort of derogatory in some way the boy part, but calling him fire boy was just acknowledgement of his prowess in firing those engines.  It took a lot of skill to get, to keep that steam up in those engines.  And I think that was a part of how we came to be.  The train went literally just maybe a 150 feet, 200 feet from our house and so every time daddy would go up from Macon to Atlanta [Georgia], we would go up to the track to wave at him and he would typically throw something off to us, some peanut butter, Ritz crackers, things that were wrapped up.  But it was quite a, something for us to see our father on one of the biggest machines in the environment in that time.  So I think that had a lot to do with our sense of worth about ourselves.
Story_ID: 22975
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah I was just asking off camera like how long your father [Will Evans] lived.  You said he lived to be eighty-six.
Speaker 2: Eighty-six, at least eighty-six.  He told lies about his age so he could work on the railroad but he was at least 86.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us about your brothers and sisters, how many do you have?
Speaker 2: Okay, there were eight of us, seven boys and one girl.  My oldest brother was Allen Evans.  He was born Willie Allen Evans but when he became a professional opera singer they told him he had to get, change his name so he became Allen Evans, then I was second.  Then there was about a four year period between--Allen and I were just about a year and a half apart and then there was about a four year period before the next boy was born and that was Otha.  He is the one who has this Roundtree family name.  Then our sister Martha was born within two years of Otha and then after Martha we had Jesse and that's again another one of the Roundtree names and there must have been only about a year, two years at most between him and Martha.  And then there was Larry--
Speaker 1: Now in terms of the Roundtree name, did, were--did your father actually name them Roundtree?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Well they just decided to call themselves, I mean--
Speaker 2: We were all Evans'.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, we were all Evans'.  So the Roundtree name as far as he's concerned is gone.
Speaker 1: So your brothers that took the name Roundtree just kind of took it because they--?
Speaker 2: We, that--I didn't have a brother named Roundtree.
Speaker 1: Oh okay I thought you said--
Speaker 2: My sis, the sister kept her name by the first marriage.  But we were all Evans'.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: No, I was saying that Otha, the first name Otha is a Roundtree name.
Speaker 1: Oh, is a Roundtree--
Speaker 2: And Jesse is a Roundtree name.
Speaker 1: From your father's side of the--
Speaker 2: From my father's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I understand.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: Larry you said--
Speaker 2: Larry.  Larry, that's not--that's just a name that we--that he was given.  And we all had two names.  People refer to us sometimes as the--with the two names.  So I'm Billy Joe, my older brother was Willie Allen and Martha Ruth and Otha Lee.  So I--
Speaker 1: What about Larry?  What--?
Speaker 2: That--I forget Larry's middle name.  I forget his middle name.  Maybe, he may not have had a middle name but I think he did, we all did.  And my, when my mother died the youngest child Jonathan was only two years old.  And there's a rather sharp line of characteristics between those of us who sort of reached our teen years when my mother was alive and those who didn't even though my father took care of all of the children and my sister Martha, became sort of the surrogate mother to the children younger than she.  There is that line of--that separates those of us who reached our teen years when mama was alive and those who didn't.
Story_ID: 22976
Speaker 1: Now I, from reading into this, that you're suggesting that your mother's [Mildred Owens] influence really helped the first group you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, that's--you know it's hard.  Yeah, with that, that's the only way we can make any sense out of it though mamma was not one who pushed us.  We didn't, she didn't say we had to do this or we had to do that but whatever she did--but whatever we did she supported us in it and I guess in many ways, Mr. Crowe, I would have to say that my mother sacrificed herself for us children.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she has a tremendous influence on you, she sacrificed a lot of her you know--
Speaker 2: I'm sure she died as young as she did because of the toil of just trying to raise us.  But none of us ever got in any trouble even those who were born, who reached their teen years after she had died.  But there is a clear line.  It's no two ways about it.  Those of us who reached our teen years before she died, we finished college.  Those who didn't, did not finish college or did not go to college at all.  So there was a very strong line there.
Story_ID: 22977
Speaker 1: And you said your older brother [Willie Allen Evans] is a celebrated opera singer?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, he went--
Speaker 1: In Germany.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he finished Julliard [performing arts conservatory].  Of course our family didn't have the money to pay for him to go to Julliard.  He initially went to McAllister College [private undergraduate liberal arts college] and there he met Dewitt Wallace.  Dewitt Wallace is one of the big beneficiaries of donors to McAllister and Dewitt Wallace's wife paid for my brother to go to Julliard, including paying for his music lessons which were about $250.00 a month in the mid-60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a lot of money.
Speaker 2: Right in those days, yes.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So, and then you were able to finish school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, he and I went off to college at the same time.  I didn't finish high school.  I don't have a high school diploma.  So, I went to Morehouse [College] and I virtually had a fully expense scholarship to Morehouse.  That was the only way the two of us could have gone off to school at the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was there a sibling behind you went to school too?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That would have been Otha.  Am I right, it's Otha?  No.  Yeah, that would have been Otha and Otha, he went to Morehouse but he finished Georgia State [University].  And then behind him, and Otha also did not finish high school.  Behind him would have been Martha Ruth, our sister.  She finished Fort Valley State [University], that's a school right down south of Macon [Georgia], about twenty miles south of Macon.  And then the brother behind her, Jesse, actually he also went to Morehouse as an early admission student but he did not finish Morehouse.  He caught a lot of flack because he was my brother and there were people on the faculty at Morehouse who were sort of my contemporaries and they would tease him or maybe bully him about whether he was going to do as well as I did.  And so he left Morehouse after his sophomore year and went to University of Washington in Seattle [Washington] but he did not finish.  I think he's the most talented of all of us in terms of native ability but he--that bad experience at Morehouse sort of sidetracked him and he never got back on track.  Though he lives in one of the family homes in Macon now and he's a builder.  He has, he's very skillful with his hands.  We all had to work with our hands.  Our father [Will Evans] insisted on that but he's the one who makes a living working with his hands.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So after him, the children after him, Larry, Jonathan and Terry, they did not even attempt to go to college.  They finished high school but they didn't attempt to go to college.
Speaker 1: And you say they were raised basically in a household with your older sister?
Speaker 2: My older sister yeah, who did go to college, and my father.  They had a better life than we did, that is the three oldest of us.  We lived in a, essentially it was a three room house but really it was just two rooms cause the third room was a kitchen that was off to the side and barely a full room.  You had the fire place which never adequately heated the house and so the other four children or the three children grew up in a house that my father built which was brick and well heated and so they had a better life materially in some respects than we did.  But I guess that just goes to show that material things don't account for all that we do.
Story_ID: 22978
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest, earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have one.  It's sort of trivial.  I, our living circumstances were rather uncertain at this time but it was in the same general neighborhood that I grew up in.  There was this hill sort of where there were a lot of houses and down below was a little road and some lady--I had on a, I had on overalls and some lady, a friend of my mother's, a friend of the family went by and my--who is the man of the house?  And so I stuck my hands in my overalls, things, said I'm the man of the house.  That's the, my earliest memory.  Sort of, it stands alone.  It's not connected to anything.  I don't remember what happened before or what happened afterwards but that one incident I do remember.
Speaker 1: Do you remember how old you were?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was about three years old.
Story_ID: 22979
Speaker 1: Now was there a name for the neighborhood that you grew up in Macon [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: It's now called a historic district.  The neighborhood to, there are two of them right there together and one of the neighborhoods this was Tindall Heights.  And Tindall Heights was an identified neighborhood when I grew up.  It had public housing in it basically.  Our area did not have a name as far as I remember but apparently in today's historical context for the City of Macon, our--where we grew up is a historical district.  I don't know the precise name but Elm Street which is where we lived is--and it may be called the Elm Street Tindall Heights District, Historical District.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, we're in a--my family was in a big fight.  Somebody wanted to change the name of, at least a block or two of the street and we own about four properties on the street now and we oppose that change of name.  If you can believe black folk talking about historical setting in Macon when people really you know second class citizens.  But all of the north-south streets in Macon are named after trees so our street was Elm Street, the next street was Ash Street, we had Plum, Cherry, Mulberry and so my sister went before the city council and argued that you shouldn't tamper with these historical names and pretty much the city council bought her argument.  Our property was the sit of a munitions plant, a confederate munitions plant.  And we have pictures and there's all this slag on the, in the ground where our, where we have our homes there and so they also objected on those grounds that there's a lot of history associated with this area and they should not go tampering with the names.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we had a very, our neighborhood was a very active neighborhood.  We lived in, we lived on a lane.  It wasn't quite an alley but it wasn't too far from that.
Speaker 1: This is a lane you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it's really--there were alleys and the alleys were much worst than--the ones that were called alleys were much worse than the ones called lane but they were basically the same.  You would have a main street with maybe houses with four or five rooms and then they'd have this little alley with houses on each side that were all maybe two or three room shotgun houses and the alleys were generally not paved.  But in our little alley there must have been about thirty-five children in that little half block area.
Speaker 1: So this is on Elm Street?
Speaker 2: Off of Elm Street.
Speaker 1: Off of Elm Street, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what was the name of the lane?
Speaker 2: Jackson Street Lane.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When my father [Will Evans] was looking for housing for us, the--somebody showed him some house in a place called Coles Alley and that was really rough.  My father told the folks, said I can't raise my children in this place.  So we had to find a better alley which to be raised.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now with that and, was there I guess a direction designation for your neighborhood like North Macon, South Macon?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  There was an East Macon, there was a South Macon.  West Macon and North Macon we didn't have those designations.  We were right in the center of town.  We were maybe a half mile from the City Hall.  So we were right in the center of town more or less.  But there was an East Macon, a South Macon.  I'm not sure if there was a well defined West Macon or North Macon.
Speaker 1: Was there a well-defined back business district in Macon?
Speaker 2: Yes, that would have been on Broadway and that stretched for, with some intermittent, with some interruptions it was about oh, five or six blocks long.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was there a black movie theater?
Speaker 2: Yes, the Douglas Theater and it was--James Brown performed regularly in the Douglas Theater and the Douglas Theater is still there.  It's now a historical facility and they still have performers.  My brother has performed in the Douglas Theater.  In fact I think that, there's one there showing him performing in the Douglas Theater.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But the viability is completely gone.  It's dead.  It's a dead, as is typical of so many towns.  Little Richard for example performed and so did Otis Redding.
Speaker 1: Redding.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they all sort of lived and performed in that area and now it's just a hollow shell of itself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was like the, part of it I guess what they used to call the chitterling circuit where the black entertainers would--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --go to the black theater and the black--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  Well Macon was unique because I say there were some strictures on where blacks could perform in Georgia and surprisingly Atlanta was not a place where they could perform easily.  So Macon tended to be the sort of the center of, for black performers like Little Richard, Otis Redding, James Brown, Jackie Wilson.  And Macon had the, had a very large auditorium and everybody could perform in that auditorium.  It had the largest copper domed roof I think in the southeast or maybe anywhere and it could hold several thousand people.  And I know James Brown performed in the Macon auditorium regularly so there was some kind of, it was easy for the performers to have performances in, for black performers to have performances in Macon easier than elsewhere.
Speaker 1: Now was the theater built by black people or was there a story behind the theater?
Speaker 2: The Douglas Theater was built and owned by black people.  Of course the Macon Auditorium was a city facility and there were personalities associated with the Douglas Theater.
Speaker 1: Like who (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I think it was named after the family that owned it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: These people, these were people who had prominent positions in the community because of their owning this theater.

Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well for me having the ice truck come by.  Many of us had ice boxes for most of our lives.  We did get refrigerators eventually but having the ice man come by, having the watermelon truck come by and having the man plug the watermelon to make sure it was good.  And if it wasn't good you didn't have to buy it.  And in the early spring, maybe not so early spring, we actually had ladies who would come through our neighborhood selling blackberries just like in the Porgy & Bess stories.  Of course they weren't signing but they would come back nice black berry--they didn't say berries, just nice black berry.  And they were, my mother [Mildred Owens] would pay a dollar for a pint of black berries which they were wild.  They didn't come off of any farm or anything so I remember that.  The smells, we had a pulp mill and we had a glue factory.  The glue factory was named G. Burns and sometimes you would get inversions when it was going to rain.  And my mother would, if something was very pungent my mother would say you smell like G. Burns and the pulp mill.
Speaker 1: Now when it rained the glue factory smelled worse?
Speaker 2: I think they both tended--that's when we would smell them both.  No ordinarily normal weather we wouldn't smell the pulp mill.  It was only when it was going to rain.
Speaker 1: Oh the weather, the wind would get (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the pulp mill was south of us and I don't know if that was down wind or what.  But whenever it was about to rain, we could smell G. Burns, the glue factory and the pulp mill.  And then there was another odor that really was quite overpowering and that was we had a, they called it the oil factory but Proctor & Gamble had an oil processing plant there and they would use steam to reduce the viscosity of the oil.  And when they did it would have a very strong odor in the air and it was right, located in the black business district.  It was just a half block away from the black business district.
Speaker 1: Proctor & Gamble now they, they're famous, they process a lot of pork, I mean hogs.
Speaker 2: We had a slaughter house in Macon and I'm sure that's why they were there and this smell I think it must have been some low grade lard kind of product which they used of course to make their famous Ivory soap.  So those were the smells that were very, those three, G. Burns, the pulp mill and Proctor & Gamble.
Story_ID: 22981
Speaker 1: Now so when you were coming along now, was church important?
Speaker 2: We went to church.  We went to church every Sunday.  My father [Will Evans] only went occasionally.  My mother [Mildred Owens], if she wasn't there, she was at least there in spirit.  But what was most important to us I think in terms of church was that was a, an outlet for us to develop our talents.  So we would have to say our Christmas speeches, our Easter speeches and so we learned to speak in public and that's when my brother [Willie Allen Evans] had his start of--in his singing career by singing in the junior choir and eventually going on up to higher levels.  And of course whenever my brother sang and my mother was in the audience she got all emotional and everything.  I tried to sing but I just couldn't sing.  I just did not have the talent but for sure the church was an incubator for us to develop our speaking habits in public.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was your brother's--was he a baritone--?
Speaker 2: When he first started out he was a soprano and that was quite a burden for me because this-Macon [Georgia] of course had a full spectrum of profession but we were basically a working class community and the young men and women were pretty unsophisticated but especially the young men so they would accuse him of being a sissy.
Speaker 1: Oh because he sang that high?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right and as a nine year older that's all you can do is sing soprano.  So it was something of a burden to me to have him sing but it was okay.  So church was important but not all important.
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Fulton Baptist [Church].  It was not one of the big shot churches.  The AME [African Methodist Episcopal] churches, we had two, two AME churches.  In fact there was one right across the street from Fulton Baptist and that's where most of the big shots went to church.  But we had some, a few big shots at Fulton Baptist.  Big shots were mainly teachers, lawyers and doctors.  Nobody had much money so it was mainly based on one's profession.  But the church was an important part but it wasn't everything.
Story_ID: 22982
Speaker 1: Our schools were probably more important than the churches.  The churches reinforced what happened in the school.  Nowadays I do not believe the churches, at least my experience it's not that they do not reinforce what should be happening in the schools.  But for us it was a seamless something so my brother sang in church and he also sang in school.  And the principle motivator for his music career was a fifth grade teacher, Bernice Blunt.  When she discovered that he could sing she virtually took him away from my mother [Mildred Owens] and father [Will Evans] and every Sunday she had him going all over Macon [Georgia] singing the song about Zacchaeus.  "Zacchaeus was a wee little man and a little man was he.  He climbed up in the sycamore tree for the Lord to see.  And when the Lord came passing by he looked up in the tree and he said Zacchaeus you come right down out of that tree because I'm going to your house for tea."  So he went singing that song all over Macon and that was really, he acknowledged later on that Bernice Blunt was the thing that got his music career off and running.
Speaker 2: Okay, so she was his mentor and guide?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  She was the fifth grade, she was a fifth grade teacher at G.W. Carver Elementary School.
Speaker 2: Now is that where you started school?
Speaker 1: G.W. Carver Elementary right, G.W. Carver Elementary School.
Speaker 2: So they called it G.W.?
Speaker 1: Right.  We didn't call it George Washington, it was G.W. Carver Elementary School.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And so when you started now were you, when you started could you read and write?
Speaker 1: I have no recollection.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Some of the people we've interviewed were way ahead when they started school.  I was just wondering.
Speaker 1: No, I was a disciplined person but my parents were ordinary.  I did not have a desk in my home.  I did not have books.  My--this older sister did have books and she bought a set of encyclopedias just for me to use.  She bought a typewriter just for me to learn how to use but in my own home I did not have that.  And I had no place to study.  I mean we had two rooms and we had to get eight children and our parents, ten people in those two rooms.  So there was really--no I did not have the setting that I would have liked to have had.  I had friends who, whom I would visit and they had desks and I used to always lament the fact that I didn't have the kinds of settings that they had to study.  But I was a good student and oh I guess about the fourth grade was when I began to move myself away from the general student body in terms of my academic aspirations.
Story_ID: 22983
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you said by fourth grade at G.W. [George Washington] Carver [Elementary School] you began to pull away from the pack.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And it was due primarily, I was always a pretty good student but there were some young teachers who came in fresh from college and one lady at the time that I met her was Leontyne Fields and they wanted to have a play, a major play for the entire school and it was called an operetta.  And the name of the operetta was Sunny, S-U-N-N-Y.  And of course the children of important families got the big parts.  My family was not important as a family so I got a small--and my brother had a relatively large part because of his musical ability.  I had no musical ability so I got a smaller part, playing a part of Grumbo who was a little beggar, homeless man in this medieval, princes, king kind of story.  And so I had to, I had a song that I had to sing but I had to audition for the part and I remember the audition very well.  I put everything I had into that audition.  I think the teachers must have laughed at me, I'm not sure but any rate, they gave me the part. And that was, that, at that point I created--I had to create that part myself.  I didn't have anything to read it was just me and this teacher working together.  I would try it and then she would tell me to make some changes and I would try to make the changes and I remember that as my first experience in learning that I had the ability to create something from within myself without having to read a book or anything.  And so I cite that as really the beginning of my aspiring to be something more than just getting a job.  And then I had a seventh--I had a sixth grade teacher and a seventh grade teacher, Carolyn Pitts and at that time the report cards were little, like little blue books and on my report card she would just put excellent.  She wouldn't put anything on the subject, separate subjects.  And when I got to the seventh grade she wrote on one of my report cards that I was going to go, I was going to be something one day and I remember that very clearly.  So my foundations was in that little segregated black school, G.W. Carver  [Elementary School] where they put oil--we had wooden floors and the beginning of every term they would put oil on the floors to keep the dust down.  I think it was waste oil, I'm not sure but I think it was waste oil.
Speaker 1: Did it create a certain smell?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes.  And of course once the smell went away the protective action was probably gone too.  Sort of like putting oil on dirt roads you know.  I think it was essentially that.
Speaker 1: Okay and it kept the dust down.
Speaker 2: Kept the dust down and when they swept the floors they had some--it was a mixture, some little chips that were oil soaped.  So they would spread that on the floor and then sweep it up and that would keep the dust down.
Story_ID: 22984
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: High school was Ballard Hudson [High School].
Speaker 1: Ballard Hudson.
Speaker 2: It was one of the biggest high schools in Georgia, high schools in Georgia at that time.  I was there I think 1955.
Speaker 1: Now was this 1955 when you started high school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And was Ballard named for some famous black person?
Speaker 2: No, no.  There were two schools in Macon [Georgia] before.  One was named Ballard and one was named Hudson and this older sister of mine actually went I believe she went to Ballard and it was a normal school.  I think it may have sort of been semi-private.  And you--when she finished that school she immediately went into teaching without a college degree or anything if you--
Speaker 1: A normal school--forgive me for interrupting.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I think normal was a two year teaching certificate I think you get in a normal school.
Speaker 2: I don't know the details.  Eastern Michigan used to be a normal school but it was a teacher's school.  But this was high school, this was not a college.  She was just, it was just high school.  So they merged those two, there must have been a Hudson someplace.  So I think Ballard Hudson was the result of merging these two schools.  So it was a very big school.
Speaker 1: So, but you don't know if Ballard or Hudson were black people in (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, I do not but I'd be surprised if they were.  I mean the only black folk you could name a school after in those days was G.W. Carver [Elementary School].
Speaker 1: We had Dunbar Schools and--
Speaker 2: I think that was in the north.  I mean down--
Speaker 1: Well (unclear) I know Little Rock and--
Speaker 2: Well you--when were those schools--see this was a school that was set up in the 40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: G.W. Carver was in the 40s [1940s] so I, but I don't know to answer your question.  But I would be surprised if it were a black person.
Story_ID: 22985
Speaker 1: Well Carver, correct, tell us--I mean how did people feel about George Washington Carver in those days?
Speaker 2: Well you know Carver was a, he was a very humble man.  He did not fight for segregation.  He was very much in the Booker T. Washington mode.  And so he posed no challenges to anybody so it was pretty easy to name a school in the south after George Washington Carver.  After all, he was very much committed to the south, certainly to the agrarian community in the south.  And you probably heard stories about his massaging Franklin Delano Roosevelt's [32nd president of the United States] arthritic, no polio joints and they attributed it to the peanut oil.  But they said it had nothing to do with the peanut oil, it was the very sensitive fingers that Carver had that allowed him to locate the muscles that were atrophying.  So he was very much loved by, throughout the south, black and white.  So it was no problem to name something after him.
Story_ID: 22986
Speaker 1: So Ballard Hudson High School in 1955.  Now you were saying earlier that some of the most important figures in the community were teachers.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so who were some of your teachers at Ballard Hudson?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I had a number of teachers at Ballard Hudson but two stand out more than--all of my teachers were good teachers. All of the teachers were not good teachers.  Some were just you know ordinary teachers, but I had two teachers, one was George Espey who taught me English and the other one was Phalba Pitts who taught me social studies.  So I had them both in the 11th grade.  By that time I was very much into my academics outside of the classroom actually.  I would read, I bought all these books, 'Philosophy Made Simple', 'Math Made Simple' and I would read those and so I got interested in my word power.  So I started trying to build my vocabulary up and Espey discovered I was doing that.  And so every Tuesday he would take twenty minutes out of the class time and I would teach the students the words that I had learned in the previous week.  And that took a lot of courage on his part because he could have gotten in trouble for taking legitimate class time and having some little student who was wet behind the ears taking up their time to talk about vocabulary.
Speaker 1: So he asked you--so he allowed you to teach the other students (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, I would teach them what words I had learned and about that time the term chauvinist pig was coming online and--but I learned what chauvinism meant independent of this.  So I knew that chauvinism was just someone who was extremely patriotic or passionate about some one something.  So I had, and I--that was one of the words that I taught them, chauvinism. So again that was a time where I could create something for myself, certainly with the guidance of a teacher but independent of a strict classroom setting.  Then the other teacher was Phalba Pitts.  She was--
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: George Espey?
Speaker 1: No, the--well Espey, I--
Speaker 2: E-S-P-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: His wife who was not his wife when I had him in class was a Leontyne Fields who had me in the play at G.W. Carver [Elementary School] so the two of them married after I had gone on.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the other--?
Speaker 2: Was Phalba Pitts.
Speaker 1: How do you spell--?
Speaker 2: P-H-A-L-B-A, Phalba Jean Pitts, Phalba J. Pitts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was an extremely physically attractive woman and she came to us when, sort of fresh out of school.  You can imagine what we young men with our hormones racing through our blood stream would have to say about Phalba Pitts.  But she dressed well, skirts were a little tight.  Not too tight but tight enough.  (Laughter).  Sort of like the English professor said at Morehouse [College], short enough to be interesting and long enough to cover the subject.  She was just that fine line.  But I was a very good student in her class and sometimes she would give our exams back and we would read our scores back to her.  So she did that on one occasion and I said oh, I said "the usual."  So she made me stay after school and dressed me down, told me that it's not good to be arrogant like that.  So she was strongly interactive at least with me.
Story_ID: 22987
Speaker 1: And so one day I was in her [Phalba Pitts] class and she said Mr. Evans why aren't you taking the exam?  There was an exam being given that day for kids to go off to college.  And I told her, I said Ms. Pitts my, I don't have the money.  It was just $3.50, but I didn't have the money.  So she stopped her class and asked for one of the more mature students to come up and take over the class and she marched me down the hall.  It was a big campus as I mentioned so it must have been about a quarter of a mile at least.  So she took me by the arm and marched me out of the building, across the yard to the auditorium where they were giving the exam and she asked the people if they had any extra exams and they said yes.  And she said can I pay for this young man to take the exam?  They said yes.  So she paid $3.50 and I took the exam.  It was called the Cooperative Intercollegiate Examination, the CIE and the better black schools, Howard [University], Morehouse [College], Fisk [University] and Talladega [University] all participated in this program.  And if your score was high enough they would admit you to college directly from whatever grade you were in.  So I was the only student at Ballard Hudson [High School] to pass the exam at the levels that were permitting them to do that.  So without her, I would have been, I would have had to spend my senior year at Ballard.  But instead I went off to Morehouse from the eleventh grade.
Speaker 2: Well what a gift.  I mean really thinking about what a great thing that was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  No, no, without that, that was life changing for me because I tell you, Mr. [Larry] Crowe, you know as I say we were in a working, I was in just a working class community there and who knows what would have happened to me in my senior year.  I was coming into my sexuality and everything.  I may have ended up getting some girl pregnant and that would have been the end of it for me.  So my leaving when I did was a blessing in many ways.
Speaker 2: And it illustrates I guess how important those teachers are--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --to young talent coming up.  There's no one in your family would have even understood what that test was about or what--?
Speaker 1: No, no, my--and that's probably why I didn't have the money to take it.  But on the other hand my parents would step back and whatever teachers wanted to do with us they could do with us.  Many parents in my neighborhood would never, never let that happen.  They would not give up control of their children to someone else and that's a big problem in the black community today.  Parents who don't know any better still refuse to let somebody who does know better guide their children's career potential.
Speaker 2: That's something.  So this is life changing.  This is in 19--
Speaker 1: That would have been '59 [1959].
Speaker 2: --'59 [1959].
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 22988
Speaker 1: So that next fall you go off to--?
Speaker 2: I went off to Morehouse [College] so that would have been in the spring of '59 [1959] and I went off to Morehouse in the fall of '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: All right.  Now when you were at Morehouse was president--
Speaker 2: President Mays, Benjamin Mays was president, yes.
Speaker 1: Benjamin Mays was president, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And so at Morehouse there were twelve early admission students and we would be, we were put in a special class along with twelve normally graduated students and so we were called the Flying 24.  And I guess Morehouse was trying to compare the success rate of these early admission students with the more mature students.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I want to say something then ask something too.  I just wanted to point out that Dr. [Martin Luther] King was an early admission student to Morehouse.
Speaker 2: He was.  He was, right.
Speaker 1: I think arriving when he was sixteen.
Speaker 2: He may have been fifteen.
Speaker 1: Fifteen (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--they took them as early as fourteen at Morehouse.  That was too early.  The social maturity was not sufficient.  Those students tended to have lots of problems.
Speaker 1: And I was--there's a note in here about an event that happened in Money, Mississippi that affected a lot of black students in the south.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, Emmett Till [African American boy who was murdered at 14], the killing of Emmett Till.
Speaker 1: That was in '55 [1955] I think.
Speaker 2: Yes it--right, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: That's just as you were starting high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, but we were well aware of that.  I mean you--
Speaker 1: You would have been the same age right as Emmett Till or just about, maybe a year older than Emmett Till.
Speaker 2: I forget his exact age.  I think he may have been a little bit older.  I think he was fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think he was fifteen.  But no, that was, we all saw that picture in Jet Magazine.  It was I mean it was something that really just went through the whole community.  Even though it really took, what we saw took place in Chicago [Illinois] and my family, my wife and I actually went to Money about four or five years ago just to go to that location.
Story_ID: 22989
Speaker 1: Now when you start college at Morehouse, now how would you say you were prepared in terms of mathematics and science?  How was your preparation?
Speaker 2: I would say that my preparation was not, if you look at what I had been taught, was not very good.  I had taken chemistry, I had taken algebra, I had taken no physics.  I had taken no trigonometry, no geometry.  And so in terms of the facts that I had under my belt it was not what one would have wanted.  But Morehouse admitted I think in the, that exam it was really aptitude as opposed to achievement and so when I went to Morehouse I didn't--even in my first semester, I was competitive in the--we had--our first course was calculus and analytic geometry.  I never had any calculus before and we used a standard textbook.  It was standard until a few years ago.  Michigan used it, all of the big schools.  It was by an MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA] faculty person, Thomas, called 'Calculus and Analytic Geometry.'  A thick book about that thick and my instructor at Morehouse was Pop Dansby.  He was an ABD person from Chicago [Illinois].  He did not have his Ph.D., he was all but degree.  And Pop Dansby's first lesson was how to count.  And we were--
Speaker 1: He taught calculus.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And it was--but his first lesson was how to count.  But we were counting not in a Base 10 but we were counting in a Base 2, Base 6, any base that he selected, we learned how to count in it.  So in a Base 2, there are only two numbers, 0 and 1, in a Base 10 there are ten numbers, 0 and 1 through 9.  So the kids who had gone to--there were kids who had gone to the Palmer Institute, the black prep school I think somewhere on the east coast.  They had their big jackets with their big letters on the back.  They knew calculus and they knew how to count in a Base 10 but they didn't know how to count in a Base 2 so that was a fresh experience for them.  So what mattered there was not what we had had, but what kind of thinking we were able to do.  So I could do that as well as they did and by the time we got to the calculus, well I was sort of up to speed too so I could compete with them doing the calculus.  Now if I had gone and I wanted, I--when I was at, in high school I had an MIT catalog and this fellow George Espey told me to put that damn catalog down and take my behind to Morehouse.  Now I probably could have gotten into MIT but the first class in calculus at MIT would not have been how to count and I wouldn't have had time to catch up with the other students or keep up.  So that was an important decision for me to make to have gone to Morehouse.  If I had insisted on going to MIT, it would have been a bad choice for me.
Story_ID: 22990
Speaker 1: It's interesting to think that you were thinking about MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] when you were in--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.  I had two catalogs one from MIT and one from a school in Southern California.  I thought I wanted to be an aeronautical engineer.  I built model planes.  I did not play with little girls' bodies when I was in high school.  I played with things and I could manage that.  So I thought that because I played with model planes I thought that I should do aeronautics.
Speaker 1: Well you excited about the astronaut program?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Had they even announced it then cause you were let's see, '57 [1957] is when Sputnik [first artificial Earth satellite launched by the Soviet Union]--
Speaker 2: So '57 [1957], I was still in high school.  That would have been about the same time.  But I was not one who was impressed by the hype of science and technology.  I had my own interests and so that's pretty much what I followed.
Story_ID: 22991
Speaker 1: I thought it was interesting when I asked you about your teachers before, you gave me English teachers and political science teachers--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --who were pivotal but you hadn't mentioned any science teachers.
Speaker 2: I had a good chemistry teacher but--and I spent my lunch periods with him and he engendered in me a fascination and a love for words but he was not engaged in me the way George Espey and Phalba Pitts were.  I mean that's just, that was just how that came out.  And I think many students make a mistake of limiting their strong interactions with the people in the career that they think they want to go into rather than what people who are really going to invest in them.
Speaker 1: So what we're saying, and correct me if I'm wrong here, you were focused on science in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: But your favorite teachers were actually were not science teachers?
Speaker 2: No, no.  And I was not fascinated by poetry and things like that but that didn't keep them from interacting strongly with me one the one hand and I accepting their intrusiveness.  But I think that probably came from my parents who did not encourage me to stick to my own ways even when adults were telling me differently.  That's a big problem we have nowadays.  Students just won't listen.  They know what they want to do and you can't change them very easily.  But I think that's a critical part of being successful in careers is listening to people who may or may not be in the discipline in which one has an interest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have any I guess prior to going to Morehouse [College], did you, were there any scientific role models that you looked to either in the world at large or locally or--?
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: Did you know any of the black doctors in--?
Speaker 2: I knew the doctors in my city but that was not a scientific something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I knew nothing technically about what was going on with them.
Story_ID: 22992
Speaker 1: Well you know often a kid with a scientific aptitude who's good at math and science is encouraged to be a doctor--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --in poor communities.  That's seen as an immediate need of--
Speaker 2: Right.  I fought that.  I fought that very--not while I was in high school, once I got to Morehouse [College] I decidedly did not want to do medicine.  The students at Morehouse that wanted to do medicine, I did not think very highly of them in general, in general.  Now there were some like David Satcher but there were--you know half of the students who came to Morehouse wanted to be doctors and I did not think very highly of them and I did not want to do what they were doing.
Speaker 1: It's a, do you think now, I'm going to ask you this now just cause I wonder here if you think that a lot of people who want to be a doctor because of ambition rather than--cause it's such a prestigious--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that--I think that's most of it.  And that is why so many of them actually don't succeed.  You probably maybe are aware that the drop out rate for blacks in medical school is 60%.  That's higher than the drop out rate in the baccalaureate programs and that makes no sense because you've already gotten rid of a whole lot of people who shouldn't be doing these things and then you send on this rather select group to medical school and they are quitting at a higher rate than an ordinary population did at the baccalaureate level.  That they don't--they want the prestige, they want the money but they don't realize how hard the work is.  But I didn't want to be a doctor because I just didn't want to be doing the things that these other fellows who wanted to be doctors were doing.  Like there was a very famous person in the Chicago [Illinois] area whose father was a dentist and had sent his son to Morehouse to be a doctor and his son was not doing well.  I went to this father for my dental care which was in this black community in Atlanta down on Hunter Street which I think is now called probably Martin Luther King Drive.  And he asked me, he learned I was a good student in chemistry, asked me to tutor his son which I did do.  But his son just, he had too much luxury in his father to do what he needed to do to do chemistry.  So I deliberately didn't do chemistry and you're probably vaguely aware but Hamilton [E.] Holmes was in my class at Morehouse, the fellow who integrated University of Georgia.  He actually went from Morehouse to the University of Georgia and was personally selected by Benjamin Mays to do that.  That was a big decision.  I was a better student than Hamilton Holmes but I did not have the resources that he had to go to Georgia State--go to University of Georgia.  My parents were not sophisticated enough and I wasn't sophisticated enough to put up with what one would have to put up with at the University of Georgia.
Speaker 1: So he was chosen almost like Jackie Robinson--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --was for baseball because of his ability to--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --endure punishment.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And then, and have the support from his parents, from his family that he would have needed.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So and David Thatcher was in school with you too?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Story_ID: 22993
Speaker 1: We were talking off camera about Hamilton Holmes--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and his preparation for being the first black student at the University of Georgia.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: You were saying that he, physically he--
Speaker 2: He could have passed easily.
Speaker 1: For white.
Speaker 2: Right, easily.  And, but he was a good, he--we, everybody liked him.  And after going to University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia], he would still come back to our class reunions at Morehouse [College].  But he was a fanatical person and as you know the word fan comes from fanatic.  He was a big fan of the University of Georgia football team, he was just all out.
Speaker 1: The University of Georgia football team (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's where he went to school.
Speaker 1: The all-white football--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was known across campus at the University of Georgia for being this big fan of the sports program there.  He died at a very early age.  He let himself get a little bit overweight, maybe a lot overweight I'm not sure.  But I think Hamilton Holmes just have died in his late fifties.  I'm sure it was the late fifties that he died.
Speaker 1: So he was a big fan of the football team after he attended, is that what you're saying?
Speaker 2: Of Georgia, yes.  But he still liked Morehouse too.  He would come to the Morehouse games.  He still liked Morehouse too.
Story_ID: 22994
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now David Satcher was in school with you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who became the--
Speaker 2: Surgeon general.
Speaker 1: --surgeon general--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for President Clinton [William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton, 42nd president of United States].
Speaker 2: That's right. He was also, before that he was director of the Center for Disease Control.
Speaker 1: CDC.
Speaker 2: Right, and then he was president at Meharry [Medical College] for a while.  Now Satcher was a regularly graduated student.  He was not an early admission student but he was a very disciplined person, very disciplined.  For recreation, he was a part of a little informal marching group that would march in front of the dormitories after dinner each evening when the weather permitted.  But he was a biology major, he took a lot of chemistry but he was a biology major and he--I along with about five other students had a little prayer group.  We would meet every Wednesday.  We had a chapel on the campus built by the Danforth Foundation at Dr. [Benjamin] Mays' request.  And we would meet every Wednesday and we had a little prayer group.  We would say individual prayers and everything.  We would--he and I were never very close friends, but we had a lot of mutual respect for each other.  We were friendly toward each other but we just weren't bosom buddies.
Speaker 1: Okay, anybody else that we would know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's this fellow Amos Brown, he's a minister of a big, maybe I don't know, the biggest AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church in San Francisco [California].  He was also in our class.  Very, very mature person.  Then there's a fellow you don't hear much about, Amos [N.] Wilson.  He was a, he was in sociology.  He was a sociology major and a chemistry minor and he went to write several books about the raising of black children.
Speaker 1: Right, now I've heard of him and the 'Psychological Development of Black Children.' [sic, Psychological Development of the Black Child].
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: It's a black book store staple.  I mean people are reading that book now as if it was brand new.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he was a very, he was large in stature, not big but he was bigger than I.  I was sort of a little fellow but he was a very pleasant fellow.  I remember him very clearly.  And I didn't discover that he was doing these writings until I went to my barber in Detroit [Michigan] and he was telling me about this fellow?  I said who?  I said that's my classmate.  So I went off and immediately bought his books.  But Morehouse [College] does not give, don't give him a lot of recognition.  I'm going to see to it that our class, we are celebrating our fiftieth graduation anniversary.  I'm going to see to it that we're going to put a book together and I'm going to pay for him to have a page in there documenting the things that he did.  But he's very much a cast in the image of the so-called Morehouse Man.  I think he more than anybody else, exemplifies what Morehouse wants its graduates to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, in terms of--?
Speaker 2: In terms of having an impact on their community, being willing to step out there and say things that other people are afraid to say and you don't have to be, you know you don't have to be fighting everybody to do it.  He did it in a scholarly kind of way you know.  He was not, I wouldn't call him an activist but he based his activism on his scholarly endeavors.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would think, yeah his focus was on the needs of the black community.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  And he wrote about it and in a serious kind of way.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dr. Amos Wilson.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: He passed about ten years ago?
Speaker 2: I think so.  I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, well known in the black studies circles.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Anyone else?
Speaker 2: Those were people who were in my class.  The one person I do have a strong feeling for is a dermatologist, his name was Isaac Willis.  He was ahead of me, maybe a year or two.  I forget how much.  But while we were waiting in the line for dinner he was always reading his book on endocrinology.  I remember I was just maybe a freshman.  This big book with endocrinology on the spine and he was there studying and studying and studying.  And he went on to become a dermatologist.  He headed up dermatology at Emory University and he quit Emory to set up in private practice.  And I have this vitiligo, you can see it on my fingers and he treated vitiligo.  And so I did a sabbatical at Morehouse one year and I went to see him and he was the only person able to get me to color.  I went to the University of Michigan and they burned me.  They didn't know how to treat vitiligo.  They knew how to treat psoriasis but not vitiligo.  But I was very much impressed with him and he had his own research center at the Morehouse School of Medicine.  He, in fact he bought a building and leased a building to Morehouse, the Morehouse School of Medicine when it was not, just getting started.  And when McBay [Henry Ransom Cecil McBay, chemist and teacher] died, Isaac Willis paid for the production which was a big something of the memorial program for him at the Martin Luther King Chapel.  So I've always held him in high regards.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He died at an early age and I don't know what was behind it but he's one of the people that I hold in high regards.  And he was a doctor despite being a doctor I still have a lot of respect for him.
Story_ID: 22995
Speaker 1: There seems to be a dialogue, it's a silent dialogue, the public doesn't hear this.  It's kind of like a, you know a little push and pull between the doctors and scientists.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: The general public sees being a doctor as a highest achievement you know that you can attain where scientists don't seem to hold the doctors at.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  There is--because doctors are constrained by protocols.  If a treatment modality has not been approved by someone they, even though know it works or should work, they can not do it.  So in many ways, doctors are not scientists, they are practitioners.  They use scientific knowledge as a basis for what they do.  But what they do is dictated by regulatory agencies and they can't follow their instincts.  But I will say that my wife had a quite an episode recently.  She was in critical care and my estimation of emergency room doctors was totally transformed by that experience.  We had a case where the doctor actually was willing to take a chance on a treatment modality and without his taking that chance, my wife certainly, certainly would not be alive today.  But most doctors are not that courageous.  In fact the nurse said she didn't believe in what he was doing.  She did it anyway because she had to but she didn't think it was going to work.  But it did work.  So my--I'm evolving along these lines.  Some of my best students here at Michigan have been doctors, have gone into medical profession.  There's still this, there is this feeling I think among scientists and I think it's well founded that doctors cannot always do what is scientifically the soundest thing to do because of regulatory and liability, especially liability issues.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Getting sued.
Speaker 1: I've also heard it said that doctors don't really solve problems, I mean in the sense that they you know follow a recipe rather, more so than--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  And when a surgeon, if a surgeon operates and you don't die, then he was successful.  And then they say that's a problem of internal medicine.  They've done their part so there is that added to it a little bit, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 22996
Speaker 1: Now well tell us about Dr. [Henry] McBay looms as the godfather of black chemists.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: You know, tell us about him and how you met him.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well when I went to Morehouse [College] I looked around and I said, what is the best program on campus?  Where do you have the best faculty and the best facilities?  And I concluded that that was chemistry.  And so I took chemistry as a freshman and McBay taught the freshman course in chemistry, general chemistry and he was clearly an overly committed, overly dedicated teacher.  His lectures were always interesting and rigorous.  And when he would talk about molecules vibrating he would actually move his body and you know shake as if you know you're going to--and he would sometime allude to the opposite sex about shaking this buttock and not shaking the other one.  And he would talk about normal modes so sometimes you have two things moving but actually one moves and then the other one moves, those would become normal modes.  Then you get the two moving together, you can always separate the combined motion into the separate normal modes.  And so he would indicate what those normal modes would be by shaking one and not shaking the other.  So it was a very exciting class for me.  And I took a course in sociology, the calculus course, all with these twenty-four, just us twenty-four students.  But with McBay we were just in a general class.  There were 125 students taking general chemistry.
Speaker 1: So they kept the twenty-four early admit, admitted students together?
Speaker 2: Right, right in all of the classes except classes like chemistry and physics where it was just not economically possible to have just a class of twenty-four students.  But McBay gave a very exciting class and it was also very difficult.  So I don't know what my grade was in his class the first semester.  I suspect it was probably a B, I'm not sure.  But I suspect it was probably a B, but of that 125 students who enrolled the first semester, only thirty-nine were around for the second semester.  And he would have problem sessions before every--every Friday whether or not we were having an exam he would have problem, a problem session.  And so we would work, he would have a book of problems and we would go to the blackboard and work the problem out and he would critique it and what we had done wrong, etc.  And some students claimed and I believe it's true that he scheduled the problem sessions on Friday night just to separate those students who were serious from those students who weren't cause on Friday night you had the dances with the Spelman [College] young ladies or you would go somewhere and if you weren't willing to sacrifice and not go to the dance and do chemistry instead then maybe you were not suited to do chemistry.  And many fellows did not come to the problem sessions and it was mainly because of that, that they didn't do well on the exams.  But I went to the problem sessions, many of--maybe about forty of us would show up.  But he would neglect his family.  He could have been with his wife, a young woman.  He had children who were maybe four or five years old on a Friday evening but he was instead in the chemistry building helping us try to learn chemistry.  So after the freshman year I decided that I would be a chemistry major mainly because of McBay and the other people in the department but McBay clearly stood out among the chemistry faculty.  And he did not want to know our names in the first semester.  When he graded our exams, they were all handwritten in blue books.  He would turn your name sheet over so he would not see your name so he would not be influenced in his grading the exam by your name.  He may have known, I'm sure he knew many parents, especially the parents who were doctors and professionals.  So he worked very hard to be fair.  And so a young fellow like me whose parents didn't account for much in that setting had an equal chance with fellows whose parents were movers and shakers in the community.  And so I committed to chemistry and he would give me some projects to do and I would do them, but he was very much in our business.  Morehouse fellows could only go to Spelman between the hours of 4 in the afternoon and 6 p.m.  Well Morehouse stopped serving the dinner meal at 6 p.m. and so the fellows would stay at Spelman for as long as they could and try to get back to Morehouse before the dinner line was closed.  And the pathway between Spelman and Morehouse went right by the chemistry building.  So McBay who was short, he was maybe only 5'4" or something like that, he would raise himself up on the window and look out onto this pathway.  And so when the fellows would come by he would point at them, oh he's taking chemistry.  He won't be doing very well.  So those of us who were serious would never let ourselves be seen by him running back and forth between Spelman and Morehouse.  So he was very much involved in our lives pretty much the way my high school teachers were involved.  And I was sort of prepared for that because I've had that experience before.  Many fellows were not prepared for it because they have not had that experience before
Story_ID: 22997
Speaker 1: Did people from the south do better from those from the north in that regard because of the, I just wondered because the southern teachers you know in the segregated schools being a lot more intense than--?
Speaker 2: I don't--that, your statement I think anecdotally is what I would say is true.  Now Satcher was one of the better students but he did not come from a sophisticated family background.  But I don't know to what extent--there were some kids who were from Chicago [Illinois] for example.  They wanted to show us country boys how to live and I think they may have been tripped up by that to some extent.  But I think it was--I think what you say is true and it needs to be looked into, to see what exactly what the factors were.  We tended to not drink as much and that may have had something to do with the sort of closed society we lived in, in the south.  If a black man drank too much he was in jail.  In Chicago, you could drink, you're in your own community and if all you were doing was drinking you didn't get in jail, get locked up just because you were, had a little too much to drink.  But that was generally true.  The top students, the very top students tended to be from the south so in my class I was the only student to graduate summa cum laude and I think Satcher was right behind me.  He graduated magna cum laude.  I think there were just two of us in those categories for our class and that tended to be the case generally.
Story_ID: 22998
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you went on to--after graduation you went on to the University of Chicago [Illinois].  Now we know Dr.[Henry] McBay was a graduate of University of Chicago.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And did he help facilitate that?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  He told us where to go to school.  It wasn't facilitated.
Speaker 1: So it wasn't a hint?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  He would--and for some students he would refuse to write a letter of recommendation to a school of which he did not think they would do well.  So that was--he was very pointed about that.  And also now McBay--Kimble Huggins who was another member of the Morehouse [College] chemistry department but all--but both Huggins--all Morehouse chemistry faculty were also members of Atlanta University's chemistry faculty.  But Kimble Huggins had finished Chicago [University of Chicago] earlier than McBay in 1933.
Speaker 1: So he had a Ph.D. from there?
Speaker 2: From--right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And McBay had taken a masters degree from Atlanta University and he had studied under Kimble Huggins also.  So that was, there were two generations so I would have been a third generation student in that line of black men who had gone to the University of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Kimble Huggins would have been like a mentor to--?
Speaker 2: To McBay, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is--we're talking about tradition now being passed down over--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --three generations.
Speaker 2: But it's gone now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That--Morehouse's strength in science is almost non-existent today.  When I was at Morehouse [College], Morehouse accounted for 10% of all of the Ph.D.s and M.D.s in the country among blacks.  But Morehouse only had 500 students enrolled so it had much, much less than 10% of the enrollment.  Now Morehouse does not rank.  If you get a list of schools producing as a baccalaureate origin of Ph.D.s in science, Morehouse is not--does not make the list anymore if you look at the Top Ten.  They've gone very much for the business and finance program though that's not a traditional strength at Morehouse.  But getting back to McBay, there's a teaching method at University of California, Berkeley that was pioneered by a fellow by the name of Uri Treisman that was touted as one of the ways of learning calculus involved group learning and things like that.  I felt that McBay's approach to science was much more effective than Treisman but no one ever gave him or acknowledged the effectiveness of his teaching methods.  And I think that's one something that needs some correction.  McBay's way of teaching was very effective for students who had good potential but not a good foundation in the high schools or elementary schools in the sciences.
Speaker 1: Now you having taught at University of Michigan for so many years--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you don't encounter probably as many students that had, that come in with a deficit.
Speaker 2: No, I do not.
Speaker 1: But do you utilize McBay's methods and--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, yes.  That turns out to be my most effective method.  For many years I try to teach the way my white colleagues taught and I would gather that I would actually pretty ineffective.  But at one point I decided that I was going to do this thing the way I thought was the way to do it and so for about ten years I taught all of the junior and senior pre-med students at Michigan.  There was a course they had to take and they took it in their junior and senior years.  Most of them were white.  I would suppose that only 2 or 3 percent would have been black.  But my mode of teaching was to be intrusive and so when they would come into my class I would say you can sit wherever you like but you must sit there everyday from this point on.  So, and I had a seating chart.  I knew exactly who was sitting where in the classroom and I could call the students by name.  Some of them thought that I knew their names by heart but which I eventually did but in the first few weeks of school I did not know their name but I had their names on my sheet of paper and so if I wanted to call on someone I would call them by name.  And that was one thing that McBay did, he always addressed us by name, not our first name but our last names.  It was always Mr. Evans or Mr. Satcher, never Billy Joe or that kind of thing.  And so with these white students I would address them in that fashion and some of them were quite, they told me some of them were quite amazed to be addressed that way because no one had ever addressed them in that way.  They called them by their first names or nothing at all.  And so if a student was absent I knew he was absent.  When he showed up the next day I would tell him you weren't here last time were you?  So they were not accustomed to that but they appreciated it and I had a very, I think a class that was very satisfying to me and that was equally satisfying to them.  So--and the students recognized it and I have a little book that two young ladies gave me called Axioms by Evans.  They--I would have some sayings that I would say in class like even if you don't know something, speak with confidence as though you do know it.  And they wrote those things down and when they graduated they gave it to me as a little present and I keep it here on my, on the coffee table in the living room.  So, and the remarkable thing about this is that I have continuing connections with these students so last weekend a young man came into town for a wedding and we spent half a day together.  He was in my class I think in 2002 and I went to his graduation for medical school.  I went to the brissen [bris, brit milah or circumcision] of his son but I went to his wedding, they invited me.  I went to the brissen of his son and I went to his graduation from his urology program last year and I have a picture that I'll show you.  There's another young lady, Depah Soni [phonetic], she's a neurosurgeon and she was one of my students and when she graduated from her neurosurgery program she invited me and so--and these are white students.  These are not black students.  So just as I had a lifelong relationship with McBay from the way that I interacted with these students which is really the McBay way of doing it, you get the same kinds of relationships and it has nothing to do with race or ethnicity.
Story_ID: 22999
Speaker 1: Okay, you finished a B.S. in chemistry in '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you went on to the University of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Now 19, this is 1963 in Chicago so what was Chicago like?  Had you--
Speaker 2: I'd never been--
Speaker 1: It was different from being in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Never been in the big city. I, in Atlanta, I never went into the city.  I stayed strictly on campus.  So coming to Chicago was a different experience for me and of course Chicago did not have dormitories for graduate students, at least not married graduate students so you had to live in the community.  So Addie Bell and I lived in Hyde Park oh about, five or six blocks north of the University at 5110 Kenwood Avenue in one of the University apartment buildings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in that particular year there were about four or five blacks in the graduate, in the entering graduate class, a young lady who had gotten her Masters Degree under Henry C. McBay.  She was a bit older, had a family, I and three other blacks.  One young man was from University of California.  He did not have much to do with us blacks from the south.  He thought that we were unsophisticated and did not have the kind of experience he had had.  He was a name dropper.  He would drop names of famous faculty members at the University of California, Los Angeles.  But Chicago had a very unique program then.  The whole idea of taking classes was to get you prepared to do your Ph.D. research.  You didn't do classes just to be doing classes.  So you took exams when you came in and depending upon how well you did you had a curriculum that one had, that you had to follow.  But one was expected to take his Ph.D. qualifying exam in the May, in May following your September entrance so few, less than nine months you were expected to be ready to take your Ph.D. qualifying exam.  And so that was the, that was a case with me.  And then there were kids, white kids from the Ivy League Schools who also sort of looked down on us blacks but I worked very hard and my wife was very supportive of me.  I would have to study into the wee hours of the morning.  When I came home at 1 or 2 o'clock she would still be awake and we would have toast.  We didn't have much money.  We would have toast and honey and hot tea before going to bed.
Story_ID: 23000
Speaker 1: Where did you meet your wife?  How did you all meet?
Speaker 2: I met my wife at Morehouse [College].  My--when I went to Morehouse for my freshman year they had freshman week and I went over to Spelman [College] like all of the other Morehouse fellows did and I said whoa, these women look took good and I am not going to survive if I associate with them too much.  So I vowed that I would not set foot on Spelman's campus during my time at Morehouse which I did not do.  I didn't begin to look at the young ladies at Spelman until the second semester of my senior year.  And I must have seen Addie Bell someway or another at the library.  I don't know what triggered it but somehow or another I said something to her and so we started talking.  She was a sociology major.  The sociology fellows told her that I did not care anything about her, all I cared about was chemistry.  But she and I persisted and she was an attractive woman.  She had a boyfriend or two and I told her that I did not have time to compete.  I said it's either me or nothing.  So she agreed to that and so we were, we dated.  We didn't do the nasty.  (Laughter).  You have to tell people that.  We would do, go Downtown and walk around and so we graduated and then I said well we should get married.  And McBay was telling me all along that, well you know she's already applied to graduate school where you're going so she's waiting on you.  That wasn't really true but those are the lies, he told a lot of lies, which were good, well intentioned.  But we got married in August of probably my, August of 1963, August 31, 1963.  So I met her at--I didn't introduce her to my family.  My family hardly knew her when we got married but it's worked out so far so good.  She supported me very much in my studies.
Speaker 1: Now does she, did she go to school in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: She went to school.  She went to Rosary College [now known as Dominican University] in Chicago to get a degree in library science.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's quite a bit of ways--
Speaker 2: To the west side.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) west of you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.  She--
Speaker 1: --in Oak Park.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it's in River Forest.
Speaker 1: River Forest, right (unclear) Oak Park.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a bit, I think it's a bit west of Oak Park.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And indeed she had both of, all three of our children while she was enrolled in school.  And she had, we had twins so she had twins on January the 7th and she was back in school on January 19th.  So she was, she had a lot of energy, very hard working, very intense.  And I didn't learn to drive until I was twenty-six so that would have been in 1967.  And I had to do my work, I had to do some computing at Argonne National Labs [Argonne, Illinois] and she would drive me out there and wait on me and drive me back.
Speaker 1: She was a big part of your success?
Speaker 2: Probably more than I am.
Speaker 1: Well you had to do it but still--
Speaker 2: What was that?
Speaker 1: You had to actually you know (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I had to do it but I had no complications from her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She made no demands.  She didn't say that I was spending too little time with her.  I would leave for work for the school at 7 o'clock, come back at 6 and be back up at the school before 8 o'clock every evening and she never complained.

Speaker 1: Now from what I understand this is one of the strange aspects of segregated south--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that the State of Georgia actually paid your tuition to go to University of Chicago.
Speaker 2: They paid the difference between tuition at the University of Georgia and tuition at the University of Chicago.  And of course Georgia, University of Georgia being a state school had a very low tuition.  So every quarter, and the other young lady who was there from--Gloria Anderson who was there with us, every quarter we got a check for $900.00.  Chicago was an expensive school and every quarter we got a check from the State of Georgia for $900.00.  That was almost more than our stipend from the University of Chicago, yep.  And so for the four years that we were there we got that check every quarter from the State of Georgia.
Speaker 1: And this is a check from the State of Georgia basically to ensure that you do not go--
Speaker 2: Go to State of Georgia.
Speaker 1: --to school, you didn't sue to go to school at University of Georgia.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly, exactly.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Meanwhile at the same time Hamilton Holmes was down there as a first--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was already enrolled but they were still paying--but see Hamilton Holmes was not in graduate school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they still had the segregation pattern in graduate school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So this is all over the south where the, these tuitions are being paid by these southern states to keep them from going to ["white" schools]--and would a degree in chemistry from University of Georgia been equal to a degree--?
Speaker 2: No.  No, that was the irony of it.  I wouldn't have gone to the University of Georgia anyway.  (Laughter).  You know, they paid me to not go to a place that I wouldn't have gone to in the first place.  That's--so but these prejudices can make people do strange things, did then and still does today.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I just wanted to point that out.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: We heard this kind of story over and over again.
Speaker 2: No, it's true.  It's true.
Speaker 1: Just amazing.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Story_ID: 23002
Speaker 1: So now you, now what were you focused on in chemistry as a student at the University of Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Now at University of Chicago they have a unique program.  As I mentioned you only take classes to be ready to do one's Ph.D. research.  And so Chicago has a divisional structure, there's a division of the physical sciences, division of the biological sciences and social sciences, etc.  Once you pass your Ph.D. qualifying exam you can do research anywhere in that division.  So when we took our, we took our qualifiers and in my group which was inorganic chemistry, only two of us passed.  All of the kids from the Ivy League Schools did not pass.  It was a young man from Taiwan and I, an unlikely set but I did pass.  And so I began to look for a faculty research advisor in May of sixty--that was '65 [1965], sixty--
Speaker 1: So who did you--?
Speaker 2: I chose to work with a fellow in geophysics.  I was interested in something having to do with electron densities and he was in--his area of research was in that and so I chose to work with him.  The chemistry faculty were very angry with me because they wanted me to work in the chemistry department but I didn't, I did not want to do the kind of research that was available to me in chemistry so I chose to work with this fellow in geophysics.  So I did something called, it's a European field called crystal physics.  In this country we don't have an equivalent but it's applying modern chemical methods to minerals.  Yes, minerals like magnetite, olivine, these are mineral, pure minerals that are found in the earth's environment and also on the moon.  So I did my, I had my office in the Department of Geophysical Sciences and I did my research in the low temperature laboratory so I did not do traditional chemistry.  I had to learn how to use a lathe, a milling machine, how to make my own vacuum systems, I had to learn how to solder, how to hard solder, how to soft solder and I was surrounded by physicists, students in physics.  We used liquid helium.  Helium is very expensive and so when we used the helium it would boil off and they collected the helium.  So we had to be in a special facility where they could collect the helium once we had used it.  So I worked in the low temperature laboratory and my research advisor was a fellow by the name of Stefan Hafner. He was a Swiss German or--and I was his first student and for about three years I was his only student.  And my rationale for making that choice was that any work I did he was going to publish because he had to get tenure.  With older senior faculty members they can sit on your work because they're already tenured and you won't get your work published.  So with Stefan Hafner, any time I completed a project, within a few months we had sent a paper off to be published.  So my--
Speaker 1: Did this strategy, this is a strategy that you came up with yourself or was it--
Speaker 2: It was one I came up with myself.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Dr. [Henry] McBay to find somebody that--
Speaker 2: No, no.  McBay couldn't, he didn't know the scene at Chicago but it was something I came up with myself.  Now other students would choose an exact opposite one.  They would want to work with the biggest name they could find because this person could help them get a job later on.  But in the meantime their work was not getting published.  So with Hafner, my work was published and I had my first paper less than a year after I started working with him.  Most students don't get a paper until they're almost finished doing their research and he supported me fully.  I was a hard working student.  I could work long hours because of my wife and then she gave me all of the support that I needed to do the work that I had set out to do.  And so when I finished at Chicago I had eleven papers and that's a rather large number for just a Ph.D. thesis and I also had written a chapter in a book.  And that came out of my work that I did at Argonne [National Laboratory] when my wife would have to drive me out there to do the work.  So there were important people at Argonne who recognized what I was doing and championed what I was doing and saw to it that I was invited to write a chapter in this book.  And in fact they had all of the authors who were writing for the book to come to a dinner at Trader, what is it called?  Is it Trader Joes?  What is this?
Speaker 1: Trader Vics?
Speaker 2: Trader Vics.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Downtown.
Speaker 2: Yes, Downtown Chicago.  So we had a dinner at Trader Vics and my Addie Bell was there.  We were maybe half the age of everybody else in the room and we had ordered Mai Tais and I think Addie Bell had drunk a little bit too much Mai Tai so they had the speakers getting up you know introducing themselves so when they came to us Addie Bell got up and introduced herself, but they just passed it off to youthfulness.
Story_ID: 23003
Speaker 1: So I had a good experience in Chicago [Illinois] but I was almost killed in Chicago.
Speaker 2: So what happened?
Speaker 1: I said I was a hard worker and so one New Year's Eve I was working, Addie Bell and I.  I didn't go to the New Year's Eve party.  I was up at the lab working and I was there until about 12 o'clock.  And I was in one of those gothic buildings on the central campus and the son of a faculty member was on an upper floor.  He was just there for Christmas vacation and not knowing anything he called security and says there is a strange fellow down on the next floor, of course a black fellow.  But I was in that building every night, everybody knew that.  So the, they sent a fellow up to see what was going on.  They sent a black fellow up and he came out the elevator into one of these dark hallways where there's just a little light bulb, oh what, what, where, what, what are you doing?  So I went to--so I went to go for my--don't, don't, don't put your hand in your pocket.  Don't put your hand in your pocket.  So we eventually got close to each other.  He was drinking.
Speaker 2: New Year's Eve right?
Speaker 1: Right, but he was on duty.  So he, I don't know if he said okay--I said no, we're going downstairs.  So we go downstairs and there in the car with the engine running, it's cold in Chicago, sits the sergeant.  He had sent the black guy up to see what was going on.  So we get in, I get in the back of the car and the fellow gets in front and the sergeant going to say, well okay I guess--I showed him ID.  He said I guess everything is okay.  I said no everything is not okay.  You're going to take me to the station house.  He was pretty mad then, but I insisted.  So he took me over to the station house and of course you know it's like a prep room where all the chairs, where everybody sits for the morning.  So they were--he knocked chairs over and everything and he says well--I said no, you're going to get a dean here tonight.  You are not going to just pass this off.  So eventually a dean came with his robe on and he told me I was crazy for working that late on New Year's.  But eventually I got a letter of apology from the president.  He was a Nobel Prize winner.  The name is escaping me now.  But I misplaced that letter.  I'm going to have to get a copy of that letter but he sent me a letter of apology for the incident.  But I could have gotten killed up there in that laboratory.
Speaker 2: That was New Year's Eve, what year?
Speaker 1: New Year's 19, had to be '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: '68 [1968] okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 23004
Speaker 1: Now were you in Chicago [Illinois] when Dr. King was assassinated in--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --April of '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I didn't leave until August of '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I remember when that happened.
Speaker 1: It wasn't as much uproar on the south side as--
Speaker 2: But there was a lot--we actually drove over to the near north side near Old Town.  It was pretty rugged over there, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But one thing that came out of--so when I finished, while I was at [University of] Chicago, Dr. [Benjamin] Mays would see me once a year because Morehouse [College] had one of its board meetings in Chicago.  And every time they had a board meeting he would come by Chicago and ask me to be sure to return to Morehouse when I finished.  Every year he came by to see how I was doing and make sure I was going to come to Morehouse.  But in '68 [1968] Dr. Mays retired and he sent me a letter.  And he said Billy Joe, I'm retiring and I cannot hold the incoming president to our agreement but I have talked with him and he has agreed we have a gentlemen's agreement that he will hire you when you finish Chicago.  So okay, so that's how I was going to do it.  And as I was finishing Chicago my research advisor said, Billy--he never called me Billy Joe.  They don't know about this two name thing.  Said, Billy, don't you think we should start looking for a position for you?  I said I already have a job, acting like a Negro.  And I must have incensed him.  I said I already have a job.  And then I got a letter form the president, the new president at Morehouse maybe in July or August that Morehouse does not have a job for me, so here I am.  Luckily I had met a fellow from the University of Manitoba [Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada] who was in magnetism at one of the meetings that I had gone to and he was looking for a post-doctoral fellow.  So I took the post-doctoral position at the University of Manitoba.
Story_ID: 23005
Speaker 1: What was your dissertation or your Ph.D. thesis?
Speaker 2: I did my, it was called 'Order, Disorder and Hyperfine Interactions in Spinel Ferrites.'  So there was a phenomenon in solids like for example, sodium chloride, you have sodium ions and chloride ions and they always occupy the same position in the salt crystal.  If you see sodium you know the next atom is going to be chloride.  And so that's an order, that's what we call an ordered arrangement.  If you know where one sodium is you know where another sodium is that may be a thousand distances away from that one.  And then there's a phenomenon where you can have a solid and the ions are not arranged in an orderly fashion like in glass, the glass that makes up our drinking glass, the window panes.  You--that has silicon and oxygen atoms in it.  Well you can know where one silicon atom is but you don't know where the other silicon atom is and that's the case of a disorder arrangement.  And so I was looking at solids in which you could go from an order arrangement where you knew where every atom was if you knew where one was to a situation where if you knew where one atom was, you wouldn't necessarily know where another one was.  And we studied how these atoms were arranged by something called hyperfine interactions.  You can look at atoms or we can also look at the nucleus.  The nucleus of an atom interacts with the electrons and so by looking--those interactions are called hyper, hyperfine.  They're much, they're high, in fact they're much weaker.  And so we can look at the hyperfine interactions and tell where the atoms are in the solid.  So that's what my thesis was about.  It was about minerals which was what my research advisor was interested in but also about magnetic materials in which he had no intrinsic interest.  That was really my interest.  And of course in those days that would have been the seven, the early, late 60s [1960s], early 70s [1970s], the memories of computers were made up of magnetic oxides and so that was an important something to know about.  And I worked on the materials that were in fact used for computer memories.  Nowadays magnetic oxides are used in many applications, speakers on High-Fi systems.  The suspensions on a Corvette, that's a magnetic suspension.  They're not using magnetic oxides but they're using magnetic materials and so the magnetism allows you to have things move without touching each other so there are no frictional forces or any wear and tear.  So that's the kind of thing that I worked on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In terms of the--you were talking about the order and the--
Speaker 2: Disorder, right.
Speaker 1: --disordered arrangement of molecules--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --does that make a, does a disorder arrangement, how does a, I mean how do the materials differ that are--cause you mentioned glass is a disorder arrangement.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: And I know glass is fragile.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah and then--
Speaker 1: Does it, so does a disordered arrangement make a substance, I mean a--
Speaker 2: Well, it can.  It can, it can.
Speaker 1: --(unclear).
Speaker 2: Some materials are stable in a disordered state, others are not and glass is one of those.  Glass is thermodynamically unstable and so a glass can crystallize on you without warning.  Normally it doesn't happen at least not in the lifespan of a human being but in nature glasses that are formed in a natural environment like in a volcano where you have obsidian, the obsidian glass, one does not find very old obsidian glass because the glass is thermodynamically unstable and it will crystallize and turn into clay.  So the disorder can have an effect like that but in terms of magnetic materials disorder, you can use it for either positive or negative kinds of effects.  So normally on the oven, on many ovens, the high temperature switch is a magnetic material.  If it gets too high it separates because it--at high temperatures it loses its magnetism.  Well we can control the temperature of which it loses its magnetism by ordering or disordering the magnetic material.  And so in that case we can use order/disorder to our advantage.  So it has--and there are some mineral phases, very important, one hears a lot of talk about problems in mathematics that have been longstanding and they, these are the things that either make or break careers.  But in minerals there's a class of minerals known as feldspars and they exhibit order/disorder.  And some of the disordering mechanisms have been studied for hundreds of years and people still don't know what's going on.  And for one to solve one of those problems would be as important as solving some of these mathematical problems, just that folk don't talk about it very much.
Story_ID: 23006
Speaker 1: All right, University of Manitoba [Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So your fellowship was carried out in the Department of Physics.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so yeah.
Speaker 2: But my, see when I was in Chicago [Illinois] I had already worked with physicists and I was in a low temperature laboratory which really is physics, almost totally physics.  And my research was relevant to physics, not really to chemistry.  So, and this fellow, his name was Morris, he had written one of the standard textbooks in magnetism and being a physicist he did not know as much chemistry as he knew he needed to know so the best way to solve that problem was to have a chemist come into the lab who also knew some physics.  So I went into the lab specifically to help them solve a chemical problem they were having, which I was able to do.  But in the meantime, we all, I also was able to do some of my own physics, again in order/disorder in magnetic materials.
Speaker 1: Well I was asked to ask you about what is meant by a permanent magnet?
Speaker 2: Right.  We have different kinds of magnetism, all--there's something on this diamagnetism.  Any material that contains electrons will have diamagnetism as one component of its properties.  A material, doesn't matter what it is, gas, solid, liquid, if it has unpaired electrons, one, let's say a single electron, it will exhibit something known as paramagnetism.  If you take a material that is paramagnetic that just has some electrons that are unpaired, you put it in a magnet, it will be attracted by the magnet, not very strongly but it will be attracted.  Once you move the magnet away it remembers none of the magnetism.  So with a paramagnet you can only tell what's going on with it when you put a mag, in the presence of a magnetic field.  Then there are materials where you can have unpaired electron spans but they will be ordered so they all point up, they all point down or maybe one is up and one is down.  And those configurations can be stable over long periods of time.  But if they're all pointed up with moments, with electrons like that, they have a moment.  They have a magnetic moment and that moment doesn't change.  That's a permanent magnet.  So there are some--and a permanent magnet can either be a metal or it can be an oxide so something known as alnico, aluminum nickel cobalt, that's an alloy that it's a, it's metal and most of the little dogs that you buy, the trick shops, they have Alnico magnets.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) of those, I mean they used to be popular in the 50s [1950s] these little Scotty dogs, I was hypnotized.
Speaker 2: That's exactly, that's right.
Speaker 1: I used to play with right with (unclear).
Speaker 2: One would--that's, I did the same thing.  That's probably Alnico magnets.  Then there are the class of magnets that are oxides and the most common one is something called a hexaferrite which occurs in nature.  You can find them in Sweden, very complicated chemical compositions and complicated arrangements of atoms and so that would be a permanent magnet.  So the refrigerator magnets, permanent magnets and they are made out of oxide materials that have been embedded in a plastic or a rubber material.  And there's been virtually a revolution, no one knows about it but the starter motors on cars used to be very large and they had copper wiring on them.  And the copper wire was used to create a magnetic field and then you could make the motor turn in that magnetic field.  Well for about twenty years, they've been using permanent magnets, oxide magnets to create the magnetic field that you need in a starter motor.  So now the starter motor is only about that big and that's because they're using these permanent magnets.  They used to make them here in Michigan.  Hitachi is a big manufacturer.  General Electric used to make them but Hitachi bought the General Electric factory up near Michigan State and now Hitachi tends to dominate the market in these permanent magnets.  But the door closers, the windshield wipers, they're all operated by these permanent magnet oxides so they're quite common in the environment.  People are unaware of them but they are there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so instead of using the old magnets that we used to create in grade school with the dry cells when you wrap the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: --wire around (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: They're using the permanent magnets now?
Speaker 2: You can now just use a permanent magnet for that, yeah.
Story_ID: 23007
Speaker 1: Now in 1969, you joined the faculty in the chemistry department at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] as an assistant professor.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now how--did you contact Howard or did they contact you or how did that happen?
Speaker 2: I think it was probably mutual.  This, there's this physicist, Warren Elliot Henry, he's a--he works in magnetism and he's the reason I knew magnetism.  He came to, he came through Morehouse [College] when I was a student there. [Henry] McBay had him come through.  He gave a talk and from that point on I was interested in magnetism.  Well he had been at Lockheed Laboratories for many years in Palo Alto and he was moving to Howard and we knew each other.  And the expectation was that he and I were going to set up a magnetic laboratory at Howard University.  So that was why I went there.  It didn't last very long.  I did something that wasn't quite right and the dean and my department chairman Marty Taylor got called to the dean's office and I had to go with them and on our way to the dean's office he chewed me out for getting him in trouble and having to go to the dean's office.  So--
Speaker 1: What did you do?
Speaker 2: They had some funny grade sheet that you had to fill out and no--this was my first year.  No one had told me about all of these things.  So apparently I filled the grade sheet out wrong and instead of them showing me how to do it, I got called to the dean's office.  And so Marty got called too and he was upset.  At that point I decided Howard was not the place for me.
Story_ID: 23008
Speaker 1: So do you think that, so it was the bureaucracy of Howard [University], I mean and how they responded to what happened with you and the grade sheet.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that's the way many black schools operate, even today.  They hire people who have no choice about where they work so they treat them poorly and that was what--they were going to chew me out and send me back into--over in the corner and I would cry.  But what had happened was somewhat more complex.  When I was at [University of] Manitoba I actually was interviewed for a job at Phillips Research Laboratory, it was in the Netherlands.  And I had gone to New York to be interviewed by a big name that I knew.  These were old Dutchmen who wore the black suits and he white shirts and the black hats.  One was George Rathnow and another one was C.J. Gordon.  They had done pioneering work in permanent magnets and they offered me a job but they didn't offer me housing.  And so I wrote them back and said look, I have a wife and three children.  I need housing.  And I didn't hear from them for a good while and I had the job at Howard so I decided to go to Howard.  And as we were getting ready to go to Howard I got a telegram from Phillips saying they had housing for me but it was too late.  We had already rented the truck and were ready to leave.  So I didn't go there.  But in the meantime I had gotten a call from one of the deans at the University of Chicago, Julian Goldsmith.  And he knew me because of my being in the geophysics department.  He was dean of the physical sciences but he was also a faculty member and I suspect chair of the geophysical sciences.  So when I was at Manitoba I got a call from him.  He says, Billy Joe, this is Julian Goldsmith.  I said yes, Dr. Goldsmith.  He says could I recommend you for a position at the University of Michigan?  I said yeah, why not?  And then I didn't, as I said I knew nothing about Michigan.  Well, but he recommended me and he was one of the big names.  When he said something people listened.  So I was interviewed at Michigan and that would have still been in very late 1968 or early 1969.  So I interviewed at Michigan and they offered me a position but they didn't want me to come in 1969.  They said well we'll put you on the books in '69 [1969] but want you to come in 1970.  So I had that one sitting there but if things had worked out between me, with me and Warren Henry I was certainly going to stay at Howard.  But when things didn't work out, I left and came to Michigan.
Story_ID: 23009
Speaker 1: Now did Warren Henry stay at Howard [University]?
Speaker 2: He stayed at Howard and never, they never did do what they said they were going to do.
Speaker 1: So he never did set up his magnetics laboratory?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  And Warren Henry is absolutely brilliant, absolutely brilliant.  I think he is actually one of the most productive chemists.  I'm sorry, one of the most productive physicists that we have.  Warren Henry did some work on, in magnetism that was, had to do with whether quantum mechanics was right in describing magnetism in solids or if a classical model would work.  And Warren Henry proved once and for all time, this was in the late 50s [1950s], for once and for all he proved that the quantum mechanical model was the correct one.  And the way he did that, he was at Lockheed Labs at that time in Palo Alto [California], but he had to use a laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley.  He made measurements at extremely low temperatures and that was the only place he could do that.  And Warren, he almost killed himself doing that.  The doctors actually made him rest after he had completed that work.
Speaker 1: Just because of the intensity of his work?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, you wouldn't believe the points.  I mean the points on his lines, every solid state physics book worth salt, I don't care whether it's written, whether it's printed in Russia or Japan has these plots of Warren Henry's data, every one of t hem.  If it doesn't have Warren Henry's data it is not worth reading.  And so he did that and in order to do that he had to do some extremely unconventional things.  First of all he worked with he worked in the lab of a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, W.F. Giauque [William Francis Giauque].  Giauque was a big man at Berkeley.  Berkeley had probably more Nobel Prize winners in chemistry than anybody.  And Warren would go up on weekends.  One weekend he went up and they had locked the door to the room that had the alcohol and Warren Henry needed alcohol.  Warren Henry went to the fire thing, took the fire ax and chopped the door open and go this alcohol so he could complete his experiments, but a phenomenal man.  Used to be that when we wanted to make very low temperature measurements we used glass like the thermos bottles, we would use something like thermos bottles.  Well thermos bottles are porous.  Helium atoms can get, can go through the walls of a thermos bottle.  And if you're an experiment for a long time if you have helium which is what one normally has, you lose the vacuum of the thermos bottle because the helium has gone through the walls.  Well that was a problem that people had for years and years and Warren Henry said you can make a cryostat out of metal, out of thin wall, stainless steel metal.  No one believed it.  Warren Henry did it and it worked and so nowadays we want o make very low temperature measurements, they are all made out of metal.  And Warren Henry was the one who pioneered that way of thinking but once he got to Howard he was treated quite shabbily.  But he was a hard, he was still hard working, would not be intimidated or put down but he was never able to bring to Howard what Howard could have used to become a world leader in magnetism.  So, but we stayed in contact over the years he and I.  We were all just--he and McBay were very tight and so as a consequence I was very tight with him too and just as my wife loved [Henry] McBay, she loved Warren Henry.  She would tell me in a minute that if she would marry somebody it would be Warren Henry.  (Laughter).  So, but I think the most important thing though I think about this exchange is the thing that Julian Goldsmith did.  Julian Goldsmith was a white man, incidentally he was Jewish.  But of all of the black kids who were at [University of] Chicago with me and up until the time that I finished from 1968, of all the black kids who had finished in Chicago, not a one had gotten an appointment at a major university.  And I would not have gotten an appointment at [University of] Michigan if Julian Goldsmith had not recommended me.  They call it an old boy network.  I don't know whether that does justice because Goldsmith was not an old boy.  But it's quite clear that without his having the courage to recommend me for the position at Michigan, I would not have gotten it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you were just saying if you, the old boy network would not have worked had you not known your--?
Speaker 2: An old boy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Or if you had not known your craft, I mean if you not known, if you hadn't known your science.
Speaker 2: Now that's how he recommended me.  He knew what kind of work I did.  He knew that I was--he knew about the fellow trying to kill me so he knew that I worked hard.  Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: So was he the dean that came over that evening and--?
Speaker 2: No, he was not, no, no, no.  A dean of students came over.  These academic deans don't, they don't do that.
Story_ID: 23010
Speaker 1: University of Michigan, 1970. So you worked first as a consultant in the alloy physics section of the National Bureau of--
Speaker 2: It's now called NIST, National Institute of Science and Technology.  Yeah, that was a very important outlet for me.  I would work there in the summer and I would work there during the Christmas holidays and I would also--we would work you know by telephone at other times.  But when I first came to Michigan it was just I in my laboratory.  I had one or two students but I didn't have the large number of collaborators.  But this consultant-ship I had at the National Bureau of Standards gave me access to about six mature scientists and they also worked in magnetism.  So I would say that in my early years maybe two thirds of my publications came out of my connection with the National Bureau of Standards.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So at the University of Michigan did you have a heavy teaching load or was it--?
Speaker 2: No, I had, I--
Speaker 1: How was--?
Speaker 2: No, I had a standard teaching load.  When I came in they hired two faculty people, a white fellow who had done a post-doctoral at the Australian National University and he was an orthodox mineralogist.  I was in the Department of Geology and Mineralogy where we would do--and of course that's mineral physics I was telling you about.  So he was an orthodox mineralogist.  I was sort of you know I wasn't part of that world.  And the expectation that the department had was that he would be promoted to an associate professor and tenured before I was.  That didn't matter to me.  But I came in, I had good work habits, I wrote proposals, again with the support of my wife.  And so at the end of my first year I went down to see the chairman.  He said well Billy Joe, you're doing all right.  I had grant money, I was publishing, I had students working with me.  He says so things are looking okay and normally you are promoted after six years.  And I said well, and his name was Ike Smith.  I said well Ike, I expect to be promoted after three years.  He said well, the department doesn't see that as something that we are inclined to do.  I said well that's fine.  I said it's your--you have the authority to offer tenure and I have the authority to accept it or not accept it. And that was the end of the discussion.  So for the next two years I worked pretty hard.  I got grant money and I published and there was one faculty member who sort of thought that he was in charge of everyone and the other person who was hired with me was his favorite.  I was not his favorite.  And he thought that maybe I wasn't doing everything that I should do.  He accused me of coming into the building and going into my office and just, and starting to type.  I was typing research proposals.  I mean that's what I was supposed to do.  He wanted me to chat with him and talk and do whatever he thought was the social thing to do.  But I wasn't going to do that.  And so he got pretty angry with me and I had a young man working with me who was a son of one of the faculty members here at the University.  His father was in the history department.  And my offices, we shared a wall and he called my--this student in and said, told him well Evans has--he's been deceptive.  He's not living up to--I heard him say this.  He's not living up to his responsibility.  I said no, no, no he's done everything he said he was going to do.  There's no problem between me and him.  But that's how things were going.  And so at the end of the third year I, in May I got a note saying that I had been promoted.  And, which was pretty unusual because normally when you are promoted you have to provide a doc--you provide names of people to contact, you send in your dossier but somehow or another they had promoted me.  But at that point this other fellow and I had, we were really locking horns so I decided that it was time for me to leave the department and I went and talked to the chairman and he was sort of noncommittal.  But we had a meeting before the executive committee of the college and the department made its case and I made my case and the result of it was that my position was transferred to chemistry.  So after three years in geology as a professor, and I was tenured, I received tenure in geology, my tenured position was moved to chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now did this affect your research in any way?
Speaker 2: Not really, no.  I--my work tended to be more chemical, more physics and I would not have had as much success with students in geology as I would have had in chemistry.  And of course my training was in chemistry.  I could teach.  I could teach only a few courses in geology and mineralogy but I could teach a much broader, wider variety of courses in chemistry than I could in geology and mineralogy. And when I came to Michigan chemistry actually wanted a joint appointment and I wasn't a part of these conversations.  But it was decided that that would not be a good move because if I were split between two departments then neither department would own me.  And when it came time for something to happen, nobody would make anything happen.  So it was better that I be in one department or the other and not split between two.  So when things got on the rocks in geology, chemistry still felt that they would want me to be a part of its faculty.  So that sort of facilitated the move.
Story_ID: 23011
Speaker 1: I was asked to ask you about National Science Foundation funding for your research in the, I guess 70s [1970s].  Was that--?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Now actually most of my funding came from other agencies.  I had, my earlier grants were from, one was from the Research Corporation and one was from the Petroleum Research Fund.  Those--these are all chemical funding, chemistry funding agencies.  The my first major grant from a federal agency was from NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] for, to support my work on glasses, a special kind of glass that's found in nature.
Speaker 1: And NASA funded this too.  Were they trying to, it had something to do with space exploration?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  It was related obliquely to the lunar research.  There are these glasses called tektites that are found throughout the world and unlike the obsidian glass that I told you about that does not get very old in the earth's environment, these tektites could be tens of millions of years old.  They are found in Australia, in South East Asian and in Georgia and Texas.  And so the, they have a very high silicon content and there was one notion that these glasses were actually fragments of the moon.  That a meteorite, and there are many meteoritic impacts on the moon, that a huge meteorite had impacted on the moon and shot rocks out laterally and these rocks were moving at sufficiently high speeds that they actually escaped the moon's gravitational field and were subsequently trapped by the earth's gravitational field and eventually landed on the surface of the earth.  The other notion was that a meteorite had actually impacted the earth, melted the rock, threw the rock up into the air and then it came back down and landed in something known as strewn fields.  So there is the Australian strewn fields which stretches from Australia up into Southeast Asia.  We think it actually goes into China but we don't have good documentation on, of the locations in China.  And then there's a notion that there was a meteoritic impact in the Gulf of Mexico and they found tektite like materials in the sediments in the Gulf of Mexico and it's thought that maybe some of the tektites that we see in Texas and in Georgia may have something to do with other meteoritic impacts.  So my work was to see if I could make a distinction as to how these tektite glasses were formed.  So I had three funding rounds from them which was very important early on--
Speaker 1: From NASA?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it had a lot to do with my getting tenure.  One of the conditions for tenure is showing that you have the ability to get money competitively from a federal agency as opposed to a private agency.  There's this distinction in the universities.  So that was a big part of my being promoted.  Now I didn't start getting significant monies from the National Science Foundation until the early 80s [1980s] and they were the ones who funded the program, the outreach program I had in Detroit called, the Program in Scholarly Research which I think is probably one of my most important undertakings as it relates to getting young people to do careers in science.
Speaker 1: Okay, well we're going to get to that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I just wanted to ask that question.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So NASA is an early part of your research--?
Speaker 2: Yeah I wasn't, well I was not funded early on by the National Science Foundation.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now '72 [1972], you worked as a research fellow in the basic sciences at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a fellowship that I got. It's normally taken as a harbinger for a good scientific career, very competitive and that actually as you mentioned, it had something to do with my work.  But the fact that Chicago [Illinois], I had a pedigree from Chicago and that they supported me in this had a lot to do with that.  So that was an important fellowship and that had a lot to do with my getting promoted too.
Story_ID: 23012
Speaker 1: Okay.  So okay, in, so in '74 [1974] you're like in the chemistry department and--of University of Michigan.  Did you think that in all these schools in the early 70s [1970s] were under some pressure to have some black faculty and staff.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And somebody like you with a University of Chicago Ph.D. and all these publications, you must have been a pretty hot commodity nationwide I would guess in terms of--so did you have a lot of, did you feel you had a lot of latitude to do anything you wanted?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that's a story that's maybe exaggerated a little bit because as I mentioned the other folk who were at Chicago with me and who did very good work, they were not offered a position at any major university.  That's true for Gloria Anderson [HM] who spent all of her life at Morris Brown [College] and she was a gifted organic chemist.  Then there was Thomas Cole who finished a bit before me.  He was not in his early years offered a position at a major university and later on after he had become a university administrator, he was, I think he was president of West Virginia, University of West Virginia.  But as a practicing laboratory chemist, these people did not get offers from major universities.  Now when I was at [University of] Michigan, I was made some offers.  One offer when this, probably I made my decision was not entirely the best one in this case.  I got an inquiry from the California Institute of Technology [Cal-tech].  They wanted to hire me.  But they wanted to hire me in a non-tenured position and I was already tenured at Michigan.  You just, even, I mean even for a school as outstanding as Cal-Tech or Harvard [University], you don't leave a tenured position and go to a non-tenured position.  So I did not take that offer.  I suspected that if I had taken it I would have done well in it.  You know, what you want to do, I have security here so now I'm going to a situation which I'm not secure but  would have worked just as hard and made the same kinds of, if not, other better findings.  I would have had better students available to me there in principal but as a black person you cannot count on that.  But that's a decision that I think is somewhat up in the air but this notion that there was a lot of pressure to hire blacks by the major places, no.  That, that--no and that has never been the case.  I think we did a--someone did a study which I was peripherally associated with which I was peripherally associated I believe in, maybe it was 2000.  At that point there were only sixteen blacks in the Top fifty chemistry departments and you're talking about at least 2,000 faculty total.  And so no one, anyone that would have been hired in the 70s [1970s] would have still been around in 2000 and they just were not there.  So I think that's fiction.
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear).
Speaker 2: And I went to McAllister as I indicated.  I was a student at McAllister and I was a top student in organic chemistry there.  And they could not have forgotten that quickly and I never had an inquiry from McAllister.  So I think in my case individually and from what I know from my other colleagues, that's just a fiction, a myth that people want to promote.  It may have been true in other areas but not in chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you think that they just didn't see you I mean in terms of they just weren't looking for you necessarily and didn't see you cause you weren't in their path?
Speaker 2: No, they were not looking for you and I don't think if they saw you they would not take you on.  I--my work for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], I went to a Gordon Research Conference which is a highly specialized little private group where you go off.  You can't publish, you can't quote anything and for a week you're at this prep school and you're just doing science.  I made a presentation there and one of the fellows came up to my wife and said oh you know, he really handled himself very well.  I said what the--but nobody offered me a position.  So no, I think it's universally true in some of the social sciences areas, maybe in some of the softer sciences like psychology they may have made a push, but not in the hard sciences.
Story_ID: 23013
Speaker 1: Now '77 [1977], you were appointed as a Danforth Associate.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  And now that's another encouraging type of--
Speaker 2: That's, yeah that speaks to my involvement with students.   The Danforth Foundation supports strong faculty interactions and faculty members from Oberlin, Borea, many of the small liberal arts schools are part of that.  And what the Danforth Foundation would do for example, would give you money to invite students into your home for dinners during the academic year.  And so it was that kind of involvement of the faculty with, deeper involvement of the faculty with the students but also faculty members coming together to discuss the kind so f things they were doing with students.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know you said earlier that Danforth funded the little prayer group that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, a chapel.
Speaker 1: A chapel (unclear).
Speaker 2: A chapel at Morehouse [College] yes, yes.  It was a very important foundation.  You remember at the Clarence Thomas confirmation, Danforth from, well it was Missouri yes, he was a big supporter of Clarence Thomas.  And of course you know that the Danforth people also have a controlling if not the controlling interest in Purina--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --the agricultural, agri-business company.  But they were very supportive of Dr. [Benjamin] Mays and for many of the faculty members who were at the black schools in the 70s [1970s] who did not have Ph.D.s, that were Danforth fellowships, they would send them off to school to get a Ph.D. to upgrade the faculty at some of the black schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they had like a long term commitment to the black colleges?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, but no loner.  They quit.  They quit philanthropy and they now own a resort, I think it's Keystone resort just west of Denver [Colorado].  But they phased the foundation out.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there any--well I don't know if you know the reason why.
Speaker 2: I think it was a business decision.  They just, they had done what they were going to do and that was that.
Story_ID: 23014
Speaker 1: Also in '77 [1977], you were invited as a visiting professor to two universities in Germany, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  That was a very important opportunity for me.  I got a Humboldt fellowship to do research in Germany. And the Humboldt fellowship is probably comparable to the Sloan Foundation fellowship except it comes at a later point in one's career.  So I had no teaching responsibilities, just purely research, highly competitive and that allowed me to pursue a research interest that I could not pursue very well in the United States.  It also allowed me the occasion to immerse myself in the German culture, learn how to speak German, my children learned how to speak German so it was a good year for us all around.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you were at the University of Marburg.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then Phillips--
Speaker 2: No, that's one.  It's called Philipps Universitat Marburg.
Speaker 1: Oh, it's just one place?
Speaker 2: Just one place, yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: One place, okay all right.  We discussed it on the phone Saturday as the--
Speaker 2: Oh did you?
Speaker 1: --if it was one or two.  We didn't (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, it's one.  It's one.
Speaker 1: All right, okay so--
Speaker 2: It was the reddest of the German universities.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: --in terms of communism.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's Philipps University of Marburg?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  Right.
Speaker 1: Philipps, is it Philipps College of the University of Marburg?
Speaker 2: No, no it's--I think Philipps was one of the nobility in that area.
Story_ID: 23015
Speaker 1: Now in 1980 you were appointed director of the program of Scholarly Research for urban minority high school students.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: And a lot of the people we've interviewed at some point get involved in STEM programs for high school students for youth.
Speaker 2: Right right.
Speaker 1: So how did this come about?
Speaker 2: Well actually I was the, I don't like this term but I'll use it, I started that program.  What I noticed in my work here at [the University of] Michigan was that the black kids would come in and they would quickly degenerate to mediocrity in their work.  And my assumption was that maybe they were not seeing the best kinds of things that one does here at the University of Michigan.  So at that point I went over and we had a black associate vice president for academic affairs.  His name was Richard English, was a social worker but he was one, a person that one could talk to.  So I told English about my idea and that I wanted to try to do something.  He supported me and the university allocated $15,000 for me to do this program.  And initially we worked at one high school in Detroit [Michigan].  It was a selective high school but a small high school called Renaissance High.  And so the first year the program was called the Renaissance High Project.  We couldn't think of anything else and that really was what it was, a project at this one high school. And so the idea was to involve high school students in real research at the University of Michigan in the same way that we have graduate students.  So I selected a group of faculty members who agreed to do this and the idea was that the students would come up in the summer but they would come every vacation that they had during their academic year, on weekends to continue their research.  So instead of trying to do a research project in three summer months, we knew that was not enough time.  You don't do research in that short a period of time.  We would work over the entire academic year and so that's what we did.  And there was a gifted administrator in Detroit, Beverly Thomas who was a music person but she understood what we were trying to do.  She suggested as we were coming to the end of the summer phase of the program that we should have a symposium and the students would present their work.  So I said okay we'll do that.  And so the students worked all during the fall, during their Christmas vacation and oh, about the middle of January we would have a symposium.  So the students gave ten-minute talks, they could only talk as long as we would talk in our professional meetings.  And we worked with them all of the time for a month getting their talks together.  And so the symposium came, we had it at Detroit at the Engineering Society a very scholarly technical setting.  And without warning we knew nothing about it, Shapiro was in the back of the room.  He was president of the university at that time.  So he came in to see what we had done with his money and the students did fantastic.  And when it was over Shapiro had allocated for the next year $150,000 for the program.  So we went up by a factor of ten in funding and we continued that program for about fifteen years, fourteen or fifteen years and it was funded at that level for that period of time.  We had about a three year period when the National Science Foundation funded us but we didn't like their money.  They wanted to tell us what to do and we did not agree with them on that.  They wanted us to have recreational activities and things like that for the students.  We said no, our students will find out how to recreate themselves.  The university is rich in those kinds of facilities and we're not going to spend our time worrying about that.  But we did accept funding from them for three years and we didn't do it anymore.  And I think we must have gotten about a half million dollars in funding from them.  But the remarkable thing about that program was that during that period of time Detroit had more Westinghouse winners than they had had--the Westinghouse Science Talent Search had been going on for about since the 40s [1940s] I believe and in just this ten year period, Detroit had more winners in the Westinghouse than they had had for the previous forty years.  And most of these kids, not all of them, most of these kids were black kids and most of the kids came from ordinary families.  Their families were not professionals.  One of the characteristics of the Westinghouse winners during that time was that the parents tended to be professionals, Ph.D.s, scientists themselves.  But these were just ordinary kids.  And so it showed what one could do with the general population just by doing those kinds of things at the university was already very good at doing.  What's so distressing about that activity is that we--our last year of doing that program was 1994 and Detroit has not had a Westinghouse winner since.  It's now called the Intel--Intel now does it but Intel and Westinghouse, that's the same project, same program.  So, in what '94 [1994], that's about eighteen years so in eighteen years there has not been a single kid of any description from Detroit to be a Westinghouse winner, very distressing.  And it says a little bit--and we still have the STEM programs.  We probably have more STEM programs today than we had in 1981 or 1994.  But it says something about what people are doing in these STEM programs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We should have more winners than we've had.
Story_ID: 23016
Speaker 1: Now also in '84 [1984], the same year you started this program, you were, you served as Director of the Comprehensive Studies Program of the University of Michigan.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's a program, it's had many names.  When I came here in 1970, it was called the Center for the Research of Learning Skills, C-U, yeah C-U-L-S, Center for the Utilization of Learning Skills.  It was an outreach program for black kids, sort of a bridge program.  Kids who came in and had deficits, they would make up for these things in this program.  Well someone had the idea that Billy Joe Evans, since he had been effective in other kinds of things like this, he might be effective in that program.  When I became director, I think it had a different name.  It's called Comprehensive Studies--it's called CSP now.  They don't like X on, the numbers, the names don't mean anything it's just CSP.  So when I came in there was another director who was in charge of counseling and so the idea was that I would deal with the academics and she would deal with the counseling.  Well this person wanted to tell the faculty what to do.  Well non-faculty cannot tell faculty what to do and I made that clear that if someone wants to tell the faculty members what to do then tell me and I will tell them but non-faculty can't tell faculty members what to do.  And then there was another issue, we had these power courses where students would have an extra session.  They had done it in biology.  They said the students in CSP who had taken these power sections were doing better than students in the normal sections.  I said, great.  So we don't need to continue those programs, they can just go now and move into the regular curriculum.  No, no, no we want to have these power sessions until they're in upper level classes.  I said no, it doesn't make any sense.  If they have shown accomplish in the lower level classes then they can move into the regular stream.  So we had a big debate about that with the consequence that I resigned.  I said I can't--if I can't do what I think is best for the students then I won't do anything at all.  And I still think that such programs are problematic for places like Michigan because it gives students a crutch that they never want to get rid of.  And if it's going to work you got to move them into the regular academic program at some point.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: I know you don't like to hear things like this, but this is the truth and the truth has to be told.  At least as far as I see what the truth is.
Speaker 1: Yes sir, well I don't--you know I'm listening.  I'm listening.  So you were, in '85 [1985], you were also elected president of the University of Michigan Research Club.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Now this is a campus wide independent faculty body for promoting and recognizing excellence in research.
Speaker 2: Right, now that was basically a group of white faculty, mainly men.  There was a women's research group but the University of Michigan Research Club also would have women.  But there was a time when I guess it was based purely on merit.  I was willing to do the work that the presidency required and I understood research and so I had the appointment.  Those were good years for me and I had good relations with the faculty but mainly the faculty were not from my department.
Story_ID: 23017
Speaker 1: Okay.  You also worked on several consult--you were the science and technology--you were, I'm sorry, you were hired by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
Speaker 2: For the Advancement of Science, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and advising on science and technology programs for youths and teachers in, and this is in Ann Arbor [Michigan] here or--?
Speaker 2: No, no, nationwide.
Speaker 1: Nationwide, okay.
Speaker 2: We, I arranged for programs for youth at the Detroit [Michigan] meeting of the--it's called the AAAS as well as the meeting in Los Angeles [California].  And they had never had a program of this magnitude devoted to outreach for pre-collegiate students.  And it was Shapiro who, he was one, I think one of the co-chairs of the meeting for that year.  It was he who recommended that I do that.  And I did it in connection with one of the executives at Chrysler Corporation.  It turned out to be very successful.  We had buses to bring students in which had never been done before and as a result of that, we also did the same thing in Los Angeles.  And in that case my teacher, Phalba Pitts had moved to Los Angeles.  She was teaching in the Los Angeles Public Schools and so I invited her and her class specifically to come to the session there.  So it was good to make contact with her again once I had done something myself.
Speaker 1: Okay, that is something to be able to reconnect with her, had done so much for you.  Now in--okay, now you were involved in the youth symposium for the AAAS [American Association for the Advancement of Science]--
Speaker 2: That's what we've been talking about.
Speaker 1: That's what we're talking about now (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now '85 [1985], you're also one of five national recipients for the Silver Award for excellence in high school university partnerships--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --given by the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education.
Speaker 2: Right.  That was an award that was given for the program in scholarly research.  Yeah, I didn't--the university put that up.  I had nothing to do with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in '86 [1986] you spent a year in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Atlanta U as the chairman of the chemistry department.
Speaker 2: Right.  This fellow Luther Williams had become president of Atlanta University at that point and it was his idea to make Atlanta University a fully articulated research university.  And so he wanted me to be chairman of the chemistry department.  They conducted a search and [Henry] McBay was part of the faculty at Atlanta University and he says that I came out as the top candidate with no reference to my having been a student at Morehouse.  So I took the position and a lot of work to be done but I was up to the job.
Speaker 1: You didn't have to leave your position at University of Michigan right?  You had to--or did you take (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have to--I took a leave.  I took a leave at that point.  And midway Luther Williams, the president was essentially stripped of all of his power.  They put an attorney in the anti-room to his office and in order to get to Luther Williams you had to go past this attorney.  And that was no way to try to run a department so I didn't--I was tenured and I was making a good salary but that was no--I was not going to be able to do any effective scientific work so--
Speaker 1: Now had you moved your family to Atlanta for this activity or did you go by yourself?
Speaker 2: I went by myself.  I went by myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.  And it happened so soon that I did not have a chance to move my family.  There's a-Morehouse [College] will show up later on down there and that's the time when I did move my family to Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Atlanta U was going through a lot of changes in those days in '86 [1986], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  They messed with the endowment.  And in fact when I was chair, I noticed that on certain days of the month nobody was around.  I said where is everybody?  And I never got to the bottom of it but--that is on my own.  But one day I got a call from the bank where our checks were deposited and they said Mr. Evans we just need to alert you to the fact that your check will not be--you will not have money in your account today corresponding to your payroll check.  It said the university didn't have any monies.  That's when I discovered why the folk were not around.  On pay days they did not have direct deposit.  They would get their checks in their hand go the bank, cash the checks and then put the money in the bank before the account ran out of money.  I didn't--no one told me about that.  But I said I refuse to live like this.  I am not--I work, I've been trained well.  I'm not going to live like this.  But--so that's, those are the kinds of things that were going on at that time.
Story_ID: 23018
Speaker 1: Okay, back at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor] in '87 [1987], you were appointed coordinator of the inorganic cluster in the Department of Chemistry and you served there from '87 [1987] to '91 [1991], right in that capacity?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--that sort of service work, we have clusters, physical, organic, inorganic and so I had the job of doing the inorganic cluster for that period of time.  Because of my work with the Program in Scholarly Research, I had a lot of experience in putting together brochures and graphics and things.  So I worked very hard to give good publicity for the inorganic cluster and it was significant from the perspective that race still matters and the fact that I was black and had been given that responsibility said something.  I don't know what, but it would have been unexpected--it would have been expected if I had never been coordinator of the cluster.  No one would have raised any question about that.  So the fact that it did happen was of some minor significance.
Story_ID: 23019
Speaker 1: Okay.  So also it says on June 8th, you delivered a presentation at invitational conference of the Rockefeller Foundation's participants at Howard University [Washington, D.C].
Speaker 2: Right.  The Rockefeller Foundation was supporting an effort at Howard [University] that was very similar to the Program in Scholarly Research and so they invited me to come there and present the findings that we had here at Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And there are a lot of consultancies here--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I think in the late 80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: One is at Los Alamos [New Mexico] in '89 [1989] which lasted till '94 [1994].
Speaker 2: Yes, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now and you were consulting for the Dynamic Testing Division.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So what were you doing?
Speaker 2: That's the bomb making division.  Not--well it's a bomb testing division.  There's another division called, I think was Division X in those days with big brick wall, nobody knows what goes on behind it.  But that was a division that conducted a test, the underground test on nuclear bomb developments.  That was a good experience for me.  I got to see what really went on and it was a classified position so it was very instructive and I got paid to do it so that was another perk.  And again I was the only black person on that committee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in '92 [1992], you were a consultant for the African American Faculty Advisory Council of DuPont Merck.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: For--and for the Louisiana State Board of Regents.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  The one for, the one on the--at DuPont Merck, that was a good experience.  They had a very dynamic vice president who was running that effort and DuPont Merck had not been too successful in getting minority faculty, black, I mean minority scientists.  And so he set up this committee to try to do something about that, very innovative.  And one of the consequences was that they would pay for post-docs at university positions and so one of the fellows at Michigan got a post-doctoral appointment out of that at the University of California, Berkeley.  So it was a good experience but when he left DuPont, of course that committee sort of left too.
Story_ID: 23020
Speaker 1: In '94 [1994] you were hired to work as a consultant with the Inkster, Michigan Public School System.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's a black town.
Speaker 2: That's a black yeah that's a black town.  People tell stories that some automobile executive named it that as an illusion to the fact that it is black.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard--
Speaker 2: You've heard that story too?  Yeah, yeah no, so I worked with them in their science areas and I worked with them again from 2009 to 2011 in a similar connection, very difficult situation.  I did not have the success in that effort that I had with the Detroit Public Schools in the Program in Scholarly Research.  It was just a difficult something to do.
Speaker 1: So Inkster wasn't, things weren't cooperative or they just--?
Speaker 2: When we went into Detroit [Michigan] the superintendent told people to leave us alone.  Whatever we wanted to do we could do and he didn't want anybody gumming the works up.  And Shapiro had said the same thing here at Michigan.  In the case of Inkster, we did not have that kind of carte blanche.
Story_ID: 23021
Speaker 1: In '95 [1995] you were honored as a catalyst metalist but by the National Catalyst--or no, you were the National Catalyst Awardee by the Chemical (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right, by the manufacturer's association.  That's one of the big awards in chemistry for the teaching of chemistry and so I got that for that year.  I think it came with a sizeable monetary award as well as maybe a week's stay at Greenbrier down in West Virginia where they don't--you don't talk about money, you just do what you do and pay your bill when you get ready to leave.  So it was a very good something.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in '97 [1997], the American Chemical Society National presented you with the award for encouraging disadvantaged students into careers in chemical sciences?
Speaker 2: Right.  And that's one of the national awards and at that time you know one only can, one can only do what he does.  You can't do everything but at that time I was the only member of the chemistry department at Michigan who had a national award from the American Chemical Society.  There are regional awards but then you have the national awards and at that time I was the only one who had a National Award.  Since that time many other people have gotten national awards from the American Chemical Society too here at Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in '98 [1998] you received the presidential award for excellence in science mathematics and engineering mentoring from the National Science Foundation--
Speaker 2: Mentoring, yes.
Speaker 1: --and became the fourth Lloyd N. Ferguson Distinguished Lecturer at Cal [California] State University in Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Well the presidential award is a very big something and I received that directly from [President William] Clinton.  We were actually in the Oval Office and Clinton presented the award to me directly.  And then the Lloyd Ferguson Award, Lloyd Ferguson was one of the outstanding black chemists, wrote several books, three books, excellent books, never offered a position by a major university.  He was at Howard [University] for most of those years but Cal State LA offered him a position.  Cal State LA is a good school but it is not a major university.  So I mean just as I indicated to you before, this assumed pressure of places to hire blacks in the 70s [1970s] just really was not true.  And Lloyd had written excellent books.  In fact when Lloyd went to Cal State LA, one of the faculty members suggested that he might use a particular book in his course on mechanism of organic chemistry.  Lloyd said I can use my own book because he had written a book on just that subject.
Story_ID: 23022
Speaker 1: I heard actually, you hear the story about Lloyd Ferguson and civil rights, right, the one they tell?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, they just say that when people were trying to integrate the white schools in this country, Lloyd Ferguson was already in there cause they were using his book.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  I hadn't heard that one.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So have you interviewed Lloyd, did you interview Lloyd too?
Speaker 1: We were lucky enough to interview Dr. Ferguson--
Speaker 2: Good, good, good.  He passed last year.
Speaker 1: --before he passed away.  Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I was there for the dedication of the plaza.  They dedicated a plaza for him at Cal State LA [California State University, Los Angeles].
Speaker 1: Have a bust of him there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dr. Lloyd Ferguson, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We interviewed his first graduate student that was--Hopkins, Ms. Hopkins at Martha's Vineyard last week.
Speaker 2: Did you?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What's her name?
Speaker 1: Theresa Hopkins, I--
Speaker 2: Theresa Hopkins.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I have to look that up.  Does she live at Martha's Vineyard or--?
Speaker 1: She lives there now with her son, yeah.
Speaker 2: I have to look that up.
Speaker 1: She lived in Framingham, Massachusetts.  She was a selectman, city councilman in Framingham--
Speaker 2: And was she a, she was a Howard [University] graduate then?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and she went on to Polaroid from Howard.  She worked at the--
Speaker 2: And she would have taken a Ph.D. with--did she take a Ph.D. with him at Howard?
Speaker 1: No, she went on to Yale [University] to get a Ph.D.
Speaker 2: Because Cal State LA did not give the Ph.D. degree.
Speaker 1: No, she got a Ph.D. from Yale.
Speaker 2: Okay but she got a Masters from Lloyd at Howard [University].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have letters between Lloyd Ferguson and [Henry] McBay.  Lloyd was trying to get McBay in fact to come to Howard because McBay is given a lot of credit for teaching but McBay's greatest love and his greatest talent was in research.
Story_ID: 23023
Speaker 1: What is [Henry] McBay noted for in research?  What (unclear) his efforts?
Speaker 2: Free radicals.  He worked with a very famous fellow, Morris [Selig] Kharasch at the University of Chicago [Illinois].  And some of McBay's school mates from that time had written letters back to the University.  He was renowned for his ability to work with free radicals.  And when he went to Morehouse [College] he continued to work with free radicals and indeed McBay was almost killed with doing his work on free radicals.  A free radical will explode on you and he was working and he had an explosion.  And someone had to clinch his jugular vein to keep him from bleeding to death.  And that was probably in the 50s [1950s] and when I saw McBay in the early 60s [1960s], he still had marks on his face where the glass had gone into his body, but he did not stop doing research.  What he did, he got a telephone booth and put at the end of his reaction rack and he would sit in the telephone booth and watch the reaction and that was there when he died.  And McBay, to do free radical research you need complicated glassware and you need a glass blower.  You can't just buy it.  So McBay became a glass blower.  He could blow some of the most beautiful scientific apparatuses imaginable.
Speaker 1: That's incredible, this, I'm just thinking about it.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: You stayed friends with McBay throughout his life (unclear).
Speaker 2: Throughout his life.  Yeah we were friends for life.  My wife, my children, we were friends the same with Warren Henry.  And I have similar relationships with my students though they don't need me as much as I needed McBay.
Speaker 1: Now your--when we came in your wife was telling us a story about Dr. McBay, you drove him across the country cause he had never been all the way across the country?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, we were--I had a meeting in Vancouver [British Columbia, Canada] and my students and I had decided we would drive there and McBay learned about it.  He said that he was going to have an eye operation.  He wasn't certain how things would go and he wanted to see the west and he asked if he could ride with us.  So my students decided that they weren't going to go and so McBay, I couldn't drive that 2,500 miles by myself so Hattie Bell agreed to drive with us.  So the three of us took off and drove across country.  No she loved McBay and Warren Henry I think sometimes more than she did me.  But that was because she didn't see their faults.  She could see my faults but no she had a great love for them.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Thought I'd point that out.  And Dr. McBay, he passed away when?
Speaker 2: I think it was '95 [1995].  I had--we were in constant contact so I had called to talk with him and the secretary answered the phone and said that he was not available or something and I said this doesn't sound right but I didn't--and I think maybe a day or so afterwards she calls me and tells me that McBay is dead.  I said what are you talking about?  So I immediately went to Atlanta [Georgia] to see what was going on.  McBay had had a blockage in his intestine and he had gone to a gastroenterology group.  They were going to do some kind of, put some barium or something in him to find out what was going on.  They gave him the barium and he could not pass it and so they immediately put him in the hospital and they operated.  They removed the blockage sewed him up and things were looking fine. He was a big baseball fan and he was in the hospital room watching the game, the Atlanta Braves I guess with his son.  And all of a sudden he took a downturn.  And during this time just as that woman didn't tell me what was going on, he didn't tell any of his students.  He had tons of doctors in Atlanta.  Turns out that they didn't sew him up right and so he died from sepsis.  Now all McBay had to--but toward the, when the problem came they did contact some of his students and they came in.  One of them was this fellow Isaac Willis that I mentioned but they couldn't do anything then.  It was too late and so he died from sepsis.  And the tragedy about that is that McBay must have been 80 years of age then, in good physical and mental condition.  He wanted to keep working.  He did not dare let his colleagues know at either Atlanta University or Morehouse that he was ill cause they would have written him off.  So rather than run the risk of being written off and bringing his career to a close, he did not tell anybody.
Speaker 1: So you think he worked past, longer than he, I mean ill longer than he should have and--?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  He didn't tell anybody he was being operated on.  If he had told somebody they would have been in that operating room and would have seen to it or maybe the doctors would have been more careful in sewing him up.  But to them he was just an old black man with nobody around him of any importance and so they probably were not as careful as they could have been.
Speaker 1: That is tragic to think that.
Speaker 2: But the operation itself was successful.  He was fine.  They just did not sew him up right.  And all he had, I mean with all of those doctors he had trained.  And Isaac Willis is in the book of the best doctors.  He's one of the best doctors or was in the U.S.  If he had been there, they--he would have gotten an entirely different kind of treatment, very, very tragic, very tragic.
Story_ID: 23024
Speaker 1: We were talking about now you had received the presidential award from [President] Bill Clinton.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In the White House in 1998.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And this is a, you said this is a, really a big deal.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's one of the--I think it eclipses all of the awards that I have gotten because it was for an entire career.  The Catalyst was for teaching chemistry, the Humboldt was for research but this one was for an entire career.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In 2000, you receive the James Flack Norris Award for achievement in the teaching of chemistry too from the Northeastern Section of the American Chemical Society.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: The Giants in Science Award from QEM?
Speaker 2: QEM, Quality Education for Minorities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you're also honored as the distinguished lecturer at Sigma Xi.
Speaker 2: Sigma Xi, yes.  Sigma Xi is an honorary scientific society and they appoint people to lectureships and for one year you go all over the country giving lectures to other Sigma Xi chapters.  The QEM award is good but it's sort of local.  It's something that we blacks do for each other and that's good.  One needs to have a home where people respect you, but the award before that--that was the James Flack Norris award.  Yeah, McBay got that award I believe in 1978 and I was, I presented, I spoke at that occasion in which he got the award.  So it was significant to me that I would receive the same award some years later even though I certainly, no question about it, I was not as deserving of the award as McBay was.  I don't have fifty students with Ph.D.s who may not have even gone to college out into the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now 2000--now you were a Sigma Xi College Distinguished Lecturer a couple of times right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And 2008, you were appointed to serve as chairman of the Committee of Multicultural--the Committee for Multicultural University--
Speaker 2: University, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --at the University of Michigan.
Speaker 2: Right.  That was a committee set up some years ago under Duderstadt [James J. Duderstadt, President Emeritus and University Professor of Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan] who had a very aggressive program for minority participation. It had been dormant for many years and just as I was asked to be chair of this CSP program, somebody asked me to chair that.  That turned out to be a very good experience.  We prepared a report on minority participation in the various faculty groups and it was pretty bad.  We had not made any progress in about ten years in those areas and we had a report which was well received.
Speaker 1: Now the report from what I understand showed that more minorities were working at the University of Michigan than ever before but the growth in terms of black and Hispanic faculty was almost nil, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right and that was the number, the figure the university hides behind.  By using minority, things look good. But that minority was mainly Asian Americans or maybe I think I should just say Asian.  So that group was growing at very high rates and blacks and Hispanics were essentially standing still or receding.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.  So did you make any progress other than issuing the report I mean were you able to get the--?
Speaker 2: Well I made a presentation to the faculty senate and then I moved off of the committee and there has not been a report since.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You think they were expecting you to have, to issue that kind of report?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: But it was a purely, perfectly objective report.  I mean there were no opinions expressed in it, just the data and they spoke--the data spoke very loudly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you really feel a need to promote the presence of African Americans in the sciences?
Speaker 2: Yes and good people.  I get that from my father [Will Evans].  I didn't, we didn't--in fact my brother, we were talking about the mess in my home town where they want to change the name of the street and we Evans' were the only ones fighting that and I wrote my--Otha, the brother under me and he agreed.  He says yes but daddy had a lot of faults but one of the things, good things we got from him was that to stand up when we think that things are going in a wrong direction.  And so when daddy worked for the Central of Georgia as I mentioned when they got the automatic stokers they tried to get rid of the black firemen in Mississippi.  When they got dieselization on the Central of Georgia they tried to get rid of the black firemen again.  And they were going to require the black firemen to take a written test on how to operate a diesel engine.  Well most of the black firemen could not read very well, not only to read a technical thing.  And so daddy went to a strategy meeting in Washington with A. Philip Randolph.  We have a picture of that trying to--but there is a picture of daddy with A. Philip Randolph and daddy's job was to give classes to the black firemen so they could pass this test, which is what he did.  And I think very few if any of them actually lost their jobs.  So that's the kind of background from which I come.  They can't do much about it, it's part of who I am.  I'm no sure that it's a decision I make the way Martin Luther King made a decision to change things.  Maybe with me it just sort of reflects it but that's what I do.
Story_ID: 23025
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you have done to this point is there anything major that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I, you know I've had a bit of time to think about that and I, at this point I feel I have my integrity.  I'm not ashamed of anything.  I can look anybody in the eye and so I feel good about what I did.  I paid heavy for it but I sort of knew that going in and what I paid should not be all that important to me.  And so I feel, no I wouldn't change very much.  I would want to fight for what I thought was right even if it cost me something.  And, but I feel good about the kind of life I've led.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when did you retire from (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I retired in 2003.
Story_ID: 23026
Speaker 1: And today when you look back at your career, I mean what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: The Program of Scholarly Research, working with the young people and my teaching of physical chemistry and the relationships, those are the things, those are all continuing with me, the relationships I formed with my students, some black, many white students and then my research in magnetism.  I did discover or uncovered some things that are still around even though people, especially Americans are reluctant to acknowledge that, that's all right.  I know what I did and some people know too.  So I'm reasonably satisfied.  But those what, it's those three things, Program of Scholarly Research, my work in physical chemistry and those are people kinds of things and then lastly my research in magnetism.
Story_ID: 23027
Speaker 1: Now what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I am very much concerned about the loss of community among African Americans.  The black faculty for example at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor], we have very little to do with each other outside of officially sanctioned activities.  And this shows up in what happens to our students who come here.  We just met a law professor at my church whose been here for eight years and she's virtually an unknown quantity in the black community.  I'm concerned that the black faculty generally is not strong enough to fight the kinds of oppressive attitudes and maneuvering that they find when they come to the university.  And so that's--and their strategy is to do nothing and hope that nobody would bother them, the consequence being that they lose a lot of their integrity and their ability to stand up to things when things are wrong.  That, so that concerns me, that's my greatest concern at the moment that we blacks in the, in academics have lost, if we ever had it but I'm sure we had more than we have now, have lost a sense of community.  And we've just become employees rather than the kind of faculty members who will lead universities even if they have to pull them screaming in the right direction.
Story_ID: 23028
Speaker 1: All right.  Well tell us something about your family?
Speaker 2: My family.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We talked about how got married--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you got three children?
Speaker 2: We have two children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So Addie Bell and I married in August 31, 1963.  We had our first child September 16th, 1965.  That was William Joseph Evans.  We gave him a correct name, not a nickname.  My, both of my names are nicknames so his name is just a correct name for me though he was also named for his grandfather.  And then in January 7th, 1967, we had twins, a boy and a girl, Carole Elizabeth and Jesse Niles.  You notice that Jesse has both of those traditional Evans names, my father's name as well as the name Jesse.  That's part of the Roundtree collection of first names.  They were born in Chicago [Illinois].  They were very happy children, no major problems with any of them, very different children.  William, rather quiet like his grandfather on his mother's side, Jesse, maybe he was a new soul all together and Carole is sort of--everyone say she looks like Addie Bell.  I cannot see it in her, neither can Addie Bell.  They say she talks like Addie Bell, I cannot hear it in her but everybody says it.  She has some of the characteristics of my mother but--so they went to Germany with us.  Jesse and Carole went to grundschule, the elementary school and William went to the gymnasium which is where the college bound German students go.  He had a good experience.  Carole and Jesse learned how to talk to the ordinary German, learn expressions that we still can't figure out but they had a good time.  They were raised not looking at television so we would listen to the public broadcast station out of Boston [Massachusetts] when we were having dinner.  We always had dinner together.  But when we went to Germany we had to get a television just to keep up with the language.  We just couldn't learn the language well enough with ourselves.  So when we came back we bought a television and so William was maybe thirteen at that point and that was his first experience with television.  And he liked to read, still likes to read.  They went to high school, had a good experience.  William was--the oldest boy was a bit more scholarly than his brother and sister, though Carole took physics because William had taken physics.  She had no intention of doing science but she wanted to do what her brother did.  And then William entered, all three of them entered the science fair.  The first time they got second and third place and then William persisted and he got second place one year which sent him off to the International Science and Engineering Fair and he got first place in chemistry and got some scholarship from General Motors.  And the second year he won first place here in Ann Arbor [Michigan] and again went to the National Science and Engineering and got tons of first prizes, including the General Motors prize which gave him a scholarship to go to college as well as a summer job.  And at that time he was applying--and he was also a Westinghouse Science Talent Search finalist.  He was one of the forty winners.  He didn't get one of the top three prizes but we were happy with his being a winner.  And he was applying to college.  He applied to the University of Chicago and he was accepted and his mother asked him, you know I'm going to pay the room deposit.  Are you sure you're going to Chicago?  He said yes I'm sure.  He had visited the campus.  So one of the prizes that he got from the science fair was a trip on a nuclear submarine in Hawaii so on his way to Hawaii we told him to stop off in Los Angeles [California] and look at Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology] just to be sure.  He was accepted there.  And he called back and told his mother he was going to Cal Tech so she was pretty upset about that and told him he had to see Chicago again before she would agree to make a room deposit at Cal Tech.  But he went to Cal Tech anyway.  He was a top student at Cal Tech, a better student at Cal Tech than he was at--in high school.  We paid $7,000 of his expenses the first year and we paid no more after that.  Cal Tech would give you more scholarship money than you need to pay your bills.  So he got a Carnation Scholarship and the General Motors and so he actually had more money than he needed to pay his expenses at Cal Tech and--but he was a top student.  And when he applied to graduate school he applied to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], Harvard [University] and Cornell [University] and some others but he never heard from MIT.  And all of his classmates were saying Will, they had heard from Cal Tech--I mean from MIT and said Will, we know you're going to get something from MIT.  And he didn't hear.  So finally he sent MIT a letter and he got a letter back saying that all of the minority students' applications we had held in a special batch for consideration and he would hear from them.  And he wrote a letter back saying that he didn't want to come to MIT for that reason because he had been excluded from competing for the normal set of scholarships that MIT would give out.  But in the meantime he was admitted to Harvard and he got a Hertz fellowship which is one of the big fellowships that one gets in physics.  I think at that time it paid $25,000 a year, not counting any expenses.  That was just a stipend.  And the idea was that if someone takes a Ph.D. degree it takes them about ten or fifteen years to catch up in earnings with somebody who did not take a Ph.D. degree.  So the idea of the scholarship was to compensate for those lost earnings that were incurred by going ahead for the Ph.D. degree and not earning a market based salary.  So he finished Harvard and was offered a post-doc at Lawrence Livermore Labs [federally funded research development center].  And in fact once he got there they told him they wanted to hire him as an employee and not as a post-doc and he agreed to that.  So he's been there about fifteen years now.  He's a group leader.  He has a very good career and he has a wife, two children.  He always said he wanted to have a wife and a family but his mother and I could never figure out how he was going to have a wife and a family if he didn't marry.  So he reached forty years of age.  We said woo this boy, he's going to have to court for five years and--but he met the young lady and in two years a child was on the way so, so much for our calculations.  So he's happy and we have a good relationship with him.  His--the other two children, Jesse died at age twenty-seven.  He had a lymphoma of the central nervous system.  His sister, his twin, she finished Spelman [College] and she always been interested in I guess deviancy work with, she worked with the Boys and Girls Club in Atlanta and she had to do a thesis.  Spelman requires their students to do a thesis so she did a thesis on incarcerated youth who were in the Boys and Girls Club of Atlanta [Georgia] and so she decided she wanted to take a Ph.D. in sociology and she did.  It took her some time but she was committed.  She wrote a good dissertation and she's not married.  And in our family as was true of our son, my wife says until they get married they belong to us.  That's kind of a Scandinavian concept, at least for women where the women belong to the men until she gets married.  And so she and her mother talk at least once a day everyday.  She's a deputy warden at a sort of minimum security facility in Wilmington.  She brings a different perspective to it than most folk who work in prison.  She comes from an academic setting and no punitive aspects and she's well respected and she's very happy and fulfilled in her work. Sometimes she thinks she's too fulfilled, she needs to do some other things than just her work.  But she's happy and we're happy with her.  My wife, her mother got real ill in the end of July and she was able to come home and spend two weeks until we got her back in her health again and that was a consequence of having worked so hard and doing a good job where she is.  So we miss our son Jesse very much but we are I think basically a happy, very close family though my son's wife tells us that some of the things we used to do for him, they are her job now and we need to let go.  But we're okay.

Speaker 1: Now is there anything I have not asked you we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I was just thinking about the question you asked me about my, the response I gave about lack of community among us blacks.  I do think that the Program in Scholarly Research demonstrated that where you have a full commitment to young people that you can take them from almost any setting and give them an experience that will make them choose a path in their lives that would give them a good quality life, lives for themselves.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well you probably haven't gathered, I'm something of a, I wouldn't say a jokester but I like to add some humor in some of the things I do.  And so when I go to church, I'll do things and people say are you going to behave yourself?  I said no because I want folk to remember me when I'm gone. But I don't, I haven't decided about what I would like for them to remember.  I think about McBay, we remember his impact and affect he had on students.  Well I will never have the numbers that McBay has.  But I think I would like to be remembered as someone who loved people and who would, especially young people and who would do most anything to ensure that these young people had a--that I helped young people have a good life.
Story_ID: 23030
Speaker 1: Go ahead and tell us about that picture.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's a picture of my sister, Martha Ruth, the fourth in the Evans children.  She's with Warren Buffet who bought her company, Geico and Martha was one of the directors at that company.  I think she was the highest placed black in the organization.  That's me with my colleagues at the International Conference on Magnetism.  The young man I'm with is from Belgium.
Speaker 1: About what year was that?
Speaker 2: That's, let's see it's on the back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh it's not showing up.
Speaker 1: Well what about this one?
Speaker 2: Oh that's me with my son William Joseph and we're in the Southern tea rows of Italy and that's in 1995.  That is I with my daughter and my son in Wilmington, Delaware.  We have just moved her there for her graduate studies in sociology.  When was that Ms. Evans? MRS. EVANS:  That is me.
Speaker 1: That's not you.
Speaker 2: Can you name them?
Speaker 1: That's Billy Joe on the right, Carole Elizabeth in the middle and William Joseph on the right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's, those are the Evans siblings with only one missing.  So that's to the left standing with the white vest on is Jesse Niles, next to him is Otha, that's the brother next to me Otha is right next to me, then there's Jonathan, there's Martha, that's Martha's husband behind her and then Jonathan is at the right with the sweater on and Lillian R. Ford who--Lillian Roundtree is sitting in the chair.  She was a sister by my father's first marriage who was so critical in our development. MRS. EVANS:  That's Jesse not Jesse Niles.
Speaker 2: Did I--I said Jesse. MRS. EVANS:  You said Jesse Niles.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my father at the retirement of one of the locomotive firemen on the Central of Georgia.  They're standing in front of the Nancy Hanks which was the Central of Georgia streamliner and daddy is sort of considered the dean of the retired firemen on the Central of Georgia Railroad.  That is I receiving the National Award from the American Chemical Society for mentoring disadvantaged youths into the chemical sciences.
Speaker 2: I guess top left.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a picture of me and my family in Milan, Italy in front of the dome.  I'm, I have the pigeon in my hand.  Carole is next to me to my left.  Jesse is directly in front of me then comes William and then his mother Addie Bell and that's my Humboldt picture from that same era.  That's, that is I and my brother Jesse and William Joseph when we were at the University of Chicago.  I'm painting a model train.  That is I at the University of Michigan with one of the students in the Program in Scholarly Research.  That is I in the early 70s [1970s], probably 1975, maybe mid-70s [1970s], 1975, 1976 in my office in the chemistry department at the University of Michigan.
Speaker 2: Okay, start on the top left there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now that's a (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, that is I at the University of Chicago in front of the equipment I used for my thesis research.
Speaker 2: Okay, and the next one.
Speaker 1: The next one is I at the, in my living room at the end of one of the programs of the symposium in the Program in Scholarly Research.
Speaker 2: And on the bottom.
Speaker 1: And on the bottom that is I at the University of Manitoba doing my post-doctoral studies there in 1969. Those are the (unclear).
Speaker 2: No. Maybe you're getting this?
Speaker 1: No (unclear). (Unclear), my son's at the bottom.
Speaker 2: Okay. At the bottom of the other page.
Speaker 1: Oh don't worry about it.
Speaker 2: Oh this one?
Speaker 1: I don't know why--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Don't worry about this one?
Speaker 1: It's fine.  It's fine.
Speaker 2: Okay (unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh the top picture is very important.  This is I with my two mentors, Warren Henry on the left and Henry C. McBay on my right, I'm in the middle.
Speaker 2: Okay, and the bottom one?
Speaker 1: The bottom picture is my doing on the questionnaire, they asked me what was one of my favorite experiments?  That's me doing my favorite experiment where I mix two powders, two dry powders together to make a power and water.  I talk about that in terms of Moses striking the rock in the desert.  He was a good chemist.  That's my family.  I'm in the back, the taller of them all.  In front of me, the little fellow is Jesse.  Next to him is my sister Martha Ruth.  In front of her is Terry, the darker, shorter young child and next to him is Larry and then behind Larry is Otha.  The young man behind Otha, between Otha and Martha is a friend of the family.  So that was all, those are all of my family members who were alive at that time with the exception of my older brother.
Speaker 2: That's my grandson, William Alcorn Evans.  He told the teacher that he was not going to smile on his school picture.
Speaker 1: He didn't.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's I with my two brothers in order, Allen is the taller on the left.  Otha is between the two of us and I am on the right.  And that's my mother as a young woman.
Speaker 1: Okay, we got another group picture.
Speaker 2: I wouldn't do that one.  That's in the 70s [1970s].  You already have something about that.
Speaker 1: Is this the house you grew up in?
Speaker 2: That's--yes.  That is a picture taken in maybe 2009 of the house in which I grew up.  You can see the two windows, there were only two rooms and then toward the back you see a little offset, that was a kitchen.  So ten of us grew up in that house.
Speaker 1: Now what, I don't know what--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm going to--yes.  That's the figure up front is my dressed as Grumbo, the play that I was in, in elementary school.  And that's when I received the award from the American Chemical Society in which I acknowledged that the beginning of my career was playing that part in elementary school.  Before I didn't know what the hell was happening.  I came out there--what?  I said okay.  That's I with one of my students.  That's David Savock [phonetic].  He finished Harvard, went to Cambridge for a Masters in Philosophy and has a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley.
Speaker 1: Now this one is kind of damaged but I don't know if there is anything that replicates it.  You want to shoot that?
Speaker 2: That probably, that's the same, that's similar.  That's the same subject matter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's when I received at the dinner when I received the award from the American Chemical Society.  Those are my graduate students, Sheri Bluntson [phonetic] who got a Ph.D. with me, I'm sitting down, behind him is Jeffrey Smithers--no, behind him is Ted Clark, one of my students who had a Ph.D., he's at Ohio State University and next to him is Jeffrey Smithers and we are in front of one of the models of the compounds that we work on.  That's me in the 70s [1970s].  It's probably contemporary with the other picture we took where I'm sitting down.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's my sister, Lillian Roundtree, the one who did so much to help us.  That's me oh about 2008.  That's at one of the symposiums that we had for the Program in Scholarly Research, I to the left in my Chicago Ph.D. robe, a University of Michigan faculty and one of the high school teachers, Betty Hines.  That, that's the same contemporary picture as the other two we've taken.  That's my office.  You can see what a clutter it is.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)?
Speaker 2: That's similar to the other one we just had.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's--
Speaker 2: That's when I got the book of golden deeds from the Exchange Club.  It's--we don't have to--
Speaker 1: It's a nice cover shot on that lab.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  That is I and one of my graduate students in front of our research apparatus.  You can see we worked with radioactive material.
Speaker 1: This is significant.
Speaker 2: That's a newspaper article when I won the presidential award for excellence in mentoring.  That's, that is I in 1962.  I was at McAllister College when that picture was taken.
Speaker 1: Did we shoot this?  I thought--did we shoot (unclear)?
Speaker 2: We--that's Amsterdam.  The one we shot was in San Francisco.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: But you can barely see me on there.  I'm way back there in the background.  I don't--you want to do that, do you?
Speaker 1: Well not if people can't see you.
Speaker 2: I'm way--I have on a Madras coat.
Speaker 1: Oh, you got your head turned.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay well we won't worry about that.
Speaker 2: Let's see here we are--
Speaker 1: That's--we have a better photo of that I think if you didn't--
Speaker 2: These are grandkids?
Speaker 1: Those are my grandkids, yeah. That's Flash and Gordon.
Speaker 2: Flash and Gordon. Flash and Gordon.
Speaker 1: Those are our two grandchildren.
Speaker 2: And Dr. McBay.
Speaker 1: That's Henry C. McBay with one of his students, Van Catledge who worked at DuPont.  Okay, now that is I at my gradation from Morehouse.  I'm the real skinny fellow shaking hands with Samuel Williams.  Samuel Williams was one of the big--one doesn't know about it--one of the big advisors to Martin Luther King.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Here's you in front of a '59 [1959] Chevy looks like.
Speaker 1: Is that--
Speaker 2: It's a '59 [1959] looks like it.
Speaker 1: Oh it could have been '59 [1959].
Speaker 2: Or it could be '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: No it wouldn't be '60 [1960] cause I had gone off to school-
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --by that time.
Speaker 2: Let's see here.  Got you explaining something?
Speaker 1: I'm making a presentation before the regents on the Program in Scholarly Research.  And the fellow whose head is to us is the provost of the university, Billy [E.] Frye.
Speaker 2: Now this is (unclear).
Speaker 1: That's when I was at--yeah.  It's not--I wouldn't do it.  You can hardly find me on there.
Speaker 2: You had something similar to this.  Which one do you like the best?
Speaker 1: Why don't I let you pick?  That is I in the 1980s.  What?
Speaker 2: Okay, you can't duplicate this.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  I gave a talk at a university and a young lady did that caricature of me.  That's my favorite.  You can't find me on that but that's a Morehouse graduation line, much more formal and disciplined than it is today.  That's a close up of me and my graduation picture.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We already got, this is Benjamin Mays?
Speaker 1: Yeah that, and that, this is just a head shot of me.
Speaker 2: Now this is a better one of--this is the one we're talking about.
Speaker 1: Okay right, right.  That's the same one.  That's a picture taken of the platform committee and I as the ranking student.  And next to me is a very famous chemist, Percy Julian, he was given a Ph.D. by Morehouse at that ceremony.
Speaker 2: He's on which side of you?
Speaker 1: Right here.
Speaker 2: It's a--there's a caption.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: I would imagine that's something.
Speaker 1: That is my getting an award from President Shapiro for my work in the Program in Scholarly Research.  You might want to hear this Mr. Crowe.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The department refused to let the president increase my base salary and--
Speaker 2: The department refused to let--
Speaker 1: So they gave you an award?
Speaker 2: So--but he gave--it was a cash award.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it didn't increase my base salary.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) earthly politics.
Speaker 2: That's another picture of my working in the Program in Scholarly Research with two high school students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What is that?  That's when I got the presidential award for mentoring.  That would have been in--that is my favorite picture where I'm with the sister in law of the, what was Wade McCree? Solicitor General.
Speaker 1: Solicitor General of the United States. That's me and my grandson in the Oakland Hills of California.  That's my daughter.  I don't--we, don't we have a better one?  I don't like--we'll see.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: We'll see.
Speaker 2: This is your son, his--?
Speaker 1: That's my son and his children.  That's that Lillian R. Ford again.  She's the one in the center.  Despite the fact that she had polio, she was the director of the athletic program at her school.
Speaker 2: That's her in the center?
Speaker 1: Right, right here.  That is I and my classmates at my 25th class reunion.  That's my favorite picture of my family.
Speaker 2: The names.
Speaker 1: That was in the mid, wait, late 70s [1970s] right (unclear)?
Story_ID: 23031
Speaker 1: And this is just my family again.
Speaker 2: Okay we're ready.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got that one already.  Okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't name them though.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  So that's Jesse to the left, no--yeah, Jesse to the left, William in the middle and Carol on the end.
Speaker 1: And you and your wife?
Speaker 2: Yeah, me and Addie Bell on the top.  And that's my brothers and sister and I in Newark, New Jersey on our summer vacation.  What strikes me about this picture is how--what a big smile I have.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're right--?
Speaker 2: I'm to the far right up top.  That's Addie Bell and me in 1968, just before we went to Manitoba.  That's Addie Bell in high school.  She was a majorette.  So that is I at the ceremony which McBay got the James Flack Norris Award, the award that I got in 2000.  So that's I in the middle and that's a very famous black chemist and businessman, Henry Hill, who was also president of the American Chemical Society.  I don't know who the gentleman is on the far right there if that's how we want to call it.  And that is I and my classmate, David Satcher here at the University of Michigan, around the year 2000 when he came to be a speaker in the graduation ceremonies.
Speaker 1: We have McBay here.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is a great one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So this is a poster that accompanied McBay's appointment as the first Martin Luther King, Jr. visiting scholar and there was a symposium in which former students of his gave papers as listed on the side there.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was 1991.
