Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is--I like neckbones (laughs), cornbread, greens, you know, collards, turnips, the Southern soul food.  I'm a Southerner so I like Southern foods.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: You know what, I'm trying to find that out.  I really don't know what my favorite color is.  I think I like greens and pastel colors, pinks and canary yellows and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I like summer.  I like summer and spring.  Those are my favorite times of the year.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: My favorite vacation destination is my home.  When I want a vacation, I stay home.  I really enjoy my home.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: My favorite saying is--(pauses) no, not really.  It depends on--it depends on the situation.  I--I'm always saying, "A dream without a plan is only a wish."  You have to--in any of your plannings, you have to--in your dreams rather, you need a plan, so I think I say that.  And "If it is to be, it is up to me, for I believe in me."  I strongly, strongly believe that self-belief is the key to success.  So those are the things that I say to myself most of the time.
Story_ID: 20194
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about your parents?  Could you give us their names and spell them for us and tell us where they came from?
Speaker 2: My mom's name was Willie White.  Willie Brown is her maiden name.  And she was born and reared in Centreville, Mississippi.  My dad's name was Johnny White, and he was born in Louise, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Did they pass along any, any family stories about the origins of family--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) My parents--I was abandoned by my father at birth and my mother at three days of age.  And I was reared by my grandparents [Louis and Edna Brown].  I knew my parents, but I never spent time with them.  My mother passed when I was twelve and my father passed when I was fifteen.  So I know very little about my parents other than I knew who my parents were.
Speaker 1: So you were raised by your grandmother?
Speaker 2: I was reared by my grandparents.  My maternal grandfather [Louis Brown] and--he had just married--in fact, the year that I was born he remarried.  And they had--they married in December and I was born the end of December.  So they was the newlywed with the first grandchild.
Speaker 1: That was an interesting situation.  So the family didn't talk about, you know, where they--where the origin of the family was or where they came from (unclear) -?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The Southern families at that time--blacks did not-- my father--my grandfather--when I refer to my father, it's my grandfather--my grandfather was from Centreville-Woodville, Mississippi and there was an occurrence there where either he was about to be lynched or he was--they were in the process of lynching him and he was able to break free.  And in the process, the entire family, all of his sisters--you know, he had five sisters--all of his sisters--their family, his family, they fled in the night, which was not uncommon for blacks before the passing of the Civil Rights Bill [proposed by President John Fitzgerald Kennedy in 1963, signed into legislation by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964] back in the apartheid days of, of, of America.  So they fled.  And these are things that I'm finding out now--it's something that they never talked about.  And I know that-- speaking to my uncle, he stated that when they moved to the [Mississippi] Delta--Greenwood [Mississippi]--Money [Mississippi] is in the Delta--when they moved to the Delta, their mother died.  And my father--my grandfather's sister reared my mother and her two brothers, but they said, my dad [grandfather, Louis Brown] used to come in the night.  And they would know that he was there because when they woke up the next morning, they would, you know, find things that he had brought.  But he would always travel in the night.  And he did that for years and years and years.  And I was down visiting some relatives, and I found that my grandmother [Edna Brown], when she passed--this is my Mom's mom, that fled from Southern Mississippi up to the Delta, her brothers, they didn't know where she was.  And, you know, back in those days, you got information by traveling because because of segregation, everybody knew everybody and people settled in certain areas.  So they told my grandmama's brother that she had passed.  And no one saw her.  When they fled Mississippi, they didn't know--when the fled to southern Mississippi, they didn't know where they were or where they had relocated to.  And she had been dead about five years when her family found out about it.  And nobody talks about it, even now.  Well, most of the people who, who are alive, they know very little.  Now, my grandfather's mother, from based upon what they said, there were two sisters that was dropped off in Centreville, Mississippi.  And apparently they were plantation owners' daughters because they were, they were--they looked-- they're white.  They had blue eyes and they were white, and they were two sisters.  And no one knew anything about them.  And so my surmise is that they were slave owners' daughters, and when they--when they freed the slaves, the plantation owner probably--they were their children so they freed them.  And they came to Centreville, Mississippi.  And this is where they got married.  And no one knows anything about them other than they just appeared, two sisters appeared in Centreville, Mississippi one day.
Speaker 1: That's all, yeah, that's mysterious.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's very--well, I do know that because of my skin color, because of my eyes that there's a mixture of, of French.  And so coming from Woodville, Mississippi, Centreville, Mississippi, that's on the Louisiana Bayou, so it's Bayou country.  It's Cajun country.  So I do know that there is a-- there's French and black involved in there, but where I can't say because I can't trace the history.  And I cannot trace the history on my father's side simply because my--his mom, she had two sets of children, and they were all by different people.  And White is my grandmother's--my, my father's mother's maiden name.  And so she was not married.  And so I can't trace that side of the family either.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, could you talk about--so you didn't--well, you didn't have much contact with your father [Johnny White] and mother [Willie White] then?
Speaker 2: I had contact with them.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I had contact with them.  I just couldn't stay with them.  I, you know, my grandparents would not allow me to, to spend the night with them, but I knew my, my mother and father.  I knew them well.
Story_ID: 20195
Speaker 1: What was your grandfather like and (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: My grandfather [Louis Brown] was a man of very few words.  He was a disciplinarian.  He's very quiet.  You never knew where he was coming from until it was too late.  And he was a man who gave you choices in life.  As a child, he took me to the cotton fields--although I lived in the township of Greenwood, Mississippi, he would take me to the cotton fields.  He never allowed me to work for whites.  At that time, the only work for blacks was domestic work and working in the homes of white families, taking care of their children, cleaning their house, washing their clothes.  I had no encounters with whites whatsoever throughout my entire life, other than when you would go downtown to, you know, to shop.  But as far as encounters with them, I did not have that until I made the [U.S.] Olympic team in 1956.  And I--and now, as I grow older, and I start finding out things about my grandfather, I can understand because my grandfather had a very short temper.  I, too, am the same way. And I think through my father's--my grandfather's eyes, he saw me in him.  And he knew that it was trouble, and he just would never allow me to have any encounters with whites.  I didn't find out about the, the ugliness of Mississippi until 1955 when Emmett Till was killed in my hometown [Money, Mississippi].  And when I went to [Melbourne] Australia the next year in '56 [1956], then I was able to really understand what was going on in the South because I was shield from it, my, my parents shielded it from me.  I--although they, they would  burn crosses at night, you know.  Any night of the week would be like the Fourth of July because they would be burning crosses all up and down the street.  But these were things--in those days, your parents, they didn't discuss unkind things to you.  And so I found all these things out after I left Mississippi and later on in life.
Story_ID: 20196
Speaker 1: Now, you were born in Money, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: I was born in Money, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then you were raised in Greenwood [Mississippi].
Speaker 2: I was reared in Greenwood, yes.
Speaker 1: Right, and so, can you tell us about the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in Greenwood, Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a very happy childhood, and my parents--my, my grandparents [Louis and Edna Brown] gave me all the, the necessities.  They gave me a home to live in.  They gave me food and shelter.  And they were not affectionate people.  They were people who--I had to go to church.  And my grandparents were my heroes and she-roes.  They were my role models.  You couldn't do anything unless you went to church.  If you didn't go to church on Sunday, you did nothing.  And my father--my grandfather, he sent me to the cotton fields to show me that if I didn't get an education, I would spend the rest of my life in the Mississippi Delta cotton fields chopping or picking cotton for two dollars a day, less than twenty-five cents an hour.  And I couldn't pick a hundred pounds of cotton.  So I wasn't going to the cotton fields for the money.  My dad [grandfather, Louis Brown] gave me the worst of situations, to show me that I had choices.  I could get pregnant and end up in Mississippi.  I could get off into--we didn't have drugs at that time, we had alcohol, which is now considered a drug--or I could get an education and I could leave Mississippi.  So he gave me the worst of situations.  And I could not wait--could not wait to, to graduate from high school because this--the, the message that was stated that once you graduated from high school, you are on your own.  So it was up to you to figure out, you know, to get an education so that you could leave, leave Mississippi.  And they were very, very strict on me.  And the only way that I could get out of the house was to be involved in athletics.  So I started running track--not necessarily athletics, but to be involved in school activities.  And I started running varsity track when I was ten.  I started playing varsity basketball when I was twelve.  And I was in the marching band when I was thirteen.  And I found ways and means to get out of the house.  And then I found that all I had to do to get from home was to be involved in some positive activities.  And my parents supported me.  So--and I was, I was an outcast because my parents were unlettered.  They were, you know, illiterate.  They couldn't read nor write.
Story_ID: 20197
Speaker 1: And with me, with the mariny hair--in the black community, there is a color caste.  And the color caste is that if you, you were light with the long pretty hair, then you're acceptable.  But then if you're light with the short, kinky hair and--you're not.  And I was wild--I was buck wild, wild weeds, and very unattractive. Parents wouldn't--the neighbors wouldn't allow me to play with their children.  And I was just an outcast.  And my mom [grandmother, Edna Brown] used to tell me, you know, not to, not to worry about other people and not to judge other people.  So then when I got into athletics, I found that I had a talent and an ability that no one could take away from me.  And so I, at that early age, this is when I started saying, "If it is to be, it is up to me,  for I believe in me."  And it was up to me to, to determine my destiny.  "A dream without a plan is only a wish."  So I had a plan and that was to get out of Mississippi.  So when I started running at ten, varsity track, I beat all the high school girls.  And I won the high school state championships from age thirteen until I graduated from high school [Broad Street High School, Greenwood, Mississippi].  And at age sixteen, I was invited to Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] 'cause I was the best in the state of Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, we don't want to get too far.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Okay.
Speaker 2: I want to go back a little bit to childhood.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And let's talk about--so, what is a mariny and how do you spell that?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh, the mariny--don't ask me how to spell it.  You know, the mariny, you know, the red, I'm red, [gesturing to her head] and, you know, when, when I was younger, my hair was the color it is now and just--and they call it mariny, you know.  You just didn't fit, you know, it's just red, and just mariny-looking.  Just a funny-looking person, with this red hair and these green eyes and--,
Speaker 2: I've heard that before.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yes, that's a Southern, that's a Southern-,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, from the South.
Speaker 1: That's a Southern term.
Speaker 2: People don't use it anymore.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no.  You know, you don't fit.  You're not--you're not yellow.  I was red and I've got this peach fur running down the side of my face and, you know, just a mariny-looking color--an unusual, an unusual looking color.  And at that time, braids were not fashionable.  My grandparents--my grandmother [Edna Brown] had nine thousand little braids on top of my head.
Story_ID: 20198
Speaker 1: And I'm wearing high-top shoes with overalls and playing Cowboys and Indians with the boys.  So I was considered a tomboy.  And that was not fashionable in those days because little girls did not play Cowboys and Indians and walk around in overalls and high-top shoes.  You know, they had the patent leather shoes and the, the beautiful dresses with the big bows in the hair and all of that, so I was just a misfit.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean were most of the girls dressing like that and acting like that?
Speaker 1: Oh, sure, oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  I mean these are Southerners.  I mean, you , you didn't wear pants, you dressed.  You took your Sunday manners--when you left home, you took your Sunday manners.  You didn't wear blue jeans and, and, and overalls and things like that.  And when you--when you went out, you may not have had the, the boy may not have had but one shirt or, or one pair of pants, but they were starched and ironed.  And when you went out, you were making a statement because  during segregation--the beauty of segregation is that you had a, you had a community and everybody worked together.  And you represented your people, your community, your school, your church.  And it was important that you were able to go anywhere in the world and stand next to kings and queens and presidents because you knew how to act.  You were taught how to eat correctly and, and how to be polite. Listen--you were to listen and you were to be seen and not heard.  And so those were just Southern customs.
Story_ID: 20199
Speaker 1: I was a very sensitive child, but I was very strong-willed.  And I was a tomboy.  I had my own mind.  I knew what I wanted to do.  I was not a follower, and then I wasn't a leader.  I was just my own person.
Speaker 2: That doesn't sound bad (unclear).
Speaker 1: No, now it isn't, but see, as a child, I just didn't fit.  I, I was in a dysfunctional environment and I didn't fit.  And I tried to fit.  And it has taken me almost sixty years to realize that I stand alone.  So now I, I accept it.
Speaker 2: Okay, (unclear).  In what ways did you try to fit in?
Speaker 1: I, I just wanted, you know, friends, and I wanted to play with the other little girls and visit them, but their parents didn't want me to do that.  So my grandmother [Edna Brown], she was very protective of me.  And I guess--I didn't have a lot of friends because if they--if I couldn't come to their house, then they couldn't come to my house.  So I had maybe one or two friends, you know, but none that--where you slept over or, or things like that.  So I was basically a loner.  And later on my sisters [Hester White] and brothers [Eddie White and Wade White] start--came to live with us because when my mom [Willie White] died, my brother [Wade] was two months old.
Story_ID: 20200
Speaker 1: My mother [Willie White] gave all of her children away--all of her children were reared by someone else.  So there were four of us.  And my grandparents ended up with three of us, and then my, my older brother [Eddie White]--who is younger than I, but older brother of the two boys--he was reared by his father's parents.
Speaker 2: Is there a reason why she did this or was it--I guess it's a two-part question.  Was there a reason why she gave her children up?  And was there a reason why people accepted them, you know?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, in those days--well, when my father [Johnny White], my father left my mom [Willie White] when I was born because he looked at me and said I wasn't his.  I mean, but you can imagine a man of dark complexion and here's this little rat-looking, mariny red thing with these blue eyes and blonde peach fur for hair.  He said, "Nah, that's not my child,"  and he walked away.  But he came back into my life when I was ten.  And he told me that he had made a big mistake because I, I am my father's child.  And during the little time that I had with him, he would always tell me, "You are my child."  And my mom--I--this is what is missing when you don't--when you don't know your parents to, to--and I tried to find out, you know, what kind of person was my mom?  And they would all say she was sweet.  She was--but I tend to believe that she was a loner herself and she would--she and I are a lot alike in, in our own way.  And we didn't have a lot of friends,  we didn't associate with a lot of people.  And so with me being the first and my father acting the way that he did, and my grandfather [Louis Brown] being the way that he was--and he came and got his granddaughter and his daughter.  So then when my mom--when I was older, my parents wouldn't allow me to go--my grandparents would not allow me to go with her.  So it wasn't a choice.  And see, like today, if, if  grandparent--well, yesterday, if the mother and father said, "You don't do this," although you are an adult, you did not do it.  And there was no such thing as adopting.  They said, you know, "You can leave, but this child stays."  And there was no question about it.  So there were no questions asked.  And then my sister [Hester White]--she had my sister who was by my father.  And she ended up staying with a cousin of ours.  And then my brother--she moved to Memphis [Tennessee] and she met my--the third child, which is my brother [Eddie]--and she and this gentleman, they were together, and they had my brother.  And he ended up staying with his father's parents.  And then my baby brother [Wade White], he was two months old when my mom died, so I can't tell you.  And then with him being two months old, I asked my grandparents, would they just take care of him until I was able--old enough to, to support him.  And they did.
Story_ID: 20201
Speaker 1: So, when you started school, I mean--Did you take to school well, I mean, did you like school?
Speaker 2: I liked school.  I was slow.  I retained a grade because I didn't have the basics.  I didn't have the basics of reading and writing and arithmetic and things like that, simply because my grandparents were, you know, they were not lettered.  So I, I suffered there.  What it took an average child, you know, a week to do, to learn, it took me a month or months or longer.  So that affected me even, you know, throughout my adult life, you know, being--because you--I did not have that basic educational foundation.  But the thing that really helped me was my travels.  Traveling is, is truly one of the greatest educational tools that a person can, can encounter.  So with my traveling, I was able to learn, and then I could--was able to go back and read and, and get a better understanding.  So my education--I have a worldly education.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you mean your travels after you started competing and that sort of thing or--,
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Once I got into athletics, then I started traveling, meaning going with the, with the track team throughout Mississippi and with the basketball team throughout Mississippi.  I was able to see, you know, all of Mississippi and then once I left when I was sixteen and still in high school [Broad Street High School, Greenwood, Mississippi], then I got a chance to start seeing the world.
Speaker 1: Okay, were you happy before you started participating in athletics in school?
Speaker 2: I was happy, but I was trying to find a way to get from under my, my grandfather [Louis Brown] because of his strictness.  He was so strict.  And I wanted to, you know, get out in the street with the other children and I couldn't do that.  I could play in front of the house, but I couldn't venture off.  You know,  I could ride my bicycle all over town, but I had to be home before the sun went down.  We didn't have street lights.  So my dad said, "Do not let me catch you out this house when the sun goes down."  So it's the same thing as street lights.  So I was as happy as I knew to be.  I mean, I wasn't--I mean, you know, I was happy.  I enjoyed, I enjoyed my, my  childhood.  I mean, I had a ball.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what were the things that you did that were fun to do?  What did you do that was fun?
Speaker 2: Well, I just, I just enjoyed life, you know. I was always living on the edge, you know, just, just what teenagers do--did rather.  And I just enjoyed myself.  You know I said, I was, I was a drum majorette, I was, I, I was a star track athlete.  I was a star basketball player.  I was a drum majorette.  I was in the glee club.  I did all those things.  I did all the things that high school--what, what teenagers should do.  And it was just wonderful.  I had a wonderful childhood.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you have any teachers in high school that were particularly important in terms of your growth and development?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I--there were, there were five people.  My first track coach, the principal of the high school, and my first physical ed [education] instructor, and the English teacher and a math teacher.  I mean, they were the ones to really mold me into what I am today because they--you do not judge a child by their, their outside appearance, but by the content of their heart and their soul.  And these were people who embraced me-- who accepted me for what I was and who I was.  And they just accepted me. And they just took this little wild stinkweed and, and cultivated it into a beautiful person.
Story_ID: 20202
Speaker 1: You're awful hard on yourself in terms of your descriptions of yourself, you know, you don't--I don't think you--I don't know.  It's hard for me to believe that you were--.
Speaker 2: Well, see, it appears hard to you because you're listening, but see you're not inside and you did not have to encounter the things that I encountered.  And, and the obstacles that were thrown in the--I didn't have obstacles,  I had boulders that were thrown in my path. But it was because of my grandparents [Edna and Louis Brown] and my, my spiritual upbringing that I could walk around those obstacles and not--if you, if--had it not been for my parents [grandparents], had I not been in athletics, my life would have been totally different.  It would have been different in a negative way because through athletics, you're exposed to all that constitute life: pain, fear, joy, disappointment, success and failure.  Those are the, the elements that make up life.  And just because I made a mistake over here, it doesn't mean that that's the end of the world.  And all you have to do is just go back and--to the practice arena or looking in--within yourself.  When something goes wrong that I don't understand, the first thing that I do is assess myself to find out if it's me.  And if it's--if it's not me, then I deal with it.  If it's me, I deal with it, but you deal with it in a different way, you know.  No, I'm not hard on myself.  I really love me.  It took me a long time.  I'm a very complex person.  It took me a very long time to understand that--because, see, I had no standards.  I didn't have--you get your standards from your parents.  I had no standards because my parents [Willie and Johnny White] were all deceased.  And so I couldn't say, "Why am I sensitive?  Why am I a very determined person?  Why am I very competitive?"  You know?  And then I couldn't--I can't tell you those things because--they say you're products of your environment.  This is true, but you also--you're made up of two genes, your mother's and your father's.  And I don't know who I am, you know.  Am I more like my father?  Am I more like my mother?  What part of me is my father?  What part of me is my mother?  You know, it's the picture--the, the picture in the mirror.  You look in the mirror and you see, you see yourself.  Or you look in the mirror--I can't tell who I see. I can't say if I'm seeing my father or my mother.
Story_ID: 20203
Speaker 1: How did you get involved in athletics in school?
Speaker 2: When I was--
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the school anyway?
Speaker 2: My elementary school was McLaurin [Elementary School, Greenwood, Mississippi].  My junior high school was Stone Street [School, Greenwood, Mississippi] and my high school was Broad Street [High School, Greenwood, Mississippi].  At age ten, my cousin came by--I was playing on the street, playing on the corner.  And I said, "Where you going?"  She said, "I'm going out to the high school to try out for the track team."  I said, "Okay."  And she said, "Why don't you come with us?"  So then I ran home and asked my mom [grandmother Edna Brown] because at that time, the high school was in, in my backyard.  So I said, "Mom, is it okay if I go with my cousin, Viola, to try out for the track team?"  So she said, "Sure, yes, yeah."  And so I went and I beat everyone.  And everything was history. After that I became a part of the--see, that's, that's the beauty of living in the South and the beauty of segregation in that if you had talent, the whole community surrounded you and tried to make certain that, that you developed.  Whereas, now you're ten years old, "If you're ten years old, you shouldn't be running with the high school children, the dah, dah, dah."  But they were interested in giving you exposure, quality exposure, positive exposure.  And so I started running at age ten, and everything just marooned after that.
Speaker 1: So you ran on the high school track team --
Speaker 2: Yes, varsity, yes.
Speaker 1: --even though you were ten --
Speaker 2: In elementary school, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --only in fifth grade?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And I played for the high school basketball team when I was in junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was just that good (laughs).
Story_ID: 20204
Speaker 1: Now, in the summers, I don't know when this started, but in the summers, I know you went to Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Okay, when I was sixteen, at that time there were two universities in America that gave work aid to girls in track and field and that was, there were two ebony-based universities.  And that was Tennessee State and Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  And so it was like a farm program.  They would bring all of the Southern girls from all over the South.  Tuskegee would take those, and then Tennessee State and you would run for the summer.  And if you, you know, they would work with you until you graduated from high school.  And then you would come into their program.  And so I went to Tennessee State.  I chose Tennessee State because it was farthest away from home [Greenwood, Mississippi].  So I went to Tennessee State, and that was in 1956, Wilma Rudolph [who won three gold medals in the 1960 Olympics], we were all in high school.  And that was, that was the year of the Olympic Games.  And when I got there, the only thing that I knew was I got there May 28th and I was missing all of the cotton.  I didn't have to go to the cotton fields.  That's what I was so happy about.  So when I got there, they were telling us about the Olympic Games, which were gonna be held in November in Melbourne, Australia.  And I said, "Wow, if I make the Olympic team, that means I don't have to go home, all the cotton will be gone when I go home now"--not even knowing what the Olympic Games was all about, had no idea, no clue.  The only thing I knew was that if I made the Olympic team, then I wouldn't have to go to the cotton fields because I would not get home until after Thanksgiving.  And all the cotton is gone.  That was, that, that--those were my thoughts.  And the trials were held in August, which meant that I would miss the cotton the entire summer.  So they had said, "Oh, Willye, you can't make the Olympic team," and--but, see, they didn't know that I had a mission.  And my mission was that I didn't want to go back to the cotton fields (laughs).  And so I trained and I made the Olympic team.  I made--in fact, I jumped Junior Day, I qualified for the Olympic team.  And I had six jumps, and all my jumps surpassed the Olympic qualifying standards Junior Day; came back Senior Day, I did the same thing.  So the coach was not taking me to the Olympic trials.  But after I surpassed the Olympic trials standards, two days in a row, he took me to the Olympic trials, which were held in Washington, D.C. at that time.
Speaker 1: Who was the coach?
Speaker 2: Ed Temple.
Story_ID: 20205
Speaker 1: Tell me something about Herb Temple--
Speaker 2: [Edward] Ed Temple [her coach at Tennessee State University]?
Speaker 1: Ed Temple, Ed Temple.
Speaker 2: He was a man who brought in the world's greatest talent and pitted it against each other.  And when you do that, you get good results.
Speaker 1: As simple as that, huh?
Speaker 2: Simple as that.
Speaker 1: Okay, you don't, you don't want to share anything else with us about him?
Speaker 2: There's really not too much that I can tell you about him, that's--that I would like to put it on tape, you know--no.  But I think one of things I would like to say is that he made me--the reason, I am--he is the reason why that I made five Olympic teams in that he told my father [Louis Brown] that I was nothing without him and Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And I was kicked out of college.  I was, I started school--I ran for Tennessee State four years, my freshman year through my senior year [of high school, 1956-1959].  I came in.  I was--I only stayed six months and he kicked me off the team for the winter quarter [March 1960].  And I didn't come back; I came to Chicago [Illinois], and my mission was to make certain that I made his life miserable.  And (laughs) so.
Story_ID: 20206
Speaker 1: Now, let me backtrack to Washington, D.C., the trials, you're on the verge of Olympic trials in D.C. [1956] and what did you--were you impressed with Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the capital.  You know, I was impressed because I'd never been out of the state of Mississippi.  And here I am, we ran--the Junior Meet was held in [University of Pennsylvania's] Franklin Field in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  So we drove to Philadelphia, and I'd never lived in a hotel.  I've never, I'd never eaten in a, in a restaurant, you know, and, it was an experience.  So I went to Philadelphia, and then from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. and we were living in this hotel.  And we ate in these beautiful restaurants--well, they were cafeterias, but still they were beautiful.  And on the road, the only place that blacks--once we crossed the Mason-Dixon line--the only places before we could eat was in train stations.  And everybody knew everybody.  The big train stations--our first stop, leaving Nashville [Tennessee] was Cincinnati [Ohio], the train station.  And we were going east.  And that's where we would stop; and there were no hotels blacks could, could--there were no hotels for blacks.  If you, if you were in a city where there was a Y, YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], then you could, you could get a room there.  Other than that, you drove all night.  There were always two or three drivers, and they drove all night because there was no place to stay.  Then this is--one of the hotel chains, the restaurant chains that I really like is Howard Johnson because Howard Johnson was one of the first restaurants that integrated.  And we would--we, we knew all the Howard Johnson's, all up and down the turnpike because we could go there to eat.
Speaker 1: Okay, what happened in D.C.? I mean was there any drama or did you just beat everybody flat out?
Speaker 2: No, I got second because of my teammate, my teammate who was older, and she was a sophomore in college.  My first jump, I qualified for the Olympic team.  They take three.  You have to meet Olympic standards.  So my first jump, I met the Olympic standards.  I surpassed the Olympic standards.  I made the Olympic team.  And then she came behind me and jumped farther.  Then we both went on to, to Melbourne, Australia.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Margaret Matthews Wilburn.
Story_ID: 20207
Speaker 1: So that's in August [1956], I guess, the trials?
Speaker 2: That's in August, the [Olympic] trials were August, yes.
Speaker 1: And so did you go back to Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yes, I came, we came from--we went back to Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee], and, in fact, there's a picture in there of--we went back to Tennessee State, you know, met with the president [of Tennessee State University], the press and all of that.  And then I went home [Greenwood, Mississippi] because I had to come back for training in September.
Speaker 1: Now, wait a minute.  We're speeding past and meeting with the president and the press.
Speaker 2: The president of the school.
Speaker 1: The president of school, okay, oh.
Speaker 2: President of Tennessee State University [Walter S. Davis].  So then we met, and then I went home, and, you know, because I had to enroll in school.  So I started school, and I left the end of September because I had to go back to Tennessee State where we trained.  And then we went to training camp which was held in Los Angeles, California.  And we were there a month. And then we flew to--we left there and went to Melbourne, Australia--thirty-seven hours of flying time, not stopping, just flying time.
Story_ID: 20208
Speaker 1: At the time [1956], did you know anything about Australia at all?
Speaker 2: I never, knew nothing about Australia, didn't even know where it was, you know; got it, you know--looked at a map.  And I never thought I was gonna get home [Greenwood, Mississippi] because when you wake up, you were over water, and when you went to sleep, you were over water.  And when you land, you land in water.  And, you know, I just, I never thought I would get home again.  And then I was amazed when I got there to find that there were two worlds, Mississippi and the rest of the world, and where blacks and whites, they--you know, they, they were friends.  They touched.  They, you could--they were your roommates.  And you, you, you cried with them; you hugged them, you know, and it was just--and that's when I decided that I wanted to see the entire world.  And, and that's when I, I felt sorry for, for Mississippi.  I didn't know anything about Georgia and the rest of the country.  I just felt sorry for Mississippi and Tennessee because those were the, the two Southern cities that I had been in.  I just felt sorry for those people who were so ignorant that they had never left.  And they didn't know that people really shared, you know, they, they could be friends and that it wasn't--you know, the color of your skin shouldn't make a difference.  And that's when I learned not to judge a group of people by one person, you know.  Each person, each situation is different, and you judge each situation differently.  And I decided I wanted to see the world and all I had to do was stay in shape and I could see the world.  And that's what I did.
Story_ID: 20209
Speaker 1: Okay, now, speaking of staying in shape, what did you do to get ready for the Olympics?  What kind of training regimen were you on?  What would be your daily--
Speaker 2: Training three times a day, 360 days out of the year.
Speaker 1: Well, what would you do to train?  I mean what would you actually do?
Speaker 2: Well, from, from September to November, I'd run cross country, five miles in the woods, in the hills, up mountains, wherever.  And I didn't start lifting weights until I was twenty-five.  So I would run cross country.  And then November, you'd come in and you'd start training for indoor season.  And you ran indoor season, I would work out at the Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association], you know, during the--
Speaker 1: But I'm talking about getting ready for the '56 [1956] Olympics.  What was your training and what (unclear) --
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, well, I was at Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  We trained three times a day.  We trained at five o'clock in the morning, ten o'clock at the morning, and three o'clock in the afternoon.  I trained three times a day from May 28th until August 1st, five days a week, six days a week in most cases.
Speaker 1: And what would that consist of?  I mean where would you run?
Speaker 2: In the morning, it consisted of running up and down those mountains in Tennessee, about a mile.  And then you would come on the track, and you would do three hundreds [meter races], 150s [meter races], sprints, starts, jumps, you know; and relay races--relay, baton passes and all that.  So, it, you know, it depended on the coach, and he would break it up.  And this is why it's interesting when you hear about athletes now, especially when the young man [football player, Rashidi Wheeler] died up at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] two years ago.  And they said that he was out--it was too hot, and they shouldn't be out in the heat and, and I just laughed because we were out in the heat.  It was so hot, it was so hot, you know, you just--you couldn't wear--walk on the bare ground with your, you know, without shoes because it was so hot it would blister our feet.  And here we were out there running and training and out in the cotton field, and you couldn't drink water at that time.  They said, you know, "You should not drink water; water is not good for you."  And so we were out there all day with no water.  And it's really amazing, but then we didn't have--everybody didn't live in air conditioning.  So we didn't have air conditioning, and we didn't have air conditioned rooms.  So our body was accustomed to it.  And so it really, it really interests me now when I hear newscasters and lay people saying that, you know, there was, this lady was, this mother [Linda Will] was suing Northwestern because she said, "My son should not have been out there training in the heat of the day."  But you train in the heat of the day.  The only people that the heat affects are those lay people who spend 99 percent of their time in air conditioning.
Story_ID: 20210
Speaker 1: It's an awful lot of hard work.  You know, this is why I said that--track and field especially--but athletics, no one can give you the kind of pain that you inflict upon yourself, trying to get to that mountaintop.  So often, every now and then an issue comes up with young athletes participating in sports.  Like now, they're talking about the little gymnasts and the little skaters because they feel that the parents are, are pushing them because--but to be a world class athlete--first of all, to be a world-class athlete, you are a unique person anyway.  You're not a part of the norm.  You're a very unique person.  Nobody is gonna force you to get out of bed at five o'clock in the morning; no one is gonna force you to perform when you're injured.  And this is, this is inbred, this is inborn.  This is within you.  This is--these are the--this is the, this when you can tell that you really have a child that, that, that's gonna be a star or gonna be successful in whatever they're doing because you can't force a child to get out of bed at five or six o'clock, four o'clock in the morning or three o'clock in the morning to go swimming or to go falling off a beam or to go running track, and there's nobody out on the track but you.  And you're not gonna force a child to spend eight or nine hours a day training.  That child is unique.  And when you get a unique child, then that's the child that you--you follow that child.  You--the only thing that you ask of that child is, is, whatever you do, you commit to it.  I received a call last week from the [Chicago] Sun-Times [newspaper] in reference to [professional golfer] Tiger Woods and the Williams sisters [tennis professionals Serena and Venus]; and they feel that their father [Earl Woods and Richard Williams] pushed them.  And I said, their father did not.  I said, the father could not make Tiger go out at three or four years old with a golf club to hit golf balls and say, "Daddy, let's go hit golf balls."  I've known the Williams girls since they were six and seven years old.  They grew up in Compton [suburb of Los Angeles, California].  And their father had the insight to say, "Well, I want to do something with my children to keep them out of the street."  So what did he do?  He took them to the tennis court, and he taught them the basics for tennis.  And he stayed with them, and he played with them.  And it wasn't something that he forced them to do, and now, they're good.  And so you--when you--if you're gonna get a, a world-class athlete, you must start young.  You start very young because that's when you set the pattern.  That's when you set the work ethics, at a very early age.
Speaker 2: Okay, but it has to come from the--.
Speaker 1: It's comes from within.  And that's that very unique person.  I can walk out, and I can see a child, I can see children out playing.  There may be children with, with, with talent that's twenty times greater than, than one, than, than some of the other people that are out there, but that child with the less talent, works the hardest.  And that's the child, that's a unique child.  And that's the child that, that--you don't have to wake up and say, "It's time to go to practice."  That child is up and dressed and ready to go to practice at four o'clock and five o'clock in the morning.  I mean when I'm out--when I was out there running around the track, the, the guys that I dated and my, my friends, they couldn't understand.  "Why are you up here at five and six o'clock in the morning?  Why are you running at five o'clock in the morning?  Every morning at five o'clock, you're out on the track."  Well, it's what I wanted to do.  I wanted to be the best and to be the best, I had to give the best.  And so that's what I did.
Story_ID: 20211
Speaker 1: You're in Melbourne [Australia] in November, 1956, you know, who were--tell us about what it was like to meet all the other athletes?
Speaker 2: It was amazing because when I got there, that's when I found out there were two worlds, Mississippi and the rest of the world.  And I saw that blacks and whites, they stayed together, you know; we, we shared rooms together.  We ate together.  We laughed together.  We danced together, you know.  And I just said, wow.  And then I found out people who spoke different languages and they had uniforms on.  I never had a uniform before, you know.  And it was just interesting.  And I used to just go out on the track and just watch them train.  And that's how I learned how to--my training techniques.  So it was, it was just priceless, it was just priceless.  The education was just priceless.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what happened on the day that you competed for the medal?
Speaker 2: Well, when I went there, when I went to the Olympic Games, I just felt that I had trained hard and that they were no better than I.  And I felt that my chances were just as good as theirs.  So I [long] jumped, and I was in first.  And well, you have to qualify.  You have to meet the Olympic standards to get into competition.  So I met the Olympic standards.  And then I got into competition.  And you get three jumps to, to meet the standards, and then you get three more jumps to get into the final, the top twelve.  And so I made into the top twelve, not knowing what I'm jumping, not knowing what I'm doing, just ignorant, you know.  So anyway, they came and told me that I was in first place.  And so I was in first place up until the young lady [Elzbieta Krzesinska] from Ger---from Poland, she beat me on her last jump.  But she was also the Olympic champion in 1952 [sic, 1960].  So she had been there before.  And it was just, it was just another day at a track meet for me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, well, it certainly had to be special in some way.
Speaker 2: But see you must realize that the specialty for me was not being in the cotton field in Mississippi.  That was the most thrilling and exciting thing for me.  I mean I didn't know what I had accomplished.  I had no idea.  The only thing I knew was that I was not in the cotton fields in Mississippi.  That was it.  You know, I knew nothing about the Olympic Games, being the second best in the world.  I didn't know that.
Story_ID: 20212
Speaker 1: Were you disappointed at not winning?
Speaker 2: No, well, when you get to the Olympic Games--let me share something with you about the Olympic Games.  The hardest thing in the world to do is to make an Olympic team.  That's the hardest thing to do.  The second hardest thing to do is to get in the top twelve.  And the third hardest thing to do is to get a medal.  Now, when you make--the hardest thing, when you make the Olympic team--you've made the Olympic team.  And then everything else is a bonus.  And then, when you get there, you just said, "Oh, God, please, let me make into competition."  So then, and you say, "Oh, God, please, just let me get a medal."  You don't care what color it is.  It's the lay person, it's corporate America who pushes gold, gold, gold, gold.  And the sadness of it is to be, to compete against--you know, you got seven thousand people there.  And in your competition, you may have eight hundred people from all over the world.  And you're competing with these people.  And just to be able to represent your country out of--what? Twenty million people or whatever, to represent your country.  And then you--because you don't win, then, you know, it, it, it--you're nothing or you won a Silver Medal.  I mean the Silver Medal don't count.  You must win Gold, but the sadness of it, and this is why you have so many athletes that are destroying their lives using drugs because of the, the pressure that lay society put on our athletes to be the, to be winners.  You know, what about doing your best?  What about giving 100 percent?  There's always someone that's better, but the question you ask yourself--and this is what I tell children that I work with--did you give your best?  Did you give 100 percent?  If they said, yes, then you are a winner.  But no, the American way is to win at all costs and it is costing the lives of our young people.
Story_ID: 20213
Speaker 1: So what was it like climbing up on the, there's a--what do they call that--
Speaker 2: The podium, podium [at the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne, Australia].  Oh, it was a wonderful feeling, you know, it was a wonderful feeling.  It was a wonderful feeling that I was, I was supposed to be there.  You know, I was, I was supposed to be there.
Speaker 1: Were you really aware of, were you at the time keenly aware of your times and how they ranked in the world at that time?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I knew nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had no clue.  I didn't even--before going to Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee], I didn't even know what the Olympic Games was all about.  I had no idea.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you, how did you manage to feel that you were supposed to be there?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Why not?  I had trained hard, you know.  And I just felt that I was as good as anyone else that was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And see it was, at that time, it was based on natural ability.  But then after that, it changed.
Story_ID: 20214
Speaker 1: How did it change?
Speaker 2: Well, men started competing as women.  They're called hermaphrodites.  And that's why they have a sex test.  So I lost a Gold Medal in '64 [1964], '60 [1960], '64 [1964] because I was competing against men.  And then when that, when, when they started the sex test in '65 [1965]--no, they started the sex test in '67 [1967], then all the men were eliminated, but then the drugs [anabolic steroids] came on the scene--the muscle enhancers.  And so then I had to deal with that, and at that time, America was very ignorant.  And we tried to explain to them that these athletes were not better.  They were, they just had better doctors than you did.  And so then you make the decision, "Well, do I take the drugs to be a winner or not?"  And when you look at the counter indications--but then they were not giving out million dollar bonuses.  Probably if they had been giving out million dollar bonuses, I probably would have been one of those that, that took the drugs, you know?  You never know.  But then the drug scene came on, and to the point now that it's so bad now that the NFL [National Football League] and the baseball league [Major League Baseball], now they're testing athletes.  And they're saying that so many athletes will not pass because of the drugs and things they are taking.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I--
Speaker 2: The steroids that they are taking.
Speaker 1: In the 1960 Olympics [in Rome, Italy], I remember there were some athletes that, from the Communist bloc--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, yes, yes.  They were the ones who introduced us to it--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously)--that looked different.  They didn't look like women.  I mean, you know, they were running against women, but they didn't--
Speaker 2: They were not.  They were men.
Speaker 1: They didn't look like women at all.
Speaker 2: They were men.  So there was a lot--but now, now, America is reading the newspaper and following sports and they understand.  But it was very difficult.  You know, it's very hard to come home and they say, "Ah, you know, the Russians are better than you."
Story_ID: 20215
Speaker 1: You know--but athletics was their [athletes from Communist countries] flight to freedom, freedom of movement, and there was a difference.  They competed for a different reason.  They were not competing to get out of the cotton fields.  They were competing to have a better standard of living.
Speaker 2: Well, it's similar in a sense, isn't it? That you're competing to get out of the cotton fields, and the--.
Speaker 1: Athletics was my flight to freedom, yes.
Speaker 2: And their flight to freedom was out of the Soviet Union or, or East Germany (unclear) where it's athletic.
Speaker 1: No, their, their flight to freedom was to be a winner so that they could have a better standard of living.  They could have a flat or they could have a car, and they could have, have money.  They didn't have to share--five or six people staying in one room.  So their, their plot of flight was similar to mine; my flight to freedom from Mississippi, from the biasness, from segregation, from illiteracy, from all of those things.  So I could relate very well with them, you know, what it was all about.  And they says, "Oh, they're better."  No, it's not that they're better, but their flight is different than ours.
Speaker 2: So it gives you more incentive to--
Speaker 1: Yes, it does.
Speaker 2: --succeed when you're--,
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --you know you can run away from something that's not, that you don't like (laughs).
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 20216
Speaker 1: And they [athletes from other countries] had coaches, like after--I never had a long jump coach, never.  And that was sad because sometimes, sometimes when I, I sit back and I do a reflection over my life, I reflect back over my life, it saddens me that I could have been--I am a HistoryMaker, but I could have been a HistoryMaker that would have, that no one could have surpassed.  And all I needed was a coach, an honest person to tell me that they didn't know what they were doing, but they were willing to learn.  I didn't have that.
Speaker 2: Well, didn't you have some sort of coach?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: As a long jumper?
Speaker 1: No.  I, I learned through trial and error.  I never knew what I was doing.
Speaker 2: But wasn't it--I mean when you went to track practice--I mean how did you even know what the long jump was if you didn't have some guidance--
Speaker 1: It's called visual, visionary imagery.  You, you get a photostatic picture in your mind as to what you're doing, and you watch, you watch movies.  And you watch, you read articles and look at other people.  And you try to emulate what you think the author is saying or what you think you saw.
Speaker 2: They didn't have a program for a long jumper at all?
Speaker 1: Un-uh.  America--we do not develop athletes.  We have a program.  And this is why so many of our athletes in the universities now are from foreign countries.  We just run programs.  We don't do developmental programs.
Story_ID: 20217
Speaker 1: You were saying before that you didn't have a long jump coach, and--
Speaker 2: I never had a long jump coach.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what are the techniques, the technical aspects of long jumping that a coach could correct and--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there are, two--three types of jumps.  There's a sail jump, a hitch kick jump and a hanging jump.  Hitch kick is you walk in the air, hanging is you, you hang, and the, the sail jump is you just jump and you just put your feet out and you sail.  And what happens is, your jump is determined based upon your body style.  And at the time I was competing, I was a--I came from a sail to a hang jumper, based upon my body type.  But then all the people who came out to--that I asked to help me, you know, just to look at me, they says, "Well, you know, you're jumping wrong.  You should do the hitch kick," because at that time, all the world record holders were hitch kicking.  And so I learned to hitch kick, only to find out that that was not my jump because when I got in trouble, I would revert back to the hang.  So versus taking what was natural for me and perfecting that, they didn't know how to perfect it.  So what they said, "Well, you need to do this," not knowing why I should be doing that.  So that's when I started coaching.  When I stopped running, I started coaching.  And I'll take an athlete--I don't want my athlete to run like a Wilma [Rudolph, Olympic medalist, 1960].  I don't want my athlete to jump like a Jackie Joyner-Kersee [Olympic medalist, 1984-1996].  I want my athlete to jump like they jump, what is natural for them.  And it is up to me to develop their, their--to make them technically and fundamentally sound in the style that they have.
Story_ID: 20218
Speaker 1: Okay, in 1956.  So you go back, you go back to Mississippi, to Greenwood after the Olympics.  Were people excited?
Speaker 2: Oh, most definitely.  And they gave me a parade downtown, and got my first newspaper clipping, you know.  And the town was very proud of me.
Speaker 1: So this is your first newspaper clipping?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I mean ever?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And it was for the Olympics?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: A silver medal in the Olympics and this is a big deal, and this is your first clipping?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, 'cause most people have success at the local level and they build up, but you--but, wow.  That's something.  So--
Speaker 2: Well, you've got to realize, here I am sixteen years old, high school, made the Olympic team, went to Melbourne, Australia, got second, coming out of Greenwood, Mississippi, you know, population of 16,000.  I mean that's, that's, that's big.
Speaker 1: Well, I know that's exciting, but I guess I just found it hard to believe that--and most success comes in increments.  You have, like a success at the high school level, and you make the paper.  And then you go--.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But you get your first one in the world, in world competition.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm thrown on the firing pan, the frying pan (laughs).

Speaker 1: Did it [Olympic success] do anything to ease the racial tensions in the town [Greenwood, Mississippi] at all?
Speaker 2: No, the racial tensions were the same.  I mean, you know, as they say, you knew your place.  You were on this side of the railroad track, and they were on their side of the railroad track.  But I knew that there was a difference.  I knew there was a difference, and I had made up my mind that I wanted to see the rest of the world.  And all I had to do was stay in shape and train.  And so that, that, that next year, '57 [1957], I wanted to get back to Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And I did.  And we had our National Championships in Shaker Heights, Ohio [suburb of Cleveland, Ohio].  And I went to Cleveland, [Ohio] and then I went back home.  And then in '58 [1958], they had the first International Tour, and we went to Russia, the first team that had been allowed inside of Russia, behind that cotton curtain or the Iron Curtain, since before the war [World War II].  So that was very exciting.
Story_ID: 20220
Speaker 1: Well, Wilma [Rudolph] was with me in '56 [1956] [at the Olympic Games in Melbourne, Australia].  And she was with me in 1957 [at Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], but she became pregnant in 1958.  And she didn't go to Europe with us [on the International Tour] in 1958.  So we had Margaret Matthews [Wilburn] and Lucinda Williams, Isabelle Daniels.  We had that group with us and Barbara Jones from Chicago [Illinois] who was running for Tennessee State [University] at that time.  And that was a very exciting trip because I met [actor, activist] Paul Robeson.  And he was, he was the first--I didn't know anything about Paul Robeson.  The only thing I knew, this big handsome man came up, and he was trying to get a message to his, his relatives in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  At that time, you couldn't talk, you couldn't touch in Russia, you know.  And so, he, he folded, had a note in his hand.  And he folded it up and he shook hands with one of the athletes.  And in the process, he said, you know, "Please take this and give it to my family."  And so that was--and then not knowing anything about Paul Robeson, and then I came home to find out that he was a very outstanding man, a dynamic man.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, do you think--and you may not know and I know, maybe the answer might be both sides, but was it because of pressure from the Russian government or the American government that he had to sneak you a note?
Speaker 1: That's the Russian--that was--that's Communism.  I mean, we didn't, we didn't associate with the athletes.  We were isolated.
Speaker 2: So they didn't allow their athletes to talk to you?
Speaker 1: They could talk to us on the track, you know, at, you know, during competition, we were together.  But we could not socialize together.  They did not allow you--everyone knew that you were Americans because of, your buses were different.  And you were just isolated.  That was just the--that was just the Communist way.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, but the Americans didn't tell you all that you couldn't talk to people and that sort of thing?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no.  But they couldn't--you couldn't, you know, if we, if I met someone, we had to stand a distance.  The Russians--you could not--there was no closeness because the government wouldn't allow that.
Speaker 2: Okay, so if they met you, they would stay a certain distance away from you?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, at all times, huh?
Speaker 1: Because they were afraid that, you know, they were, we were telling them something.  Or they were telling us something, and they just didn't want that, no.
Story_ID: 20221
Speaker 1: '58 [1958], I mean what--so when you're back in Greenwood [Mississippi], what's going on?  Are you becoming more and more popular in Greenwood all the time?
Speaker 2: Well, no, well, now, you know, it's a whole different--but I was the same.  And, and I was the same little wild teenager that left.  And people thought that I would change, and I didn't change.  And that disappointed some people, you know, because they thought that I had gone and I had done all these things and, you know, do you know who I am?  But I came back the same little, what, wild teenager that left, you know, still out having a good time, laughing and talking to everybody.  And the thing that really saddened me was that the educators, the society people felt that I was at a certain stature and that I shouldn't associate with people, you know, like the, the derelicts, the drunks and the, the lower standard of people.  But I, I didn't see that because the people, the, the drunks, the derelicts, they treated me with more respect than those who were the high society people because they wouldn't, they wanted--when they would see me, they wanted to buy me some food or just talk to me and, and, and I would sit, go down to the joints where they were hanging out, and I would sit on the corners and I would talk to them, you know.  And that was, that was taboo.  You don't do that, you know.  There are certain people you just don't socialize with anymore because you have moved up to a different level, a different standard.  But that's not true.  And so that created a lot of problems for me.  And then people in their minds, they said, "Oh, well, you know, she has done all this and she's gonna come back with a big head."  I didn't.  I came back the same little, wild teenager that left.
Speaker 1: Were you conscious of not coming back with a big head?
Speaker 2: Why should I have a big head?
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of people get them.  That's why--.
Speaker 2: No (with emphasis).  No, I wanted to, I just wanted to share all of my beauty and to tell, you know, to tell all my teammates and, you know, what all they could do, and just share all the beauty that I had received, no.  I mean, you know, I'm happy to get home.  I enjoyed, I enjoyed my, my, my teammates.  I enjoyed, you know, going to school, but I also looked forward to the summers because I didn't have to go to the cotton fields.  And then I could go back to Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and see some more of the world.  So I enjoyed all that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so how was your social life as a teenager?  You know, did you--.
Speaker 2: Typical teenager, I dated, you know, I dated.  I dated.  I had to be home at nine o'clock, you know, on Saturday and Sunday nights.  And I thought the whole world was out and I was at home.
Speaker 1: So your grandfather was still very strict?
Speaker 2: Oh, grandfather [Louis Brown] was very, very strict.  Grandfather was very, very strict.  So I had to be in at nine o'clock.  But I, I didn't have to be in, before, you know, before the sun went down, you know?  But he was still strict and he still had his rules.  And young men could come to visit, but they had to be home--go home at nine o'clock.  So (laughs), yeah, as long as you stayed in Dad's house, you had to do what Dad said.
Story_ID: 20222
Speaker 1: So as you approach the late '50s [1950s], there's another Olympics coming up in 1960 in Rome [Italy]--
Speaker 2: Right, um-hum.
Speaker 1: --did you always think that you would compete in that one too?
Speaker 2: I, I, that's, I left Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] because I was kicked off the team that winter quarter.
Speaker 1: Was that--are we in 1960 now?
Speaker 2: We're in 1960, yeah, I went in September of--and I was kicked off the team for the winter quarter.
Speaker 1: Now, why were you kicked off the team?
Speaker 2: Well, because Mr. [Edward] Temple said that I had to conform to his, his, his rules and regulations and how he saw things should be.  I was too independent.  And then I had to conform.  But see there's a difference.  I guess, I could afford to go to school.  My father [Johnny White] had passed and he was a disabled veteran, so I could afford to go to school.  And I did not--my grandparents [Louis and Edna Brown] started saving for an education for me when they got me as a, as a three-day old child.  And I did not have to--I wasn't threatened, whereas most of the athletes there, they were from a family ten, twelve and 'Skeeter' was from--Wilma [Rudolph] was from a family of twenty-two.  So if, if they didn't get an education, you know, they had to take--whatever he said or did, they had to accept it because if they didn't, they couldn't go to school.  Well, I didn't have that, you know.  And, and being an independent thinker and a person who asks questions because my grandparents told me that if something, if you felt something was not right, you ask, you inquired, you ask questions.  And there're some adults that children just don't ask questions of.  And so I was not--I was not the kind of athlete that he felt that he was looking for in that I was very independent.  And so he, he told me that I would have to go home for the winter quarter and I could come back the, the spring quarter.  But then my thing was this, "What have I done?  I haven't done anything.  You know, you just, you're gonna, you're gonna tell me that I'm gonna conform to your ways," which I had some problems with.
Speaker 1: What, he had certain rules he wanted you to conform to, that he thought you--
Speaker 2: No, I don't know.  It, it's, it's just that--I was just different.  I was a maverick.  I was a maverick.  And I wasn't intimidated.  I wasn't threatened, you know and you had to be timid.  I was not timid.  You know, if he asked a question, if it's something I didn't understand, I, I inquired.  You don't do that.  You know, it wasn't, it wasn't that I did anything that was disrespectful or breaking the rules or anything like that.  I was just a strong person because I, you know, you need to--when you're dealing with children, you need to know where they came from and, and where they're going.  And I had fought hard to get out of the Mississippi, and there were things that I wanted to see and places that I wanted to go and do, and I knew what I had to do in order to get there.  And then you ran into the, the competition of your teammates, you know, when you have a, you have money in your pocket and you have different clothes, and then the jealousy thing comes in because, you know, I--the money wasn't a problem.  Clothes wasn't a problem.  I didn't have the problems that other, the other athletes had.  So then you've got a jealousy factor going there.  And a lot of lies and things were passed around, and it just--it's a typical envy, jealous situation.  And so he told me to go home for the winter quarter and come back the spring quarter.  Well, that meant that I would be off a whole, what, what quarter--they went on semesters, so I'll be off, what six weeks?  I'd be off six weeks.  And I called, at that time, one of the, the second best teams--well, one of the teams who was competitive with Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] was Mayor [Richard J.] Daley Youth Foundation [Chicago, Illinois].  So I met the coach here, Coach [Joseph J.] Robichaux, and I asked if I could come to Chicago [Illinois] to train with him to see if I could make the 1960 Olympic team.  So he said yes, and so I packed my things.  And I left.  And I came here.  And my father [grandfather Louis Brown] stopped speaking to me because Coach Temple told my dad that I could not make it without him.  And so my dad stopped speaking to me for about a, for about a year because he felt that I had done something to disgrace the family.  And I wasn't, I wasn't listening to what Coach Temple said, but that wasn't so.  And it was not until about a year and a half later that I--my father saw me compete once.  And I invited him down to Louisville, Kentucky to an indoor track meet and Tennessee State was there, and I whipped everything that Tennessee State put on the field.  And my father went over and told, and, and spoke to Temple and said, "You told me that my child couldn't make it without you."  And that was the first time my dad asked me what happened, and we sat and talked.  And he became my best friend.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is your father or your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Grandfather, when I say, father, I'm talking about my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yep.  And so the rest is history.  I stayed in Chicago.  And at that time, Mayor Richard J. Daley, he just said "Chicago will give you whatever you need.  The only thing I ask of you is that when you're no longer competing, give back to the City of Chicago."  And so that's how I ended up staying here so long.
Speaker 1: Now, now, where did you stay?  Did you have any relatives here?
Speaker 2: No, I knew no one.
Speaker 1: And so you--
Speaker 2: Chicago was the last city on the earth that I wanted to come to.
Speaker 1: Well, where did you actually stay when you came?
Speaker 2: I stayed with Mr. Robichaux.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then there was another teammate of mine who was on the team at Tennessee State, to whom he had kicked off.  And she lived in Chicago.  And I, I moved in with her.
Speaker 1: Now, who was that?
Speaker 2: Alfrances Lyman.  And I moved in with her.  And then I stayed with her for about, for about a year.  And then I got married, and so then I moved with my husband.  And so then I stayed in Chicago, and I made four Olympic teams with the Mayor Daley Youth Foundation.
Story_ID: 20223
Speaker 1: Tell us about the 1960 Olympics.
Speaker 2: What do you want to know about the 1960 Olympics?
Speaker 1: Well, I, I know a lot happened there.  I know that's the year that Wilma Rudolph won (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's the year that 'Skeeter' [Wilma Rudolph] won everything, yeah, and--.
Speaker 1: And Rafer Johnson won the decathlon.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: It was a--.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, that was, that was--I think the 1960 Olympic Games were the best Olympic Games because it was in Rome [Italy].  And Sydney [sic, Melbourne, Australia]--the first Olympic game after the war [World War II] were [in London, England in] '48 [1948], and then the next was in '52 [1952].  And Helsinki [Finland] and then with Australia, but in Rome, then, you know, everybody was coming in.  I think that was the first time that there was no conflict, you know.  And it was just, it was just a beautiful Olympic Games, a beautiful Olympic Games.  I had difficulties with Coach [Edward] Temple because he didn't want me there.  And it made my life very miserable.
Speaker 1: Was he the coach of the--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: --the U.S. Women's Track Team?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  But we worked through that.  And I was under a lot of pressure, and I, I didn't perform very well there.  But to make a long story short, Coach Temple and I became very, very close.  Over the years, we became very, very close.  But it was just that--I was just at a different time and a different place.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you compete in, in 1960?
Speaker 2: The long jump.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what happened?
Speaker 2: I think I got, I think I got eleventh or twelfth.  I think I did, yeah.
Speaker 1: And who won that?  Is that the year that--.
Speaker 2: Russia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the person who won--.
Speaker 2: Was not--was using drugs.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And then I didn't start running until--I started running the year after that.  I started running in '60 [1960]--I was running, but I wanted to make the Olympic team, and I didn't want to take any chances of getting injured or anything.  So I just long jumped in the '60 [1960] Olympic trials.
Story_ID: 20224
Speaker 1: In the meantime, you know, when the Olympics are over, you're still running, you're a mainstay with the Chicago Mayor [Richard J.] Daley track team [Mayor Daley Youth Foundation, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, I'm training here.  I'm going to nursing--I'm trying to get in nursing school.  And, you know, they say, "Go North, young lady," you know, for integration.  So I came to Chicago [Illinois].  I was in nursing school at Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and I was gonna go on to Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  And then you go two years at Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and you go to Meharry to get a degree, and they discontinued the program.  That's another reason why that it was easy for me to leave Tennessee State because they had discontinued the nursing program.  So anyway, I came to Chicago and I enrolled--I took the Nursing League [National League for Nursing] exam to go to Cook County Hospital [Chicago, Illinois].  Well, shock, shock, shock, shock.  Cook County said that they only took one black per year.
Speaker 1: They told you they only took one black--.
Speaker 2: Yes, they only took one black per year.  And I had to be number one in my graduating class.  I was not number one in my graduating class.  It was not, and it was not based upon the Nursing League exam.  It was based upon they took one black per year.  And your nursing schools at that time took one black per year.  And so you took the Nursing League exam.  I took the Nursing League exam hoping to get in school in '61 [1961] because I was training for '60 [1960].  So you had to take the, you take the exam in the middle of the summer to get in school in September.  Well, when I came back in '61 [1961], and I go over--you know, you go in.  And they explained to me that they only take one black per year, and I had to be number one in my class, and they did not accept me.  Okay, so that means I'm laying out a whole year because you can--you, you have to take the exam every year for--if you--so I can't go to Cook County.  So I've taken the exam, and I passed the exam, but they won't take me because I'm not number one in my class.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but how do you feel about that?  They tell you--did you expect that Chicago would have that kind (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, it gets better.  It gets better.  Okay, so then I get a job at Provident [Hospital, Chicago, Illinois].  You know, at that time, Provident was the 'muckity-muck, high black society' hospital.  If you went to Provident, you had arrived in Chicago.  So I worked at Provident as a nurse's aid.  So I took the exam for Provident.  Well, when September came, I went to Provident, and I was told at Provident that--at that time, I had made two Olympic teams, and they told me that I was too worldly and that I would be a very bad influence on the other students at Provident.  Now, this shattered me.  I mean this, this absolutely, because I'd worked at Provident the whole year.  And so now--I mean this--I mean this was just--this was too much.  This was the slap in the face.
Speaker 1: You were too worldly?
Speaker 2: I was too worldly.  And they said, and she told me that I would not be accepted and gave me a list other things that I should--and why would I want to give up a lucrative track career where I'm traveling all over the world, to come to nursing school?  And see, this is when I stopped telling people what I did.  I stopped putting my achievement on applications because it became a liability, and not an asset to me.  Okay, now, this really shattered me.  So I was getting ready to go--I decided that I was gonna go to Homer G. Phillips [Hospital for Colored] in St. Louis [Missouri].  So this is '63 [1963]. So I took another exam.  But then I was married.  And my husband did not want me to go to St. Louis.  So then I went to the Practical Nursing Program through the [Chicago, Illinois] Board of Education, and then when I came out of that, I worked private duty, worked at [Cook] County [Hospital in Chicago, Illinois] and worked private duty.  And I was leaving Chicago.  My husband and I divorced after '60 [1960]--well, we didn't divorce, we split.  So I was leaving Chicago 'cause I'd gotten an offer to work at a veterans hospital in Los Angeles [California].  And this is when Mayor [Richard J.] Daley asked me--I came to his office, and he said what can he do to keep me in Chicago?  And I said, "I need a job that every time I make a team, I don't lose the job." And I spent six months out of the year--from 1958 until I stopped competing in '76 [1976], I spent six months out of the year in some country, running all around the world some place.  And so every time I would leave, I would lose a job because I'd be gone too long.  And so I said, I needed a job that would not--that I would, would not lose every time I left town.  And so that's when I went to the [City of Chicago, Illinois] Department of Public Health.  And I stayed there for thirty-five years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what kind of a job did you get at the Department of Public Health?
Speaker 2: I worked in Health Education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I started at the bottom, and when I left was Acting Director of Health Education.  And then I started a program for girls in Robert Taylor [Homes housing project] and then I went Altgeld Gardens [later Altgeld Gardens-Murray Homes housing project].
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's good.  That's gives you some flexibility to keep training and competing.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and then I went back to school.  I went back to school because the city would pay people to go to school.  And then I got a scholarship in 1975, athletic scholarship to Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois], and that's how I was able to graduate.
Story_ID: 20225
Speaker 1: Let's go to the 1964 Olympics.  This is number three.
Speaker 2: I'm running now.  I'm running.  I'm running.
Speaker 1: So you didn't compete in the long jump at all?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, oh, yes.
Speaker 1: So you did both?
Speaker 2: I did both, I did both.  I was competing in the long jump, and now we got drugs.  Drugs are heavy on the scene now.  So I compete in the long jump.  And I, I made the relay team.  I made the relay team.  Coach [Edward] Temple is my coach again, and I made the relay team.  I ran lead-off leg on the [4 x 100 meter] relay team.  And the, the, one of the runners from Poland was a man--and I have documentation on that, was a man [Ewa Klobukowska].  So, we've been trying to get the gold medal.  They gave us the world record, but they wouldn't give us the gold medal because they had not started sex testing then.  They didn't start the sex testing until 1965, '65 [1965] they started sex tests.  So they gave us the world record, but we cannot get the gold medal.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is all in retrospect because at the Olympics, the Polish team won the gold, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then, and you all win the silver medal?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It was you, Marilyn White--
Speaker 2: Edith McGuire--Marilyn White, Edith McGuire, [Wyomia] Tyus, Marilyn White and myself.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.  I remember those names.  I mean, you know, you were--I don't know if everybody does, I remember those track names from and they're like musical names.  Wyomia Tyus and Marilyn White--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right, right.  And then in the Long Jump, they had a monsoon, and, you know, in America when it starts raining, you know, you don't practice in the rain.  It was raining so hard on the day that we jumped, that the only thing that you could see was the official sitting by the long jump pit with this yellow--he had this, this canary yellow raincoat on.  That's the only thing you could see.  Water was about--water was over your ankle.  It--and wind was blowing.  It was the worst experience of my life (with emphasis).
Speaker 1: This was in Tokyo [Japan], right.
Speaker 2: This was in Tokyo, this was in Tokyo.  So Ralph Boston, Ralph was a teammate of mine from Mississippi and at Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee], and I said, "Ralph, the country that win today will be the country that's accustomed to rainy, cold weather."  And both long jump events were won by the English, by the British, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were right.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes.  I mean it was, and from that day forth, from that day forth, the minute it started raining, I would go to practice.  I would go to practice because I'd never let that happen to me again in life.  It was horrible.
Speaker 1: Was this your first time in Tokyo?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you like Tokyo?
Speaker 2: Tokyo was interesting.  It was interesting.  It was, it was different, you know.  It was different.  It's just part of the world that I had never seen before.  My first trip to the continent of Asia, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, but in 1964 then, you all win the silver medal.  And the U.S. Olympic Committee has never--even though they've--.
Speaker 2: It's not the U.S. Olympic Committee now.  It's the International Olympic Committee.
Speaker 1: The International, that's right.  The International Olympic Committee has given the world record to you all.  I mean for that particular year, you all set the world record, but you didn't get the gold.  They still, Poland still has the gold medal.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, because they were not doing sex tests.
Story_ID: 20226
Speaker 1: What did you do after the Olympics in Tokyo [1964]?
Speaker 2: I came home, and I trained.  And we did, we did tours.  One year the Russians would come to America.  The next year, we would go to Europe and compete in Russia, Poland, Germany, England, Greece and places like that.  So just seeing the world.
Speaker 1: Did they have the U. S. World Championships in those days?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't start until--I stopped competing in '76 [1976].  They started in '77 [1977], '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Okay, and you all had the Pan American Games too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, that's the year before the Olympic Games.
Speaker 1: And, and in the Pan American Games you would tour South--.
Speaker 2: No, it's--no, it's just the Panamanian [sic, Pan American] countries, you know, North America and South America.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the Caribbean, that made up the Pan American team.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you traveled a lot--a lot.
Speaker 2: I traveled a lot.  I spent every October from 1964 until '76 [1976] in Rio de Janeiro [Brazil] and then every Apr--I mean every August in, in Jamaica.  You'd come from Europe.  They'd bring you from Europe into Jamaica and then from Jamaica, you would go down to Rio de Janeiro.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to enjoy yourself traveling?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes.  And I just wish that--the only problem that I had is that I wasn't old enough to really appreciate the travels, and I wasn't aware of the history of those countries.  And I missed an awful lot because I was too young, and I didn't know what to look for and the sights to see.  So I missed out on a lot there, but later on in life, I started reading.  And I could relate to--What's interesting watching the movie, watching the, the television series, 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'--we lived in all of those resorts and--cause our, our home in London, England was the Dorchester, Dorchester Hotel.  So we lived in the very best hotels, all of the big resorts and things like that.  So it's very hard now to go, to find some place that you want to go because you've been everywhere.  And that's why I said, the best vacation I, I can take is in my home.
Speaker 1: Well, did you make friends in a lot of those countries?
Speaker 2: Oh, most definitely, yes.  And we still communicate.  I go to the Olympic Games now, not for the competition, but for my friends.  And so often we all meet up, and it's just--I mean these are my friends from my teammates as well as my competitors from other countries.
Story_ID: 20227
Speaker 1: '64 [1964]--let's go back to '64 [1964] for a minute.  I wanted to ask you about, in 1964, there's a great deal of turmoil and there's a watershed of activity in Mississippi, I know, around the same time that the Olympic Games were taking place, that same fall.  That's when the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party was formed.  And they went to the Democratic [Party] Convention, Fannie Lou Hamer [Civil Rights activist] and a lot of people from some of the--that you would, a lot of the towns and stuff that you've mentioned before, Philadelphia, [Pennsylvania] Mississippi, Greenwood and all that--,
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and did you go down there (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, I did not because one of the things that--,
Speaker 1: (Unclear) voter registration--.
Speaker 2: --no, because one of the things that, that my parents [grandparents, Louis and Edna Brown] did, and my coaches, they felt that we could do more 'cause we had the press.  We had the, the eyes of the press and we were, and we could do more to help the [Civil Rights] Movement, to help the cause by dealing with the press and not going down and getting jailed because they were asking for non-violent people.  And I am definitely not going to allow someone to stick a match to me, a cigarette to me, spit on me and sic a dog on me and I'm gonna walk away.  And I knew that, and my parents knew that, and everyone who knew me, knew that.  And they just said, "No, you know.  We don't need people like you because you will not help the cause."  And so what we did, we just made certain that we got, you know, we had the press and we talked to the press, and shared with the world what was occurring.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you notice a difference after '64 [1964] in the way people were treated or was it? And was that difference gradual or what happened?
Speaker 2: No, the difference did not come until the passing of the Civil Rights bill [Civil Rights Act, 1964].  And then you can find, it, it--you could see a difference in the South, whereas, it was--they didn't necessarily like integration, but they supported the law.  Where you had your problems was north in, in cities where they presented one picture to you, but that was not the real picture.  So there was more discrimination and more segregation North than it was South.  You knew exactly what time of day it was in the South.  You knew what you were dealing with, and they would let you know that they did not care for you, but, you know, the law says that we have to allow you to come in. Whereas, up here, they made you feel that, well, you know, we accept you, when really they didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I have more respect for the South, for how they embraced integration than I do for your northern cities.

Speaker 1: Between '64 [1964] and '68 [1968] then you continued to tour and train and with Chicago [Illinois], Mayor Daley Youth Foundation.
Speaker 2: Yes, Youth Foundation, yes.
Speaker 1: All right, and '68 [1968] Olympics in Mexico City [Mexico], did you compete in the same events there?
Speaker 2: I competed--no, I was on the relay team, but I got burned.  The, the day before I was supposed to run, I mean to jump--the morning I was supposed to jump, you know, you go and you get a massage.  So I was getting a massage, and I smelled something burning.  And someone had broken a heat lamp, and when the, when the trainer was rubbing my legs, it fell on the back of my legs, and I got first, second and third degree burns on the calf of my leg.  So that was maybe an hour before I was supposed to compete or less.  So, I mean I was in bad shape.  And at that time, that's when they started the drug testing.  So you couldn't, they couldn't give you anything for pain.  They couldn't give you anything,  you know, and my, my biggest concern was me getting an infection down at Mexico.  So I didn't run, I didn't run.  I, I was--I didn't run on the relay team, and I didn't jump very well either.
Speaker 1: That's really--it had to be disappointing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, you know, because the thing that was so distressing was that why would somebody break a lamp and just leave it on and put--you know, you know, those coil heat lamps and leave it on?  And, and when he was training me, and I said, "I'm smelling something.  What is that I smell?"  "It is me, cooking (said with accent)." And so that was, so that was '68 [1968].
Story_ID: 20229
Speaker 1: '68 [1968] was interesting.  And that was when Harry Edwards [activist and sociology professor at the University of California, Berkeley] came on the scene, and I think that he, he ruined the lives of three beautiful athletes: [U.S. Olympic runners] John Carlos, Lee Evans and Tommie Smith by asking them to boycott the Olympic Games [in Mexico City].  And he was using it for his advancement.  And because they were teammates, and because they were classmates, they supported him.  But he exploited them and just ruined their lives.
Speaker 2: Well, they didn't really boycott.  They actually competed and won gold medals and--.
Speaker 1: No, they were going to boycott the Olympic Games.  If, if John Carlos and Tommie Smith--if they had said, "We're gonna boycott the Olympic Games," we all would have.  This--and 1968 was the first time that it was an American Olympic team, black and whites came together to support Tommie and Lee.  The first time, before then, you had the black athletes over here and the white athletes over here.  '68 [1968] brought us together as we--the most segregated organization in the world was the United States Olympic Team, Olympic Committee.  And in 1968, it became the United States Olympic Team, and we became one.  And out of that, out of that ugliness came the beauty of athletes coming together.
Speaker 2: Okay, as I recall, what happened on the podium after the, I guess it was after the 220--
Speaker 1: It was after the 220 [Meter Dash], yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, you know, had a, put black gloves on and raised their--,
Speaker 1: And raised their fists, yes.
Speaker 2: --while the [U.S.] National Anthem was being played.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 2: And so, how did you feel about that?
Speaker 1: I didn't feel anything about that because one of the things that happened, we were all, we were all gonna do something to demonstrate.  We just wanted to know what they were going to do, and they wouldn't tell us.  And they just said--but, you know, they were not being disrespectful.  It was Avery Brundage at that time who was the President of the International Olympic Committee--he had been messing with them.  He told them that if you did anything, you would be kicked off the team and all of that.  He was actually threatening them, and they had about six or seven Olympic trials trying to kick them off the team.  And that's why the 1968 team was so good 'cause they took them up to Lake Tahoe [California].  They had to run Olympic trials almost every week, trying to kick those young men off, and they, and they, and they couldn't.  So Avery Brundage had threatened them and intimidated them, and they brought in Jesse, Jesse Owens to come and talk to the athletes and things like that.  And Jesse was, was criticized because we felt that he was not a part of--he was not supportive of us--although I was not supportive, and none of us was not supportive of Harry Edwards simply because every Olympic game, someone comes up during the Olympic Games to tell us that we should not--we should boycott.  Where were you the day after the last Olympic Games?  Where were you the three years, the three and a half years leading up to the Olympic Games?  Why do you come up at the, at the bewitching hour to tell us that we're being exploited and all of these things?  So I had some serious problems with Harry Edwards, some very serious problems with Harry Edwards.
Speaker 2: So I guess after training for three years, you really don't want to hear that--.
Speaker 1: You don't want to hear it because, you know, there's no support.  They're not bringing you, they're not, they're not helping you get to meets.  You don't even know them.  They're not even speaking to you, and then when it's time for you to go and open a door, then they come and say, "We're gonna close this door.  You don't need to go through that door."  Well, if you feel so strongly about your beliefs, then why didn't you come to me after, after Tokyo [Japan, 1964]?  Or where were you a year before?  Why would you wait up until fifteen minutes before it's time for me to go on stage to perform to tell me that, you know, we should boycott the Olympic Games?  And so I had some problems with Harry, but with me being older and having experienced that through my, you know, through my, through my athletic career, someone is always coming up.  And the catch was, who would be the next person coming up?  And so it was Harry.
Speaker 2: Now, just for the sake of those listening to this tape much later, who is Harry Edwards?
Speaker 1: Harry Edwards is a, what is it--a, a psychologist.  And at that time, he was a student at San Jose [State University, San Jose, California].  And he came to fame after the 1968 because he was the one who started John Carlos and Lee Evans 'cause they were classmates--classmates and teammates.  And so he was the one to come up to say how blacks were being discriminated against, and so he started that issue then.
Speaker 2: Okay, and just a regular--.
Speaker 1: He's a professor.  I think that he, he's a professor.  I don't know if he's still a professor, but I think he went to the--he was a Professor at the University of Berkeley, the University of California at Berkeley.
Speaker 2: Okay, and John Carlos and Lee Evans and Tommie Smith--,
Speaker 1: Tommie Smith.
Speaker 2: --set a record--,
Speaker 1: Set a World's Record, yes.
Speaker 2: --a World's Record and an incredible performance--.
Speaker 1: Oh, incredible man, incredible man and a fantastic athlete.  All those athletes were just fabulous athletes.  But their lives have not been the same since then, and just because they bowed their heads and made a statement.
Story_ID: 20230
Speaker 1: And Avery Brundage [President of the International Olympic Committee] was such a control, a dictator, that he--you know, if you do anything out of the ordinary, then you'll be banned and disbarred from track and field,  and that's what he did.  But Avery Brundage was also the person who banned Jesse, Jesse, Jesse Owens from competing.  Jesse never competed anymore after 1936 because after the [Olympic] Games, they wanted Jesse to--Avery Brundage wanted Jesse to run all over Europe and places like that.  And he didn't, he wanted to come home.  And so they said, "If you go home, then you will never run track again."  And he didn't.
Speaker 2: And Brundage had something to do with holding Jim Thorpe's medal--,
Speaker 1: Brundage had something to do with all of the disasters that have ever occurred in Olympic Games, starting from 1936.  I don't know what role he played with, with Jim Thorpe.  But I do know that in 1972 when my--members of our [Olympic] family was, was assassinated, he was the one who said, "The Games go on."  And I thought that was absolutely, totally horrible because at that time, the only place in the world where you had total peace was the Olympic Village.  And here these athletes had been massacred and he just said, you know, "The Games go on."  And I thought that was just so coldhearted and, and cold-blooded, but that was Avery Brundage.  In 1936, he created a problem with, with Jesse and in 1968, with the, with the athletes in Mexico City [Mexico] and 1972 in Munich [Germany].
Story_ID: 20231
Speaker 1: But you say in '68 [1968], the majority of the athletes were with Tommie Smith and John Carlos--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, and we met.  We met almost weekly, and we wanted to know what did they want us to do.  And they just said, nothing.  They didn't want us to be a part of it.  And if they had said, you know, we would all wear--in fact, all of the black athletes wore black, we had black sweat suits that was given us to by Adidas [athletic apparel manufacturer], and they wore black socks.  And for those who, who performed after, they demonstrated.  If you noticed, the girls have on black--black pants, shorts, running shorts, whereas, our uniform was white.  And so we made statements like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and in 1968, that was the year that Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated--,
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: --and Robert Kennedy [U.S. Senator from Massachusetts and presidential candidate] was assassinated.  (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes, and that's the year they had the riots too in Mexico City [Mexico].  That was, it was, it was a year of unrest.
Speaker 1: There were riots in Mexico City?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, student riots, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20232
Speaker 1: What were the events leading up to the '72 [1972]?
Speaker 2: Same thing, traveling going to the Pan American Games, same thing.  But that was, the only thing about--going to the, you know, the Pan American Games, still traveling around and all of that and--all the same identical thing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're enjoying all this?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed my entire thirty years of competition.  I enjoyed every moment of it.  It was, I mean it was just beautiful.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the 1972 [Olympic] Games are in Munich [Germany], and you just spoke a moment about the, a moment ago about the tragedy in Munich there, athletes being killed and that sort of thing.  Well, talk about the--,
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I had competed in, let's see, I had competed, I had spent a month in Israel in the Hapoel Games, competing in kibbutz, competing all over, living in a kibbutz, competing all over Israel, starting in Jerusalem [Israel] and going all around and ending up in, in Haifa [Israel].  So what they would do, all of us, you know, we would just go from city to city competing.  And it's like a, it's like the Olympic Games, with all the different sports.  And we would go to these various countries--various cities throughout Israel and so some of the athletes we knew, and to me it was just devastating because at that time, the only place in the world where there was total peace was the Olympic Village because with the Olympic Games--the history of the Olympic Games, wars would cease for warriors to walk across battlefields to go into competition.  And when the games were over, they would walk back across the battlefields.  So the Olympic Games were sacred.  It was peaceful.  They--the Flag of Peace is flying and people--countries who are at war, they would stop fighting, and they would come into competition, and they would work together.  And for someone to come into my house, into my family and kill members of my family, it was just devastating.  To wake up, to see the Olympic Flag of Peace flying at half mast, to see armored, armored tanks and guns roaming all over the, all over the village and to see--when my, my members of my family has been killed, blood's everywhere.  And to see these hooded people [members of Black September, a Palestinian terrorist organization] and to witness your, members of your families [Israeli Olympic athletes] coming out with hoods on their head, chained together.  And it's just, I mean, it's, it's, it's something that stays with you forever, and it's always a part of your life.  And it's--and then 9/11 [September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, D.C.] did not help because it was déjà vu all over again.  And it's just--I can't go to the Olympic Games anymore.  I, I can't be around people any more, you know, large groups of people because it just, it just affects you.
Speaker 1: Okay, even now--.
Speaker 2: Even now, even now.  I went to Sydney [Australia] in 2000, and I said I would not go back to another Olympic Games because I'm just--there's no, I, I--it's just unnerving.  If you've never been in a massacre, if you've never been on a plane crash, you don't know.  It's very difficult to relate.
Story_ID: 20233
Speaker 1: So in the 1972 Olympics [in Munich, Germany] you competed in the same events?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, just the long jump.  I was injured so I competed just in the long jump.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how'd you do in '72 [1972]?
Speaker 2: I think I got, what, I don't know if I got--I did, I fluctuated between second and twelfth and thirteenth, I think, somewhere like that, fourteenth, some place like that, you know.  I got into competition, but I didn't get into--I qualified to get into competition.  But I didn't get into the top twelve.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's still tremendous, though.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  I made it into competition at all of my games, you know.  And I think, I think two or three of them I made it into the top twelve, you know, and I didn't--.
Speaker 1: So that's five Olympic Games and that sets a record, right?
Speaker 2: It's a, yeah, I'm the only American who's competed in five Olympic Games in track and field.  I missed the '76 [1976] Olympic Games [in Montreal, Canada] by a half inch.  I pulled a hamstring muscle.  And that was a bad year.  After '72 [1972], my dad [grandfather, Louis Brown] got sick.  My dad died in '75 [1975], and then I went to Olympic trials in '76 [1976] because I just wanted to, I wanted to get out of it, and I was injured.  And I just said, "If I don't go, then I'll be back next year," which was World Cup [in Dusseldorf, Germany].  And I said, "No, I'm getting out of it."  And I, I placed fourth in Olympic trials.  So I missed it by a half inch.
Story_ID: 20234
Speaker 1: After, your father [grandfather, Louis Brown] dies in '75 [1975]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And you said, he got a chance to see you compete--
Speaker 2: Once.
Speaker 1: --one time?
Speaker 2: One time, yeah.  My mother, my mother [grandmother, Edna Brown] never saw me compete.  My sisters [Hester White] and brothers [Eddie White and Wade White] never saw me compete.
Speaker 1: Did they have a sense of what you accomplished?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  Yeah, by that time, you got newspaper clippings, you know.  And you're in magazines.  And now they have television so, 'Wide, Wide World of Sports'.  They could see you on ABC [American Broadcasting Company, television network], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so as an athlete competing all those years, did you--were there financial rewards for that kind of competition?
Speaker 2: Not a dime, nothing.  Absolutely, totally nothing.  Just the opportunity to see the world.  That was all.  Today, if I was today's athlete, I would be a millionairess or billionairess, but we received nothing, just the airplane ticket and room and board.
Speaker 1: In fact, it was illegal to give you anything--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --as an athlete in those days.
Speaker 2: You were an amateur then.  And now everybody's a professional.
Speaker 1: That's--well, you did have some advantages, I guess in terms of, you know, the Mayor [Richard J. Daley] making a commitment to you here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, you know, if, if I had to live my life over again, I think I would like to live it the same identical way because the friends that I met along the way.  The athletes of today, they don't have the opportunity to, to develop the friendship because they have the lawyer or the agent and the hanger-oners, and the wannabes.  And they miss out on the beauty of having teammates where you, you know, you need to, you have to stick together in order to survive, and they don't have that.  And we are still very, very close.  All the athletes that were part of my era, we're very, very close.
Story_ID: 20235
Speaker 1: Even during your Olympic career, you worked with youth, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Worked with youth, and I know we've even--I've--you know, even in Chicago [Illinois], Mayor Daley's Youth Foundation.  You worked with, to develop a lot of young people.
Speaker 2: They did, yeah.  That, that stopped in 19-- the Mayor Daley Youth Foundation ended in 1976 because that's when Title IX [legislation with provisions regarding gender equity in higher education] came in.  And they started opening up athletic programs for girls in the school system.  And see, the Mayor Daley Youth Foundation sponsored two programs, men's wrestling and women's track and field.  And then they started in the school system.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you now have something called the Willye White Foundation.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I--as I traveled around, I worked for the [City of Chicago's] Department of Health and Health Education, and we're all talking about teenage pregnancy.  And so I started going to the schools and talking to young girls trying to find out, why is there so much teenage pregnancy?  And I found that they were looking for someone to love.  And my question to them is, "How can you love someone when you don't love yourself?"  And so I decided to start a program for girls, to assist in the development of self-esteem.  And so I started the Willye White Foundation and I only work with girls.  And I started in Robert Taylor [Homes, public housing project] where the, the, you know, the self-esteem was so very, very low.  I was not concerned where those children came from, but where they were going because I felt that, if I could turn the girls around, the girls could turn the boys around.  And they could both turn the parents around.  And one of the problems that we have in America today, we don't listen to our children.  Our children, our children are different than we were.  I mean, the things that our children have to go through on a daily basis, we cannot even imagine in a nightmare.  And all you have to do is just listen to what they're saying, and nobody wanted to listen,  and so I decided to start a program to, to develop their self esteem through, by using sports.  I used basketball to teach team play because so many children don't know how to share any more.  "It's mine, mine, mine."  I used golf because it's an elite sport, and it took them to a different section of the city.  I used, I used tennis because tennis is polite.  "Excuse me, may I please."  I used bowling to teach math.  I used swimming to teach trust.  Ninety-five percent of the drownings in America are minorities.  Why is that?  Where do you learn to swim?  We have over six hundred parks in this city and we have close to two hundred swimming pools, but you cannot find one school, one pool on the South Side [of Chicago, Illinois] where they're teaching swimming, very few in the city where they teach swimming.  And so you see these pools, and they're vacant because the children don't know how to swim.  So I was teaching, I, you know, I taught them how to swim.  And then I started this National Girls and Women in Sports Day.  It's for, it's a national recognition for girls.  And it started with the death of Flo Hyman [African American member of the U.S. Olympic Volleyball Team, 1984] in 1986, the volleyball player.  I would go to Washington, D.C. every year from '87 [1987] until '91 [1991] lobbying the senators and the President for Title IX equal rights for girls.  So then I decided, I said, you know, "I'm traveling all over the world, making a difference for the rest of the world, but what am I doing for the young ladies that live in the City of Chicago?  Nothing."  So then I came back and started the 'Willye White Winners Dinner'.  There are ninety-five schools in the City of Chicago, private, public and parochial.  So what I do, each school would send one young lady.  And it's like an athlete's debutante presentation.  It's black tie.  It's held at the Hyatt [hotel chain], and these girls are--they dress in black, and they're honored.  It's their evening.  And they have to wear black tie, and they have to speak, and it's the first time that these young ladies have ever spoken into a microphone.  It's the first time that these young ladies have ever seen a hotel, had waiters, silverware, the things that you and I take for granted, is a whole new world for these young--for these children who were born, bred and reared here in the City of Chicago, and to have 800 people watching them.  And so I did that, and that is to develop self, self-esteem to help in preventing the downward spiral of our young ladies.  I do, I design customized programs, depending on the community and depending on the need to make a difference and to change the lives of our girls.
Story_ID: 20236
Speaker 1: What do you think your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: That I made the difference in those that I touched, you know, throughout my journey, in those people that, that came in, in--that I came in contact with, that I really made a difference in their lives, a positive difference in their lives.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, now, that's beyond the five Olympic appearances?
Speaker 2: That's not even, that's not even about the Olympic movement; that's about, outside of the athletic arena, you know, because I've tried to share the beauty that I have received through my worldly travels, I've tried to share that with the people that I encounter, as I did with, with the young man here.  You know, just positive feedback.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how would like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As an honest person, a sincere, honest person, dedicated to whatever it was that I was involved in.  But more than anything, sincere and honest.  I may be a whole bunch of things to a whole bunch of people, but one thing that you can say, "Willye was honest.  She was sincere, and she was fair."
Story_ID: 20237
Speaker 1: And you go back to Mississippi often?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yes.
Speaker 1: And what does that mean to you when you go back there?
Speaker 2: I don't feel like I belong, until they did that billboard [dedicated on July 8, 2001].  And it says, "Welcome to Greenwood, Mississippi: Home of Five-Time Olympian, Willye White."  They, it--I, I ran into, I run into a lot of negativeness when I go home.  And home is where Mother and Father [grandparents, Edna and Louis Brown] is, and they're all deceased, and it's amazing how you can go someplace and you don't fit, you know, because most of the people that made an impact on your life--they're gone.  They're dead, and all the positive is gone.  And then people come in and they perceive you the way that they think that you should be, which has always been a factor in my life.  And it's not that way, you know.  So it, it--I--until they put that billboard up, I just said I would never go back anymore because I didn't belong.  I didn't know people, and then you had to be very careful because--especially, with guys, you know.  They'll make their girlfriend or their wives feel that there's something--if you walk in and you don't speak, then you--they get upset with you.  Or then the, the woman has heard--the wife or the girlfriend has heard so much about you, and you don't even know anything about them.  And then they, when you walk in, here I come in with this smile on my face and dah, dah, dah, dah, butterfly and flittering all around the room, and it creates, you know, problems.  But I just didn't feel that I belonged, and then they gave me this--they put the billboard up.  And I said, "I do belong here."  And then they did--the [Mississippi] Senate did a resolution in April [2002], and so I really feel proud of Mississippi because they have really tried to show me that, what occurred forty years ago, you know, it was just the, it was just the times.
Story_ID: 20238
Speaker 1: Where do you feel the most at home?
Speaker 2: In my house.  That's it.  I still, I still have that, not connected, you know.  And maybe it's because I don't have children, maybe that's it.  But I just feel--I used to feel connected when I could go to, to where Mom and Dad [grandparents, Edna and Louis Brown] was.  But when they passed, I feel I'm just floating through, you know.  I, I have no roots.
Speaker 1: Do you think why it's important that you touch the lives of other people and make a difference?
Speaker 2: Maybe so.  Maybe so.  Maybe so.  And then also, I made a lot of mistakes because people judge me for the wrong reasons.  And if I see a child doing something wrong, I'm always giving advice.  I'm always save--trying to save the world.  I just don't want to see people make the same mistakes that I made.  But as I said, I took all my positives and made--I took all my negatives and made positives out of them.  And I still do that.  I still do that, you know.  Let no man determine your destiny, only God.
