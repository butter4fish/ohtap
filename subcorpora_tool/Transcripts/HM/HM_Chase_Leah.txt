Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.   I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Ma'am, could you please state your name, and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Leah Chase, L-E-A-H C-H-A-S-E, and I've been here for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is your maiden name Chase?  Yeah, the maiden name--right.
Speaker 2: No, my maiden name is Lange, L-A-N-G-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: All right.  And can you give us your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Yep, I was born in New Orleans [Louisiana]. January the 6th, 1923--long time ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, ma'am, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a chef.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah--or I guess I would rather say I'm a cook--
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: --that's better.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay now.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is November--what is today, the 15th?  Yeah, today's November 15th--yeah; I just wrote that down, shouldn't forget that--yep, November 15th, 2002.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in my Victorian Room in Dooky Chase's Restaurant in New Orleans; we've been here a long time.

Speaker 1: Before we get into depth, there are five People Magazine-ish type questions that I am compelled to ask you and they only require a short answer--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and the first one is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well, looking at my size, you would say my favorite food was just about everything.  I like gumbos, I like good--good cooking.  I really like stuffed things like chicken and oyster dressing; that's my favorite kind of thing to eat--I like that.  And if I really wanted to eat, and what I really love to eat, and nobody seems to like it but me, and that's meatballs and spaghetti (laughter), so I go off the beaten path to find that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, green.
Speaker 1: Okay; that makes sense there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Not really, you know?  I don't really have a favorite time of the year; I appreciate life, and any time is okay with me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can deal with it all.
Speaker 1: All right; now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: If I ever got a vacation, I guess I would have a favorite vacation destination; I, I don't travel very much, and when I do, it's working.  I always like to go to Fort Wayne, Indiana; I love it there, especially in the spring--lights, flowers and that kinda thing.  I, I tend to like to go where there are fewer people maybe; you can see what you want to see and rest when you want to rest.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have friends in Fort Wayne?
Speaker 2: A lot--mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And we were there this summer, that's why (unclear).
Speaker 2: You were in Fort Wayne?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Love it in Fort Wayne.
Speaker 1: Well, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--Ahh, yes is less, and I say like this--whatever you're gonna do, you better do it, and enjoy life.  That is the favorite thing I tell everybody; just do what you have to do, and most of all, enjoy life.
Story_ID: 62885
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna ask you about your parents and your family background.  Can you give me the name of your parents and their birthdates, and spell their names for us.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was Hortensia Raymond (ph.) and Lange, naturally, after she was married.  Mother was born April the 16th, 1900--no, she wasn't, she was born 1899 really; that's when she was born--1899.  I really don't know--my dad was Charles Robert Lange; he was born in Madisonville, Louisiana, and he lived to be 87.  His birthday was July the 21st; I just can't remember what year he was born in but his birthday was July the 21st.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was he older than your mother?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, he was; dad was about four or five years older than mother--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --about four years older than she was.
Speaker 1: About 1895 or so?
Speaker 2: About that, mm-hmm (ph.).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your mother or father or your grandparents tell you about your ancestors, you know, where they came from and what the family history is?
Speaker 2: You know, very--people talked little about their ancestors in my day.  I don't know--we were busy doing a lot of other things, mostly surviving, because look at my age; you know I came through the depression days.  And when you would be acquiring all that kind of information, you were too busy trying to survive from one day to another to try to look in history, but you patch it up and piece it up as you go along.  My, my dad's people were from around Folsom--my moth--my grandmother on my dad's side was around Folsom, Louisiana, and there were Indians in her family, that kind of thing.  My grandfather on my daddy's side, he was such an arrogant son-of-a-gun, I just don't know where he came from--up around Baton Rouge [Louisiana] area, he came from that way.  My mother's people were in New Orleans [Louisiana] naturally, and I know my grandfather on my mother's side, his people were from Martinique, some of them, so was just scattered around.  I never--which I should do more, I guess--I never worry about, too much, about from whence I came; I always try to get goin' and move wherever, but it's interesting to know your relatives and to know something about your background because if you don't know that, you really don't know who you are, and you want to know who you are to be able to set your pace.
Story_ID: 62886
Speaker 1: That's part of it and--I mean, I wondered if any of your grandparents or your parents passed on any stories from--you know--about the family to you.
Speaker 2: As I said, very--on my father [Charles Lange]'s side, very little, very little stories were told then.  On my mother [Hortensia Lange]'s side, well, sometimes you heard different--you would hear different stories, but you know, people sometimes are, are not too interested in telling you all the stories because sometimes they don't want to know what bad things went on, which is, I think, pretty stupid because whatever bad things went on, went on, and you can't do anything about that, and it was there and it was done, but you just keep moving on, you know?  You can't erase what has been done, so--but they've always not too anxious to tell you about different things.  I remember we had a family reunion on my mother-in-law's side really, and she had an old aunt that did not speak a word of English, she spoke creole, and she was so angry because they had the family reunion and they were doin' all kinds of research and things like that, and she was angry; she didn't want this to be, but we didn't know why she was so angry about the whole thing.  And my mother-in-law had an old aunt; we used to call her Nenee (ph.), and Nenee --I don't know-- Nenee was as black as your camera, with big blue eyes--strange lady, strange lady, and, you know, she spoke French, too, and she went on--but we never knew where in the world Nenee came from, you know?  We didn't know; we just saw Nenee; we didn't know who was her momma, who was a father or whatever, so when they had this family reunion and my mother-in-law's other nieces were researchin' where we found Nenee.  Seemingly, her mother came--her mother was from here and her father--her mother's husband, rather, was from France, and he came down here, married her, then he left her here with two children, and he went back to France.  So while she was here with her two children, she begins to take in washing or doing whatever she could do to earn a livin' to support her two children, and then somewhere in the picture comes Nenee.  So you see, we didn't know--but I guess this old aunt knew all of this, but that's just one thing; we just--you know, people didn't wanna tell you everything in those days, you had to kinda scratch it out yourself.
Story_ID: 62887
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, maybe you can tell me this.  Now, you are of Creole ancestry, would you say?
Speaker 2: You know--I guess you would say that.  You know, what we call creoles de couleur--creoles of color--and they had some ancestors there; I, I never could figure that out.  I remember that was my big hang-up with my grandparent--my, my grandmother on my mother's side.  I--you know, I never wanted them to say, "Well, you're a Creole," you know.  I said, "What is that?  That isn't anything."  In those days, we were called Negroes, and you're just, you know, Negro, like everybody else, you know?  But they, they wanted to be referred to as Creoles, you know, and I, I couldn't figure that one out.  And then that got me a many slaps here and there because I couldn't understand why you wanted to be--
Speaker 1: I suppose at one time there was some distinction (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--why you wanted to be different than anybody else, you know?
Speaker 1: There must have been a distinction made at one time, but--
Speaker 2: There was--in, in this city it was--there was.  And I, I guess--and my friends--I have so many friends that went through the Civil Rights movements and all and, you know, people my age, we didn't like all that militant stuff and, and really we--sometimes we were anti- the, the workers and all that, but I always fed them all and all this kind of thing.  But, you know, you learn that--and so I, I talk about that; they say, "But Leah, you were so militant yourself because you didn't like those people callin' themselves Creoles or makin' themselves different than the rest of the African American race," you know.  And that always baffled me, so--I don't know where your Creole heritage comes from, it's a mixture.  In this city, the mixture is supposed to be our descendants of Spanish and French; people would be a Creole naturally.  But then Creoles could be a mixture of anything; I've learned that because these creoles of color, they were pretty well mixed up with a lot of, of whites or, or Africans or Haitians sometimes because we had a lotta Haitians that came--slaves that came by way of the Islands to New Orleans, the Caribbean.  Look at our--our architect here is, you know, it's just a Haitian somewhat; the, the shotgun houses and all of that kind of thing.  So we have a lot that comes from that way, and I, I don't know if one knows one from the other anymore.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--moving target once a Creole--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you know.  At one time, you know, they lived in one section of the city; this was one section where some Creoles lived and moved, then in the Seventh Ward was the big--biggest--just conglomeration of so-called Creoles.  And they were referred to as Seventh Ward Creoles; I never figured that out either, but they were very attractive people, a real pretty people, you know--pretty complexions, pretty hair--real pretty people.  And I, I don't know if it went any further than that (laughter), but they were talented; the women could sew--could sew unbelievable, and the men were carpenters.  We have an exhibition now in a museum of work done by those men.  In, in this room, if you look around, you'll see a lotta work done by those men, the creoles of color; they were bricklayers, they were excellent carpenters, excellent bricklayers.  So you have--you had a lotta things going, but I don't think they put any emphasis on what they had going for them; it was mostly a superficial thing--to me, anyway; it was how I look.  I don't think that ever mattered to me.  I, I didn't--I couldn't see because you looked maybe, in some cases, what you may think a little better than somebody else or, or your features were a little finer than somebody else's; what does that matter?  I never--I never figured that one out.  So you just keep movin'; but you do--they did have a lot to offer--a lot to offer--their work, and all of that kind of thing.  It's a pity that more emphasis was not put on their talents, you know, more than their appearance, but they seemed to put more atten--more emphasis on their appearance than their talent--.
Story_ID: 62888
Speaker 1: --Ma'am, is there a Creole language?  I think you referred to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, there is a creole language; it's, it's what we call like a Patois, a creole language, but I really never learned to speak it because my mother [Hortensia Lange] did not allow us to speak Creole.  If you said, mwen pa konnen, which is--I don't know, if somebody asked you something, you said, mwen pa konnen. I don't--my mother was flat--you had to speak French, or you did not speak anything.  And she would say, "You have to say je ne sais pas, not mwen pa konnen. So, the Creoles had that Patois--they kinda mixed up the things just like the Cajuns, but the bad thing about the creoles of color is they didn't keep that Patois--I think was bad because the Cajuns did, and they can communicate with the French even though it's all chopped up, but you can piece it together and understand it.  And I, I think that was good and I think the creoles should have kept that up but they did not.
Story_ID: 62889
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell us something about your father [Charles Lange]?  What kind of a person was he, and what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: My father was a very poor man, uneducated, had maybe third, fourth grade.  He was a shipyard worker, and you may not know about those because that kind of work is out; there are no more wooden boats, but in Madisonville [Louisiana] there were shipyards that--the wooden boats would come in and you would either build them or repair them, you know?  And he was what you call a caulker.  See, you had to caulk in-between the cracks of those wooden slats, first with cotton, then with a, a thing called oakum, which was a kind of oily thing, and he would do--he was excellent at that, could do it just a mile a minute.  And then he farmed; you know, you couldn't just do one thing because shipyard work sometimes was sporadic, sometimes you had boats, sometimes you didn't, so you had to do something else.  I remember how happy we were when daddy would have work in the shipyards, you know, and the work would come in and he would have work; we would be so happy that he had the extra money comin' in.  He was a hard-worker; he worked hard and with his very little formal education, his good common sense was unbelievable (laughter), you know?  In my household, he was a, a trip--well, we learned that--in those days, the father was the big thing; your mother taught you to, to take care of your father first of all, and then he in turn made you take care of your mother, you know?  But mother always made you take care of daddy.  You had to have daddy's water for his bath; you had to have everything ready for daddy when he came off the fields or from the shipyard or wherever he came.  And as little education as he had, he was able to teach us a lot.  I remember him sitting at night with homework, and his big thing was what you now know as mathematics; in my day, we knew it as arithmetic, and he would sit there with those figures and he was a master at it.  And he always taught us, "You must learn to figure because if you don't, people will beat you out of your money if you can't count; you must learn to count."  And he was a stickler at those kinds of things; he was hard, taught us real hard.  I knew how to tell the time on a Roman numeral clock at age five, so you know he was pretty stern, pretty adamant about learnin'.  He had no education but he was just gung ho on you goin' to school and you learnin' everything.  Even when he died, he just died sitting in his chair with grandchildren and grandnieces around him.  I think that might have been his spiel that day, how they must go to school.  You will not do anything if you don't go to school.  He knew that--that you had to be educated and you had to go on.  So his wisdom was plain, flat and dry, but it was good.
Story_ID: 62890
Speaker 1: --We lived by three rules.  You got up in the mornin'--he [Charles Lange] was an avid believer of prayers.  We had to pray every day.  His rules were you pray, you work, and you do for others, that was--he insisted on that, and we learned to do that; we learned to pray, we learned to work, and we didn't go any days without doin' somethin' for other people.  It was funny, when we were coming up, we were so poor and we didn't have anything, but if we went to the grocery for the neighbor, you couldn't take a nickel or a penny in those days for candy; he would not allow that.  You had to do that as an act of charity, and that worked for us I, I think, all through life; it worked.  He wasn't a man that believed in giving up; you never give up.  He--whatever happened in your life, you just took it on, as he would say, as, as God's work, and you just went on, you know?  You just went on.  So we got to be--there are nine girls in my family and two boys, and my mother had all of these dozen girls before she had a boy so we learned to be pretty tough little biddies, you know?  Just the way we came up; we knew we had to be independent, we knew we had to take care of ourselves, and we've been pretty lucky that all of us are able to take care of ourselves and our families.  And I think that's all he expected out of us, and there's a quote my sister remembered he always said, you know.  If you said to him--like I said, "Daddy, I'm tired.  I'm gonna quit workin'."  He said, "What are you going to do?"  I said, "Nothin'; if I quit workin', I'm gonna do nothing."  "You're gonna do nothing?  Well then, that's the end of you," he would always say.  And his thing with his no knowledge of, of proper grammar or English, he would say, "If you give up, you blowed up," so he didn't want you to (laughter)--"If you give up, you blowed up."  That's all he used say--"Don't give up."  He was oh, strong on that--"Don't give up; you have to keep going.  As long as you're living, you must keep going."  I guess that's why I'm here at 80 years old almost.
Speaker 2: Now, you're the oldest daughter of fourteen children?
Speaker 1: I'm the oldest.  My mother had fourteen; she had one child before me and it lived--she died as a baby, and then I'm the next in line, and now we're eleven of us living, and I'm the oldest of that group of eleven.  We were--we're pretty close family.  As my children say, we too clannish; but whatever hurts one gets to the other one, whatever makes one happy, gets to the other one, so we kinda clannish there; we kinda hang together, and that's somethin' we were brought up to do, you know?--to hang together.
Story_ID: 62891
Speaker 1: How did your mother [Hortensia Lange] and father [Charles Lange] meet?  Did they give you a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  I don't know--my daddy, as I said, was a worker; he worked in the shipyards, so sometimes he had to leave Madisonville [Louisiana] to come here and work the shipyards in New Orleans [Louisiana]; you know they had big shipyards in New Orleans and he would come to work, and that's where he met my mother.  I, I don't know--because they were two totally different people, you know; their beliefs were different, mainly, I think.  My mother had a little bit more education; she had what--eighth grade, I think, and my father had hardly any.  But he was good; he was good and he was a kind person; he was really a kind person, and they met here some kind of way.  My mother was a fanatic about going around without shoes, and I remember hearing her tell this tale about being scolded by her mother because she let my daddy see her without shoes on her feet (laughter), but I guess he got used to that because she always went without shoes; I don't know how she did it but she always went with--she was always without shoes for some reason.  She liked to be on the floor, and I hate it--without shoes; she like her feet in sand without shoes; I hate it.
Story_ID: 62892
Speaker 1: Now--now, what was your mother [Hortensia Lange] like, and what did she do?
Speaker 2: My mother, like all the Creole women, sewed; they worked in the factories.  In New Orleans [Louisiana], you had a lotta factories; I wish we had them now because you--maybe some women could have more work.  We had any number of factories, and the big factory in the Seventh Ward was Haspel Brothers, and they made seersucker suits; they made summer suits--well, all of my mother's sisters and all her brothers worked Haspel Factory, and that's what they did all their lives, and when she got married--well, she did not work; she went to live in Madisonville [Louisiana] with my dad, and I, I remember her workin' only one time, and my daddy got sick and then she came back here to help out and worked factories again.  They sewed, and that's what the big thing was, the women sewed, and she sewed a lot.
Story_ID: 62893
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I want you to take us back to when you were a little girl, and give us an idea of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in your neighborhood.
Speaker 2: I grew up--I did not grow up in New Orleans [Louisiana]; I grew up in Madisonville [Louisiana].  That was--I, I kind of go back now and appreciate that kind of upbringing because I think people that are brought up in small towns around farm things tend to know a little bit more about life--tend to maybe respect life and appreciate life more because you're around living things.  You had to work the garden, so you knew where your food came from; you planted the potatoes, you planted the onions, planted the garlic, you planted the okra, you cut the okra, you saw them grow, you fed the pigs every day, you saw them grow, you even saw them being butchered--everything.  You picked strawberries, so that meant you going through the woods to get to the strawberry field, and you're gonna come into wild fruit like crab apples, like muscadine grapes, like mayhaws--all kinds of things; so you tend to like and live a little bit more; you understand more about living and living things when you grow up in the country.  I'm pretty proud that my grandchildren, particularly my grandsons, got a little bit of that kind of life because they hunt and fish a lot, and they go out there to hunt and they love it.  When they go out and they said, "Ooh, just smell it."  You know, in the fall you smell those leaves, and hunting season you smell those leaves, and it is good.  You learn to appreciate everything.  Rivers--we had one river that went through our town, and we would sit on the river bank in the bayous and fish little perch and come home, and that was your breakfast with some grits and fish.  You learn a little bit of everything; you learn that when crops come in how you can save 'em for the fall by cannin' them or drying them.  Now, sun-dried tomatoes are the big thing, you know, the, the elegant things to work with in your kitchen when I was comin' up; that's how we preserved 'em.  We sliced 'em and sun-dried the tomatoes and canned the tomatoes and dried the okra and--because you didn't have freezers like you have today.  So you really learn to live; you learn to appreciate everything when you grow up in the country.
Story_ID: 62894
Speaker 1: Tell me about school, you know; where did you go to school, and how did you like it?
Speaker 2: You know, I liked school; I started--would you believe--I started school when I was four years old.  My daddy [Charles Lange] was so--pushed us so very hard because I--I don't know if we--because we were girls he pushed us that hard, because--but he was really pushy on us, and my mother [Hortensia Lange] was, too.  My mother insisted that we read a lot, that we, we spoke properly (laughter) and, you know, in the country you have to be careful of that because country people just flat and they don't--my daddy spoke so flat; I remember it was so much fun when my mother, she would say--and she taught him an awful lot.  And one thing about daddy--as I said, she was so different than he was; she liked all of the finer things in life; she liked all of that.  She liked to dance, and she liked all the nice things, you know.  And my daddy didn't like that; I mean it wasn't a part of him, but he didn't mind if she went and danced, you know?  But she was so different and she read a lot, and he read some things, but he wasn't a great reader like she was, but he insisted that we do whatever mother told us to do; he insisted that we had to study and we had to learn everything we could learn, and learn to speak properly or correctly, rather, and--but he did that all the time and he was so flat-talking and my mother used to correct him all the time, all the time--"No, Charles, you don't say heah, you say here; you don't do this, you say this."  And my daddy was left-handed and he was really--but he learned to work two hands because she insisted--"Eat with your right hand; you don't eat with your left hand," so he learned to do both things.  But he was too funny when she would correct him, and then he would be so funny.  He would say, "Okay, okay then; okay, come hither," you know (laughter).  Instead of saying, "Come here."  So he was a trip with that kind of thing.  But school for me was good.  We had to do the best we could do in school; daddy didn't appreciate 75s, which was the passing mark in my day, and they graded you 75, 80, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and 75 was a passing mark when I was in grammar school.  My daddy did not appreciate 75s; you had to come home with 90s and 100.
Story_ID: 62895
Speaker 1: Now, now what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Well, we went to Catholic schools--St. Francis Xavier was then in Madisonville [Louisiana]; it is no more, but that's the school we went to.  As I said, my daddy [Charles Lange] was Catholic, as they say, clear through, he was Catholic.  He didn't want us to go to public schools at all, so we had to go--we went to Catholic schools and then when we got through Catholic schools, there were no Catholic schools for blacks--high schools in Madisonville; they had a white high school in Covington [Louisiana], but it was segregation in those days.  You had to come here, so we went to St. Mary's Academy.  And later in life--I guess, as you grow, as you learn--and he learned, I--a couple of my sisters after that went to high school, to the public school.  But he was adamant that you go to Catholic schools to get Catholic training; that was the most important thing, that you would have your religious training in school.
Speaker 1: So you had to come to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--To New Orleans to go to high school, yes, because there were no Catholic high schools for blacks, you know.
Speaker 1: Did they just send you, or did the family come to New Orleans?
Speaker 2: No--well, my mother [Hortensia Lange] had sisters here, so I--we would come and we would live with our aunts until we went to, to school--to St. Mary's Academy.  I graduated--I was only sixteen years old when I graduated from high school and I graduated from St. Mary's Academy.  My sister behind me came, and another sister, but by that time, my mother had convinced my dad that they could go to Slidell (ph.) High, and then the last ones went to Covington High, you know, which were public schools nearer to home, and they did just as well.  But he just wanted that religious trainin' there.  People were so segregated in those days, not only for racial reasons, for religious reasons.  Coming up in Madisonville, you couldn't be associated with a non-Catholic; that was a no-no; no, you couldn't do that.  So you see?  You had all kinda biases that were not right, I think.  Because of your 'nother faith, that don't say I can't play with you; it shouldn't be that I couldn't be your friend, but until my mother--and she was one who would--kept pumpin', you know?  She convinced my daddy that because you belong to another religion didn't make you bad or didn't make you a person you couldn't be with, so she was always like that.  My mother insisted that you treat everybody equal; you couldn't make a difference with people that way.
Story_ID: 62896
Speaker 1: Now, there any special teachers or adults that were mentors to you when you were coming up that tried to help you?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I--well, I went to Catholic schools with the Sai--Sisters of the Holy Family and they taught me, and I guess they helped me, but I guess I was just a hard person to help.  A lotta people--we were very poor, and a lotta people gave us things and my mother [Hortensia Lange] would sew and if you had a coat that you didn't want and, and she could make it, she would--we would rip it all a loose and she would turn it inside out so the wrong side would be the outside, and we would have like a new coat.  People helped us that way; people were good to us that way, but people were prejudiced in those days, far more than they are now.  If you were--they were prejudiced against you because you were poor, more to me than if you were black.  I, I felt that prejudice against poverty more, and that's what made us strive hard, and he [Charles Lange] drove us hard to get out of that cycle of poverty--to work.  I remember we were on the WPA, you know, you had the work programs, and they would give you food, and you would have the commodity or whatever you call it today, but he would always say, "We have to work; we have to work and we have to pray hard so we can get work because you can't have people giving you things."  He didn't want people giving you anything.  So you had to really work and do--but I had no special people.  Even as an adult, I didn't have special people that I said, "I'm gonna be like that person."  We had--mother and daddy instilled in us the basic thing that we needed to live, and we, we learned that the hard way.  And when I came up, I learned to take a little bit from everybody.  You would meet people--I love people.  You would meet people, and you, you say, "Oh, I like that," you know?  And you do a little bit of that.  So a lotta people become your role models; you have no one special person other than your maker--than God--but no one human bein' is so mighty that he could give you all the inspiration and all the stuff you need in life.  You need, I felt, a little bit from everybody, you know.  Some people walk in the streets, even today, and you would meet--oh, they're the biggest junkies, you say.  Oh, they're not this.  But sometimes you could talk to them and you could learn--you could learn a lot of things.  You can learn what not to do, and maybe what you want to do.  So you take on a lotta people; I never had one role model other than my parents.  I had good parents; they were really, really good parents.  I mean they stuck up for us and they would help us, and we knew that we had parents we could go back to for, for whatever they had.  As little as they had, they knew it was--we could get advice at home, we could get somethin' to do there and move on.  And so we--none--I don't think any of us were like that way, that we'd say--I can't remember my sisters or anybody saying, "Well, this is my role model."  We didn't; we were brought up hardnose and to do.  And then, as I said, you grow up and you, you get other people as you're going through life and you look at what they do and you say, "Oooh, I like that, I'll try to do that."  As I said, that makes everybody a role model.

Speaker 1: Ma'am, what did you like to do when you were in school?  Were you involved in school activities?  Were you pretty popular or were you a kind of a loner, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I don't think I was so popular in school.  In Madisonville [Louisiana], when we came up, my dad [Charles Lange] was such a good person, he was extremely good person and, as I said, we were taught to give things, and I always wanted people to know me, I always wanted--I don't think that mattered too much to the rest of my sisters and my brothers, but to me it mattered; it mattered that I was a part of things, so I had to struggle on my own to be a part of things.  When you in school you're strugglin'; you know if you make that hundred, then people gonna look at you at school.  Your teachers gonna look at you, and she's gonna say, "Well, you are good, you're better than so-and-so," so you get a feel of somethin' there.  Little things like--my dad was a man who went to church every Sunday; never, ever missed mass.  We were not allowed to miss mass on Sundays, and he went to communion.  In those days, you received holy communion once a month and that was what you were supposed to do, not like you do daily today, and I remember bein' so proud because the sisters would say, "Her daddy goes to church," and "Her daddy does this, and her mother [Hortensia Lange] does that," and "Her mother sews and her moth"--my daddy would raise things--food--vegetables, and we would bring it to the nuns and bring it to the priest.  That made me happy because that made me be a little bit outstanding and I liked that; I always liked that, but that was hard maneuvering--to make yourself somebody, to make you feel like somebody when you didn't have anything.  And poverty was looked at as so bad, you know?
Speaker 1: Were you involved in clubs in school and things like that?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I--in school, no; there were not very many clubs in school, even in high schools, when I came up.  There were not things for us like they have today; you did your work and you had a few friends, and I had a few friends and I liked to play basketball and I played basketball, and I, I just wanted to be a part of everything and a part of whatever people, but I never was a groupie person; I never liked groups.  If ten people were doin' somethin' one way, I'm going the other way.  And I don't know if that's good or bad, but that's the way I was.  I was trained--you have to understand, when you come up the way I came up, poor as I came up, and you want to pull yourself up, you're workin' every day.  And I think we should tell children that today because it isn't as hard--well, say it isn't as hard for most of 'em as it was when I came up, but sometimes it's really harder because they don't have that base that I had; they don't have the parents that really understand, and the parents are young, the parents are tryin' themselves, so they just don't have all that time.  But I learned that you run your life just like you play a card game, just like you play checkers, and you movin' from one thing to another.  But I always say, "Don't take your hand off of a that checker because somebody's gonna jump you; you push and you wait and see if that works, then you move your hand off that checker."  But you learn all those things in life to try to get where you're going.  And it wasn't easy.
Story_ID: 62898
Speaker 1: Now, now when you were in high school, did you, did you have a plan for what you were gonna do when you got out of high school?
Speaker 2: Not really.  You know, you think of a lot of things, then they don't work for you, so you really livin' from--you're just wingin' it as I say; you're just on that checker board and you just takin' your chances.  You're takin' your chances at whatever it's gonna be, and if you say, "That isn't the right way to go," you're gonna back up and you're gonna go someplace else, but you don't plan your days; I don't--I didn't because I, I didn't know where to go with my plans anyway, you know.  So I knew--I'd look at things and one time I thought I wanted to be a nurse, and they had a--I had no money to go to college like some of my friends did, so I had to go back home and they had this program--you could have gotten in the military as nurse in those days, but my daddy [Charles Lange] wouldn't hear that, so you just back off that, then you come and you just try to find you a job and work at it, and that's what I did.  I came to New Orleans [Louisiana] when I was eighteen years old.  Before I came to New Orleans, I was doing housework; what else is there to do in the country?  You work for so-and-so and you help clean their house and help do their clothes, help cook their dinner, but you know that isn't what you're gonna do.  You know that won't--for me, it wouldn't satisfy me; I wanted to do somethin' else.  I wanted somethin' bigger, somethin' better.  So my daddy let me come to New Orleans; that was hard talkin' to him to let me come here and live with my aunt when I was eighteen years old.  And I went to work in the French Quarter which was, ugggh, a big no-no for the Creole community because the Creoles of color--the women went to work in the factories, but I did not; I went to work as a waitress and ooh goodness, that was a no-no.  But anyway, I did--I liked it, and my mother [Hortensia Lange] didn't resent that, my daddy didn't resent that, as long as you kept yourself the way you were supposed to be; as long as you did the right things, they didn't matter where you worked.  But some of my aunts didn't like it, but I learned a lot there, and that was where I learned a lot.  I learned a lot; I learned a lot about the restaurant business and I learned to love it, and I love it, and I just made those moves.
Speaker 1: Now, what restaurants did you work for at the French Quarter?
Speaker 2: In 1942, I went to work for a woman who had a restaurant called the Colonial Restaurant on Charter Street; it is no more there.  Then, she opened up, which is still there, the Coffee Pot, and I was one of the girls that helped her open that Coffee Pot in 1943, and it was restaurant work, and the Coffee Pot is on the other side of where we originally started.  Where it is now was a tea house; in the early '40s [1940s], they had a lotta tea houses in the Quarters where you would go and you would have tea and cookies and whatever, and they would read you tea leaves and all that.  You know, I don't think they have that anymore; I don't see it anymore anyway, but that's where I started to work, and that's where I learned.  Then, in 1946, I left the Coffee Pot and I would do other work; I'm still feeling my way, you know?  You're still on the checkerboard tryin' to move your checkers in the right way, so a man offered me a job on a racehorse board; I don't know anything about what I'm doin', but I learned pretty quickly how to work racehorse boards, but I didn't like that at all; I didn't like--it had no feel to it.  I loved restaurant work.
Story_ID: 62899
Speaker 1: Then, in 1946, I met Dooky [Edgar Chase, Jr.], and his mother [Emily Chase] had this restaurant [Sandwich Shop]; not what you see today--I made what you see today.  He had--they had just a little corner; you know like you have a bar and sell sandwiches, and then you live on the other side--half houses; well, that's what she had in '46 [1946].
Speaker 2: Was it at this location?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, was right on the corner; then she moved out--she moved out in about '47 [1947], '48 [1948]; she moved out and then we re-opened the dining room on that side.  Now, I had to really struggle because see, I'm comin' from workin' on the other side of town where, you know, I knew what whites were eating, I knew how they ran a restaurant, I knew what they did, and I was trying to do the same thing in my own community; that was not easy.  Nobody understood where I was comin' from (laughter).  And, and I remember the people sayin', "Oh, my God, she is as"--and, you know, "Oh, my God, she's gonna ruin everything; she's gonna ruin everything Dooky built."  Because, for one thing, my husband was a musician, he had a big band when he was 16 years old; he'd been having that big band.  So when I met him, he was 18.  We got married when he was 18--I was 23, he was 18, so you know that was another big hoopla, you know.  I was too old for him and that was gonna never work, and--huhhh, so you go through all that kinda stuff.
Speaker 2: So, wait a minute--you were 23 and he was 18?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm (ph.).
Speaker 2: Okay, so--oh, too old, okay.
Speaker 1: And that was unheard of in those days, you see.  And people--you know, people look at you and they really don't know you, they don't know you.  I remember my sister-in-law telling me that all the time.  She said, "You know, you have changed considerably."  What do you mean?  I have not changed at all; I'm the same me that I was before, you just did not know me; you thought you knew me.
Speaker 2: Her perception of you changed.
Speaker 1: Yes, her perception changed.  I'm not--I'm not a changed person; this is the way I've always been, you just thought I was somebody else (laughter).  But people do that; they really don't try to know you.  But this worked for me and--wasn't easy.
Story_ID: 62900
Speaker 1: Now, what were some of the changes that you made here?  I mean what was it like when you married Dooky [Edgar Chase, Jr.] and started working with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, Dooky had a big band and he was still on the road from time to time with that big band, so I was here, and my mother-in-law [Emily Chase], you have to understand, she started this--borrowed $600.00 from a brewery; started her little sandwich shop, and she made it grow to--oh, she was a good cook; my father-in-law [Edgar Chase, Sr.] was very popular.  He, in those days, was sellin' what you--what we call sellin' lottery--what you may call a numbers runner, really, but you know in New Orleans [Louisiana], you don't say that; we're kinda sophisticated.  We say, is a lottery vendor.  Isn't that nice (laughter)?  But he was sellin' the numbers.
Speaker 1: Sounds very good, cleans it up for him.
Speaker 2: Didn't we though?  We sure did.  But anyway, he made a lotta money, he was makin' a lotta money, and that little restaurant was very popular because, you know, it was--not everybody who came to this restaurant--it was just the Creoles, the--the people who he wanted, or who would just come, you know.  We had a good neighborhood, and the people would come, and he ran a tight ship.  My father-in-law was a stickler for everybody not making too much noise and not talkin' too loud and all this kind of thing.  And my mother-in-law was an excellent cook.  So they were makin' money when I came in here, so she couldn't understand--"What are you talkin' about little girl?  I'm makin' money here, you know, and you come and you gonna change this and you gonna change that."  But I knew what I saw in the French Quarters; I knew what I saw the whites doin' and I could not see why I couldn't do it just because I was black which--some of the thing was pretty naive and stupid because I used to say all the time that there's only difference in people's color, you know; they do the same things--you're only different colors; that is not so, that's so stupid.  You have different cultures, your tastes different, and that's the way it's supposed to be.  If you're Italian, you like good Italian, if you're German, you like--you have different cultures.  And that's what I couldn't understand; it took me a long while to understand that, so when I came in here I (unclear) to change everything around.  Well, one thing I did change, you know, was--we had to--in those days you didn't go in restaurants where they had table clothes 'cause black people didn't have that.  Well, we had not places to go to see what they were doin'; it was only people like me who worked in those restaurants who knew what went on in 'em because we couldn't go there to eat.  If you were Duke Ellington, you had to eat here; if you were Sarah Vaughan, you had to eat here; Lena Horne, you had to eat here--if you came to New Orleans in those days; so we had no opportunity of knowin' what was in those restaurants, unless we worked there, to see--well, you set your table up nicely.  I'll never forget whenever I said, "We setting these tables up."  Oh, my God, they said, "Nobody's gonna touch those forks that you have on the table already."  I said, "But they will, they do it over there; I see 'em do it over there, so I know they're gonna do it here."
Story_ID: 62901
Speaker 1: If they were on the table already, they wouldn't touch it?
Speaker 2: No--oh, God, black people were picky about their food; oh, they would--they still are, they still are.  You have to have it just so for them because they were eating in their homes.  They didn't eat in restaurants, you know?  They thought restaurants--oooh, that wasn't a good thing to do, and you know what?  It was a long time before I understood why we felt--why they felt like that.  Because when you passed a restaurant as a little child, what you gonna do?  You tell your momma, "Let's go in there; let's go in here; let's go in there."  And what do they tell you?  "No, you don't wanna go in there because you know--because they all drink outta those glasses; they're not clean."  So you come up with that mentality because it's a restaurant; you're not putting together the thing, "Well, they must have sterilizer here, they must have somethin', a solution that they put in here to sterilize every"--you don't think that way, you just think what momma tells you.  So you begin to believe that that's true, and you learn as you go it isn't true.  So it was hard for me to take the ketchup bottles off the table, take the--all that off the table and set it up like everybody else.  But I scuffled with it and it worked; it worked, but it was hard thing to do.  With my mother-in-law [Emily Chase], I don't think she was so much worried about the menus I would change as she was worried about the decor.  You know, my mother-in-law liked pink and blue; I hate pink and blue.
Speaker 1: (Inaudible response).
Speaker 2: She had pink and blue in this and that--everything.  I say--hate that.  So I said, "No, we can go"--when I first did the changes, I said, "We're gonna put this red in here."  I thought red made restaurants warm and nicer, so we had a red wall at first, and wow, it was just elegant.  And these same chairs here?  Got 'em in 1957; I had to battle through the nose to get 'em because she wanted chairs with chrome, you know, what I call little kitchen chair in those days.  But I had to battle for everything, but it was more the decor than it was the food; I was able to do that--to change those kind of things easier than that.
Speaker 1: Now, what kinda changes did you make to the menu here?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, people were eating in homes then, so they were not coming out to eat oyster dressing; they were not coming out to eat things that you have--shrimp creoles and things like that because they were cookin' that at home.  When they would come out, really, they would come out to drink; in the evenings they would come out to, to--you see, because you didn't have a mass of people workin' office work in those days.  You know, you have a few little lawyers like [Ernest Nathan] Morial and a few other (ph.) people like that--few doctors, teachers; but you didn't have people like you have doing office work where they eat lunch out, you didn't have that; you went home and ate what momma had.  Momma had stew, momma had rice, shrimp creole, beans--all kinds of things, so you were not comin' in this restaurant to eat that; you were comin' in this restaurant to eat what--fried oysters, fried shrimp, fried chicken--things that you didn't get at home.  So then I said, "No, we gotta change this; we're not gonna have all this fried this, fried that."  The menu said, "Half-fried chicken, french fries (unclear), half-dozen oysters"--that was the menu; my mother-in-law [Emily Chase] would write it out every day.  I said, "We're gonna change that."
Story_ID: 62902
Speaker 1: Did, did Dooky [Edgar Chase, Jr.] feel caught in the middle of this?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sometimes he was caught in the middle, but I think then he was more interested in change than he is now, you know; he knew he had to do something different and he would have little programs; he knew had to build the restaurant up, so he would always go along with--with me and my program, and then my mother-in-law [Emily Chase] finally came along.  You have to understand, I guess I would feel the same way; she worked hard, she worked hard as the dickens because she started this.  My father-in-law [Edgar Chase, Sr.] would go out and gamble the money and she'd come back and work and, you know, just keep goin'; it didn't, you know, didn't stymie her at all.  She knew--she had to do and she just did it.  So, with a woman like that, it's just hard to, to let somebody else come in and tell you, "Hey, we gonna do this and we gonna do that."  I don't know if I would like that; I don't know if I could accept that much change, but she did.  She was really good to me; she helped me with my children when Dooky was playing music and, you know, in those days, musicians were not making a ton of money like they're making now, so she would help me with the children and, and she, she would really do good things for me.  She really liked me; she never resented me at all, you know?  She wasn't in that number who said I was older than her son and all of this kinda stuff--no, no, she wasn't that way; she helped in--but it was hard for her to make those changes, and I knew it was hard for her but she did them eventually, and she left this business when she was about--oh, maybe 82, 83 years old, then she just backed off.
Story_ID: 62903
Speaker 1: And, you know, then I, I started and then '84 [1984], we had to do this remodeling.  You see, up until '84 [1984], we had people waiting to get a table; I hate that.  I would not wait in line to go eat anyplace; that is horrible, you know?  And people would be waiting and when they'd come in, you know what I'd do--"Give everybody a glass of wine--give 'em some."  I--it just bothered me to see you waiting for something to eat, you know, so I said, "Oh, no, we got to do this."  But then--well, we bought up this whole block; we had it and they were renting the houses so we had to move the people out the houses and stretch this out.  But then my daughter was livid; she was a dynamite--Oh, gosh, that girl--she was gung-ho, and she--she really battled with me to do this renovation and to make this dining rooms what it is now, and that was another hoopla, you know, because I know what I want; Dooky doesn't never want what I want, so you're just battling (laughter) all the time--to put the art on the wall--big battle, big battle because there was no art on anybody's walls.  There was no art in the white restaurants when I put this art on these walls--none.
Speaker 2: Now, tell us who some of the artists are.  I mean I walked around when I came in and I was amazed at all the artists.
Speaker 1: I, I love 'em; well, they were big helps to me.  They taught me a lot, and--well, then I start--they said, "Well, we"--I said, "I want something on these walls; we're gong put something on these walls."  And so--first Bruce Brice comes in with his big thing out there--that big painting you see out there with the typical New Orleans theme.  Well, Bruce is like a folk artist, but I love him because he depicts New Orleans [Louisiana] just the way we are in our community.  This is the way we are.  Now, we in our community--but you got to know some of us; we not so proud of what we are.  Indians were taboo.  Street parades--my father-in-law [Edgar Chase, Sr.] loved a parade; my father-in-law was always in a parade, but my husband [Edgar Chase, Jr.] thought it was a total disgrace.  (Unclear) but this is what you all about.  This is you; this is what black people are all about; we parade, we sing, we dance--that's us; can't change that, and you have no reason to change that.  So when Bruce put that picture up, pshoooh--big battle--he [Edgar Chase, Jr.] didn't like it--"And this is not a museum, and this is not--people don't wanna see art."  Well, I put it out there, and (laughter)--then, when we had to make the place--we see down that hallway we needed visibility in the dining room, so I said, "Well, Dooky, I have a young man who I know"--it was done 32 years old.  I said, "he does stained glass; I like stained glass," I said, "and I'm gonna call Winston in here and see what he can do; I need stain glassed there."  So Dooky said, "Okay."  But--he said, "I like"-- I think he thought I was gonna put up church windows, you know, with flowers.  When I put that up, he told my daughter, "I think your mother is stone outta her mind; she's crazy.  Look at that stuff she put up there; nobody's gonna like that."  Well--they like it, it's, it's my childhood.  I played hopscotch, I bought penny snow cones; we sold the rags for a penny and got the money, and that's what you see on that stained glass, and everybody liked it but he thought it was a total disgrace; but anyway--you battle all those things and you just keep going.
Story_ID: 62904
Speaker 1: Do these artists patronize the restaurant--I mean Jacob Lawrence (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, Jacob did until he died.
Speaker 1: --Jonathan Green [HM]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Elizabeth Catlett (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Jonathan Green--Um-hm, Elizabeth will be here in a couple of weeks.  Elizabeth will celebrate her 87th, 88th birthday in March here, and we will do this big thing.  I was fortunate enough to meet all these artists, and they help me.  David Driskell [HM]--David was here just the other day--all of them--John [T.] Biggers [HM] that's--John Biggers was here until he died--Richard Hunt; I got to know them all, and some of them are local artists.  That's local (POINTING), Clifton Webb, who helps me hang this thing; Bill Pajaud [William Pajaud, HM], who now lives in California, was from New Orleans [Louisiana] originally; he's doing wonderful things.  But Maya Angelou--not Maya Angelou, Lois Mailou Jones--I never did meet her, but I got--over that sofa, you can see, is one of her better pieces.  I was pretty proud when a collector came in here from--I think he was from New York, and he said, "Oooh, you have that!"  I said, "Yes," so he said the man who buys from him, he said, "You see that piece?  The man told me if I owned anything by Lois Mailou Jones, that is a piece I should own."  So I was pretty hap--that's a piece she doesn't--and she lived in Haiti.  So we have different things--and I kinda learned a lot about the art and artist, and I learned one thing--that if you don't have any kind of art in your life, you're kinda missing a little bit; it's something it does for you, and I tell that in--I'm pretty proud of this work because you know when I start doing that, black people did not have art in their houses; they would go the store and they would buy a piece, and I keep saying to them, "Art doesn't have to match your sofa."
Speaker 1: Yeah, there used to be a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge that people used to buy and put it over the sofa.
Speaker 2: --over the sofa.  That art has to talk to you; it has to make you feel that person who did it, it has to make you feel something, and it is so warming, and it's so--and that's what you try to get in these schools again; that's what you need to get in these schools.  You need to broaden these children; they need to know about artists, they need to know those things, and it'll give 'em something to go forward to work at, and to warm 'em up some--turning out too many cold people, too many people that are cold, and--and art does that, so I, I just love it, I love it.
Speaker 1: Yes, this is a gallery.  I mean I walked around, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I have some more pieces to put up, but they need to put 'em up for me, but art--if you--and I, I try to tell people more than it is warming and it is enlightening, it is everything to a person, but you know what it does in your business?
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: It--it's an investment; it is an investment in people, it is an investment in your business because it'll broaden you, it will broaden you because one thing carpet people, business-minded people know is the value of art.  So, it can put you in a circle of people that are gung-ho, that are moving; it'll put you in that circle, and it is good for your business, it is truly good for your business.  For my business, this has really done--it has brought me customers from all sides, all over, from all over; from as far as Japan--I've done work for Japanese television, I've done work for German television; I've done it all, and it's the art that brings you together.  If you know about different art and different people, it kinda warms you up and it kinda makes people understand where you're coming from sometimes; it's really--it's the best thing that ever happened to me.
Story_ID: 62905
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about the food, and what makes the food here so special (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well because, because I do most of the food myself. I love it, and I love to--I live and breathe food.  I, I like to work with food, and I learned one thing--that you cook what you're all about; I could make any kind of cream sauce you want, any kinda--but is that me?  People don't come here for that; they come here for me, for what my culture's all about, like stewed okra, string beans, gumbos, beans and rice if you will, or shrimp creole--that kind of thing; they don't look for all the other trendy things, they come here to get a good meal and a good--and when they tell you, "That's just like my grandma," I love it because I know I've done well; if I can cook as good as your grandmother, I have done well.  So I try to do that all the time, and you stretch out and do different things at different times, and try different things, but basically, you stay with what you are, and that's, and that's what it's all about.  The people in New Orleans [Louisiana], other restaurant owners in New Orleans have been good to me, and that's one thing you will find in New Orleans that you may not find anywhere else--that chefs kinda work together; they work with you, they--if you ask them--I mean if you go to Emeril [Lagasse]'s and you say, "Well, where can I get this?"  He'll say, "Well, you go to Leah for that," or I'll tell you, "You go to Paul Prudhomme for that."  Like people come here, "Can you blacken me some fish?"  "No.  I'm not blackening anything; I'm the only black thing in my kitchen, I'm not doing any blackened fish; that's not what I'm all about; Paul does that, that's his thing, you go to Paul to get that."  And that--and that's what you do.  And people have been real--the chefs have been extraordinary to me; really, really good to me because I'm not certified, I'm not formally trained like they are, but they include me in everything, and we work together, and I learn from them, and it's fun.

Speaker 1: Now, this is something new in '02 [2002], isn't it, because have there been any other--did you have any other predecessors in the black community that were accepted by the chefs of New Orleans [Louisiana] as a--
Speaker 2: No, none.  Austin [Leslie]--you know, when he had his restaurant.  Well, Austin is good; Austin is a good chef and he was good.
Speaker 1: What was his restaurant?
Speaker 2: Chez Helene.  You know, they had this little movie [sic, TV series]; "Frank's Place" was made on his thing.  Some of that spill off was--some was his thing, some was this restaurant because it was in this restaurant where clubs met, not in his restaurant; they met here from day one--from 1941 on; I've been having clubs like the Illinois Club, the Bunch Club--those kind of clubs; business clubs would meet here, and they still do.  So they kinda intertwined that and made that; it was a nice show--it was good for Austin.  I love Austin; he's a good man, and a good job, but his people--his sister died, his aunt, and those were people that would back him and help him, and when he lost them, then he couldn't--just couldn't keep it up, you know?  He got behind on some financial things which is not hard to do if you're trying to run a show by yourself; you can't do that.  As much as I complain about Dooky, I say, "Dooky, (mumbling)," and sometimes he'll say to me, "I don't know what you'd do without me."  And I said, "Well, why don't you just die and find out?"  But if he would die, I would really go bllllll--go bananas--because he takes care of all the taxes and all the things that are essential in a business where I can just go on with what I have to do, and that's what happened to him.  See, he had to do it all by himself, and that--you can't do that; you just cannot do that.  And that's what I think we have to learn in the black community; we have to learn that it's not so important to own that whole pie, it's better to own a piece out of a big pie than to try to own that little bitty thing, you know?  And we haven't learned that too well; we have to learn that, you know, you, you put it out here and you go for it and you make it grow, but you're not gonna do that by yourself; you just not gonna do that.  You have to market, you have to invest, and you have to go for it; I'm a believer in that.  I'll go for it, you know?
Story_ID: 62907
Speaker 1: Now, what are the hours at Dooky Chase['s Restaurant] here?  When do you open and when do you close?
Speaker 2: We open now at 11:30 and we close at 10:00, and that is kinda getting to me because I think that's too late to open; I--and I'm gonna do something about that.  I should be open no later than 11:00 because I like to get that lunch business, and people are at lunch at that time of the morning; I--I like that, and I would love to be able to stay open later.  When I came in here--you know, this was funny; we used to open at 10:00 in the morning and close at 4:00 in the morning, but people change, eating habits change.  Black people don't eat all hours of the night anymore, which is good; they learn that you eat dinner at dinnertime, at a dinner hour, and then you might come up--but I would still like to stay open late and remember those days when musicians would come in here after their gigs, as they call 'em, 2:00 in the morning, to eat fried chicken, to eat steaks, to eat everything--they were hungry; I like that, I like that; I would like to go back to that.  But instead of serving steaks and lobsters, I'd like a good breakfast at that time of mornin', and that's what I, I would like to do.  I'd like to stay open a little later.  But--but you have to get enough help and you have to get the help to help you do that; but that's the only thing that--I, I don't like that closing early.
Speaker 1: Tell me now, what is the--what do you think is the specialty of the house in terms of food?
Speaker 2: This house?  Gumbo.
Speaker 1: Gumbo.
Speaker 2: Gumbo and stuffed shrimp.  Everybody comes for gumbo; everybody comes for stuffed shrimp; I don't care where you are, you're coming to get that gumbo.
Speaker 1: Could you describe the gumbo and the stuffed shrimp for me?
Speaker 2: Well, gumbo in this house is like--you will go in any creole of color, as we call 'em, the creoles de couleur; in every home, that gumbo will be exactly like what you find here.  We use crab, shrimp, veal stew, ham, chicken, two kinds of sausage--all of that is in that gumbo, and they take great pains in making that gumbo.  Gumbo isn't what you think--anything you pull out of your refrigerator goes in that pot--that is not so, and that's not so with a creole; he takes his great pains making that gumbo.  And you go in that house and people will tell you, "You know, the one thing my momma never allows me to make?  She doesn't allow me to make that gumbo."  No, because if momma knows her gumbo, she's gonna do that gumbo; I don't care what else you do, she's gonna do that gumbo, it's a very special thing.  And it takes time, and you wanna do it well, so that's the one thing in this house is gumbo.  Stuffed shrimp is another thing; people like it because I don't think you get it too many places.  We stuff them with crab meat; we make the crab meat dressing, we stuff it in the shrimp, and then batter it and deep fry it; people like that a lot, too.  I never saw what they liked in it, but they do.  It isn't one of my favorite things, but they like that, and they like seafood.  They will come home to get that--what they call oyster-on-pan (ph.).  We do it--we get a bread that's like a sliced bread but we get it unsliced, and we go this way with it (DEMONSTRATION); see, we--so you got a slab of bread, like Texas Toast, but if you get a loaf on (ph.) bread, it's about this big (DEMONSTRATION), and they have oysters on it, and people like that--give you that oyster-on-pan; they--they like that kind of thing.  So some of those traditional things like that I, I never feel a need to change.  That's what they come looking for, and that's what you wanna give them.
Speaker 1: Now, in addition--well, what do you get for dessert here at Dooky Chase?  What what's the favorite dessert?
Speaker 2: Praline pudding; it is a bread pudding but it has pecans in it, it has praline liquor in it, and coconut; it's very rich, very rich, and we serve it with a kind of praline sauce--the pecans and the liquor sauce on it; people like that a lot.
Speaker 1: We'll see you later on that (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 62908
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  And this place has another significance in addition to the food and the ambience; it's been a place where black people have met to plan and develop (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, because you see--as I said, we've been here sixty--what--sixty-two, almost sixty-three years, and it was one place where people met even in segregation days when it was really illegal for blacks and white to congregate in public together anywhere; that was truly illegal.  Well, here, if the politicians had to meet black people, this is where they had to meet 'em unless they would go in somebody's church, but this is where they had to meet them here.  A lotta things--people come here and get things started and have meetings and go on because it was--and it still is, they still do that; they still come here.  If they wanna meet with people, they come and meet over lunch or dinner or something like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we heard a couple of days ago that SNCC used to meet here, and COFO [Council of Federated Organizations] was formed here, I think.  COFO was formed right here at Dooky Chase.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, because we had a woman working for us--Virgie [Castle], and Virgie was from Tennessee, but her daughter was big in the Civil Rights Movement; they have a street named after her--Oretha Castle Haley, and Oretha was big in the civil rights movement, and Virgie was an exceptional woman; why I say that, because Virgie--Virgie wasn't like me--she wasn't like a Leah, you know, she was supportive of what they were doin'; she didn't understand it, like none of us understood what the heck they're doin'; they in the streets, they parading in the streets, they, they sitting down, they're being dragged off to jail--you kinda didn't understand why, or you didn't understand was it worth this.  But Virgie was always supportive of that, and she lived around the corner; I think they trying to make her house a historic space, and they should because everybody was there--James Baldwin--they would go there and then come here to eat.  Everybody either slept at Virgie's house--I know took a bath there 'cause when they'd come outta jail I'd say, "Ayyy, go to Virgie's; go take a bath and come back here" (laughter).  "You mean you gonna put me out?"  I say, "Go take a bath at Virgie's and come back here, and I'll feed you" (laughter).  So that was then.  But she was very supportive of what her children were doing.  As I said, she maybe didn't--she didn't understand, but she wasn't anti-anything, and it was hard for her because police were all around her house all the time; it was just hard, it was really hard for her.
Speaker 1: This is Virgie--what's her last name?
Speaker 2: Castle.
Speaker 1: Castle--Virgie Castle.
Speaker 2: Um-hm (ph.).  And her daughter was Oretha Castle
Speaker 1: Could you spell that?
Speaker 2: Oretha, O-R-E-T-H-A.
Speaker 1: And Virgie?
Speaker 2: V-I-R-G-I-E.
Speaker 1: And Castle?
Speaker 2: C-A-S-T-L-E, um-hm.  And Oretha married a man name--[Richard] Haley was his last name.  What was his first name?  I, I just don't remember, but he was another bright man, really brilliant man, and did a lot of work, and was very supportive of his wife in her civil rights actions and what she did.  And you know, we used to be--like Thurgood Marshall would come through here and he was working with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]; in my age, that's what people were doing; we gonna work in the system, we gonna work this way with the NA--but you realize that that was so slow; we would still be today trying to get it done.  Sometimes you have to take drastic moves, just go at it, and that's what those young people did--they just took those drastic moves and run it.  Sometimes it was wrong moves, but that's okay; you, you had to get it done in some ways, and they were able to get it done--that we would've not been able to get it done working the slow system we were working at, you know?  It was not--you know, they were not gonna--we were not gonna make anybody understand where we were coming from.  Now, I think we could go a different route; I think the job of the NAACP now--I think it's a pity we still need it; it's just a pity that we still need the NAACP, Urban League and all those kinds of organizations.  But now, it should be an educational thing--teach people how to vote, how to vote for the right people, how to vote not necessarily for your friend, but for the man who's gonna move everything a step higher, for the man who's gonna move the country, for the man who's gonna move your city and involve you and involve everybody, and that, that's their job today.  I think it should be a lot on education and how we ought to go about thing.
Story_ID: 62909
Speaker 1: Now, now was the restaurant here like a major meeting place for the black mayoral candidates?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, my goodness (laughter); that's a whole 'nother story, yeah, yeah.  Dutch [Ernest Nathan "Dutch" Morial] was my good friend, and Dutch was good for us; Dutch made us under--made us feel like somebody.  Now, there was a mayor before Dutch; there were two mayors.  DeLesseps [Story "Chep"] Morrison started this, barely moving black people in.  [Maurice] Moon Landrieu came along and he did, but you gotta understand, times make men able to do what they do and how they do it.  When Moon Landrieu was mayor, he did involve black people; he tried to involve black people, but he did what he could do, you know, at that time. And I'm a strong believer in--you gotta preserve yourself sometimes, you know; you just can't kill yourself for the system or for whatever, you gotta let it work; and he did that, he did that very well.  Then, we came with Dutch; he was gonna be our first black mayor.  Well, we all had to come together and work for Dutch because it's something we had not had before, and Dutch was a brilliant man, he was brilliant and he was just arrogant enough to do what he had to do.  Some people call it arrogance, I call it confidence, you know; I call it confidence, you know.  And people do what they can do and what they--I do--I loved Dutch Morial because I loved his spunk; I like people with that push, with that drive, and I understood him, and sometimes that drive just got him in all kinda trouble.  People say, "Why don't you just give up?"  But you can't give up.  You know, you try to give up and then you wanna--you say, "No, I wanna go at it, I know what I can do."  And that's the way he was.  But Dutch was--he made us really feel like we belonged, and that was a good thing; every black man kinda got a feel of his worth, and I think that's what Dutch did--made every man feel his worth.
Story_ID: 62910
Speaker 1: Let me ask you--what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: I would like to see them again.  We lost a lot--I feel we lost a lot in the black community because we lost, basically, our good things.  You know, you can join somebody else's group, but you don't have to lose you; you don't have to lose what you're all about.  I can work with you, and you can be your thing and I can be mine, basically, and that's what I did all though life lookin' for my role models.  I don't have to become you to be--to do what I have to do and to believe what I have to believe in, and I think that's what we did in the black community, you know?  You know, black people prayed a lot; we prayed a lot.  We could call on God when we didn't have nobody else to call on, but that's our heritage, that's where we came from; that's the only thing that made us survive.  But why do we give it up?  Because it isn't fashionable--'cause it isn't fashionable to say, "Lord, have mercy?"  That isn't fashionable?  So we give that up--it wasn't nothin' wrong with that; it wasn't gonna hurt anybody, it was just what we're all about, and it--it worked for us.  We were honest, we were clean.  You know, when you went out, your momma'd brush your hair down tight and put that Vaseline so you wouldn't be ashy skinned; you were shinin' out there.  We lost that because the system said, "That's okay, you can go around lookin' like this."  No, you can't; you can't do that.  You gotta make yourself somebody, and they're not gonna look at you if you lookin' any kinda way; you gotta be yourself.  You were not that before, so don't start it now--those kinda things.  But when Dutch [Morial] came to be mayor [of New Orleans, Louisiana] and, I guess (unclear), then--we then really felt like we were a part of the system.  I'll never forget when he died.  You know what the people said and I thought that was so hard to say, and to hear them say that?  "We have nobody; we have nobody.  We have lost everything we had."  Because we were depending on him to bring us up; he could talk for us, he could do this for us.  Dutch would come out here and be like God came out there 'cause he could talk to every man; he could talk to every man and help them and show them, not--he's not gonna give you everything, he's gonna show you how to get something done.  I'll never forget, standing in my back door one night, heard these two guys talk.  One had just got outta prison and he was tellin' the other one, "Man, I don't know what to do.  I don't have a job, and I don't know what to do."  So the other one told him, "Well, go to Dutch; go to Dutch, he showed me how to work with people and he will show you how to work with people."  You know?  And it wasn't to give you anything; he's gonna show you how to do things, and that's all we need to do is we need to show people where to get advice, show them what to do, tell them how to move and how to make the moves they have to make if they don't know how; and that's what he was good about, and I think that's what every leader should do, you know?  I can't see how they can't understand that because, you know, if you workin' with a majority of people, please get that majority uplifted, please make that majority move and do the things you, you have to do, and I, I think people oughta do that a little bit more, you know?  Just make every man feel his worth, and then you will rise up yourself, and everybody else will rise up with you.
Story_ID: 62911
Speaker 1: For the past--I know--twenty years or so, at least, you have received so many awards and honors.  Can you give us some of the highlights of some of the honors and awards that you received?
Speaker 2: You know, every time I receive those awards I appreciate 'em, I did them; then I would feel sad because lots of people should be doing things that I did.  It shouldn't be just one person linin' the wall up with plaques; everybody should be doin' somethin'.  Everybody could do the same thing.  It means stretchin' yourself, it means doin' what you have to do, and everybody should do that, and that's hard to get people to understand.  And that's the one thing my daddy [Charles Lange] and all his ignorance taught us, that no matter who you are, how poor you are, there is something you can do to make a difference, and he taught us that.  People say, "But I don't have any money."  That's the biggest cop-out there is, is "I don't have any money."  I'm not asking you for money, I'm asking you for service; I'm asking you to do something yourself--doesn't cost any money.  And I always say that.  I don't do--mayors will tell you that--"Do this, I don't have the money."  I'm not asking you for money; money isn't everything.  There are things you can do, services you can render without any money that would help uplift everybody, that would help your city, and that's the only thing that--I'm grateful for all those plaques, I'm grateful to bring 'em back to my community--to show the people here if I can do this, so can you.  If I can do this, you can do the same thing; it means stretchin' yourself.  Plenty of times I, I would like to go home and go to bed too, but I can't; I have to do what I have to do.  And I can't live like that; I can't live goin' to my job and then home, goin' to my job and then home; I could not live like that.  I have to be involved, I have to do somethin' else.  But the biggest award that I, I liked my--I get--my A.P. Tureaud Medal that I got from the NAACP, and it's always great to have your own people appreciate you; that is great, that is one of the greatest rewards I have is that A.P. Tureaud Medal.  If I could come close to A.P. Tureaud, who sacrificed a lot, a lot of work, to do the things and to better lives for other people--and he was a man, too; he never once said, "I don't have the time."  It meant sometimes not being home with his family, it meant his family sacrificing all that for what he had to do, but he did it, and I--I like that about him, so I like that award, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Now, before we go further, I just wanted to clarify who H.P. (ph.) (unclear) is--
Speaker 2: A.P. Tureaud (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Spell his name, spell his name, first of all.
Speaker 2: His last name is spelled T-U-R-E-A-U-D; I think that's the correct spellin'.  He was--I, I never knew what his--Oh, Alex was his first name; it must have been Alexander; I don't know what the P was for, but his last name was Tureaud, T-U-R-E-A-U-D, I think, is the way he spelled it.  But he was a lawyer; he was an attorney here--one of our first black attorneys in this area, and he did a lot of work with the NAACP--a lot of civil rights work.  He put his whole life to that; his whole life was that kind of work, and there was nothin' you could tell Mr. Tureaud that he didn't look into if it was gonna better your life, if it was gonna be somethin' he could do to help you--that kinda man; so I was pretty grateful for that medal--for that award.  If I could be any way close to what he was, which I can't.  Another award that I have, that I need to put out, is the Loving Cup [New Orleans Times-Picayune Loving Cup Award]; now, that's the highest award you could get in this city [New Orleans, Louisiana] for services.  I was really happy to bring that to this community, you know, because you know who gets the Loving Cup Award?  All the big people, you know, the Kabacoffs; ooh, that man was wonderful; he deserved that award (laughter).  Lester Kabacoff and all the big people--Dr. [Albert W.] Dent--and Dr. Dent was the first black ever to receive that award, and rightly so; he needed to do it because he had done a lot.  And then Norman Francis with Xavier, who has done a lot.  So I was so grateful to receive--the only black woman that ever received--I could not believe it, I could not believe that I had received that award, but I was happy to bring it to the community.  And then I received award for--it's called the Ella Brennan Savoir Faire Award; I'm grateful for that, too, because if I could be like that woman, that would be wonderful.  She's worked it, she's done wonderful things for people; and it's given by your peers, by the other chefs, so you kinda glad to see that they thought enough of you to give you this award.  So awards mean you just better keep workin' and try to help other people and, and to just keep going and doing things for the community.
Story_ID: 62912
Speaker 1: Now, ma'am, did your father [Charles Lange] and mother [Hortensia Lange] live to see you become a successful restaurateur?
Speaker 2: No--no, they did not, and I, I kinda wonder; they would be so proud, they would be so proud, and my sisters and my brothers are really proud of what work I've done.  Sometimes, they tell me, "You need to stop; now, you've done enough; you need to stop."  But they--I couldn't do that without them because they have backed me in everything I've done.  All of my life my sisters were there for me; when I was pushin' children through school and raisin' funds for schools, they were they; they were always there for me--all the time.  So I'm, I'm grateful for that; a lot of people were always there to help me.  So you don't really get awards by yourself--you can't; somebody else always helped you.  We, we--Dooky [Edgar Chase, Sr.]--I tease him all the time about his--you know, Dooky's not that kinda person, but if he would not back me and support me, then I couldn't do the things I do either.  Even though he can't do 'em or he would never do them, but he supported me in whatever I tried to do.  So it's always many people that help you get awards where you get them--a lot of people.
Story_ID: 62913
Speaker 1: Now, what would you--looking back on it all, what do you see as your legacy?  I know you're still doing new things, but--
Speaker 2: I would like--I would still like to get this restaurant A-1.  Before I get outta here, I would like to leave it a good restaurant in a black community; I would like to do that, and for people to say, "Look at this, and it's in a black community; look at this, and it's in a black community"--to show people that we can have things, we can do things, we--we like each other enough to be able to--like in here, I want people to get the best service they can get.  We deserve it; black people deserve it.  They been at this a long time, so give that to them; give it to them, and you don't have to move out of a community and leave people behind.  We could've moved outta this community, I guess, and it would go shoooop (ph.) (DEMONSTRATION) flattened out; you can't do that.  You make that community and you make it work.  When you leave, then it doesn't work, and that's what has happened to a lotta things; people just leave.  You know, of course, they wanna do better things, I guess, and live better, but when you leave, then nobody has anything to hang on to.  You can't take a bunch of poor people, black or white, and group 'em together; they have nothin'--nothin' to grab onto.  But if one person stays there with enough going for them, they'll say, "Ooh, we gonna try to do that; we gonna try to be like that," or "We gonna try a little something else."  See, you gotta hope you got somethin' to hang on to, and that--that's what I'd like to do; I'd like to leave a good restaurant in the middle of this community.
Story_ID: 62914
Speaker 1: And, ma'am, this is slightly different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Just as a good person.  Just as a person who tried to help people; just as a person who, who lived and enjoyed life, that's all--in whatever way you wanna show people that you enjoy living, and that's what I like to see people do.  I like to see people enjoy living.  It means work, but okay; you can enjoy work, too, you know?  You don't have to play all the time to enjoy living; there's a lotta things around you--people, things that are just beautiful things; but I'd like people to enjoy living, and just go about life lookin' at it that way.  Now, we puttin' a little bit too much emphasis on the dollar.  The dollar's gonna come; it's gonna be there if you do what you have to do.  If you work and you work well, the dollar is gonna be there for you, so you concentrate on doing whatever you do well, and the rewards will come.  It's just like living; if you do it well every day, if you work with other people--you cannot live without working for other people, can't live without doin' something for somebody else.  My son--the one thing I heard my son say--he used to be on the board of a bank called Bank One, and he's now rotated off of that board, but he still wears that little One in his lapel.  And I said to him, "Son, why do you wear that little One in your lapel?--you know, you're off the board."  He said, "That One reminds me, mother that every day I must do one thing for somebody else."  And I thought that was the greatest thing I ever heard.  You cannot go through life unless you do somethin' for somebody else every day; you will live a successful life, you will live a happy life if you do that.  And that's all I want to do, is to leave something for somebody to hang on to that they can enjoy life and enjoy whatever there is to enjoy.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
