Speaker 1: But I'd like you to start out by stating your name and spelling it for us.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And I just want to state it.  So--and I'd like to have your birth date and today's date and your position.
Speaker 2: I'm Edmund Barry Gaither, E-D-M-U-N-D, B-A-R-R-Y, G-A-I-T-H-E-R.  And I was born in Fairfield County, South Carolina in 1944, October the 6th.  And, I presently am director of the Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists [Boston, Massachusetts].  I also serve as chief curator here.  And I'm an adjunct curator and special consultant at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston [Massachusetts].  Today's date is February 12th.  The old birth date of President [Abraham] Lincoln.  The year 2001.

Speaker 1: What is your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of year would be summer.  I like heat and humidity.  I don't like cold.  Fall would be next in line because it's such a colorful time of year in a broad way.  Spring is after that.  Spring also has color.  But spring color is color of promise.  It's green that's still yellow.  Because it hasn't really come into its own.  And it's spots of intense color with annuals and other perennials that bloom.  But the fall is a more generalized treatment of the earth in ochre tones of orange and reds.  It's a great time of year. Winter, however, is for people who like to bundle up.  And I don't.  I like to stick to what I touch.  So that's summer time.
Speaker 1: Okay, favorite color?  I mean favorite--yeah.
Speaker 2: My favorite color?  I think that my favorite color is probably blue.  I hadn't really thought about it a lot.  Because I, I tend to think of colors in batches rather than as stand alones.  But I think probably blue because It's a color that is so strongly associated with infinity.  And I think of infinity as parallel to imagination.  In that both of them are without bounds.  So in that sense blue is also the, the kind of color I would give to imagination.
Speaker 1: Favorite, time of year.  No.  I don't want to say the time of year,  I'm sorry.  Favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food.  That's a difficult one because one of the things that my women friends, my mother [Fannie May Little Gaither]and aunts and all of them have always liked about me is that I'm not at all fussy about food.  I tend to eat and enjoy what's put before me.  I guess, I would have to say chicken.  But I'm sure that chicken is the favorite food of so many southerners that if you asked, at random, you would find it very high on the list.
Speaker 1: Favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: That one is very hard to answer because I have no history of vacations. For almost all of my work life, I've had the enjoyment of a lot of travel being integrated into my work.  So I've never thought about vacation.  And since I've been married, which is only a few years now, I have been pressed to think about vacation.  And I've really not developed a favorite vacation place.  I could only say that wherever it would be, it would be further south, warmer and sunny.
Speaker 1: Favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, I think probably my--the saying that I evoke a lot, I mean there are actually two of them.  And they both have to do both with my work and with a certain kind of promotion that you have to do.  One is that "Every duck has to praise his own pond."  Which is a, a reminder that, that you have to be the advocate for what it is that you do and you think is important.  The second is, "If you look dead, people will throw dirt in your face."  And this is a reminder that if you want to get some place, and to enjoy some prosperity and promise, you have to look like you're at that place.  And if you look like the lame person, if you look like you're already defeated, lots of people will jump on and help bury you.  So, so I'd say the pair of those are good for me.
Story_ID: 7440
Speaker 1: Now I want to start--we usually start asking about your family background.  And, and what you know and I know that--I'd like to start with your, your father.  And I'd like you to talk about his side of the family.  You know, give me his name and, you know, what you know about his, you know, his family.
Speaker 2: My father was Walter--is Walter Bernard Gaither.  And he was also born in Great Falls, South Carolina, which is where I was born too.  If you define it a little more than the county.  He grew up there, and actually in the time that he grew up there he got a better high school education than I did.  He grew up when the schools in the town were, for the most part, owned by churches that built them for--black schools, that built them for the students within walking distance of those churches.  Of course, the state paid the teachers and so forth.  So my father went to Paradise School which was owned by Paradise AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion Church.  And, he had Greek and Latin among other things, none of which existed when I was in high school, decades later in the same town.  My father's parents were farmers.  And they owned a track of land so they weren't sharecroppers.  They were a subsistence household.  They raised most of what they ate for the animals, the, vegetables, the fruits and so forth.  And my father's mother who we always called Grandma Bunch even though her name was Frances also was from that small town.  The two of them went to Pleasant Grove AME Zion Church.  And most of my family on my father's side are buried in the cemetery of Pleasant Grove AME Zion Church.  We grew up very actively in that church tradition.  My father was genuinely a remarkable man in the following ways.  When he was a young man, he chose to go to junior college.  And my Aunt Minnie, my father's oldest sister had gone to Clinton Junior College in Rock Hill [South Carolina] which was about thirty-five miles north of Great Falls.  Clinton was a junior college owned by the AME Zion Church.  Friendship [College, Rock Hill, South Carolina] was next to Clinton College.  It was a junior college owned by the Baptist church.  And it was partly through the grace of my Aunt Minnie that my father went to, to Friendship.  It was there that he met my mother [Fannie May Little Gaither].  And, and--so we're all a product in a very real sense of his having gone there.  When he finished there, he and my mother married they settled in my father's hometown.  And my father started to work at a mill.  My hometown was virtually owned by J. P. Stevens [and Company, Inc.] who had three cotton mills there, so my father worked there.  And later my father began teaching and resumed his education at Benedict College, in Columbia, South Carolina.  And when I was a small boy at the dawn of the '50s [1950s], my father worked a full day and drove forty miles to Benedict College to complete his degree work.  At that point both my mother and father were teaching.  My father was interested in, moving along and perhaps becoming a principal.  And thus the commitment to this ongoing study.  But in '54 [1954], in South Carolina, the school system was purged of teachers who were alleged to have anything to do with the NAACP [National Association for Advancement of Colored People].  So my mother really became unemployable in South Carolina public schools after that.  And my father also left teaching, and went into brick and tile work. Brick and tile work actually paid more than teaching.  So for the next long period of our family life, my father and several of my uncles were working in brick and tile work.  The jobs were never in the town we lived in.  So they commuted to jobs that were forty to eighty miles away on a daily basis.  And doing that, my father assumed the burden of seeing that the five of us, his children all got through college, and holding the house together.  And doing all of that for most of the period without my mother being able to work.  So I often thought if any thing had happened to my father, over that long period of time.  If he had been ill or had an accident or anything our lives would have come out a radically different way.  So I think that my father feels that his life was one that was singularly blessed.  And, and I would have to say I feel the same way about it.  He has never had any serious health issues.  He has always had a great commitment to, to work.
Story_ID: 7441
Speaker 1: And there's one other story about his [ Walter Bernard Gaither] character that I'd like to share because it's a story that in a certain sense has been very influential in my own life decisions.  The church that we went to when we were small, Pleasant Grove AME Zion Church [Great Falls, South Carolina], had been constructed after the Civil War by a group of men from several families that were loosely related, what in the south people call family folk.  So they were the Gaithers, the Perrys, the Holmes, the Gunthrops and they were all sort of meshed in ways that you didn't always see on the surface.  At any rate, this church was a frame structure that sat on big rocks.  And by the beginning of the '50s [1950s] it sagged between them.  And the whole structured had a bit of a tilt.  So, the trustees of the church made the decision that they would build a new church.  The plan for this was that the men in the church who were in building trades would physically construct the new church.  And the women of the church would raise the money to support the purchase of the materials and so forth.  And, it was undertaken in the spirit.  Well not far along, the men dwindled.  They had illness here or crisis there.  And it became for a period of time only my father who was working on building that church.  And he was building it with his Saturdays, with portions of the day left after work in the summer.  And over a period which I think was probably three years, he worked and built that church.  Built the pulpits, did the wiring, did the preliminary plumbing.  Coming up to the end of the work people reappeared and reassumed roles and bringing it to finish.  Over the period of that time, my mother [Fannie May Little Gaither] complained.  She said, "When you finish with that, it isn't gonna belong to you.  Those other men promised that just like you did.  Why aren't they doing it?"  And my father's answer was that, when he promised to do it, he promised for himself.  So if they defaulted, that was their business.  But he didn't have any intention of defaulting on the promise that he made.  And in fact their promises were irrelevant to what his commitment was.  And, and he was very focused in that way.  When the project was finished, the church was dedicated.  People who deserved very little credit for it were there to receive as much as anybody else.  My father made no great issue of it.  I think from my father's point of view, he did what he felt was the right thing for him to do.  And he took having done that to be substantially its own reward.  And the other aspects of unfairness, which are endemic to human enterprises, he never wasted time fretting over.  And I took that as a kind of important model in my own life.  And when I had started to work myself and discovered myself biting off something that had to be built,  as an activity that was uninsured.  And one in which I was putting as much of what I earned as I was taking out.  I slowly saw myself sort of in my father's mold.  And I saw the moral proposition of it very much in the same way that he had seen the moral proposition of it.  And I thought, I don't really want to get married.  Because I didn't want to ask someone else to defer what they wanted or expected so that I could do what I thought I had to do and put my resources there.  And whatever deprivations would be precipitated from it, I was prepared to assume them for myself.  But I didn't want somebody else complaining that I was shirking some fundamental responsibility.  So, very much the decision that I made personally to sort of work at what I undertook with such a focus and, and to really do it fundamentally alone.  It was in part a reflection of how I, how I understood as a child looking at that process and the history of my family.  And I'd perhaps misunderstood it because as a child, your frame of understanding is so narrow.  But I, I do think there were some lessons from it about what it means to take on something and wrestle with it, and about to whom one is ultimately responsible for how you expend your energy.  And, and I think those lessons were good lessons.
Story_ID: 7442
Speaker 1: Now I have--you came out of a family that was pretty--you know very steep in tradition in that community.  And I was wondering if your father [Walter Bernard Gaither] ever shared with you any stories of his growing up there.
Speaker 2: Well my father, of course, has lots of stories about the people who were--whom I called uncle, and whom I knew as my father's friends and my grandfather's friends for growing up in that town.  And, and they were often stories really about I guess coming of age, kinds of stories, from his own times there.  My aunt who is actually also very talkative and who's now in her nineties and still full of stories, sometimes shared in these stories.  A number of the stories also spent around the camp meeting.  Because my own town [Great Falls, South Carolina] has a camp meeting that happens every third week of August, and seems to have happened since the 19th century.  And that brought back to Great Falls all of your aunts and uncles who had gone away, and who came back like a homecoming.  And that was especially true I guess until into the '60s [1960s] when traveling to and fro ceased to be quite as unusual a thing as it, as it had been. So my father had lots of stories about those kinds of things.  He had one story about--well, I have to set this up a little bit, you, you know, small southern places think of themselves in terms of a narrow geography.  So, where my parents--where my grandparents' family stead was, was on one side of the river.  And the little township was on the other side of the river.  And from where my parents--my grandparents lived, you referred to Great Falls as 'over the river'.  And the river was like this big marker.  So to say--in, in how large it loomed locally, it was like talking about going overseas.  So you had the impression that this was really a great distance.  And I had one grandaunt who never (with emphasis) went over the river.  She never went to Great Falls.  So my, my, my--my father told me a story one time about his father who had acquired a new car that he hadn't learned to drive.  Back in the days when everything was a shift with clutch and gearbox.  And, and he drove the car across to Great Falls in only one gear, never shifting it through to the others.  So--this car would have been going vooo, vooo, vooo.  And every time you'd let off the pedal, the, the thing of course would start to slow down because of the--it was in the wrong gear and you needed to move it on. So, so this was a very funny story to us.  Because we were growing up when automatic transmissions were coming in and the notion of one not knowing how to drive seemed peculiar.  Because we, of course, didn't appreciate that in the time of my grandfather, cars will still pretty new and not everybody had them.  So it wouldn't have been strange that you didn't quite know how to, how to make it behave in the way that it should.
Story_ID: 7443
Speaker 1: Now did you get any sense of--or do you have any sense because I'd seen that you've done a lot of genealogical study.  Your family, do you have any idea of what the origins were, your African origins were at all?
Speaker 2: I have no idea about the African origins.  But I do have some interesting information about the Caucasian side of our family.  You have to look hard in the, in the South in most places to find a family that does not have some crossover to Native American or to Caucasian.  My grandfather who was maybe a little larger than I am was about the same complexion that I am and had this sort of heavy wavy hair that used to be much prized.  My grandmother, his wife could have passed for white.  So if you'd just bumped into her, and you didn't have any other context, she could have been on either side of, of the tree.  And, and recently, I mean within the last decade, we found out who her father, who was white, was.  And, and the family was a family that is as old in that town as we are, Gaither is not their name.  Now my older brother, Herman [Kenneth Gaither] became very interested in this.  And sort of on behalf of the five of us, took on trying to find out as much as he could about our family history.  And most of the black portions of the family came from within a kind of three county area of where we grew up.  The Gaither name itself came to Great Falls [South Carolina] with descendents of the white Gaither family in Maryland.  The family associated with Gaithersburg, Maryland.  And, they were in Great Falls for a period of time.  Not very long after the Civil War, they--most of them left.  My brother found that a couple of sisters from the family who had married locally stayed.  But, of course, they didn't bear that name.  So now in Great Falls there are no white Gaithers to be found except in the cemetery.  So the only white Gaithers around there are cemetery bound.  And all of the Gaithers that you would run into are black.  There are maybe three clans of black Gaithers who acknowledge each other as family folk.  But the detailing of those relationships are not entirely clear.  One of the people that my father [Walter Bernard Gaither] grew up with from his boyhood, and who never lived more than perhaps two miles from us, turns out to be a linear descendent of the white forebearers of my grandmother.  He is a man that my father knew all of his life without knowing that they were in fact blood relations, until a little incident of about four or five years ago.  I'll tell you just this little story because it's sort of how these things work themselves out.  When my father retired from doing brick and tile work, he didn't retire from working because my father loves to build.  So he started to take little jobs that kept him busy.  And he took a little job at a big old two story family estate not too far around from us.  And one day he was working around there repairing a chimney.  And he was in the second floor of the house.  They--the man who had asked him was up there with him, and started to talk about the portraits that were in the room.  And my father I guess was seeming mystified.  So the man dropped the conversation and went on to talk about nothing of much consequence.  Later my father mentioned the story to my mother [Fannie May Little Gaither] in the presence of my aunt, who's I guess, five years older than my father.  So, my aunt spoke up and said, "He was trying to show you your grandfather."  And my aunt knew about this relationship all the while, and my father didn't. And these kinds of things are not really rare in, in, in southern families.
Speaker 1: So did you have a sense that it was, was there--you know, there's a perception that there were--a lot of these were rape relationships.  And there's the other thing that they were legitimate, you know, relationships really.
Speaker 2: I have no way to speculate on the character of the relationship.  But I will say this about race in the South as I see it.  In a little place like where I grew up, the amount of dalliance across racial borders was considerable, and everyone knew it.  There was even one man who lived down on the river who was known to have a pair of mistresses that everybody knew about.  The exact nature of the relationships are hard to place but, these kinds of things were inherently contradictory.  We had a cross burned on our lawn when my oldest brother [Thomas Walter Gaither] worked as a field secretary for CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] in Mississippi in the '60s [1960s].  Could have been exactly the same people who were blood relatives to us in one way or another.  So there was this dimension of small places in the South where the same people were in a certain way 'Jekyll and Hyde'.  If there was a local catastrophe, people came to help.  But at other moments, the same people were busy strictly enforcing very unfair social strictures, and administering injustice.  So the two sides of this, the side of active prejudice and the side of human compassion tended to be in the same sets of people and never resolved.  And at the recent death of my mother, a number of white relatives, of white neighbors who also have been in that town all of their life came, and paid respect to my mother.  This wouldn't really be that strange.  Even in the old times when I was a child if somebody lived to be very old and died, people from both black and white community would come and pay respects to these people they'd known a long time.  That didn't happen if you died young.  But if you lived to be an elder, in a certain way that was a respect that everybody thought was due to you.  But at my mother's wake when people were coming and going, my oldest brother and I were just reflecting on how many conversations and how much potential to understand each other had been lost.  Because that kind of coming to and fro and neighborly sharing really has become possible in the last fifteen years, in a way that was never true over the last hundred years.
Story_ID: 7444
Speaker 1: Now your mother--family--.
Speaker 2: My mother was Fannie May Little until she married my father [Walter Bernard Gaither].  And the two sides of her family were the Littles and the Beattys (ph.).  My mother's father, [R.] Luvelle Little was a [textile] mill worker in Anderson, South Carolina.  Actually more specifically in Starr [South Carolina] which is a little area at the edge of Anderson.  And he worked there, I think, all of his life.  Because I remember he got a gold watch for his many years of service there.  And I recently came to have it, because it was in the possession of my mother.  My mother's mother was named Mollie [B. Little].  And she died close to when I was born.  I never knew her.  But my grandfather, Luvelle I knew.  My Grandma Mollie was a housewife.  And she raised my aunts and uncles and she also made butter, and that was to augment the income of the family.  And I have her butter churn because my mother had her butter churn and gave it to me a few years ago.  They were people who believed in education.  And they had a family of largely daughters.  So I have five aunts.  My mother had four sisters and three brothers.  And the three brothers were all last.  And most of my aunts became teachers.  You know in--there was a period in the south when if a family had limited resources, particularly a family that was starting from a lower socioeconomic place, they invested the money in the education of daughters.  And, and this was on the principle that the largest job market in the south was in teaching.  And a daughter always had a very good chance if she had the background to become a teacher.  And it made her less dependent on the husband.  So that if her marriage for whatever reasons didn't work, she had a way to be independent and respectable.  This was actually at odds with being higher up.  'Cause if you were higher up in the social strata, the emphasis tended to be on the sons, who were then seen as perhaps becoming professionals.  And, and at a higher up level, people were more interested in what used to be called finishing for wives, to make appropriate wives for professional husbands.  But at the level where my grandparents on my mother's side were entering, the education of daughters was very important.  And as much as my grandparents could, they saw to the education of all of their daughters.  And several of them became teachers.  And my mother became a teacher.  My mother's aspiration had been to be a singer.  That's what she really wanted to do.  And, when she was thinking about going to school, she was really thinking about where she could go that might assist her in a singing career.  But where you got to go to school often depended on other sets of relationships.  My mother grew up in a large Baptist church in Anderson County [South Carolina].  And people who were very interested in the uplift of the race and who were reasonably successful were always looking for how they could make a way for other younger people that they saw as assisting in this process.  And they often were doing that by helping to root you to a school where they had contacts and could help your family, get a situation that they could manage fiscally.  So my mother got rooted to Friendship Junior College [later Friendship College, Rock Hill, South Carolina], because it was a Baptist school.  And people in her home church knew of it, and had some relationships there.  So that became a place where my grandmother was willing to send her daughter, that far from home and be comfortable that she would be in a proper setting in a proper context.  And where they could manage the bills.  So it was at Friendship that my mother and my father met.  My mother was a woman with a very keen sense of how to read character.  And I think we were all impressed growing up that she didn't get easily deceived by anybody.  She and my father turned out to be an excellent pair for each other.  My father was always a person who could absorb a certain amount of pressing, without it showing.  He used to say to, to me when I was growing up that, "You have to learn to hear and not hear."  Which I think is what people mean now by "picking your fights."  That you don't have to respond to everything.  And in order to get along with people, you have to be able to sort of do that.  My mother could be quite pushy and stubborn about the things that she cared a lot about.  So she and my father made a good complement in their lives.  And, and they were married for some sixty-three or sixty-four years, and really never apart for more than very short period in all of that marriage. Because during the second war [World War II], my father worked briefly at the dockyard.  But my father was never out of the country even then.  And I was born in '44 [1944], which is right in the middle of the war.  So that's evidence that my father was--my mother and father were, were never really separated, even at that period.
Story_ID: 7445
Speaker 1: They both held in common a conviction that education was exceedingly important.  And also a conviction that you had a social responsibility to sort of move along the progress of, of black people.  So when I was quite small, I remember going with my parents [Walter Bernard Gaither and Fannie May Little Gaither] and my brothers and sisters to see Walter White when he was head of NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And I remember going to Charlotte [North Carolina] to see Thurgood Marshall when he was at that role.  And when Mary McLeod Bethune came near, we went to see her.  So, so there was a sense also of the civic engagement.  And later on when my brothers and sisters and even, even when I was involved in the Civil Rights Movement, my parents were very supportive of that.  And they understood that immediately in terms of a larger set of historical issues that we were called upon to, to struggle with.  I look a lot like my mother physically.  My mother was very beautiful.  So I'm not making a, a--this is nothing about myself.  But, but I really I think I look a lot like my mother.  And as I've gotten older, I'm more like it.  My teeth are like my grandfather's [R. Luvelle Little].  My mother's father had sort of small teeth that were spaced out this way.  So we used to sort of joke about that a little bit.  My mother, (pause) I think her notion about family rearing was that she wanted you to decide what you wanted to do.  To think about it.  And then she would support you in it.  So all of us, made the large decisions about our lives pretty much.  And my parents supported that.  I think the only arena where there was not such latitude was in where to go as an undergraduate, because that very much had to do with the money for it to happen.  My--when my mother was teaching and there were no kindergartens in the South.  When, when my oldest brother Thomas was old enough, my mother took him with her to school.  And when my second brother Herman was four, my mother started to take him too.  So my two oldest brothers were always in the same grade.  And that meant that when it came time to go to college, they both went to college together.  And, and my family struck, a workable agreement with Claflin College in Orangeburg [South Carolina] and my two brothers went there.  And my sister Glenda [Jean Gaither Davis], who was ready to go to college their fourth year, so it would be three of us in college, really didn't have a lot of choice about it, because my parents could make a better arrangement for three in one place, than they could if everybody had been dispersed between places.  I was the first one not to go there.  I said to myself,  "Of all possibilities, I don't want to go where two brothers and a sister have gone."  But, but my parents sort of, except for that decision, went along with the decisions pretty much that, that we made.  They did impose a requirement to it.  The requirement was that we were all expected to work in the summer and earn a semester's tuition and buy our winter clothes.  And then everything after that fell on my father.  And where possible, we were encouraged to try to find other work that we could do as we went to school.  Anyhow, back to my, my mother.  So my mother was really very good about all of that.  Thinking about letting people make decisions, I guess the reason that came to my mind was because, when each of my sisters decided to get married, and, and came to my mother and said they were going to get married.  You know sometimes parents can be very intervening about these kinds of decisions.  And my parents never were.  They said, "Have you thought about this?  Is that who you want to marry?"  And then after that, they were aboard.  So, so I always appreciated that about my mother.  And especially because she was such a good reader of character.  Even if she might have thought she saw reasons to be cautionary, she didn't intervene based on those.  But instead, allowed you to make your own--to encounter your own problems, and make your own solutions.  And I think that takes a great deal of faith.  I think that was possible because I think both of my parents were of the conviction that if you did your best to rear your children, to have the kinds of values that you wanted them to have, that some how they wouldn't get too alienated from that.  And it was a confidence that we would manage to steer our way through.  And I think it was in the long term a logically justifiable confidence.

Speaker 1: Could you, you told me the first three siblings.  Now your first--you have one younger sibling?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And her name?
Speaker 2: Diane [Gaither Thompson].  And I'll tell you a very funny story about Diane.  Diane is almost five years younger than I am.  She was born in '49 [1949], the beginning of '49 [1949] and I was born at the end of '44 [1944].  And, we'd gone to church on Sunday.  And Brother Perry who is one of the members at our church had a new daughter who was born just a few days earlier than my sister Diane.  So I had seen this baby at church--this new baby.  And then when my sister was born, which must have been like about the Tuesday following.  I was sure she was the same baby I had seen at church.  So I kept thinking, "When are they going to take her back to Brother Perry?"  Some how it, it--I'm sure they had told me I was expecting a sister--I mean I'm sure they had properly prepared me.  But some how in my head I kept thinking, "This is the same little girl I saw at church.  And they must be planning to take her home sooner or later or whatever."  So it was very funny.  And I like to tease Diane about it.  We have, we have a lot of fun around it.  There are five of us.  I mean sort of two years apart from my oldest brother Thomas Walter who is named after my father [Walter Bernard Gaither]--the Walter after my father to my second brother Herman Kenneth to my sister Glenda Jean. You see all of this is running true to the South with a middle name.  And then I was born.  And my sister Diane has no middle name.  So, so she's the only one of us who didn't have that little attachment in there.

Speaker 1: Well now let's talk about a young Barry Gaither, Edmund Barry Gaither.  You don't like that first name do you?
Speaker 2: No.  I never did.  I always thought it was stiff and obtuse.  And--so I always liked being called Barry.  And almost everybody calls me Barry.  And when somebody calls me Edmund Barry I think I'm about to be chastised.  Because when I was growing up and you got called your whole name, it meant that you had--you were in for some trouble.  I mean something--you were being called on one thing or another.  So I have tended in the last few years to use my whole name.  But for most of my life Barry was the only thing I said.  And when I was a little boy I used to be called 'Barry Boy'.  And that was a nice little rhyme.  I had other nicknames I won't repeat.  But Barry Boy was an acceptable one that I did have.  And I enjoyed it.  And Barry always seemed much more of a warm name than Edmund.  There's something about the clip of the D and the M in Edmund that already makes it have a certain rigidity as a name.  And I certainly didn't like Eddy--I mean the other ways that you might have softened that as a first name.
Story_ID: 7448
Speaker 1: Now what were you like?  How would you describe yourself as a young person?
Speaker 2: Well (pause) there certainly are some ways that I deviated from my brothers.  I mean, in, in my family, my two brothers [Thomas Walter Gaither and Herman Kenneth Gaither] are together, my sister [Glenda Jean Gaither Davis] and then I come along.  So I'm four years from my older brother.  I think I had a good physique always.  But I didn't have a large interest in sports.  My father [Walter Bernard Gaither] had been a pitcher on the black team in my hometown.  And he liked that.  He played ball.  Both of my brothers were good at baseball and at basketball.  I never had much interest in either.  So, so I played very little of sports.  I think the only fight I ever had in my life was tied to sports.  That was when I was going to one-teacher school [Mitford Elementary School, Great Falls, South Carolina]. We were at recess one day and all the boys were playing baseball.  And it was my turn at bat.  And some other kid was going to take my turn.  And I just dec--I wasn't mad--I just decided in principle that I shouldn't surrender my turn unfairly.  And that's actually the only physical fight I ever really had.  So, so that's not been something--that kind of excessive physicality of, of that never interested me.  So anyhow I was interested from very early on in drawing, and in reading and making things.  So, my older brother Herman and I used to have armies.  This is in the time of the Korean Conflict.  We would occasional see convoys of planes flying over, going I guess to Fort Jackson [South Carolina], from where we lived.  And we used to get up in the morning in the summer and brush back the top layer of the earth so we would have a smooth, beige ground surface.  And with nails we would start drawing our armies.  And we would have a continuing mural of soldiers and bazookas and tanks and B-29 airplanes.  And we would fill the yard so much with these drawings, that when the insurance man would come to pick up the money from the policy--which you used to put the money in and put it on the door.  So they'd just come and take it out and go.  They would have to hopscotch over our drawings to go.  They were always nice.  They wouldn't step on them.  But they'd sort of step here and there to get to the door and to get back.  Then I did a lot of drawings and artwork for teachers.  When teachers used to subscribe to 'Instructor'.  It was a monthly magazine that every teacher I knew seemed to take this magazine.  And it would have bulletin boards in it.  And a teacher would say, "Well, I want to re-create that bulletin board for my room."  And I would get the job.  So I would you know, make it out of cut construction papers and drawings and thumbtacks, and put it together.  And after a while, if teachers wanted something illustrated or blown up or lettered or whatever I would get to do this.  And, you know, usually get a silver dollar for it, and a lot of encouragement.  So my interest in art was strongly sustained.  Plus my father [Walter Bernard Gaither] drew fairly well.  And both of my brothers also drew fairly well.  So, so I enjoyed doing that.  And when they were off playing ball or whatever, I was drawing.  Or I had my watercolor set making paintings or my crayons doing something.  So a lot of my time was spent doing that.  I also enjoyed reading poetry a lot.  And because I liked these more solitary things, I tended to spend a lot of time squirreled away in my own spaces.  And much less time out, sort of being in teams of things.  So in that sense I, I think I probably was at some variance with, with a lot of kids where I was my age who were male.
Story_ID: 7449
Speaker 1: I also had a lively imaginary life with my younger sister--my sister Diane [Gaither Thompson].  We had a whole set of imaginary people, that we used to make our own stories up about.  We had a character called 'Grandma Hushy'.  I don't know how we came up with her.  But anyhow, the thing that distinguished her was she only ate bananas.  And we would sort of share between us these invented stories around imaginary characters. And that was a lot of fun for a long time.  Now there's a story that everyone in my family tells that's about me.  And I'll repeat it for you.  But I don't remember it myself.  But, it's been told so consistently that I have to suppose that there's some truth to it.  My father [Walter Bernard Gaither] had a car when lots of families didn't and when a lot of people in my grandfather's generation didn't.  So on Saturdays, people would go over to Great Falls [South Carolina] to buy their groceries.  And sometimes older people would go expecting that they would see somebody they knew who would sort of help get them back.  So we were over at the grocery store one Saturday morning and Mr. Son Perry, who was a peer of my grandfather saw my father's car.  My parents were in the store buying something still.  And I was in the car.  It would have certainly have been in the summer.  So Mr. Perry came over and asked me if he could ride back across the river with us.  And by all accounts, I said to him that I didn't know if he could ride back because I was riding with them myself.  So he'd have to wait and ask them, my parents.  So, so I guess if I were to take anything from the repeat of that story, it's that I've always tended to be a bit of a structuralist about things.  And, and that kind of channeling of information and absence of presumption, I think would be reasonably true of my character.  Now I, I went to one-teacher school, under my mother, from first grade through fourth grade.  And I walked to school every day. I tell this story because it connects to the whole discussion of bussing.  Because when people are talk--were talking about bussing I always got a chuckle out of it.  Because when I was going to school, only white students had buses.  So we would be crunching through the Jack Frost walking to school, and the white students would go past in the International Harvester.  Their bus, being taken to their school, which actually was owned by the state and was a big brick building.  And we were going to the one-teacher school which my church had built.  Which was about the size of this gallery, maybe a little bit smaller, and was a frame structure adjacent to my home church.  A structure where the boys came in the winter early to make the fire and warm the building up so that by the time the smaller children and the girls got there the place was warmed up and we could have class.  And where if you were smart, you could sort of learn all of the lessons for all of the levels because you were sitting there when everybody went over their work throughout the course of the day.  So anyhow I, I started going to one-teacher school [Mitford Elementary School, Great Falls, South Carolina].  Then when my, my sister Diane was too small to go to school, my older sister [Glenda Jean Gaither Davis] and I rotated keeping her.  So I went to school three days one week and two days the next week.  And because my mother [Fannie May Little Gaither] was the teacher, I had to do the same amount of work.  But I had to do more of the work at home.  Now on the days when I stayed home I had a lot of adventure and, and a reasonable amount of mischief.  I mean I remember one time I was supposed to watch the beans.  'Cause in those days, you know, people cooked beans for hours.  And my job was really just to see that they had water, and to turn them off when they were finished.  But I got busy with something that was my own project and I completely forgot about it, until I smelled them.  And then I went and there was no water.  And the beans had stuck to the bottom and scorched.  So I took the beans out.  And I cleaned the pot out.  And I put new water in and I put the beans back in and finished cooking them.  And the beans looked just fine until the first bite.  And they all tasted like they were scorched.  So I got a switching because I had tried to pull a fast one that didn't work.  Then another time, my neighbor's cows came to our yard.  'Cause we lived in a--it was sort of the edge of town, as it were.  And my father owned two and a half acres and my mother had a lot of plantings.  She loved flowers.  So we had petunias and everything growing all over the place.  And the cows were eating up my mother's plants. And I knew I should drive them out and, and make them go away.  But I was afraid of cows when I was a boy. So I collected a pile of rocks. I would throw these rocks at the cow and the cow would just stop eating and look at you.  I don't know if you've ever dealt with cows.  But cows have huge brown eyes, that don't seem to blink.  And they look at you with such intensity that it's intimidating.  So the cow would stop and look at me.  And I would never come near enough to make the cow leave.  And when my rock pile was all gone the cow would resume eating and I would resume collecting more rocks.  So I had my own little adventures, you know, when I was at one-teacher school.  Then after '54 [1954], the southern states got busy to create integrated new school--I mean consolidated new schools so that we wouldn't ask to go to the white school.  So all of the one-teacher schools would become a consolidated school.
Story_ID: 7450
Speaker 1: So, a county would take the one-teacher schools which were closed and combined these now into consolidated schools of maybe six teachers or eight teachers or twelve teachers.  And, these would be basically schools that now went through the eighth grade.  Because most counties had only one or two high schools for black students.  So when you got to high school, you might go at a much more considerable distance than you went to elementary school.  In fact a county like my home county [Chester County, South Carolina] really expected that a large number of people wouldn't go beyond elementary school.  And I remember wh--at my graduation from eighth grade at Mitford Elementary School [Great Falls, South Carolina], the representative from the--superintendent of education for the county, who was white came and, and he said we should all be very happy because we now knew how to measure a cord of wood.  And what this attaches to is that my home county was a pulp wood county. And his ambition for us was that we were gonna be cutting timber and we'd know how to stack it up and measure when a cord was done.  I mean that, that was his extent.  Now the thing is that all of the education was proceeding on two levels.  The sets of expectations that were sort of official expectations of the county were generally low for what would become of us.  The expectations represented in the main by black teachers were generally high.  Their expectations were that they were thinking that of who they were going to send off to whatever college they had gone to.  They were sort of seeing themselves making people who were going to become consequential.  But the general purpose, in the county beyond that was really, very modest in terms of what the, the white system expected. That's why when I was in high school, at the black high school, Elizabeth Heights High School [Great Falls, South Carolina], we didn't have two tracks.  We had one track on the expectation that most of us weren't going anywhere.  So when I was in high school for two years, I took double period everyday of vocational agriculture.  So I know all the breeds of pigs and all about cows and ducks and so forth.  At the white school, they offered that as a second level and then they offered a level for people who were going to go to college.  So the time when my father [Walter Bernard Gaither], some thirty years before was learning Latin, the offering available to me was really cows and ducks. And if I had been a girl, I would've been the comparable period in home economics learning about how to become a housewife.  So it was really the teachers who circumvented this official educational policy who took on trying to prepare you and interest you in an educational possibility that was bigger than that.  And who encouraged you despite this official stat--status of really just wanting to dump you into a localized labor force at a low level.
Story_ID: 7451
Speaker 1: Anyhow I, I went to Mitford Elementary School [Great Falls, South Carolina] and, my interest in art and my academic interest were all very encouraged.  I continued to do boards and all of those things and make little bits of money.  And I had a very good friend in elementary school, James McCrory, who also drew and he and I were able to sort of build on our interest in drawing because we both had that in common.  Then, I went to Elizabeth Heights High School [Great Falls, South Carolina]. At Elizabeth Heights High School, that's the first place where we actually had, something in the way of greater facilities.  I mean we had, a gymtorium, which we didn't really have before.  And we had a wider range of faculty and of course some specialization in faculty, even though the range was too narrow.  There I became very interested in theater and spoken word.  I belonged to a little thespian group that we had.  And Geneva Culp and I, we were sort of, cousins two or three removed.  We entered a lot of competitions that were oratorical competitions and theater competitions.  Because within, the network of black schools, there were these kinds of structures.  So there were sort of countywide and regional competitions in oratory and so forth.  So we were very involved in those kinds of things.  I continued to not have any particular interest in sports.  And by now I was very interested in designing cars.  So I used to enter every year in the Fisher Body Craftsman['s] Guild, which allowed you to design cars and build the models and then send them for competition.  So I won two prizes doing that for designing cars that I built in fiberglass and put in a box and sent away to the southeastern regional competitions.  I enjoyed doing that.  It was in high school when I met my first living working artist.  That came about because, my two brothers [Thomas Walter Gaither and Herman Kenneth Gaither] and my sister [Glenda Jean Gaither Davis] were all going to Claflin College [later Claflin University] in Orangeburg [South Carolina] and they had an art department at Claflin College.  It was headed by a painter named Arthur Rose and I got to meet him because everybody was interested in helping build on my interest in art and saw to it.  And he was the first person I knew who actually worked as an artist and really made paintings and those kinds of things.  I was very active in city and school government when I was in high school.  And I was elected as a delegate to, a, a National Student Government Association convention in 1961, my junior year in high school.  And, I was sent from the Palmetto High School [Williamston, South Carolina] Association.  In South Carolina, these were all segregated.  So the South Carolina Council of Student Councils were all the white student councils and the Palmetto Student Councils were all the black student councils.  So I was elected and I went to Janesville, Wisconsin and it was my first big trip.  I took the train and in Janesville, I was, something of an entertainment.  They hadn't seen a lot of black people up in Janesville.  And I stayed with a white family and, and they came and sort of examined me to make sure that (laughing) that the color was permanent and it was really a very funny experience.  It was unlike anything I had ever had as an experience.  And, and, it, it--it was nothing bitter about it, but I guess it was curious!  And my recollection is that the convention was quite big and all of the black students who were there were from segregated systems in the South.  And I think the sum of us constituted still a very small number of kids.  There was a Hispanic kid, named Carlos something or another from, somewhere in the East who came.  And I met him and I think he was the first person, who was brown and sort of not black in the sense of being African American that I really met.  Because in the in--where I grew up [Great Falls, South Carolina], I mean an African American could look like anything.  So, so this kid when I saw him and he looked like he could've been any African American--but when I spoke to him I found out you know that, that he was coming from a different ethnic location and so forth.  So it was sort of my first look at that.  Because that kind of diversity didn't exist in the South that I grew up in.  The South that I grew up in divided very neatly between blacks and whites, a small spotting of Indians and Jews who were sort of not seen as white but also not seen as black.  And I think we thought of them that way because they tended to be social outsiders to the white world where we were even though their economic status was such that they tended to have a lot of voice in certain things like education.  So that was a, a kind of fair description I guess of what my high school years were like.
Story_ID: 7452
Speaker 1: I have several questions of, based on things that you mentioned.  One, I'm curious--you talked about when you're young and white kids were riding on buses but, you know--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you were walking.  Now when you were in high school [Elizabeth Heights School, Great Falls, South Carolina], were you bused?  That's what I--.
Speaker 2: When we, when we were in high school, we were bused and not only that I drove a bus, because South Carolina in order to save money, would hire high school students to drive the buses.  They paid us thirty-five dollars a month.  So I think my second year in high school I drove a bus, and I picked up--I left like about six [o'clock] in the morning and I picked up, elementary school students from a wide swath of the county I lived in [Chester County, South Carolina].  And I took them to the elementary school and at the elementary school, I collected all of the high school students who had been picked up on the same route and then I transferred the high school students from Fairfield County [South Carolina] to Chester County [South Carolina], which was where we went to, to high school.  So I, I did that for thirty-five dollars.  We got the buses that the white students had had before, just as we got the books that the white students had had before.  When you got the books that were issued, they already had other peoples' names in them--they had missing pages, I mean they were books that were ready to be discarded but they just got sent over to, to us.  The same was true with the buses.  Your parents, often tried to augment that by buying other books.  But if you didn't have parents who had very much resources and most people really didn't have a lot.  I mean my family was a little bit more solid than many families, black families where I grew up.  So, so we had a, a family library in our house.  But that wasn't typical.  You couldn't go to the city library.  There was a small public library in the park in Great Falls [South Carolina] but the parks were off limits.  So you couldn't go borrow something from there.  You relied pretty much on the books that your parents had.  Teachers often would take an interest and lend you books if there were particular things they wanted you to read about.  I'd have to say that thinking back on it, black teachers who were paid too little and who often covered large distances to go to work and back still on a whole gave the best that they could give.  They often were working from disadvantaged educations themselves.  But still they had high ambitions and for the students that they saw a progressive interest in, they took a very large interest in trying to help those students realize their potential and possibilities, and I was very supported in that way.
Story_ID: 7453
Speaker 1: I want to understand the picture correctly. You're saying at this--that the curriculum was actually set by the white establishment--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: --in many ways. Okay, and that's--so that curriculum was set in that way, and the teachers found themselves, you know, out of these one-person school rooms to, you know, these larger schools.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: And you had sort of hand-me-down books.  Now yet at the same time their expectations were high for their students you know, so the curriculum they didn't set.  But my question to you, is what--where was the teaching?  Were you taught black history?  I mean is this common in you know--where it was common in southern schools, or was that you know a different type of southern school?
Speaker 2: No, no you were--you got taught that.  But that was not part of the state's [South Carolina's] curriculum.  That was part of what was really a subversive set of activities that teachers took on.  Not every teacher did it.  But in most schools there were some teachers who took on doing that.  So for example, by the time I went to high school [Elizabeth Heights School, Great Falls, South Carolina], I was familiar with Benjamin Brawley's 'Short History of the [American] Negro' and with Carter G. Woodson's 'History of the Negro' [sic, 'The Negro in Our History'].  That had been added into what we learned but entirely at the initiative of teachers--it was nowhere in the county [Chester County, South Carolina].  So if you were actually looking at county records of what was supposed to be being taught, none of that would appear.  What that connects to is, is the following.  Carter G. Woodson when old Negro History Week was established in 1926, and when in it's wake he created the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (now the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History) and the 'Negro History Bulletin' [sic, 'Journal of Negro History'].  These were all instruments created to support the knowledge base of black teachers in the segregated systems of the South who had sought and expected that kind of support from places like Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] which in the '20s [1920s] was thinking of itself as the national Negro university.  So, that role was taken on and it was fostered through these, race specific activities.  So when I was in, a one-teacher school, as well as when I was in six-teacher schools, we had a dimension of black history which was taught and we had to learn, black poetry and you had to learn Negro spirituals.  These were all, regular integrated curricula pieces.  And at every occasion that was an important occasion, you had to sing 'Lift Every Voice and Sing,' which in those days was known as the 'Negro National Anthem'.  So there was this considerable underpinning.  There were, however, some, pieces to it which, which probably should have a footnote.  In the poetry that we learned, we learned, some Countee Cullen's, we learned a lot of Paul Laurence Dunbar.  And for Dunbar we learned, both the dialectic things and the things written in standard verse.  So you would typically on a Friday in a small school have a period set aside for recitations of these kinds of things.  And that would be the format that these would be brought forward in.  When schools were larger and better organized, there would be regular, I guess you would say all-school meetings in which these kinds of things were formalized.  Those were also the settings in which acquaintance with Negro spirituals tradition would be formalized.  A choir for a high school or even a chorus for a grade school would typically perform a great deal of material that was traditional black material.  Might include some work songs, would certainly include a preponderance of concert spirituals.  Even at the college level, black college choirs would include a majority of their programs rooted in the tradition of black spirituals.  Now what you didn't get that belonged to black tradition in the South was you did not tend to get a lot of emphasis on revolutionary personalities.  So for example you would typically know a lot about George Washington Carver for whom things were named all over the place.  You would know a lot about Booker T. Washington for whom things were named all over the place.  You would typically know a little less about [W.E.B.] DuBois, but he would be present.  You would know even less about Frederick Douglass beyond his name.  So there was a certain filtering that, that did happen.  How localized that was I can't really speak to, but it would be pretty impossible to get through school without having had some exposure to what black people saw as elements of their cultural heritage and their history.
Story_ID: 7454
Speaker 1: My father [Walter Bernard Gaither] left teaching--it would have been maybe '54 [1954] around the same time--he wouldn't have been employable anyhow, because we'd gone to through kinds of things where Thurgood Marshall, and so forth, had been.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) But see, that's what--okay but that's why I was interested in that.  What, what was occurring at that point where he couldn't teach?  You know, you said that--earlier that he and, you know they had attended NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is the kind of thing that would happen.  Let's say, you would go to see a speaker like Thurgood Marshall, or whatever, and these things would get reported back.  You never knew precisely who reported them back, but they would get reported back and, and they would be acted on and you simply wouldn't get a contract.  I mean your, your--you would just sort of no longer be in the list of, of who was there.  And this kind of filtering was a widespread tool of control because it also meant that the teachers who continued to work were always working knowing that there was the sort of club that the county had behind its back that at any moment it could trump up or otherwise decide that they were not teaching in the interest of, of what the county wanted.  So these other pieces of the curriculum sort of got dropped in place but they never were formally a part of what was happening.  And there were well you know in, in, in those days when blacks in the public arena were not a commonplace, the word of something black happening would spread very rapidly by informal means through black communities.  You know if, if Pearl Bailey [singer] was gonna be on the 'Ed Sullivan Show', when blacks were rare on television, this news would go out and everybody would have it.  And people who didn't have TVs [televisions] would be going to visit people who do have TVs to see it.  It was a kind of ownership of a contestation in the public space.  It's the same kind of thing that made people keep up fiercely with Joe Louis [boxer].  These, battles were surrogate battles that you strongly identified with.  And the great historical personalities like, Mary McLeod Bethune.  I mean when, when she came through, people from wide areas would come to see and hear her.  I mean you knew about her--that here was a woman who had been received by Mrs. [Eleanor] Roosevelt.  And the Roosevelts were in this magical place of having been an administration that was sympathetic to black people and to poor people, so she had this elevation.  She was a woman who had spoken out in support of black causes.  So, so you know, you went and you heard what she had to said--to say, and she talked about her vision which, which was very much focused around the establishment of Bethune-Cookman [College, Daytona Beach, Florida] and her work with black women's organizations and politics.  This would be widely inspirational.  And, the NAACP was perceived as a really radical organization.  So if you went to see anybody who was associated in any wise with that and with struggle, you were at risk of having some punitive action taken against you.
Story_ID: 7455
Speaker 1: Do you think your parents [Walter Bernard Gaither and Fannie May Little Gaither] were viewed as sort of radical and was there any fallout?  Did you ever hear anything about your father--you know I mean the fact that they had been put on the list, and, you know, he had to seek other--even though it ended up ultimately paying more?
Speaker 2: Well I think that, (pause) I think my parents were perceived as being I guess you would say more progressive than, than, than radical and as being supportive of change.  And I, I'd site actually something from another arena to go with that.  You know I mentioned earlier that J. P. Stevens [and Company, Inc.] had three cotton mills in my hometown [Great Falls, South Carolina].  And there were efforts to organize unions in the mill for a very long time.  My father had worked there early in his life but he didn't work there, but we knew many people and went to church with people who worked in the mill.  And black people in the mill were at the bottom--that was the order.  So the organizers who came were often interested in organizing the whole mill, which meant organizing black workers.  Nobody who worked at the mill could entertain any kind of encounter with organizers because they would summarily lose their job.  But my father at least a couple of times hosted those kinds of things to try to help people be able to have that conversation.  Now the union never happened at the mill.  And, at the end of the '60s [1960s], after we were all gone from there, my cousins and everything were there, the mill all of a sudden gave everybody who worked at the mill everything they would have gotten if they'd had a union.  So my cousins who lived there, all of a sudden saw their economic future as brighter, borrowed money and built brick houses on the property that had been inherited from our grandfather [Walter G. Gaither].  In two years every mill closed.  J. P. Stevens bought time to relocate them. He took people off of looking at him and being on his back by giving them what they deserved and they thought that it was a genuine action.  And they acted on it and in the meantime all of that relocated.  All three mills closed.  Now you ride through the downtown and it's a ghost town.  And you know everybody works somewhere else--drives a distance.  You know, people doubled up to not lose money on mortgages where they'd gone in thinking they were going to be earning at this level.  Because when the cotton mills closed, a series of little t-shirt factories came paying minimum wages and hiring few people.  And most of those have gone, so basically there really is no way to earn very much money in the town anymore.  Everybody now works at a distance.  Very cynical.
Story_ID: 7456
Speaker 1: Did your parents nurture the arts?  And I--when I say it, both your mother [Fannie May Little Gaither] and father [Walter Bernard Gaither] I knew you said you got your drawings, at first I thought--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you had gotten an artistic bent from your mother who was, you know, a singer.  And I was just wondering were they, nurturing as well as the teachers who were around?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My parents, were very encouraging of, of our interest and specifically of my interest, in art.  they bought some materials for me as we could find in a small place. There was a limited range of materials available in a small place.  And they bought books that they thought would help me.  The same is true of my home church.  For example I have a couple of murals that I dibbed from my home church.  One of a crucifixion that at a point was actually installed behind the pulpit.  And I mean I think I was maybe twelve or thirteen when I did that.  I had a minister, Reverend Robinson who liked painting and he brought me a painting of a ship.  'Cause he, he liked these you know--people use to have these paintings of great ocean liners so, so he brought me that and, and he encouraged it.  So I had, from every sector, encouragement in what I was interested in.  And I think that that was actually true of, of all of us.  Now what I didn't get, that my brothers and sisters all got in the arts was music.  My oldest brother [Thomas Walter Gaither] plays piano and trumpet.  My second brother [Herman Kenneth Gaither] plays trombone and both of my sisters took piano. And I didn't take any musical instrument.  And I think the reasons were two.  One is because my interest was so clearly in the visual arts and it wasn't something I pressed to do.  I think the other reason was because between when my brothers were in high school and when I was in high school, we didn't have a band.  So I was never--they were in the band and that was how they got the horns.  And if I'd been in the band, then I probably would have been in that as well.  Actually now that I'm old, I wish I'd taken musical instrument because I'd really love it.  Later on when I was working in the summer in New Jersey, I did actually take up the tenor banjo.  And I own a banjo but I was, I was never really terribly good at it.  My older brothers and my sister also sang.  So they were all in choirs in high school and at church.  And I didn't do that either.  But my interest in, music more as an ethnographic interest, has been very sustained even from that early point.  Because my interest in it was a little bit more of a historical entrance--interest than a performing interest.  I started collecting blues and early gospel very early.  Now both of my brothers have collections but they both started collecting after I did.  I collected in the '70s [1970s] quite a lot of a cappella congregational music.  Which is a kind of music that I grew up on that was changing if not disappearing.  And I have a lot of tapes of that sort that I've promised actually to Columbia College [Chicago, Illinois], because of their interest in black music research, but I've never edited them, quite yet.  But I'm going to eventually edit and give them copies of those.  I have tapes of shape music which is what they sang at my mother's tradition, which is a relative of sacred harp.  It's the 'do-re-mi' kind of singing tradition.  And, I have some transcriptions of lyrics to songs that were never written but were performed as congregational spirituals when I was growing up that I want to do something with at a later point.  But nobody allowed me to sort of sing other than in the congregation--I was never in the choirs, not even in high school [Elizabeth Heights School, Great Falls, South Carolina].

Speaker 1: Can I ask you what fascinated you from a historian standpoint?  I mean you're still--you know you start collecting--what age were you collecting?
Speaker 2: Oh, probably fourteen thereabouts.  I think what was interesting to me about it was, that I thought there was a power to make one big experience out of these art forms.  I mean with music--the reason congregational music was so interesting to me was because it didn't have an audience.  I mean it's not like gospel where you have a performing choir and you can sort of get at the edges but you have to really go practice to be in the middle of it.  In congregational music everybody knows the music.  And there is no audience, everybody is the choir.  And when the music really gets going, you get sucked into it and you get lost in it the way you get lost in dance when you're really enjoying dance and, and you're not separate from the music, and you're not separate from all the other people dancing. There's a unity that the form itself sucks you into and, and I liked that.  And it seemed to me something very powerful. And I was interested in how, how it got orchestrated.  I mean what made that something that could happen.  It's like, when you go to church and, people get happy and start shouting and you're sort of looking at it.  And when you're looking at it, it's like its own kind of theater.  But if you were in it, it would be experienced differently.  If you were in it, you wouldn't have this relationship of distance and separation.  So I sort of wanted to know how you get in those things.  I mean, how the music by repetition and by hand and foot action is a choreography to move you on the inside.  And when you're on the inside and it's, it's what I think we spend all of our lives trying to get to which are moments that are so rich that we lose ourselves into them.  And we become something that's as great as all that is because we don't have boundaries.  So, so it--so, so that was really interesting to me.  But I wouldn't have been able to describe it, in ways that looked at it that clearly.  But I was interested in that process.  How it sucked you in and made you on the inside of it.  And, and with the painting, and drawing, it was in part because I had a facility for it, so it was easy to do.  It was in part because other people really liked seeing you do it and encouraged you.  And it was in part because you construct a world when you draw or paint that isn't and you control the construction.  So it allows you to make something that never was.

Speaker 1: Your experiences out of this small town [Great Falls, South Carolina] only existed with you going away that one time to--was it Milwaukee [Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: To--yes to Janesville, Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: I mean Janesville, Wisconsin.  And what, what I found curious about that, wasn't that you were part of a black group. But what was it?  Was it a religious group that had you--I mean how did you--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  It, it, it was, a student government associations.
Speaker 1: Well you said it was a black student association.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But you ended up staying in white households--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Somebody (unclear).
Speaker 2: Because, because the, some how the way this conference was organized, the conferees who came to it were sort of put up. And I don't really know the details of that. I mean I assumed that white conferees were also put up in that way.  Maybe it was that some associations didn't have very much money.  And somebody intervened at the other end to do that to help make it possible.  I don't really know anything about that sort of end of it.  I just know that, that, that I got put up with a white family.  The, the, the guy whose family it was, was a ham radio operator.  And, and, and it was pleasant enough experience.  It was a very different and new experience.  And, the number of us who were at that and who were black were a very small number.  I didn't get money from the association.  The association paid for my ticket.  They probably paid some kind of conference fee for it.  My parents [Walter Bernard Gaither and Fannie May Little Gaither] gave me money for my personal needs.  And I, I had to manage that money and I only managed it moderately well.  So that when I was coming back, I was virtually out of money.  And, and, and I remember this clearly because I was in the train station in Chicago [Illinois].  And I had never seen a train station of this size, or a rail yard of that size.  I mean this was all really big stuff.  And I didn't have enough money to continue to eat on the train for another day because it was a day from there to home for me.  So I had decided that my strategy was to eat in the railroad station because food was very cheap at the cafés in, in the railroad station.  And I had never eaten oatmeal.  I always disliked it.  I didn't like that slick texture of it.  But the only thing that I could afford was oatmeal. So I ate oatmeal in the train station and I had a long layover.  And I was stretched out sleeping on the wooden benches and the policeman kept coming and waking me up because he said you couldn't do that.  And actually I had zero appreciation that there was hazard involved in it.  I mean I had--it didn't occur to me that pickpockets or other kinds of hazards were in the station.  I had no frame for it.  It was just I had a long wait and you know the bench was free and I was just doing that.  So it was a foray into a world that had lots of problems and dimensions but I didn't know them.  So they didn't bother me.

Speaker 1: Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]--then what, what was--you didn't want to go to, to, to where your--.
Speaker 2: No I didn't want to go to Claflin [College, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: So--.
Speaker 2: And actually I didn't know anybody who had gone to Morehouse. And I didn't apply to Morehouse.  Here is how I got to Morehouse.  I--we belonged to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] so we got 'Crisis' magazine.  All the historically black colleges and universities advertised in 'Crisis' magazine.  People who went to college from where I grew up usually went to North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], which was driving distance to Charlotte [North Carolina]--I mean to Greensboro or they went to Johnson C. Smith [University, Charlotte, North Carolina], which was driving distance to Charlotte. They went to South Carolina State [University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] or Claflin or Morris College [Sumter, South Carolina].  I mean you could name the places they went to.  But I didn't know anybody who went to Morehouse.  I wrote a letter to Atlanta University [later Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  I didn't know that it was only a graduate school.  And I don't know what I saw in their ad in 'Crisis' that made me think of them, but I wrote to them and they sent my letter to Morehouse.  Because they only did graduate work and Morehouse was the undergraduate college, in effect, to Atlanta University.  I applied to half a dozen historically black schools and I went to who offered me the most scholarship.  So that's how I got to Morehouse.  And when I arrived in Atlanta with my trunk, I had never been there before and I took a taxi and arrived on Morehouse's campus and that was all new to me.  And it was one of the most fortunate decisions ever in my life.  But I didn't systematically make it.
Story_ID: 7460
Speaker 1: So now tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] was the best undergraduate experience I could have imagined for myself.  It was a school with a very firm academic tradition requiring a lot.  I was comfortable with that.  It was a faculty that was--I would say our faculty was maybe 75 percent black with some white faculty.  But a very good faculty.  I'll say more about some particular people, slightly later on.  The administration of, Dr. Mays, Benjamin Elijah Mays, was extraordinary.  He had assembled, a large community of doctorate holders.  He had a very wide toleration for difference and a very high premium on debate.  So it was, a challenging environment. He lived on the campus and exerted an immediate influence on the character of student life and the direction of the college life.  Now at, at, at the time, Morehouse is all-male school.  Adjacent to it was Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], all-women's college and Morehouse and Spelman by tradition saw themselves as a pair.  On the other corner was Clark College [later Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] an undergraduate school co-ed and I think it had started out C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal], I'm not sure.  Then at a slight distance Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia], which was an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] four-year undergraduate college.  Then over arching that was Atlanta University [later Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], which was only graduate, offerings and the Interdenominational Theological Center [Atlanta, Georgia], which was graduate theological education.  And the whole group of those operated as what was commonly called Atlanta University Center [Consortium, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia].  And you could take courses across campus lines.  So since I had a lot of interests in visual arts and Morehouse did not have strong offerings in visual arts, most of my visual arts courses I took either at Spelman or at Clark and occasionally at Morris Brown.  So I had reason to have some relationships in all of those settings.  Now Dr. Mays, came and spoke to us weekly.  And Morehouse still had a tradition of chapel.  Chapel strictly speaking was no longer religious, it essentially served an inspirational function.  It was Dr. Mays's opportunity to periodically speak directly to all of the men of the college.  We were a population of about 850 students or so at the time.  And the other times it brought in, black men who had been successful.  A large number of them from Morehouse who gave you, a glimpse of the professional and world possibilities that were yours from where you were.  So these were people who had, accomplished importantly.  The prevailing philosophy was that you shouldn't give a thought to money.  Nobody was interested in how you would make money.  People were only interested in the notion that if you contributed significantly to the race and to the world, you would make a living.  And your name and place would live because of what you contributed.  I framed this, this way because it's very different now.  I mean I was on the campus a few years ago and you know everybody is getting an M.B.A. [Master of Business Administration] and, and, and people are very concerned about how they're gonna convert that quickly into a lot of what use to be called 'creature comforts'.  But when I was at Morehouse, that's a discussion that couldn't have happened.  Nobody would have privileged personal earning over social contribution.  Things were framed in terms of what were you going to do that was going to, in the aggregate 'lift the people'.  And you were always thinking very much in terms of your work as having a mission to it greater than your personal success.  And, and I internalized that and I still find it to be a direction which is meaningful to me.  And I have made decisions in my own life, which have been much more about mission than about career.  Because my career possibilities and my purse could have benefited greatly from other decisions that were my option.  But that notion, I, I think Morehouse consolidated that as a notion for me.
Story_ID: 7461
Speaker 1: Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] also, gave me a frame for, understanding, things about black but not limited to black.  People talked a lot about what black people had done or could do or ought to do.  But at the same time you had to really learn the world.  So you had to bring those two things together and reconcile them in a positive way.  So for example I was very interested in, in, in literature and in, English literature.  I, I learned Anglo-Saxon a little bit at Morehouse.  But Steven Henderson in the English department was really teaching and writing about blues.  So you could have these two things happening.  My interest in music was, fostered and encouraged by Willis James at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] who was the teacher of Bernice [Johnson] Reagon and who was very interested in, traditional black music and every year was writing folk operas in black idiom.  So there was a yoking together that sort of made a whole world but also made you a special place in it.  Of the people there who, exerted, a very large influence on, on, on me, Dr. [Benjamin Elijah] Mays is certainly at the very top of the list.  I was in the last class that graduated under him.  And I don't know any men who went to Morehouse in the time of his administration for whom he was not that quality of model.  There was, however, another really interesting man, Father Warren Scott.  Father Scott was a black Episcopal priest.  He ran the Canterbury House, which was the Episcopal house on campus--very close into the campus.  And, he was, very interested in ideas--very progressive man.  I was not Episcopal and never became Episcopal.  But I was very involved with the programs and activities of the Canterbury House.  The Canterbury House sponsored, regular discussions about issues of the day.  We were all discussing existentialism and I-Thou relation--relationships, contemporary philosophy and, and I enjoyed that.  And it brought together people from all of the campuses, from Morehouse and Spelman and so forth.  So it was a real lively place to be.  It also occasionally arranged trips for us to go and visit other campuses.  And, these trips would be organized.  Father Scott would call up the Episcopal organization at another school and he would say he wanted to bring some students there.  Could they live with some students who were Episcopal at that school and just go to classes and then there would be discussions in the evening.  Using that I went to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey]. I came to Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island] that way.  We went to University of the South [Sewanee, Tennessee] that way.  So for those of us who had only a southern context, and only the experience of basically growing up and being educated in a black setting, these were sort of opportunities to see the other side of educational models.  So, so my first acquaintance with Ivy [League] schools was really through these activities that Father Warren Scott regularly put together.  And my friends who were close to me, were people who were part of that circle and, and, and we've--many of us kept in some contact over a lifetime.  Jeanette Hume was my English teacher, the English teacher in the department that I worked with most closely because I was very interested in melancholic material.  And she was interested in that kind of stuff to.  And, and, and I took some Middle English and Anglo-Saxon and that kind of stuff, under her auspices.  And we were arrested together, in civil rights protest in Atlanta [Georgia].  She was very influential, in my, undergraduate years as well.  Then I had some funny adventures as well.  I had worn a beard since about tenth grade up, in fact, I wore a beard until about two years ago.  So a long period of time.  And, in the '60s [1960s], especially the first half of the '60s [1960s], this really was not a respectable thing to do.  So, in '65 [1965], my teachers recommended me for a year's study abroad through a program that was funded by Charlie Merrill of the Merrill [Lynch] investment house.  He's, he's here in Boston [Massachusetts].  Anyhow, a professor of mine called me in and he said, "If you want this travel, opportunity, get rid of the beard.  He said we don't want to send away any neo-bohemians around here."  At the time, the look that you wanted to attain was an attaché case, a suit and a very clean narrowly professional look.  This was not the casual professional era.  And, and people were all interested in trying to construct you for success.  So, so that was all good intentioned.  And I didn't do it.  Second professor called me in and advised me and I refused to do it.  I said, "It would be so hypocritical.  Because if I cut it off and got it, I would just grow it back and, and then you would be in the same dilemma."  And I said, "Furthermore, I should be getting it because my grades are good and people think I ought to go and not because I complied with some model of what I should look like."  So I refused to do it and I didn't get it.  Some people who recommended me protested and when, when Charles Merrill came for the annual trustee meeting, some people brought it to his attention.  Of course he took the right posture.  He said he gave the money to the college, he had nothing to do with how they gave the money out beyond that.  But I never seriously regretted it.  It was from my point of view a kind of moral issue.  And I thought from the way I was involved with discussions around moral obligation and so forth that that was the right posture.  So that was another piece you know of my experience there.
Story_ID: 7462
Speaker 1: Perhaps the most important--or one of the most important things to come out of my years in Atlanta [Georgia] was, was my first opportunity to live with and fully appreciate paintings and sculpture.  I had not been in where I grew up visited museums.  There weren't any to be perfectly truthful and I knew painting and sculpture largely from reproductions in books in an era when color reproductions were rare and most reproductions were black and white.  When I came to Atlanta I met the paintings of Lois Mailou Jones, of John [Woodrow] Wilson, of John Biggers, of really the great names in African American art.  And not only did I just meet them but I saw them daily.  Trevor Arnett was the main library of Atlanta University [later Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And all of the undergraduates used it in addition to their reading room that was on their own campus.  So it was the main library for everybody.  So I was there on a daily basis.  And, these great paintings hung in all of the spaces of Trevor Arnett Library.  And in the basement of Trevor Arnett Library was the [Catherine Hughes] Waddell Gallery where the rest of the paintings were.  So, my feeling in a firsthand way for the possibilities of visual art, or what happens when you actually confront a work in real space, with texture and light and effects that you see when you come nearer and go away.  All of that opportunity to form a personal relationship to art happened for me in Atlanta in the years that I was at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] with the collection of Atlanta University.  Also all of my formal understanding about art and art making happened there because I had never taken an art class before I went there.  And I took a lot of studio courses because I was so interested in knowing not just how to appreciate the work but what kinds of issues were raised around actually making work.  And because Atlanta University sponsored an annual exhibition that brought visualized artists from across the nation, it was also my first opportunity to meet and see these great figures who have really been the subject of my professional life.  Now one of the things that's wonderful about that is most of my friends who worked in art history came to African American work after having come to other works.  And for them it was a discovery that they made against the background of this larger tradition.  But it was exactly the opposite for me.  I came to these works first and then I went to see the other works with these works as my point of reference.  So when I first started going to museums on a regular basis, I was going to the High Museum [of Art] in Atlanta.  And everything I was seeing at the High Museum, I was seeing against the frame of what I had seen in the context of Atlanta.  The first murals that I really got to know were the murals that Hale Woodruff executed in 1949, 1950 in the rotunda of Atlanta University.  And when I met Hale Woodruff that was all made manifest.  So for me it would have been like meeting [artist] Leonardo [da Vinci] under the Sistine Chapel [Rome, Italy] because here was the person and here was the work and the work was every day feeding eyes and feeding souls that were meeting beneath it, to, to develop and build their lives.  So that was a really important piece of the Atlanta years for me that it gave me that firsthand experience which was to become the kernel of my work.
Story_ID: 7463
Speaker 1: What I find curious is how did you get from Atlanta [Georgia] to Boston [Massachusetts]?  And the only reason I say that is--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in 1969 you were with The National Center [Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists, Boston, Massachusetts]--,
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and I'm trying to figure out that.
Speaker 2: Well I, I, I came to New England first in '66 [1966].  The fall of '66 [1966], I came to Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island].
Speaker 1: Brown. Okay.
Speaker 2: I was at Brown until the end of '68 [1968].  In 1968-1969, I taught at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], and then in the fall of '69 [1969], I came back to New England.  That's when I came for this journey that I'm still on here.
Speaker 1: But that's what I'm, that's what I'm curious about.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In, in Brown the graduate work you did was in what area?
Speaker 2: Art history.
Speaker 1: In Art History.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you had decided--I mean I'm just saying I know you were steeped heavily in humanities.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But what motive--was it a fellow--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well the, the, the simple truth of it is that at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], art history was not an option. It wasn't something offered.  So the, the most I could do that gave me a lot of study of art history was in general humanities.  So I took a lot of humanities courses that basically amounted to art history but they weren't a concentration that you could do.  When I finished there, I didn't have enough art history hours specifically to have come to Brown.  So I spent the summer and took additional courses at Georgia State [University, Atlanta, Georgia] to fill in and, and, you know get myself what I needed to come to Brown.  But my interest really was in art history.  At the end of, at the end of Morehouse, I really had to decide what I wanted to do.  Because I had an interest in studio work, but I was more comfortable with academic work.  I could see the margins in academic work and in the creative field, it's sometimes hard to see the margins.  You have to spend a lot of slush time to sort of find your, your, your space.  So I felt I had to make a decision between art history and the possibility of studio kinds of things and I decided art history.  If I had not come in art history, I probably would have gone to graduate school in theology.  Not with an interest to being a minister, but with an interest in the kinds of ethical questions that I was so--and remain interested in.
Story_ID: 7464
Speaker 1: Well I--when I, I came to Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island] in '66 [1966] it was a less flashy place then than it is now.  People referred to Providence as the armpit of New England in those days.  It was a very good school and the Art History department was a small department and we had a two year program for master's level work and, of course, a longer possibility.  So it fitted for me because I had still things from undergraduate that I needed to fill in and it allowed me that.  And it was a program designed to give you options of going into teaching or going into museum work.  So for example part of our methods preparation was learning how you organize exhibitions and how you write catalogs.  So the kinds of skills that you would need in the museum world were there as well as skills if you were thinking that you were going to, to go into teaching or perhaps into criticism.  And I enjoyed my time there.  I did very well my, my grades were, were good but I had one big concern.  My, my big concern was that my real interest was in American art history because I was interested in the place of African American work and at Brown, we really did not have any offerings in American art history.  The only Americanist who was part of the graduate faculty was William Jordy who was an architectural historian.  And, a very fine professor.  And we didn't have a lot of people in American painting and graphics and sculpture.  So at the end of my first year there, I decided to start looking for some other place that had more offerings in American Art.  And the historian who interested me the most in terms of the person whose work I liked a lot was Milton Brown.  At the time Milton Brown was at Brooklyn College [Brooklyn, New York].  I--when I came to Brown, I had an acceptance to N.Y.U. [New York University, New York, New York] and I was picking between those so I still had my acceptance at N.Y.U.  And I went down there and I had a conversation and basically I worked out that if I came to N.Y.U., Milton Brown could be my advisor there and that looked like a good package for me.  So at the end of my second year at Brown, I had decided that I was going to transfer to N.Y.U. and pick up this arrangement.  The difficulty was that I couldn't transfer the money that I had at Brown to N.Y.U.  I was gonna have to figure out another route to get the money and I thought I could do that.  But I thought I needed a moment to do it.  I had come to Brown on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship.  So I had the option of working for up to two years as a Woodrow Wilson teaching intern just for saying to the [Woodrow] Wilson [Fellowship] people that I wanted to do it and for having a good graduate record in terms of my performance up to that.  So I decided that I would do that and I would use the year to put together the money that I needed for New York.  And actually I decided to do that and I, I said I'd like to, to teach so they arranged for me they said--they gave me some options and I chose Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 7465
Speaker 1: So I went back to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and I chose to go back because I was interested in the collection of Atlanta University [later Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  So I worked on the collection of Atlanta University in '68 [1968], '69 [1969] and I taught art history at Spelman and I begin my interest in Caribbean art in the same timetable.  Because we had Barrington Watson a prominent Jamaican painter in residence at Spelman that year.  And I ended up in fact organizing an exhibition from Jamaica which became I think the first exhibition of a wide body of Jamaican art history presented in the U.S. [United States] after Jamaican Independence.  A show that I brought to Spelman and eventually to Boston [Massachusetts].  But, anyhow, I taught at Spelman for a year and I was preparing to go to New York at the fall.  About the middle of--maybe it was the beginning of the summer, I got an invitation from the Museum of Fine Arts [Boston, Boston, Massachusetts] and the National Center of Afro-American Artists [Boston, Massachusetts] to come to Boston and consider some kind of work here.  I didn't know anything about the National Center.  And I thought the Museum of Fine Arts that could be very good.  Because one of the problems that I had run into in doing independent work was that you would go to these artists at their studios and, you know, take up a big block of their time and want to look through all of their stuff to try to begin to collect research and, and their view was always, "Well what am I getting out of this?  You're getting what you're getting out of this.  But I'm, you know, just being here and giving over stuff."  So I thought if I were to take a job where I could help artists at the same time that I was collecting the kind of data and material that I wanted to collect, that would really work well for both of us.  So I still had a lot of friends in New England and I said I'll go see them on this person--I came up here and I came up with no sense of what was on offer.
Story_ID: 7466
Speaker 1: I met fellow named David Pickman--was the person that I met at the Museum of Fine Arts [Boston, Boston, Massachusetts].  It was his job to sort of show me around and introduce me and introduce what the possibilities were.  He said, "The Museum of Fine Arts is interested in somebody who has an art history background who might, you know, do some things here, and Elma Lewis--" whom I hadn't met "--has asked the Museum of Fine Arts to help her build a museum program and we're thinking about perhaps helping with that.  And we're looking for somebody who might be willing to think about biting both of these things as a package."  Then he brought me over to meet Miss Lewis.  Well, Miss Lewis is, an extraordinary presence and a woman of exceeding will, as you know.  And there were other people being considered for all of this she wanted to do.  She said that she wanted to create the Center [National Center of Afro-American Artists, Boston, Massachusetts].  And she wanted it to have teaching and professional dimensions.  And the teaching dimension was going to be the Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts [Boston, Massachusetts], which she had begun in 1950 so it already was old.  And she said that she had a vision for these professional entities, which would be a museum and a dance company and some professional musical organizations and all of that.  She further said that she had gotten the properties in which this was to happen.  These were properties that had been acquired at the very end of '68 [1968] and they consisted of a building which had been a yeshiva school which was renovated over the next decade, actually over the next four years.  It did not take us all that while and became the Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts and a grand synagogue which had been built at the end of the teens [1910s] and which was out of use at the time the Center acquired it.  But the Center had high hopes of renovating this building and the museum was going to go on the first level of that building.  Now Miss Lewis had said to Perry Rathbone, who was director of the Museum of Fine Arts, and to George Seybolt who was Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Museum of Fine Arts that she wanted to enlist the museum to help the Center create a museum which would not be an extension or department of the Museum of Fine Arts but which would in time become a member of the larger community of museums in Boston.  And she basically said, "You all have been doing this for almost a hundred years.  You obviously know how to do it and you can help us to do this more quickly."  And the Museum of Fine Arts was under some pressure as were all big museums in the end of the '60s [1960s] to respond to an artist community that it had neglected.  So it also was thinking about what it could do that would respond to black artist in the American scene.  And I became in effect the possibility of doing these things.  So in by the end of 1969--I came to Boston in September of 1969.  By the end of 1969, we had basically come to an arrangement.  And the arrangement was that, that I would develop the museum for the Center.  And it meant developing it from scratch.  There was only the idea that there should be such a thing.  But there was no such thing.  And that I would also help the Museum of Fine Arts to present exhibitions and to acquire works that would put it on the road to doing what was its proper responsibility.  There was further agreement that helping the center would not relieve the Museum of Fine Arts from its general obligations but would in fact be another kind of rather special collaboration.  The Museum of Fine Arts had no idea whether this was viable.  So the agreement never ever existed in writing.  This was a kind of consensus that came to exist essentially between Miss Lewis, the founder and artistic director of the Center, Perry Rathbone and George Seybolt of the Museum of Fine Arts.  The, the real posture that the Museum of Fine Arts took was one where if I had failed at doing this well enough, they could step out of it.  Because they weren't on any page anywhere locked into it.  I became immediately involved on both of these fronts.  And, the nature of my involvement was assisted by how little experience I had in the real world of work.  I thought that if you designed things well, and worked at them, they would happen.  Everybody who has been tempered by real work knows that nothing ever happens as quickly as you want it. And things rarely happen by the design. But I was very enthusiastic about the designs and how this would happen.  And I saw myself doing this for five years and then picking up this other plan, which I had set aside.  So I didn't see this as becoming the work that I would in effect commit a lifetime to.  At the Museum of Fine Arts, we committed to doing an exhibition which in fact happened in May of 1970.  Now that's a very short track.  A major exhibition normally takes a year or two to put together.  This timetable was driven by the sense of urgency that artists here had.  That if it didn't get committed and happened, it some how wouldn't happen.  The parameters that the show finally had, I made because of what I assessed to be possible to do in that time.  When we started out, they wanted to do a national show.  And I said, "Impossible."  There was no way to do the research for a national show.  So the exhibition became New York [New York] and Boston [Massachusetts] because one could reasonably try to cover those in a useful way by concentrating basically only on that for that period of time.  So I undertook and organized the show 'African American Artists: New York and Boston' [1970], and when that show opened at the Museum and Fine Arts, it was the largest and most critically well received exhibition of fine arts in a museum of that class in the U.S. [United States]--it was not the first show of the kind.  Other shows had been done but not in a museum sort of in that rank.  The museum at that rank which had previously done something in this direction of course was the Metropolitan [Museum of Art, New York, New York], which had done 'Harlem on My Mind'.  But 'Harlem on My Mind' was not a fine arts exhibition in the main.  It was largely an exhibition of the exquisite photographs of James Van Der Zee exploded into a larger scale and recreated as an environment.  But it did not focus on painters, sculptors and printmakers.  So the artist community as such were actually not represented in 'Harlem on My Mind'.  If you read what the show was, it would have said to you they are not fine artists of that quality that they should be at the Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York].  So when we did the show here, a show which consisted of exactly the work of great fine artist and of living artist because we didn't do a historical show, we did a show of work basically from the '60s [1960s] forward.  We did it as a clarion announcement that here is this community of work which merits to be seen on its own terms.  The other thing that became important about the show when we did it in Boston was it was among the first shows where the curator was black.  'Harlem on My Mind' of course had been done by Allon Schoener who is not black and the issue had arisen with other shows over curatorial control.  So there had been exhibitions like the 'African American Art: 1800 to 1950' [sic, 'The Evolution of Afro-American artists: 1800-1950'] which Carroll Greene and Romare Bearden had done at C.C.N.Y. [City College of New York, New York].  But sort of in the big dog museums, no black curator had gotten to make a show when I made that show.  So Hilton Kramer and the rest of the New York establishment all were up to comment about the show. Hilton Kramer interestingly attacked the show for being too much social art.  And at moment in time, there was this great discussion about black art and the discussion sort of attached itself to the riots and to the rest of the general militancy, which had precipitated this interest.  So even though there were perhaps only a third of works in the show that in any reasonable way could be said to be political, he talked about the show as if the show were 100 percent political work. We ended up in an exchange in the 'New York Times' [newspaper].  I wrote a piece that appeared in the 'Times' ['New York Times'].  And I said basically that, "I don't think styles die.  So I don't have a big problem if people want to use figures.  I think that a style lives when it's the right language for the content that you want to put forward."  Benny Andrews who was very active in the New York arts community then and who was later to become part of a group called the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition that was aggressively pushing a lot of New York museums on the question of curatorial voice also became involved in the set of discussions in the 'New York Times'. So I sort of right away jumped in the middle of what was then a really big national discussion about large museums and African American work, about the nature of African American works and about the ways in which the discussion of African American Art needed to transform our understanding of American Art.  So that became one strand of what has continued to be my work.  On the other side at the National Center, we were trying to figure out how do you start to build something without the money.  Because we didn't have the money.  We didn't really even have the space.  But we were figuring how to start.  I wrote an article that appeared in 'Art Gallery' magazine in April of 1970 describing my ambitions for the museum at the center.
Story_ID: 7467
Speaker 1: So at the National Center [of Afro-American Artists, Boston, Massachusetts] end of this, we were starting to put together the museum and I had made some decisions about what we should do.  I knew we didn't want to be a storefront museum.  I knew we did want to collect.  I thought that our ambition should be to become a museum that held collections that had an impact on criticism and the construction of art history and that in time would become a viable museum of a reasonable scale with a commitment to the visual arts heritage of the black world.  So this was detailed in an article that appeared in 'Art Gallery' magazine in April of that year [1970] in which I identified five programs that I saw as developing.  Exhibitions, collections, some research dimensions which turned out in the end to be the creation of our slide library, some commitment to publication and to interpretive public programs.  And I thought we could reasonably do those things.  We were sharing space in the old gym of the Elma Lewis School [of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts].  So in this space I, with help from design people at the Museum of Fine Arts [Boston, Massachusetts] designed a system of movable walls that allowed us to create up to three gallery spaces with its own entrance and everything in that space.  And we rotated the use of the space between when the performing arts used it as a theater and presentation space and when we used it as a gallery space.  And I started organizing exhibitions.  I also started collecting and as I was mentioning to you earlier, we had acquired this one masterwork of Charles White.  And we committed to collecting because I thought the only way a museum gains any critical voice is by holding work.  And when you hold work it also represents your commitment to permanence and continuity.  So long before for example the studio and museum committed to collection construction, we were constructing a collection.  And from 1970--in January of 1970, we presented our first exhibition at the National Center.  I was able to do that because I brought the show that I had organized for Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  So I didn't have to spend time out of working on the show for M.F.A. [Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts] to organize the show for here.  So I brought that show and it was the first exhibition we presented.  From then until 1978, we shared that space at the Elma Lewis School.  And over that period of time, we presented exhibitions that both served as forums for artists in Boston [Massachusetts] but we also brought exhibitions.  We did Haitian shows, African exhibitions, contemporary and historical.  We also presented major figures in African American art--Romie [Romare Bearden], Lois Mailou Jones, John Biggers.  So we ran actually a very rich and textured program.  But after a year or two there, it became clear to me that I needed to be looking for a different space.  That we were not going to renovate that space--that we had projected in the timetable that we had in mind.  So I started searching for a space.
Story_ID: 7468
Speaker 1: In the mid '70s [1970s], the desegregation crisis came to Boston [Massachusetts].  And Boston public school population plummeted.  The building which we're in had been the annex to the David A. Ellis Elementary School [Boston, Massachusetts].  And when the population fell, this building was going to be decommissioned because there weren't enough students to require an annex.  The principal of the David Ellis School, a woman named Edith Simon called me and she said, "This building is not going to open in the fall.  You should try to get it because I know you've been looking for a museum space. And I don't want something next to my school that does not support what my school does."  So I thought that was a great idea. I came over here. We walked through the building.  It was fully useable.  I called Kathy Cane (sp.) who was the head of the mayor's Office of Cultural Affairs and I invited her over and she came over. And we walked through it again together and she said, "This would just be perfect for you.  Let's get together and see can't the city transfer this property to you and you'll be on your way."  Well that's not exactly what happened.  The mayor [Kevin H. White] was running for re-election at that moment.  And the racial politics of the city was bitter and somebody made the decision that it was a bad idea to be seen essentially turning this building over to us in Roxbury [neighborhood of Boston].  The press conference to transfer the building disappeared like that.  And from that moment it took two years to get a title to this property.  And in the two years, the property was completely ravished.  Everything that could be stolen from it left and by the time we got it, it was a ruin.  We're now at the very end of the '70s [1970s] and empty buildings in Boston are being burned daily and this building had had one small fire in it.  So we got this building and pretty much with neighbors and the small amount of money, we were able to do enough to occupy it in 1980.  And to start to try to figure out how to bring it around and get it in place so that we could use it.  So we moved into it very prematurely to forestall the possibility of losing it altogether.  It was a moment of some economic recession and resources were very tight.  In the same time we had had two fires in the buildings which occupied--which the Elma Lewis School [of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts] occupied and a great deal of the attention of my board and of the school's board was directed towards the reclamation of those properties.  So there was not an immediate focus on how to get this property in place and on line.  Byron Rushing, who is now in our state legislature and who previously had been president of the Museum of Afro-American History [Boston, Massachusetts], was drafting legislation to create a Roxbury State Heritage Park on the model of the other heritage parks in the commonwealth.  And his idea was that all of Roxbury would be the park.  And that Elliot Square would be the center of the park and there would be none contiguous sites.  So we visualized making this building because it was a 19th century structure with an important portion of its grounds a piece of the Roxbury State Heritage Park.  So our strategy for how to move this project along was to ally it with that project.  And we got this site then designated as a none contiguous part of the Roxbury State Heritage Park.  And that should have given us two and half million dollars to begin the restoration of the building and the property and we're now at the end of the '80s [1980s].  At that point, we got our first Republican [political party] governor [William F. Weld] in a while and all of this went down the tube.  The Heritage Park went into suspended animation, and the money which had been designated for us never happened.  So in the early '90s [1990s] we were still trying to secure that and to get it to happen.  But by the mid '90s [1990s] it was out and we were back to a new strategy which has led us to getting the site made, a Save America's Treasures site which then made it possible for us to use a different tack to bring in architectural money.  And we're now looking to do these renovations to the building and grounds and next year, which we should have been able to cause to have happened at least a half a decade ago.  That really has to do with the nature of public-private support in Boston.
Story_ID: 7469
Speaker 1: Now I want to return to other things that were happening in the period of all of this.  Over that period of time I did nine other exhibitions at the Museum of Fine Arts [Boston, Massachusetts].  A portion of them I organized from scratch, some of them I brought from other places but was the curator for them here.  In the meantime, I became very interested in serving as a kind of advocate in a national setting for the larger interest of African American artists and also of African American museums.  So I served on numerous panels for the Endowment for the Arts.  And I became involved serving with N.E.A. [National Endowment for the Arts] in the early '70s [1970s].  I eventually served as panel chairman for the Expansion Arts division [program for professionally directed, community-based arts activities] of the N.E.A. in the early '80s [1980s] when Frank Hodsoll was heading that and after A. B. [Alfred Bennett] Spellman [Jr.] had gone to work for the endowment for the arts.  In the meantime, the African American Museums Association, which became the national organization, which was the voice of all of the black museums, was in a process of evolution.  Margaret Burroughs and [Dr.] Charles [H.] Wright in the end of the '60s [1960s] had convened black people working in museums to try and start to build a community of interest at a national level there.  At the beginning of the '70s [1970s], there was a group called NAAMCO, which I was involved with.  It was partly out of people who had been in the energy that Margaret and Dr. Wright had directed.  It was partly built out of those of us who were attending the American Association of Museums's annual meeting and who were thinking how we needed to have a structure similar to that structure for our institutional progress.  So, so we created this organization called NAAMCO, which basically stood for National African American Museums and [Cultural?] Organizations, and that failed.  It was perceived as too much an Eastern establishment thing.  It was too much the New York-Boston-Philadelphia people.  Then we got a second chance with a series of meetings that were funded through the National Museum Act of the Smithsonian [Institution, Washington, D.C].  Byron and John Kinard who was the director of the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum [Washington, D.C.] played a large role in getting this piece of money.  But basically it was money, which allowed black people in the museum world to meet at six different sites in different locations over a year.  And we decided to make that the next forum for creating our organization.  Because it allowed us to have input and voice from all of the regions of the country.  And I became the ad hoc chairman of the initiative which in 1978 led to the found--to the founding of the African American Museums Association.  We who made up the association, Byron whom I mentioned earlier, Rowena Stewart, John Herman--Harmon--there was a whole group of us who were really very excited about the possibilities of museums. We forged that association and we did it with the idea that we would, do a survey and quantify what we meant in national terms.  We would then use that survey and its information to take to the black congressional representation and to try to get them to create a device to assist us.  We had this notion of creating a national black trust for museums that could aggregate federal and private money and in effect help to endow all of us because most of us were private organizations with very limited resources.  We all had issues of not having sufficient critical personnel.  Most of us had facilities issues.  We all wanted to be collecting which we could not do very vigorously.  We had a lot of common concerns.  So we tried to structure that by the end of the '80s [1980s].  By 18--1988, we were involved in the great discussion around whether such--whether an African American Museum would be created on the Mall in Washington [D.C.].  And that discussion in a way had sidetracked the effort to create a National Black Trust.  We tried to find a way to make common cause with that and that didn't ever work.  And what was possible to come out of all of that still hasn't really been realized.  But I was involved, at an exceedingly heavy level over the first ten years of that set of struggles.
Story_ID: 7470
Speaker 1: In the meantime, we at the Center [National Center of Afro-American Artists, Boston, Massachusetts] were interested in developing a larger international voice and presence and I was interested in that as well.  We were represented by a delegation that I was in at the seventieth anniversary of President Leopold Sedar Senghor in Senegal in the mid-'70s [1970s].  We were invited guests there.  Partly out of that set of relationships, we brought 'Contemporary Art of Senegal' to the Museum of Fine Arts [Boston, Massachusetts] and we did a secondary show focusing on Senegal at the French library here.  So we were operating on that level.  I organized several study and art travel trips to the Caribbean and I continued on my own to be involved partly as a consultant to the Museum Service in Jamaica at a point.  Taking an exhibition to Guyana as part of the 150th anniversary of the ending of slavery in the British West Indies, being involved with the development of some institutions in Barbados.  We exchanged exhibitions and other activities with Haiti.  So we were in a very wide dialog and I also was doing a lot of lecturing and speaking and writing to try and consolidate how all of these activities together contributed to what, in my view, was the most urgent agenda for us.  That urgent agenda was how to make an American art history transformed from the foundation.  What was happening was the old American art history was there and people were getting added to the ends of it.  So now you read the same chapter except it mentioned Jake [Jacob] Lawrence and Romare Bearden.  And where I thought we needed to go was to a rewritten chapter that reflected a more integrated, a more intrical participation.  And for that to happen, other things needed to happen.  There needed to be people writing.  There needed to be people speaking.  There needed to be exhibitions produced and brought forward.  There needed to be institutions, which from their independent base could present other visions of what our heritage was.  There needed to be a way to support a whole tradition.  Because a whole tradition isn't three or four exponents.  It's a community of production.  So there needed to be levels of support for beginning an intermediate--an upper intermediate as well as for the stars.  And, and I saw that we could in some way contribute to all of that.  I saw that we should be saying that when you look at American Art over this century, it's a series of stories about little cells of people. This group at Taos [New Mexico]. This group at Santa Fe [New Mexico].  That group at somebody's studio.  Those groups of people at Atlanta [Georgia] who were running that annual from 1942 until the end of the '60s [1960s] are those people in New York [New York] and Washington [D.C.] and Baltimore [Maryland] who were discussing the nature of black art from 1924 until everybody else discovered it in 1968.  Those all belonged to that history.  Not as an addition but as inseparable from it in time and place. So I saw my work as trying to foster that transformation of the understanding of American art history in as many different ways as I could.  And I saw the work of this entity as trying to provide an institutional platform from which that work could continuously spend and go forth.  So that's sort of been what I would like to think of has been my own work.
Story_ID: 7471
Speaker 1: These are the questions I have for you and that is, in this whole process, so there was no money that came from the Museum of Fine Arts [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: No, there was money that came from the Museum of Fine Arts. The relationship that we structured with the Museum of Fine Arts started out with two dimensions. We have kept those and built on them in some ways.  The Museum of Fine Arts committed to making available, a small amount of transferable money to help the Center [National Center of Afro-American Artists, Boston, Massachusetts] and then that amount of money was never meant to be the sum or the adequate amount. But it was meant to help to get this joint collaborative adventure going.  The Museum of Fine Arts also agreed to underwrite some of the staffing.  And since I also worked on that staff, my principal earnings have been on, on their payroll.  So that has been a significant piece of the contribution.  The third thing they agreed to do was they agreed to make available the kinds of technical resources that you need in the museum world.  So for example, we own about 1,500 or more works on paper, and for the last two years, the Museum of Fine Arts has assisted us in paper conservation needs for a large body of those objects.  Because they have a Paper Conservation department, they have a lot of relationships in paper conservation.  I have very limited resources to do that. So we were able to take some of our 19th century works, which needed the stabilization and to get those basically conserved properly.  I borrow, all the time, pedestals and bonnets and numerous other kinds of things.  In the process we're doing now with our renovation, I'm getting a lot of technical review and assistance on how to think about solutions that will be the most useful for us.  So that has in fact been a, a very positive collaboration for us.  And it is, I am sure, the only collaboration in American cultural history between a developing institution and a well-established one that has had the durability that we have had.  And I think that durability has largely been because of the quality of respect we have been able to have for the work of each other.
Story_ID: 7472
Speaker 1: Okay my question for you is that even given that--why, you know, is the lack of progress really based on the fact of, you know, of, of this funding issue?  You know, had you had the support which separates you from all the other African American museums, right?
Speaker 2: Well, if we had been in a city where there were some significant public support, we certainly would have ironed out facility issues long ago.  And with that, we would have solved other things because when you don't have to worry about facility, you can do all of the programs you have in mind and you can then generate on a larger scale.  Most of the facilities that African American Museums are in have had significant participation from city, county or state.  You know, when you think of the people with the best spaces, the California Afro-American Museum [Los Angeles, California] which is state, the Ohio museum [National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center, Wilberforce, Ohio] which is state, the Detroit [Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History] which has a magnificent facility but built by the City of Detroit.  Even in New York [New York] where the arts are seen as so essential to public policy, the public sector support through New York devices has been considerable.  And Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York] has been able to count importantly on an, on a, a portion of that in how they have configured their future.  Here in Boston [Massachusetts] that really has not been the case.  The other things that have been difficulties for us is the museum has never stood alone.  The museum has always been part of the larger concept of the National Center [of Afro-American Artists, Boston, Massachusetts].  And when we lost our facilities which housed performing and teaching dimensions, that became a really large loss for us, and it became a new constant source of concern about how to get back to re-engaging those.  So in a certain sense it removed the focus from being narrowly on how to get this one piece into perfect shape and always kept it on how to get the entire thing to come together once again.  So that also has been a very real concern for us because we have wanted to realize a larger vision and because we have continued to believe that there is the necessity in terms of our national community as a culture to have some place which does bring together all of the important areas of the arts and teaching and which creates a center that is able to have that kind of ferment and focus.  Those are, in a certain way, the obligation we have to a living tradition--to try and make places where it can move forward.
Story_ID: 7473
Speaker 1: So tell me what your sense about, you know, where the mus--the African American community--museum community is and its future.
Speaker 2: In the period from the end of the '60s [1960s] through certainly the mid-'80s [1980s], the very large concern that black museums really had was how to structure ourselves in ways that really were new, and uniquely serviceable to our communities.  How to become museums that were not simply recreations of white museums with black people.  And that was a set of issues and a set of struggles.  I'm not sure that we've sustained probing that question, as much as, as we might.  There are some other points about the museum community, of black museums that I'd also like to put in though.  One is, many people assumed that the justification for African American museums was that they should step in and do what majority museums weren't doing.  So they were compensatory.  This compensatory notion needs to be thrown out the window.  If you assume a compensatory notion, it means that whenever the other institutions get around to doing what they should have been doing all the while, you have no reason to be.  What we need in the American experience is not simply more diversity with then existing institutions large and small, we need a more diverse institutional community.  You can't have a dialogue--and cultural life is a dialogue.  You can't have a dialogue without having independence of voice.  And you can't have independence of voice without having different bases or platforms from which to speak.  Within the context of existing institutions, you can veer them a few degrees this way and some degrees that way.  But they do, in fact, have a particular momentum, which is the momentum of their own history.  They have responded to the pressures brought forward, many in creative and exciting ways.  But those responses can never be wholly adequate for all that needs to happen.  And those responses need to be themselves in a dialogue with other conversants, with other institutional visions about the same material.  So black museums justify themselves. I mean if somebody asked me why I do this, it's because I feel commissioned by six thousand years of history to support the living end of a productive tradition.  Somebody has to make the focus on this heritage their everyday work, not their work in addition to fifty other topics, not their work for February, not their work even for a periodic revisitation, but work for every day.  Work that is so sustained that you can then tackle the things that are difficult.  There are some kinds of cultural problems that are uncomfortable, critical problems that are uncomfortable.  And to do them, you need a context that says, "My larger interest is a sympathetic one."  It's like teaching.  You can be critical of your student if your student believes that you really ultimately have their whole growth in mind.  If you just turn up and start criticizing with no history of a broader commitment, then they're right to take offense.  It's an attack, not, not a growth thing.  So our work has to create a continuity of support sufficient that we can absorb a lot of differences and fights interculturally about what this means and what that means.  About how to understand Kara Walker [artist] for example.  And why should the discussion about the recent interest in reclamation of stereotypes from the 19th century, which gave us all such a hard time.  This is really a discussion about our cultural place.  We should be in that discussion.  We may not agree on it.  But it should be happening in a context of the people who feel impacted by it.  That's a discussion which is a different discussion in a white setting, than in a black setting.  It's like the difference between talking about something in your family and outside your family.  It's a perceived difference.  So there's an enormous set of roles that we haven't really gotten to serve well.  We have not gotten past the first place of obligation that we have.  The first place of obligation we had when we started setting up these institutions was to be celebratory.  To help people feel good about reclaiming a heritage they didn't know well enough.  Now we have to pick up other work.  How do you criticize that?  How do you deal with tension and difference within it?  Because those are all the signs of health.  That it's still a living tradition.
Story_ID: 7474
Speaker 1: So Barry, what are your feelings about the future of, of African Americans today?
Speaker 2: My feeling is that we have to work very hard to create a community of support much wider than the one that we have.  That we have to look very hard to find the kinds of patrons who feel enlisted in a visceral way in the issues that we need to work with.  And who will by their support, give us more options of being independent in our explorations than we have.  I--when I look at Lila Wallace, and the great deal of money that they spent to reach nontraditional audiences, almost all of this money was spent to help traditional institutions reach nontraditional audiences.  Which those institutions have enough wealth that if they chose, they could do themselves.  In the meantime, the institutions that live in communities don't get enough resources to begin to realize the vision that they have codeveloped in the places where they are.  And that's what needs to happen.  If we fail to do that, we will have merely succeeded in mimicking, not in transforming.  And our job is transformation, not imitation.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, I didn't expect to be doing this for a lifetime.  And I have deferred so many other easier routes to do this.  I would be happy if this project found the kind of institutional stability that I want for it.  If the collections that we have built find themselves at the center of writing and discussion and assessment and reassessment.  If the possibility of a museum that has a dynamic response to the world around it, can be realized in this.  I would feel that I had made a platform for that to happen.  And that other people with ideas that I've never had could take that and build on it.  I would be happy.  I would feel like that my years of work had laid a foundation that someone else could count on, for solidity.
