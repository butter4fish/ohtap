Story_ID: 26395
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask that only require a short answer--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and the first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: And what is it?
Speaker 2: Fried flounder.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What is that?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year.
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination.
Speaker 2: I haven't gotten one yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Is that a fair answer, or do you want me to make somethin' up?
Speaker 1: That's fair enough (laughter).
Speaker 2: The best vacation I ever had was on a cruise ship; not a place, on a ship.  I don't have a favorite (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--In the Caribbean?
Speaker 2: Well, I was there with my wife for my 22nd anniversary; we were out a week.  People ask me what you just asked me; Larry, I have no idea where we went; I just saw her for an entire week.  I don't know where the ship went, I don't know what port we were in, I just spent time with my wife after twenty-two years; I have no idea exactly where we went--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --but it was, I think, in the Caribbean; I really didn't pay attention, I didn't, I'm sorry. (laughter)
Speaker 1: That's fair enough.  The last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Kind of, I mean-"All that glitters is not gold" would be my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26396
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side but separately so we can keep them distinct and then we'll put 'em together--
Speaker 2: Okay, alright.
Speaker 1: --so can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Lillie, L-I-L-L-I-E Echols, E-C-H-O-L-S Hubbard.  Echols is her maiden name; they called her Lillie Hill.  You know we all have nicknames down south.
Speaker 1: Oh, her nickname is Lillie Hill?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Lillie Hill.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind that?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean it just--the combination of Lillie and Hill (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I got a--yeah.  We all got nicknames; everybody down there--if you go to my hometown and ask any of those formal names, people won't have a clue who you're talking about, you have to use the nickname.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Umm, go ahead.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't--I'd have to look it up.
Speaker 1: Do you have a guess?  In the '20s [1920s] or--
Speaker 2: I can look it up.
Speaker 1: Well we don't want you to look it up right now.
Speaker 2: I would say 1929.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a good guess.
Speaker 2: In Danville, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  Can you trace them all the way back to slavery or to Africa or--and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Her father was McKinley (ph.) Echols.  Well what I remember about my grandfather, 'cause I used to live with him for a time, was he spent fifty years working at a car dealership.  Now everything I tell you about my family--my mother and father-- is all Jim Crow memories, alright?  So you have to forgive me but they're all Jim Crow memories.  So what I remember was my grandfather worked for fifty years at a dealership and all he got was a cheap watch and dismissed afterwards.
Speaker 1: So what did he do there?
Speaker 2: He changed the oil in cars.  He couldn't read or write but he was a very proud man, he really was; Deacon in the church.  My grandmother was a--Oh, his parents were sharecroppers and it's taken me quite a while to find out anything about 'em; I know one was white because he was very light complexioned and he had, you know, hair like somebody in his--one of his parents was white, and they were sharecroppers.  My grandmother was a stay-at-home mom; the two of them had three children, two girls and one boy.
Speaker 1: What was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Geneva--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --G-E-N-E-V-A, Geneva Echols.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her mother is--we just--is a Dotson (ph.); we just called her Grandma Dotson.  I'd have to look up the specifics, okay?  I'm speaking from memory.  And Grandma Dotson used to babysit myself and my sister when we were children.  I was always told that her parents were born into slavery and later freed.  Now Larry, what that means is that I know personally, or have met all of the people in my family that were not slaves.  If I, If I don't know 'em, they were slaves.  Because I remember right back to that edge when they were born in slavery and then freed.  And I find that very strange; that means that it can't be that long ago--
Speaker 1: It's not.
Speaker 2: --I know, I know 'em, I know all of 'em that weren't slaves.
Story_ID: 26397
Speaker 1: My father was one of fourteen children.
Speaker 2: Now what's your dad's full name?
Speaker 1: James Edward Hubbard, Senior--
Speaker 2: Oh, same as yours, of course.
Speaker 1: All but Senior.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: 1919 or 1920--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --December the 22nd.  I think he was like nine years older than my mom; he might have been more than that, I really don't know.  Like I said, I can look all that--I, I, I, I have a kind of a family tree with those in it, but I don't really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--That's fine, I mean we can--those materials can be made available to the file, but I just (simultaneous)--and so was he born in Danville too?
Speaker 1: He was born in Ringgold, Virginia.
Speaker 2: Okay, I hadn't heard of that place before.  Ringo, R-I-N-G-O?
Speaker 1: O-L-D. [Ringgold]
Speaker 2: Oh, Ringgold, okay.
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: Ringgold, Virginia.  And again, what can you tell us about his side of the family?
Speaker 1: His mother was Maggie, and we called her Grandma Mag.  His father, I believe, was George W. Hubbard.  The W, by the way, stands for Washington (laughter).  You know how back in the day, right?  Anyway, his father died very young and my father basically was the man of the house; had tremendous responsibility with thirteen siblings, but he did a good job.  But the reason I bring it up is it shaped his personality having that much responsibility that young for that long, and so it--to a degree shaped a piece of mine.
Story_ID: 26398
Speaker 1: Now did your dad [James Edward Hubbard, Sr.] have a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: They were born under Jim Crow, I mean my mom [Lillie Echols Hubbard] worked a tobacco plantation and picking tobacco, you can only do that I think six months; she worked six months out of the year just when there was tobacco.  My dad worked in the Dan River Cotton Mill.  There was no such thing as, far as I could tell, education.  I mean it certainly was no mention of college.  We lived in a place called Liberty Hill which was segregated--black only, and it was basically the city filled in a dump, a landfill on a dump and then built the projects on top of that and we lived there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26399
Speaker 1: In terms of your mother [Lillie Echols Hubbard] and father [James Edward Hubbard, Sr.], are there any other stories about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--there's lots of stories; my dad (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--I mean before, I mean about their ancestors.
Speaker 2: My grandmother had a brother--I wish I had my notes now.  We used to call him Bro Morgan, Brother Morgan.
Speaker 1: Is this your maternal grandmother [Geneva Echols]?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and he had something they call wanderlust, and he used to travel all over, hoppin' trains, and he would come in town every now and then.  But I knew nothing about my grandfather.  My grandma had brothers and sisters; I knew 'em only as babysitters.  Yeah, I don't know much; they just babysat me.
Speaker 1: You said there's stories about--you said that Jim Crow dominated the scene (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Inaudible response)
Speaker 1: --and were there stories about, you know, egregious examples of Jim Crow?  Because this is for history, so--
Speaker 2: I would--I remember walking to school and being spit on and chased by white people, if that's what you're talking about (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's you, but I was asking about them growing up and some of the stuff that they saw.
Speaker 2: They never--to their credit, I guess they never talked to me about it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I mean my mom was in the Civil Rights Movement.  She would come home and tell me how bad she was treated at work.  My dad was treated so bad that he left the family and left Danville [Virginia] to create a better life; he just couldn't take it no more; he's a proud man.  But no, I don't know any more than that.
Story_ID: 26400
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Lillie Echols Hubbard and James Edward Hubbard, Sr.] met that's passed down, or how they met and fell in love?
Speaker 2: I wrote a--I always have these people who say "You should write a book."  I don't have time for that and nobody else has volunteered, but one day I sat down and I wrote the first chapter and it was about that very thing, how they met.  My mom called me up while I was a young professor at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and told me that she had just got off the phone with her doctor and he told her she had two weeks to live; she was gonna die of cancer.  By the way, she lived another thirteen years; but that's what she told me.  So I immediately went home and for the next several weeks, I helped treat her and it was very painful--infections.  Anyway, the point is that we would spend--sometimes she would wake up about two in the morning and she would be in pain, and I would get to sit with her and, you know, comb her hair or wash her face, and I was in my thirties Larry, and those were the first times during those quiet moments with her, that she ever talked about how she met my dad and their relationship; my entire life, she never talked about it because my dad left home before I can remember, and basically just came to visit my entire life, but they never lived together.  But she told me these stories; she said--I mean some of which I don't want to say, but basically--I had a Uncle Froggy; I don't know his real name but Uncle Froggy and he had a barber shop, Froggy's Barber Shop.  And you know how barber shops were back in the day, that's where everybody hung out and that was a social function.  And my mom was young and aggressive and she was trying to pull away from the control of her dad [McKinley (sp.) Echols] and the only place he would let her go by herself was to Uncle Froggy's barber shop 'cause he didn't trust her otherwise.  So she would go there and hang out; everybody knew her, and every now and then she said this tall, quiet, handsome guy would come in who seemed like he had been everywhere. (laughter)  He had his own motorcycle and he just seemed so responsible and so polite and she was intrigued by him.  And she would ask about him, she would talk to him; you could not help but like such a young man.  But look, that was borne out of having responsibilities for thirteen siblings, so naturally my [maternal] grandfather liked him, and my [maternal] grandmother [Geneva Echols].  And shortly thereafter, she got permission and they got married.  Pulled the trailer home into the yard of his mom and that's where we lived.  I was born and I lived there for a while; I remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's the extent of what I know about them meeting.
Story_ID: 26401
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about--I know you didn't--you weren't raised by your father [James Edward Hubbard, Sr.] as such, right?  Because he wasn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--He was in and out.
Speaker 1: In and out, okay.
Speaker 2: What happened was, and I should say this for the record, he couldn't take the Jim Crow [laws] and so his sister was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]; she told him to come up, stay with her and make a way for his family and he did that; he worked as a janitor in, you know, that famous boxing gym in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: That (unclear) Gym?  No, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, it's in Philly [Philadelphia].  Anyway, he made a way--he sent for us all to come, which my mother [Lillie Echols Hubbard] had agreed to do, but when time came for her to actually leave family and friends and go to Philadelphia, she couldn't do it.  And she never did it, so he couldn't come back, she didn't wanna go, initially they sent me.  I went there and lived with my dad and I started the first grade there, I lived in the City of Brotherly Love [Philadelphia], but she couldn't come and never did; and he couldn't go back in Jim Crow.  And that was it.
Story_ID: 26402
Speaker 1: Now when you think about their--your parents [Lillie Echols Hubbard and James Edward Hubbard, Sr.], their personalities and their traits and how they walked and how they looked and everything, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Take after?  I have my mom's spirit.  My mom was fiery; I spent the greater part of my life here on earth when she was alive sitting at the kitchen table in deep conversations getting wisdom from her about life.  She guided me from the projects in Danville [Virginia] to a professorship at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], right at the kitchen table; every problem, every episode, every situation, every scenario, we sat there and I was the beneficiary of her wisdom.  Hundreds and hund--thousands of hours at the kitchen table talking.  My dad [James Edward Hubbard, Senior] was--I had never seen a black man like him; when I lived with my dad, he had worked himself up from being a janitor to being a file clerk with one of the biggest law firms in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and so one of the things they had him do was quote "run errands." Well, Larry, he would run errands to the bank with checks for $100,000 in his pocket (laughter).  I mean who do you know that does that?  And so over time, when the bank saw him coming, they knew he had six or seven figures in his pocket to deposit for the law firm, and a culture arose and my dad learned the rules well.  He taught me how to grease people's palm (laughter).  Who you know that talks like that?  (Laughter)  He told me about politeness and courtesy and how to conduct business, he was pressed, he wore--excuse me, he wore a tie every day, he had a nice office, he could talk to anybody.  He lived in North Philly [Philadelphia] which was one of the most dangerous places in Philly, and when he walked home at eleven [o'clock] at night, people would get up and say "Hi, Mr. Hubbard, how are you?"  Everyone respected him, and when he walked into the bank, people, people greeted him with respect.  And that's why he couldn't go back to Danville [Virginia], shuffling around in the cotton mill.  Boy, and I never met anybody like him man, he, he just--suit and tie back then, polished, people just lovin' to see him, being able to talk to anybody.  And so, over the years, when I became a professional, I had a hard time because I don't particularly care for people, and I certainly am quiet, but I reflect back on my father's smooth ability to interact with anybody and through prayer and meditation, I took that from him--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I didn't want to be that way, but now I can talk to anybody, anybody at all.  They say I'm gregarious; that came from my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26403
Speaker 1: Now how old were you when your father [James Edward Hubbard, Sr.] moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: He took me, I was five [years old]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I was in Catholic school; he put me in Catholic school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So you moved with him initially when he first moved?
Speaker 2: He was--I forget, this was a while--he went first, and then came to get me--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --and I lived with him for a year.
Speaker 1: This was about 1956 to '57 [1957], I guess, right?  Or thereabouts.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.  And I was in Catholic school.  I got in a lotta trouble there; but I've been in trouble my whole career.
Speaker 1: Well five year-old trouble is different from big trouble, or is it?
Speaker 2: Not if you're--the management.  I was a management problem when I was in the first grade.
Speaker 1: So what would you do?
Speaker 2: I was the only--I think I was the only black kid there and I didn't like some of the things the nuns would say to me, and so sometimes on recess, I'd take it out on the other kids and back then the nuns would tear you up and put you in a closet.
Speaker 1: Did you miss your mother [Lillie Echols Hubbard]?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did you miss your mother?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I used to write her; my dad had me write her a lot, and she would write me, but a funny thing happened.  So we came home [Danville, Virginia] after a year; I hadn't seen her.  And I was dressed up, and this was the country and this was on Liberty Hill so a lot of the neighbors turned out (laughter) for--to see--my nickname back then was Scrappy--to see Scrappy come back, right?  So I get out of the cab with my dad, there's a whole lotta people standing in front of me and I look Larry, and I didn't know which one was my mom; couldn't tell, and that upset her like you would not believe.  And so she grabbed me and refused to allow me to leave ever again, so my dad had to go back by himself because I really didn't know which one was her; I mean that was it, she never let me go away again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26404
Speaker 1: Now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have a sister.  I had an older sister but she died at birth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mom [Lillie Echols Hubbard] used to tell me a lot about that.
Speaker 1: So you have a younger sister though.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Five years younger, Susan--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Gayle, maiden name Hubbard, married name Penn, P-E-N-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is she involved in science at all?
Speaker 2: She's a teacher but she's a public school teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's a speech pathologist and one of the best there is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26405
Speaker 1: Now you lived in Liberty Hill [Danville, Virginia], you said?
Speaker 2: The project, yeah.
Speaker 1: Em hmm.
Speaker 2: Well, if you lived in Danville and you were black, there were three places that I remember that you could live, and one was a landfill on top of a dump and it was called Liberty Hill; the other was a place called Almagro (ph.), and I don't know that that means but I'm sure it means something black but it was just Almagro.  And it could have been "Alnagro," but we called it Almagro.
Speaker 1: Almagro.
Speaker 2: And then across Main Street there was nothing but doctors, teachers and lawyers--oh, and funeral parlor owners.  But I rarely went over there; that's where the schools were, that's where the--I guess the upper-class blacks live, I don't know.
Speaker 1: But--so the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--You couldn't live anywhere else, and if you--we had to walk to school and that's why sometimes it would be dangerous; people--white people would come after you (laughter).  You got to be careful if you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Now how is Danville structured?  I mean what was the demographic of it?  Did blacks live on one side of town and whites on the other or were they kind of in different pockets?
Speaker 2: The Almagro was next to Liberty Hill kind of, and then across town, if you wanna say that, across South Main Street was black teachers, schools; you know you had to go over there to go to school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --lawyers, funeral directors, they all lived over there on Broadnick [ph.] Street.  Langston High School was there, Westmoreland High School was there, Gibson [school].  No schools where we were (laughter).
Speaker 1: So there were three black high schools in Danville?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm--all right.
Speaker 2: During Jim Crow, there was one of everything, that's it--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --there was one little hospital, if you could call it that.  There was E.A. Gibson High School in Danville.
Speaker 1: That's the black high school?
Speaker 2: That was all I knew; I mean look, I--that's--I'm just telling what I knew.  I don't remember having no big choices of schools (laughter) to go to.  Then there was Westmoreland Junior High, and then there was Langston High.  Now we played ball against all the black schools, but we had to get on a bus to do that Larry (laugher) and go to Yanceyville or, you know, Rocky Mountain.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm just trying to figure out.  Now in Danville itself, there's one black high school?
Speaker 2: That's all I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay because you said E.A. Gibson.  Is that--
Speaker 2: Elementary.
Speaker 1: --that's an elementary, okay.  All right, I was just (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's all I remember.
Speaker 1: So that and the middle--Westmoreland Middle--Junior High School and then Langston High School.  Okay.  Do you have any recollection of who E.A. Gibson was, or did they even tell you?
Speaker 2: Emm emm (SHAKING HIS HEAD).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Westmoreland, I assumed it was General Westmoreland it was named after, I don't know.
Speaker 1: I think that would have been a little early for him--
Speaker 2: I don't know, nobody ever told me anything like that.
Speaker 1: --Langston's probably John Mercer Langston, I'm thinking, but--okay.  Now I've heard people talk about the projects, when they were first built, as being not so bad as they became to be, but what was your recollection of Liberty Hill?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm going through this with my son because he always says he hates the way he grew up because he says he had everything, and he likes the way I grew up; we had this conversation late last night.  He said he likes the way I grew up 'cause I had nothing, and look what I got now.  And so he's struggling with his identity; I told him he was dead wrong.  Don't say I had nothing, I had a lot; you're talking about material things.  And so growing up in the projects on the one hand was outstanding.  There was--everybody knew everybody; no white people was there, but we all knew each other and that's a lotta people.  There was a huge playground and we all convened there every single day and had plenty of social activities; there were seasons, there was a kite-flying season and it was viciously competitive, there was marble season and many fights used to break out at the marble--in fact, my mom [Lillie Echols Hubbard] had to come over and snatch me out of there a couple of times.  There was a basketball season where people from Almagro would come over and it was on, you know what I'm saying?  And it just went on like that.  There was a season for crafts where the adults would come over; we'd learn how to make pot holders for our moms and be all proud of it, and there was a bicycle season, there was a skate season.  There was always something to do, but I remember feeling like--you know when you get a new puppy and you put him in a box that's got high sides and you tear up a bunch of little paper and stick it in there and you can't go anywhere?  I felt like that, and I remember thinking that was so sad that a five year-old should feel like that; I felt just like that.  I was just in this box with some papers so I could pee on and I couldn't even see what was on the other side.
Story_ID: 26406
Speaker 1: So you said you felt trapped; why did you feel trapped?  What was holding you?  I mean you were five [years old], I mean, you know but--
Speaker 2: I couldn't do nothing in Danville [Virginia], you'd go to jail.
Speaker 1: But age five you know, most children are kept kinda close, but--
Speaker 2: Emm emm, we had the--I was very independent.  You could--in, in the projects?  You could not see your parents for a couple of days, I mean you're in the playground, you're having fun and everybody raised everybody else's kid; you know they see me misbehaving way up the way, I'm gonna get spanked and my momma [Lillie Echols Hubbard] gonna get called, you know.  Even the teenagers would spank you and take you home to your momma if you act wrong; so--you never had to be hanging around your parents (laughter), I mean you was out there, you know, in the fields--in the playground just doing it; you grew up there, it was the--yeah, they, they--you know, the community raised you, not your parents per se.
Speaker 1: So are you referring then to the larger city of Danville, I mean being restricted to just Liberty Hill [neighborhood in Danville] or something?
Speaker 2: My world was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it was nothing else.  If I tried to go over to Almagro [neighborhood in Danville], I get beat up; if I tried to go to Gibson, had to be careful 'cause that was like right on the edge of where white people lived, and I didn't venture to Westmoreland except when I was in school there; that was my world, there was nothing else.  Now you could go the movies, but there was one theater called the Rialto, and you could only sit in the balcony if you were black.  And there was a--train tracks ran right through the neighborhood 'cause who cared?  I mean it's just--and so we could hop the train and go to the movies; that was kinda nice.
Speaker 1: So you all would hop on the freight train and it would take you right to the movies?
Speaker 2: You had to be careful 'cause sometimes, if you blast--I mean over time, you get smart; they'd be blasting caps and stuff out there but we knew all that.  You had to learn how to handle a start-up 'cause the trains jerk, and it kind of propagates, and if you get on too early, it'll throw you right off to the ground.  I mean you learn stuff but yeah.  We even learned how to switch tracks 'cause sometime they'd have the locks on it and sometime they wouldn't, but we'd catch trains (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--That creates some mayhem wouldn't it?  I mean switching the tracks on the train when--
Speaker 2: You're a kid; you don't really know what a mayhem--all you know is 'Hey, look, this is unlocked,' and you play with the thing.  But--throw rocks, skate, it was always an adventure 'cause number one, you parents tell you "Stay off the tracks."  So first adventure 'cause you're sneaking and you're on the tracks with your boys; second, you're going somewhere.  You know, nobody that we knew had cars so you, you were like going, you know; it was great (laughter).  And sometime man we'd be watching a scary movie and then have to come home at night and the train stopped running after a while, so now you gotta walk like a couple of miles; man, you're talking about scared (laughter).  You've just seen a monster movie or something (laughter).  Those are good memories; kids nowadays they don't have memories like that.  But I did feel like this was gonna be it forever; all my friends and cousins and stuff, you know, a lot of them are in jail, a lot of them are on drugs, and I can tell you what happened to most of them; it's not good.

Speaker 1: So was there like a--I guess a black street [in Danville, Virginia]--a business district kind of street with shows or--
Speaker 2: Emm emm (SHAKING HIS HEAD NO).
Speaker 1: --I mean like the black business strip.
Speaker 2: Emm emm (SHAKING HIS HEAD NO).
Speaker 1: You were mentioning Main Street or something I mean like a place--
Speaker 2: That's white.
Speaker 1: That was white?
Speaker 2: There's no black business--I mean the only black business I ever saw was there was a general store, Sam Donahue's store, and then my uncle had a barber shop [Froggy's Barber Shop].
Speaker 1: So there wasn't a place like a strip where black folks would congregate--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --and have some businesses and activities.
Speaker 2: No, no businesses, just--you picked tobacco and that's it.  Everybody in the projects basically worked tobacco or cotton or something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No stores, not that I know of.  I mean you could go down--my mom [Lillie Echols Hubbard] once got a job at a place called Belk-Leggett's (ph.), which was a retail store but that was white, so you had to be very careful when you go in there, really careful.
Speaker 1: Like downtown was all white.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.
Speaker 2: And Belk-Leggett was white and it was downtown, so you had to be real careful when you go in there meeting her; real careful.
Speaker 1: So what were the rules?  I mean for the interaction?
Speaker 2: There is no interaction--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--For instance, if you go into a store, is there--what is the expectation?
Speaker 2: Well there were only certain stores you could go in; like you could go in--it was kinda like K-Mart [store] or something; I don't know what the name of it was, you could kinda go in there; people would watch you.  If you go in some of the upscale stores, you'll be in trouble, I mean you don't belong in there at all, you know.  When I moved to Baltimore [Maryland] even, the first week I was there, my cousin and I went into a store and the guy just called the cops as soon as he saw us.  The police came and put us down.
Speaker 1: So you were eleven [years old] then, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I wasn't used to that; they usually don't call the cops just 'cause you walk in, but that happened in Baltimore (laughter).  The cops put us right on the ground.
Speaker 1: Okay.   In Danville, could you try on clothes and that kind of stuff in the store?
Speaker 2: (SHAKING HIS HEAD NO).
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: You was--you need to be invisible, okay?  You can go in, especially if your momma worked there.  You don't need to speak to nobody, you need to find her, and whatever you gotta do, and then get out.
Speaker 1: Now was Danville a town that had like black and white water fountains and rest rooms and all that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Emm hmm (NODDING HIS HEAD).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: It's still bad to this day.
Speaker 1: Emm.
Speaker 2: If you get on and Google Danville and look at the demographic, I think, you know, a third of the city might be unemployed; I mean it's a hard place to live.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I got the Key to the City [award], you know; I was proud of that.
Story_ID: 26408
Speaker 1: We always ask this question and you've kind of answered it in some ways already, but what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Puppies.  I like dogs a lot, for a whole bunch of reasons, still do.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite dog growing up?
Speaker 2: They wouldn't let me have a dog so--I mean my aunt had a dog named Butch, and she had a fireplace too 'cause she lived over there with the teachers and one of my favorite things to do is to get Butch to lay in front of the fireplace where his fur was heated, and then lay on him; aw man, nice, yeah; that was great.  What was the other question, sounds?
Speaker 1: Yes, sights, sounds and smells.
Speaker 2: I loved their seasons; you know I loved kite season where kids would be up there; man, we used to--you have to master these things.  You--it wasn't--I'm not saying that "Okay, now they flying kites."  Man, you know, it was a matter of bragging rights and respect, so you go over there and you got a spool or spring like this (HAND DEMONSTRATION SHOWING SIZE), and you go and put the kites up in Liberty Hill [neighborhood in Danville], but they gonna--they gonna go out over the white folk area if you're good.  And then if you're really good--'cause once you put a kite out that far, you can't bring it back in; you was a mile away.  The wind'll snap your string; but if you was good, everybody would crowd around and you milk [ph.]--and we had these techniques called milkin' and man you bring that thing in there, you was a hero.  Your momma's old stockings is the tail on the kite; I remember that.
Speaker 1: Did you make your own kites?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Nobody had no money.  You literally had no money, no money.  I used to work on an apple truck, fifty cent a bucket if I sold it, and I would come home with six bucks sometime, and man my whole family would party for days with that money; that was some serious money; my ma [Lillie Echols Hubbard] loved that.  But marble season, you go over there with a--first you go over with a little--your momma might buy you a little thing of marbles like that (DEMONSRATION); in two weeks, man you got a big shopping bag full of marbles 'cause you done beat up on folks in the ring.  You know we had something called holds--holseys (ph.); man we had all these games, man, and it was very serious business, okay?  (Laughter)  Basketball--when basketball season come, I just played until I dropped; I could barely get home, I was so tired, and then do it all over again; and I loved it.  And you knew everybody, you know?  I just--those were the great sights and sounds.  You know, the grownups sitting out back, you know, drinking some hot nights, and I liked the laughter and the feeling of it all, and we would just be sitting there talking but--it's hard to explain, but it was a community, it was a real community.

Speaker 1: Now you started school in E.A. Gibson [school, Danville, Virginia]?  Is that right?  No, in Catholic school in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], right?  That's where you started school?
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When, you know, my father [James Edward Hubbard, Senior] brought me home to see my mom and I didn't recognize her, that was the end of that, so I ended up in Gibson.
Speaker 1: Did you have a better time, you know, conforming to the rules at Gibson?
Speaker 2: It was black, and I didn't make any friends, 'cause like I said, to this day I'm a private guy, introvert.
Speaker 1: But you had no friends in grade school?
Speaker 2: Not in the school, but I knew everybody in the projects.  And I wasn't interested in no friends in the school, you know.  Some of them were from Almagro [neighborhood in Danville] for example, you know what I'm saying?  That was kind of a rival neighborhood.  Some of them were from the side of town with doctors and lawyers and all that; I wasn't interested in that, but there was a teacher, my first black teacher, a woman named Miss Shepherd (ph.).  Oh man, she seemed like an angel, and I did good for her, you know?  She paid a lot of attention to me and I got very good grades.  And when I got the Key to the City [award], I didn't know it, but she came back for that.  You know how old she must have been?  And when it was over, I was leaving and somebody said "You know Miss Shepherd was there?"  I was like "What?"  Oh God, and I missed thanking her.
Speaker 1: So she basically had a good rapport with you?
Speaker 2: I just remember she was an angel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was six [years old]; Miss Shepherd--the whole city remembers.  You say "Scrap," people say "Miss Shepherd."  They remembered our relationship.  When I got the Key to the City, people was talking about "Miss Shepherd's here."  There's a couple of teachers like that; Miss Moretta (ph.) Byrd--Miss Moretta Byrd was my sixth grade teacher, and it was the first time--look, in the fifth grade, I got spankings all the time and I got two Ds 'cause I was in Miss Jones' class.  In the sixth grade, I got the perfect report card; in fact, I think I still have it at home.  I got As everywhere, I got zeros for days missed, I got, you know, one's for citizenship, you couldn't have a more perfect card 'cause of Miss Moretta Byrd.
Speaker 1: What was the difference in the two?
Speaker 2: Gee, I don't know but I can speculate.  So I--I told you last week somebody called me an eccentric; I think I must have been an eccentric my whole life.  I think Miss Jones viewed that as abnormal and rebellious, and I think Miss Byrd viewed that as gifted and nurtured, and so I blossomed.  And that happens to this day, even though I'm in my sixties (laughter).  Some places I'm very disruptive, and some places I flourish.  And so under Miss Byrd, she encouraged me and praised me rather than rebuking me, and I did very good.
Story_ID: 26410
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite subject in grade school?
Speaker 2: No.  There was this thing they had every year called an operetta, and it was a huge play.  Larry, when I say huge, I mean huge, man.  People from all over the city would come, there was costumes, you had to rehearse, you had to learn like ten pages of--and I always had a major role and I liked that.  There was something called Mayday where students learned how to plant the Maypole (ph.) with colored crepe paper, I liked that; but no particular subject, I didn't like school that much.  I don't think I ever liked school.
Speaker 1: But were you good in math?
Speaker 2: Emm emm (SLIGHT SHAKING OF HIS HEAD); very bad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I still view myself as bad in math and I just wrote a math book; I just published a math book two years ago.  I learned when I--I told you I grew up para-military; what we learned was one, to find our biggest weakness, and then attack it.  And so my biggest weakness was math, so I wrote a math book and published it under Wiley & Sons, the biggest publisher in (laughter)(unclear).  But you know you do it; I teach my--I train my students that way too.  You find your weakness and then you run toward it as fast as you can (laughter).
Story_ID: 26411
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Emm hmm, in Danville [Virginia], not in Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Reverend McCrary [ph.] was our reverend; sometimes we--you know we didn't have cars, and there was only--look, the church, "the" church, "the" church was on the side of town where the teachers and doctors lived.  I mean it's hard to get over there without a car.
Speaker 1: You said "the" church (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--There was a--well there was "a" black church; now--
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Calvary Baptist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now don't get me wrong, and this church is now famous, but when I was there, a new guy came to the projects; his name was Reverend Campbell, and he started a Holy-Roller church; that scared everybody, but I understand that church is big now.  And what they would do is--the Holy-Rollers would come to your house and invite you to their house until they got about ten children, and then they would show movies about Jesus; so that was a little scary for us but fun.  It be like ten of us over some strange lady's house in the projects and she had this thing that was a movie projector like nobody had ever seen there; that's, you know, that was white folks' stuff man, movie projector.  We was like, watching the movies, and it was always like Jesus stories but, you know, it was something interesting--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but they was Holy-Rollers.  We didn't go to their church.
Speaker 1: Did they play like a lot of music in church?  At the Holy-Roller church?
Speaker 2: They did a lotta things strange, yes; they would shout, dance in the aisles and get the--filled with the Holy Spirit; you know, scary, man.  I was in a very conservative Baptist church.
Speaker 1: So your mother [Lillie Echols Hubbard] was a member of that church--that conservative Baptist church.
Speaker 2: My mother, her mother [Geneva Echols], her mothers (laughter)--it's like the whole family.
Speaker 1: Now this is the church that the civil rights activity was generated from?
Speaker 2: Emm emm (SHAKING HIS HEAD); no, too conservative for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26412
Speaker 1: In fact, Black [Bloody] Monday, the most violent event in the history of civil rights, when the kids got beat like that in their heads, a lot of those kids came from the Holy-Roller church.  Like I remember seeing film of a Hot Shot who was my friend--ten years old; his skull was cracked; I saw the blood pouring out of it on film.  They--those cops, what they did was they took baseball bats and they sawed them short and drove a hole and put rawhide in there and that's what they beat the Civil Rights people with.  And they beat women too; Reverend Campbell's wife, they beat the crap outta her; they beat her dress off.  I saw that when I was a kid.
Speaker 2: How old were you then, at that time?
Speaker 1: It was just before we came up [to Baltimore, Maryland], so--
Speaker 2: About ten [years old], I guess?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  '63 [1963] was about when it all happened.  I think we came up when I was--'64 [1964] or '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: All right, so--well tell us about--I guess it's a good time to tell us about it.
Speaker 1: About what?
Speaker 2: About the--Black Sunday [Bloody Monday].
Speaker 1: I don't wanna tell you about that, I'll tell you about in general.  So look, one day--I used to catch--one day I caught the bus with my mom [Lillie Echols Hubbard]; we were going to the place she worked; I said it was Belk-Leggett's [retail store] or something.  I don't even know what she did; she might have been the black woman folding clothes.  I got a picture of her by the way when she was little, right there.  Anyway, so we get off this bus, we go in, she wasn't working that day but she had to go get her check or something, and then we come out and holy smoke, right in front of City Hall there's like about twenty black people and we had never seen that in our life.
Speaker 2: Now this is a Monday, I'm sorry, it's Black Monday, not Sunday.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm just telling how the whole movement, how I saw it get started.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I had never seen that many black people together downtown, and then they was in front of City Hall.  Black folks ain't allowed--wouldn't--didn't even hardly go in there.  So I asked my mom what was going on and she turned me away and we got on the bus, but I knew I had seen somethin' different (laughter), and those were the first civil rights protestors in Danville, and a lotta talk started happening 'cause they got beat, and dogs got sicked on 'em, and then fire hoses.  So the black men in the neighborhood, we were expecting them to step up 'cause nobody beats their women like--you know all the--you know, that was a big discussion (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Were they most women who were demonstrating?
Speaker 1: Well, they were both at the--in the first ones, but you know, our first reaction was the black men need to get together and show them somethin' I mean you don't be beating up people.  But they were reluctant (laughter) 'cause they'll go to jail.  I mean it was a weird dynamic in the community 'cause the black men had always stepped up but they wouldn't, and there was a lot of talk among them and then when the Civil Rights Movement divided, there was a violent approach and a non-violent approach; there was--the Black Panthers came along, SNCC [Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee], CORE, Congregation [Congress] of Racial Equality (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Congress of Racial Equality, CORE (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--and SNCC, Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee.  Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee was violent in Danville, and CORE was not, and so the men didn't know what to do; they wanted to get guns and go and get violent, and the women were saying what Martin Luther King is saying, non-violence is the best.  Anyway, huge, huge conflict within the community talking about this.  They started off by having what they call mass meetings, and my mom would take me to those, and that is--they would have to find a place; sometimes it was a school basement or a church, and they would have to secretly have a meeting to talk about--to plan the next rally where they were gonna be, and the if the cops found out, they would come in there and beat the crap outta everybody in the church and lock 'em up.  So it was clandestine, and my mom would take me on those, and they were like scary exciting, you know?  And in there they would sing the, you know, "We Shall Overcome." It was really--it was scary, moving, confusing, dark.  I mean you couldn't believe that the police would come in and beat the hell outta you and take your momma away.  I mean you just--you couldn't; but sometimes they would find out where we were and they would do it.  The day that Black Friday came and I saw my friend's skull cracked, ten year-olds, it became real to me.
Speaker 2: Is it Monday or Friday?
Speaker 1: Monday, Black Monday.  Google "Black Monday" [Bloody Monday].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Then it was real.  Some people talked about getting guns; the day they beat Reverend Campbell's wife, real.
Story_ID: 26413
Speaker 1: The day that my mom [Lillie Echols Hubbard] got locked up [for her civil rights activities in Danville, Virginia] and put in solitary confinement, real 'cause we didn't have nobody to take care of us, so one neighbor came and took my sister and then called my grandmother and she came and took me, and for a year we didn't see each other 'cause we still had to go to school and all, you know what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: So was your mother in jail all that time?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't see her.
Speaker 2: For a year?
Speaker 1: She was in and out.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because once--you know--my mom is like this, you put her in jail, now you really done got her mad (laughter).  She gone be more active than Martin Luther King out there (laughter), so she was in and out of jail for a year (laugher).  I ain't--what I know is I didn't see her because I went to live with my grandparents, and my grandparents were furious at her for doing that, and that's an under-statement; they could not believe that she would be mixed up with a bunch of hoodlums and neglecting her children; they were--they disowned her they were so mad.  So I didn't see her; they wouldn't let her come over the house or nothing; I didn't see her.
Speaker 2: Was your mother involved in CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] at that time, or SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference]?
Speaker 1: She was not a formal member, but she was on them lines man.  CORE was--they're organized; like they would send in--they got kind of professional, they would send in a few people who knew how to do these things; everybody wasn't a member of CORE, you know; or if people started getting discouraged then they would send in like Wyatt--T.Y. Walker [Wyatt Tee Walker and T.Y. Rogers; civil rights leaders] or whatever you said, and he would give a speech that would just rally everybody--or Reverend Abernathy.  They would come in and organize and motivate, then they'd go.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I was mentioning, before we started off, a Reverend Wyatt Tee Walker (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, him.
Speaker 2: --and he was a familiar figure there you were saying (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, my mom used to talk about him a lot.  Anyway--
Speaker 2: So this is a struggle in Danville.  Civil rights struggle in '63 [1963].  Now this is the same summer Medgar Evers [civil righst activist] is shot.  In the spring, I think, the March on Washington occurs; in summer bombing of the church in Birmingham in September--
Speaker 1: It tore our community apart.  In Danville, you're not too much aware about what's going on elsewhere; you don't really have good T.V.  I don't even think they had color T.V. then, I don't know.  And--we just know about us and when my mom got out of jail, she was very skinny; she had lost like thirty or forty pounds, and all I know is she came and got us to leave Danville.  It seemed like that whole life was gone; over.  You know, I hit a new era; we went to Baltimore [Maryland] and I hit a new era; nothing, Danville was left in the past forever.
Speaker 2: Now did your mother have relatives in Baltimore?
Speaker 1: Her brother.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What was his name?
Speaker 1: He's named after his father, Kenny Echols.  I said, I said my grandfather was Kenny but it was McKinley [ph.], McKinley Echols, and his son was McKinley Echols.
Speaker 2: But you called him Kenny?
Speaker 1: Emm hmm (NODDING HIS HEAD), Uncle Kenny.
Story_ID: 26414
Speaker 1: So did this [Hubbard's family's move from Danville, Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland] come like right--I mean during the school year, or was it in the summer time or before--did it disrupt you going to school?
Speaker 2: I must have finished; I don't remember a disruption.
Speaker 1: So you just started the next fall in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now how was Baltimore different from Danville?
Speaker 2: Violently.  Baltimore was always one or two in violent crimes in the nation; Baltimore is extremely violent.  My mom's [Lillie Echols Hubbard] mom [Geneva Echols] had heard about an engineering high school called Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, and nobody had ever heard of an engineering high school.  And she wanted me to go there but, you know, from their standpoint, Danville? (Laughter)  What's that?  You're not coming here (laughter).  We don't know anything about--you know, you need to go to a prep school first or something.  So she put me in this prep [preparatory] school for the engineering high school, and unfortunately the prep school was in a part of Baltimore that was white only, and so my year in that prep school was probably one of two of the most darkest years in my life.
Speaker 1: Emm.  So what was the population of the prep school?  Was it mostly white kids?
Speaker 2: All white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They threw eggs on me when I got off the bus, they would line up on the sidewalk when I walked in and throw stuff on me and spit at me, and that went on every day.  My mom bought me a brand new what we used to call a car coat, had a hood; I loved that coat, and they just covered it with eggs, the first day I ever wore it.
Speaker 1: Emm.  Were there any other black students?
Speaker 2: My cousin because--geez, I don't know if I should say--well, I think his, my cousin's, mother was jealous that I was going to this prep school, so she put him in it too (laughter), so we used to go there together.
Speaker 1: Did it cost your mother money to send you there?
Speaker 2: She didn't have no money, no.
Speaker 1: So was it a scholarship through--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: --an association with the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's called Robert Poole [school]; everybody knew it.  I don't know how she got me in there but I just know that it was one of the darkest years of my life, having them people do that to me all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a turning point though, 'cause you know what happened?  See, the whole time my mother was here, I never wanted to bring her bad news; and a couple of times I did, like I would beat people up and she would find out and it just broke my heart 'cause she would be on me.  So I would never get in trouble, and one day, I decided "You know what?  I'm not going; I'm not gone take this no more."  There was one white boy who was the leader, he used to beat everybody up, and so I just decided that I wasn't gone take it no more.  And so from that moment on, when I went to school Larry, I beat people up.  And I did it, at first, to protect myself, then I did it to send a message, and then I did it just because I felt like doing it.  And then teachers had to finally get involved and make me stop.  I did it 'cause I felt like doing it, and the problem with that is I'm like that now.  It's like if you see a wolf sleep, just go past.  But some managers will roll up a newspaper and, for some stupid reason, smack him on the nose.  What a stupid thing to do.  So I handled that situation that way, it worked out well, and forty years later, I handle situations that way.
Speaker 1: So they never organized to defeat you, you know.  I mean--
Speaker 2: I whipped the crap out of everybody I saw.  And then some days, just 'cause I was in a bad mood, I whipped the crap out of somebody; in the hallway, walking up the stairs, in the cafeteria, I just did it.  I mean my grades suffered, but-
Story_ID: 26415
Speaker 1: I don't think anybody was afraid I was gone beat 'em up, I think they just stopped messin' with me but I didn't stop messin' with them.  I mean it's the only--it's two black people in the whole school; nobody's afraid I'm gone beat 'em up but I just messed with--you know, I always--I actually have told people here, "You mess with me, I'm-a mess with you," 'cause I got it from Robert Poole [School, Baltimore, Maryland]; and boy, do I mess with 'em.  My students say--and my son, my hands too heavy, that I should--should not go so far.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were telling me, in the last segment, that you--that your grades were not that good at Robert Poole.
Speaker 1: They were mixed.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Some grades--some say--I think I did good in drafting, and I did bad in, you know, I don't know--French (laughter).  But whatever they were, I got into Polytech [Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Were the technical courses, I mean the STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] courses, stronger than the other courses?
Speaker 1: Well, I think I was in the--I was in the prep curriculum for Poly [Baltimore Polytechnic Institute], and they were all STEM, you know what I'm saying?  It was a prep for Poly; you didn't take, you know, basket weaving; you couldn't be in that section.
Speaker 2: Well, you mentioned French, so--you know.
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--It can be useful in STEM, too.
Speaker 1: Well, back then it was--you couldn't even get a Ph.D. [degree] without learning a second language, so it was, you know--having a second language, which was part of the engineering curriculum.  Now don't get me wrong, Poly had, at the time, it's different now--had the A Course which was--that was the real Poly.  And then, for others, they created the K Course--the KE Course (laughter); and that's where they let me in (laughter).  Later on, they created the T Course which is even worse (laughter), and that's for regular people, but then they had a T Course when I was there so I was in KE 5.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that's a way--you're there, but you're not really where you wanna be, or where you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Aw man, it kicked my butt.  That was some serious--it was serious engineering; I mean it was serious engineering man.  We had to learn, we had to literally learn how to heat up a piece of metal and take a hammer like back in the days when blacksmiths did it, and make our own tools (laughter), and then temper 'em in water in addition to pre-Calculus.  Man that school was seriously rigorous, and you had to wear a tie every day (laughter).  Aw man, aw man.  Plus, the whole time, you got white folks telling you you shouldn't be there, you're not up to (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Is that kind of the counseling you had from your official counselors, or would the teachers actually say that to you?
Speaker 1: Teachers would say that but we had a--you wanna hear somethin'?  So when I finished that, I had a black counselor; I used to know his name.  I wanna say Mr. Robertson.  Anyway, he told me I wasn't college material, and that's why I end up going to a trade school; I didn't go to college 'cause he said I wasn't college material.
Speaker 2: Now is Polytech an all boys' school?
Speaker 1: It was; that's against the law now.  You know I'm tell--a lot of things I would do is against the law now (laughter).  But yeah, you couldn't get in there if you was a girl back then; it was--man it was something else, Polytech.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: And it still is; I mean they have--I get alumni stuff from them all the time.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway I--when I finished there, they told me I wasn't--I couldn't go to college, so I didn't.
Speaker 2: So was there anything else about high school that stands out?  I mean did you play any sports or do anything like that?
Speaker 1: I hated it--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I hated the people, I hated--whether they were black or white, I hated the teachers, I didn't understand the curriculum, you had to get a-- (unclear).  A D was flunking; you had to get a C to pass; I got straight C's.  I hated everything about it; black people, white people, plaid people, I hated it.
Story_ID: 26416
Speaker 1: The good news was I had a second life that allowed me to keep my sanity (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, what was your second life?
Speaker 1: Well, when we got to Baltimore [Maryland], okay I started getting in fights 'cause I had a deep southern accent and some fool would say somethin' smart and the next thing you know, it's on.  So my mother [Lillie Echols Hubbard] was afraid I was gonna get shot 'cause people kept telling her "You know they don't fight up here" (laughter).  So I was in the Cub Scouts in Danville [Virginia], and she wanted me to be--she went out to find the Boy Scouts and unfortunately, she made a mistake that ended up changing my entire life.  Somebody told her the following:  "Oh, they meet down at Fort McHenry on Friday nights."  And so she sent me and my cousin on a bus to Fort McHenry to join the Boy Scouts but guess what?  It was the Sea Cadets; it was the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps that I joined (laughter).  And from that moment on, I was para-military.  By the time I was seventeen [years old], I had trained in every [U.S.] Navy facility in the country.  Great Lakes Naval Base, Bainbridge, which doesn't even exist now, four Navy firefighting schools (laughter), that was a huge mistake and I wore a Navy uniform.  In the summers, I would go to sea on DDEs.
Speaker 2: In high school?
Speaker 1: Emm hmm, junior high, or whatever high school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Junior high school?  Really?
Speaker 1: DDE.  League Cadets is for eleven to sixteen, then you become a Sea Cadet; in the Sea Cadet, you actually wear the Navy uniform and they ship you out with the reserves.  But I was at sea on a DDE at, you know, fourteen when we got in a collision with a, a, a tanker that we would--that would--reserves don't know how--I shouldn't say that, but we never--we were reserve but we were trying to learn how to refuel and end up in a collision, put a hole in the boat, got a bunch of kids on there--Sea Cadets, this is a nightmare.  Yeah, I was at sea after that, all the time; I got that all in my blood, military.
Speaker 2: That at every summer?
Speaker 1: Whenever we could--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and definitely every summer.  They did some things with us that they shouldn't have.  One summer they put the USS Roberts in dry dock because they wanted to strip all the asbestos out of it, and they hired us to do it--Sea Cadets--because it was exciting to live on a Navy ship, and we used to go to bed and that fiberglass was in our skin just burning to the touch; and they kept us there for ten days.  But we did it; stripped the whole ship.
Speaker 2: Now were these all black Sea Cadets?
Speaker 1: Emm emm (SHAKING HIS HEAD NO), all over the country; I mean all over the--Sea Cadets been around a long time; we were the--they're nationwide; we were the Tecumseh Division.  United States--United States Naval Sea Cadets, Tecumseh Division.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We trained at Great Lakes Naval--I mean we did everything.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so you'd go up there in the summer time to Chicago [Illinois]?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)-- Well, it's like the regular Navy; that was boot camp; you don't go to boot camp every year.  When we went--needed boot camp, we were trained at Great Lakes along with other sailors.  When I was on the Roberts at sea, I was in somethin' called ECC, Electronic somethin' or other compartment.  I was on the sound power for--I mean I had jobs (laughter); it's against the law to do that now.  They do that in Liberia and Angola, but you can't, you can't make kids do that (laughter).  I got pictures, I grew up doing all that.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 26417
Speaker 1: So this [U.S. Navy Sea Cadet Corps] took up a lot of time during your high school years, I guess?
Speaker 2: It was my--it was a real life rather than that school [Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Baltimore, Maryland], and I had real friends, and when I got in a fight down there, it didn't--well it was kinda allowed, you know, you were kinda--yeah, it's in the military, you macho.  And I rose up through the ranks, you know; I had authority; I became a Petty Officer.
Speaker 1: Petty Officer?  Now this was before you graduated from high school?
Speaker 2: Well there was--yeah; this is--yeah.  There was an incident before--I got actually kicked out of the Sea Cadets, but before then yeah, I rose up to Petty Officer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you're a senior, then what are your options there in terms of the Sea Cadets? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, no (SHAKING HIS HEAD).  When I was--I'll try to make this quick.  One of the things that Sea Cadets used to do was assign you to the United States--to the--I'm sorry, United States Frigate Constellation; that's the old wooden ship that's in Baltimore Harbor; it was the first ship of the United States Navy, and it was being restored for tourists.
Speaker 1: So the [USS] Constitution.
Speaker 2: Constellation.
Speaker 1: Constellation.
Speaker 2: The Constitution was not the first ship.  Anyway (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Okay, all right, all right.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--The reason I do like that is if you wanna make somebody from the Constellation mad, say that--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause the Constitution is not even real; back then, we were 33 percent real.  Constitution was a replica in our eyes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Constitution was--they called that Old Ironsides or something?
Speaker 2: It's in Boston [Massachusetts]; I'm talking about the Constellation (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Constellation; all right.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--First ship, set all kinda speed records and everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Anyway, we used to get volunteer pay, a dollar car fare and a dollar for lunch, and we were assigned to work that ship on the weekends.  One day, a bunch of us got together because we wanted, as Sea Cadets, to have our own ship; like we had heard that other Sea Cadet units had little boats, so--this comes from my mom [Lillie Echols Hubbard].  I wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Navy; couldn't have been no more than fourteen [years old]; I still have the letter by the way.  And I wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Navy on a rickety typewriter, told him that I was a cadet in the Tecumseh Unit, and I was asking him if he could please find a way to get us a boat.  Well guess what?  I actually got a letter back from the Secretary of the Navy on letterhead; I still have that.  But what it did was, it turned out that that Tecumseh Division had gotten a large sum of money to buy boats and so it triggered an investigation, a legal investigation, because--the officers of the Sea Cadet are retired Navy, they're grown; anyway, some of them went to jail.  There was embezzlement, and I triggered that with my letter, a whole investigation.  When they found out, they called all the Sea Cadets in and traced it back to me, and I got a court martial at fourteen--a formal court martial, and kicked outta there.  But a lot of those guys went to jail.  Anyway, a lot of the officers were sympathetic at what had been done to us, and so the curator of the Constellation, which was a rich white man, went to the state and found out that he had the legal right to form a militia because every state does, and he knew the governor; this is a rich man.  So he formed--or really re-constituted something called a Maryland Naval Militia and brought all of us there that had been court martialed to the Constellation under the banner of the Maryland Naval Militia; created uniforms, I went from 30 Op--Petty Officer Third Class all the way up to Lieutenant.  And he brought in a recon, retired recon [reconnaissance] marine to train us and that's when things got spicy (laughter), really spicy, yeah.
Story_ID: 26418
Speaker 1: How, what happened?
Speaker 2: Lots.  He--part of our training [with the Maryland Naval Militia] would be in the winter when the snow was coldest, and deepest.  He would put us in a pickup truck, we were restricted to have only what we could carry on our backs, he would drive us forty miles out of Baltimore [Maryland] in the woods and drop us off, he would come back a week later.  In the snow.  I remember being the oldest one there one year; I did it several years and I was sixteen.  I was in charge.  Ten days with nothing but what you had (laughter); man that was hard.
Speaker 1: So what would you eat out there?
Speaker 2: We learned how to pack stuff; don't say nothing, but we also learned--part of what we learned to pack was alcohol stuff, but it was hard.  We learned how to dig a hole and bury ourselves, we learned how to steal; we would steal hay and we would line the hole, and then we would get in the hole 'cause the wind at night is something like a high wind; we would cover over everybody, I would make everybody get in a hole with canvas and it was nice.  We learned how to live like that, stay warm.  I got a million stories about--those we used to call survival missions; we used to train with weapons, it was rigorous military training.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now that is; that's way beyond where I thought we were going with this story.
Speaker 2: You have no idea; there's stuff I--it's some bad--we did a lotta bad things under the command of a retired recon marine.  I don't know if you know--were you in the military?
Speaker 1: Inaudible response.
Speaker 2: One of the things they do, and then I'll get off this, is--to train an elite team, the first thing you do is empty their minds; and he way you do that is you basically destroy the person's everything; self-esteem, morale, just--and there are systematic ways to do that until they are nothing, and they believe they are nothing.  And then you--and then they look to you (laughter) and then you, little by little, put back in that head what you want, and eventually, you get them to the point where you come in one day and you look at 'em and you say "You know what?  You guys were nothing but maggots when you showed up here, because I'm pleased to say now that you are one of the best fighting teams I have ever seen in my career, and I am immensely proud to be associated with you."  Man you were on top of the world then, and now you're there.  And now you get sent out on assignments; training exercises but in the city.  You gotta (laughter) dream up some things that are pretty bad, and he did, and we always were successful; we were very good at what we did.  This was on the--in the harbor of Baltimore; people were scared to come down there anyway back then, and we owned one of the piers; you couldn't come there without our--we were very good.  But trained by a recon.
Speaker 1: And the name was the American Naval--what was it?
Speaker 2: Maryland Naval Militia (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Maryland Naval Militia.
Speaker 2: By law, every state can form its own militia.  Right now, it's a bunch of survivalists that will re-constitute under the state militia.  We did everything man, we were good; we were very good.  I could spend a couple of days talking about the stuff we were trained to do, and did do.  Anyway, in the midst of that, I got out of high school [Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Baltimore, Maryland] and this counselor sent me to this trade school for ships, and I end up in Vietnam.  I wanted to go to Vietnam anyway 'cause I wanted to kill as many people as I could; that's how I've been trained.
Speaker 1: Just anybody, huh?
Speaker 2: Well the enemy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26419
Speaker 1: But you were--now your mother [Lillie Echols Hubbard] was involved in the Civil Rights Movement but there wasn't--she wasn't involved--was there any--I know Dr. [martin Luther] King was--in '68 [1968], he spoke out against the [Vietnam] war; a lot of people that were in the Civil Rights Movement spoke against the war.  Did you have any of that dialogue in your home?
Speaker 2: No.  When she--when we moved, the struggle to make a way and survive in Baltimore [Maryland] was viciously hard, and we didn't talk about any--much of anything that happened in Danville [Virginia].  Twenty years later, they tried to lock her up again; I have a court docket in that box somewhere with her name on it, twenty years later they tried to get all of those Civil Rights people and lock them up again.  And that's the only time it came up 'cause we were afraid that she would get locked up and she was old; but it turned out they didn't, they end up getting that dismissed.  But we never talked about it, but me being super-military, along with--this is what people don't wanna talk about--along with millions of other black Americans, was very disappointed with both Dr. Martin Luther King and Cassius Clay for coming out against the war.  As patriots, we were very disappointed about that; very.  So--I mean I was in Vietnam because I struggled and fought to get over there at seventeen [years old] (laughter).  They could have put me on a ship anywhere; I demanded to go (laughter) to Vietnam.
Speaker 1: So immediately after high school [Baltimore Polytechnic Institute], then you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I got in this program for--the country had a shortage of ship engineers; a bunch of old guys (laughter), so they set up a school--the union set up a school to train them.
Speaker 1: Was this the Calhoon MEBA [Marine Engineers Beneficial Association] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, MEBA; it was a three-year program.  So you spend six months training, you spend a year at sea--somethin' like that.
Speaker 1: This is 1970 just for the record, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got out of high school in '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay.  1970 Marine (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Anyway, part of the training was a year at sea, and people went anywhere.  My mom liked the school because I had a 2A deferment; you know, everybody had to have a draft card and I had a student deferment so I couldn't go to Vietnam and she liked that, but I wanted to and I didn't like that.  So we used to argue a lot.  Turned out that when I--after I got into that school, I convinced her to--there was a point where I convinced her to apply for a job there (laughter).  She ended up getting a job in the accounts payable, so she used to be there with me; that's kinda nice.  But we went back and forth about Vietnam and she--there was a guy in the office there that assigned cadets to ships, so it was a job.  Somehow, during the course of time she was there, the two of them didn't get along, end up in an argument.  So he was really mad with her so the day that he came to assign me, he assigned me to an ammo ship headed for Saigon [Vietnam], and I'm sure his idea was that that was the end; he would not see me again.  Ammo ship is basically a floating bomb, so he shipped me off to [Military Ocean Terminal] Sunny Point, North Carolina.
Story_ID: 26420
Speaker 1: The pier for an ammo ship goes a mile out into the water to keep the ship that far from land in case it blows up, and you're not allowed to hit any port.  When we got to Panama, we had to stay a mile outside in case we blew up; all the way, 10,000 miles to Vietnam, so he--his idea was like "No, you're not coming back, boy."  But what he didn't count on was I loved it; I absolutely loved it.  The ship they put me on was the Mormacdraco (ph.), the Dragon, set world speed records in the Merchant Marine; God I loved that ship; I loved the engineering.  You asked me about subjects I love; I loved everything about being an engineer on a ship; everything.  At nineteen [years old], I was in charge of ten stories of equipment that went from nothing to every function that a city had, and I knew every inch of it at nineteen.  And I loved it; I could sit there and listen to all that machinery and tell you when a Pump Three-Deck Stand was short-cycling due to--at nineteen; man I loved--I was in the--Larry, I was in heaven.  And I loved being at sea; the crew hated it.  We'd be out there sometimes for a month, being thrown around, typhoon, God I loved it out there; quiet, close to God, every day was interesting, but the rest of the crew (laughter) didn't feel that way--to Vietnam; I have pictures.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you got to Vietnam.  Are you actually in the--
Speaker 1: Merchant Marine.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So the Merchant Marine is not--is a--
Speaker 1: Civilian.
Speaker 2: Yeah, civilian, right.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--We were there with no guns, in a war--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Everybody--even in a bar, everybody in the bar had guns, but not us (laughter).  And sometime shooting would occur, and you're the only fool up in there unarmed.  Anyway,--
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you stayed out with the Merchant Marines for, I guess, was it a year or--
Speaker 1: Emm hmm (NODDING HIS HEAD YES), I never experienced the winter, I kept getting on ships.  The good news is I made a lot of money, and when I finally decided to come home, I bought a house for my mom [Lillie Echols Hubbard]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I'm proud of that; I took all that money and I bought a house, which we had never had in our lives.
Speaker 2: Was this 1971?
Speaker 1: '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: '72 [1972]?  Okay.
Speaker 1: '71 [1971], I was in Vietnam.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Seventy--yeah.  All over Vietnam too.  Da Nang, Vung Tau, Cam Rahn Bay--a lotta crazy experiences.
Speaker 2: Yeah, those are the names that resonate in the news--Cam Rahn Bay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--It, it was fighting.
Speaker 2: But you were there unarmed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Well, we would be escorted but I could tell you stories that would just freak--blow your mind, but we--they would escort us when they could.  Some crew got killed; shot by snipers, the ship blown up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 26421
Speaker 1: So did your view of the [Vietnam] war change any by being over there?
Speaker 2: Emm hmm (NODDING OF HIS HEAD).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I grew up in the Maryland Naval Militia, part of a small elite team trained by a recon marine; we were all flavors.  I was--you couldn't have found a more dedicated patriot; boy did I love my country, and I was proud of my skills; I had learned a lotta ways to kill a person at seventeen, like the military would, and volunteered.  Even though I was sent over there by this guy to be hurt, I loved every minute of it.  What happened was when I got there, two things happened; there were--everybody was there; there were all services, which shocked me; even Coast Guard.  When we got there, you could look around, there was Coast Guard people, National Guard, there was Korean Elite Forces, I mean just around 'cause don't forget now, ships pull in, you got everybody running over there unloading it.  I didn't expect that; there were uniforms and insignias that I did not recognize, and the white troops--if you weren't careful, they would call you Nigger in a minute--the white troops; that stunned me, that made a huge impact on me.  And then I found out that a lotta them was getting fragged by the brothers over there--
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: --for that.
Speaker 1: And fragging is--
Speaker 2: Throw a hand grenade in the outhouse when they go to the bathroom, stuff like that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Getting rid of the Second Lieutenant or--
Speaker 2: They hated a lotta things man, you be walking down the street and a brother would see you and they had this thing that they would do; it was a sign thing.
Speaker 1: I believe it's called the Dap [ph.].
Speaker 2: No, it ain't no Dap.  It was a lang-- (simultaneous)--it was a language; they would do this, and I found out that it meant 'Hi my brother, I would die for you.'  It was stuff like that but it wasn't a Dap.  You be walking, and on the other side of the street, a brother you ain't never seen, you turn to him and he would do this thing, and then you would learn how to answer him back.  So it was more racist in Vietnam than it had been in Danville [Virginia], and I didn't expect that; I didn't expect that at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Lotta killing; some guys on my ship killed some people and they (laughter) weren't even supposed to be doing that. Anyway. Nineteen [years old].
Story_ID: 26422
Speaker 1: So this is a tough period of time here in Vietnam [War] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well I came back [to the United States; Baltimore, Maryland] with a drinking problem at nineteen [years old] 'cause it was a tough time; bad drinking problem.
Speaker 1: So you came back, you had saved up the money, bought your mother [Lillie Echols Hubbard] a house.
Speaker 2: (NODDING HIS HEAD YES) Nice, nice house--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in a nice neighborhood.
Speaker 1: All right.  Tell us how you decided to go to Morgan State [University, Maryland].
Speaker 2: So when I was in the Maryland Naval Militia, it was almost like a gang; it was supposed to be--it was formed for quote "inner-city kids," but you ended up getting a lot of juvenile delinquents, criminals down there joining, and the officers which were, you know, rich white men, they kinda--all they did was use the Maryland Naval Militia name as a tax shelter and they could bring boats and stuff and they could go out on them and they didn't pay a lot of attention to us, and so they turned us over to this recon [reconnaissance] marine and he picked two of us as his master--his, I don't know, drill instructors or whatever, even though I was a warrant officer at the time; but he trained us.  One was a white guy named Merv Griffin--Greek, and one was me, and he trained the crap out of us.  And then he turned us loose to organize that peer of people and we were viciously ruthless, you know.  There were guys there that would say they will shoot you; they would tell me that.  "I'm a shoot you."  So you had to be very violent with them to organize, and so me and Mervis we organized those guys, fifty of them; in fact, during our reign, there were three generations of people there; we called them crews, and we reigned over all three, so we'd become very close.  Well long story short, he got killed and I went into a very deep depression; I didn't work, I didn't come out the house, I lived in a basement.  I didn't do anything.
Speaker 1: Now was he killed in Vietnam or--
Speaker 2: In Baltimore.
Speaker 1: In Baltimore.  After you got back?
Speaker 2: Yeah--well I came back and was just hanging around, drinking--I tell you I had a drinking problem.  My mom got upset one day and told me I had to do something.  Well, I could see it--some university--almost see it from my house so I just went over there and my school--my grades in engineer--Marine Engineering School [Calhoon] were excellent; I mean excellent.  And so right away they found me a co-op position with a [U.S.] Navy marine engineering lab 'cause I was a marine engineer so they paid for everything and the next thing you know, I was in college.  My mom seemed happy; it was coed [coeducational], there were some fine ladies over there.  You know I had just been in the war, and so you know, that's how I got over there.  Took courses in jazz and stuff, but anyway, during that time, my friend got killed.  But I was there four years and never got a degree.  You wanna know the story I tell?  I've told this story exactly like this for the past twenty years; exactly.  I've told it to generals and to students.  So, I get over to Morgan State and I'm excited 'cause I just got back from Nam [Vietnam] and there's lots of fine ladies over there, so I'm looking for a major and I see this major, it's got labs and it's coed and so I sign up and I tell people "Well, it took me three years to realize that the major was not physiques, it was physics.  And once I found out I wasn't majoring in physiques but physics, I quit; that's why I don't have a degree from Morgan (laughter).  So I was over there majoring in physiques (laughter).
Speaker 1: You thought at some point you'd actually be studying physiques?  Actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--That's just a joke; no, I majored in physics--
Speaker 1: Physics, yes.
Speaker 2: --but I just had fun--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it was easy.  I mean I got As and I did everything; it was just--I wasn't trying to get a degree, I was trying to get my mom off my back and in the summers, since I was co-op, I worked for the Navy again; really nice.  I worked at a naval research center and I had a clearance, so that was nice.  In school, I just played around.
Speaker 1: Well who was in the physics department at Morgan State?
Speaker 2: Taylor; Dr. [Julius] Taylor [also a HistoryMaker] was the department head.
Speaker 1: Julius Taylor?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and then there was a couple--a husband and wife team that taught chemistry; they were husband and wife; everybody knew it.  I don't remember the names back then.
Speaker 1: Not the McBays.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: Henry McBay and Shirley McBay?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 26423
Speaker 1: And then Miss Lena McKinney [ph.] was in charge of the co-op and she adopted me and she became my mentor.  So when my friend got killed and I went into a depression, she pulled me in and she said "You know what?  And now it's time for you to get outta here."  She said "You've been over here all this time and you aint' been doin' nothin' but playin', too easy."  And her exact words were "You need to go to one of them rich white schools."
Speaker 2: Is this--is Nina McKinney the wife of Richard McKinney, the philosopher?
Speaker 1: I never met her husband (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Okay.
Speaker 1: I just met her.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: She had a very strong--I wasn't interested in going nowhere, and I had never heard of MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. I said "Well I've heard of Drexel [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]" 'cause my dad mentioned it.  Anyway, when the smoke cleared, she got me admitted to--I didn't do anything, she did it.  She got me admitted to Drexel with a four-year scholarship, admitted to MIT with nothing, and two other schools.  But I really didn't have no intention; in fact, to be honest with you, I hadn't filled out a--I had not filled out an application at MIT.  Her contacts looked everything over and said "If you send him up here, we'll take him."
Speaker 2: Now is this where Clarence Williams comes in?
Speaker 1: So--I'll tell you about Clarence Williams 'cause that's a special story.  So I'm depressed, I grew up violent, I'm at Morgan and I don't care, and she sets me up with a meeting with somebody from MIT.  I had kinda made up my mind I wasn't going anywhere after my friend [Merv Griffin] died; I wasn't going anywhere.  I'd just go on a dock and drink on the weekends with the guys 'cause we were very sad.  So she told me she was bringing somebody from MIT to interview with me so I wanted to make sure I wasn't going nowhere, so I showed up for the interview in a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt, and she put me in a conference room and I was in the conference room like this (DEMONSTRATION).  I wasn't going nowhere.  Anyway, this guy came in--I had been all over the world now, by then but a black man--I had--I have never seen a black man like that.  And so when he walked in the room, I was like--and his everything, the way he moved, the way he talked, he was--looked manicured to perfection, the suit he had on, the words he used, he talked to me for forty-five minutes; I didn't hear a word he said, I was just looking at him.  I ain't never seen no black man look like that; that was my view (laughter); I had not.  And so somehow, in my weak little mind, I thought maybe I could--maybe I could look like that one day (laughter).  And so when he left, I kinda took it serious.  But you know, I stayed in my depression and things got very bad between me and my mom [Lillie Echols Hubbard] because I was--I didn't follow up on MIT or Drexel, and one of the guys on the dock had an aunt who was a dean at Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Maryland], and he had told her that one of us--you know they were so proud of me there--that one of us got into MIT and she was like "What?"  And then he told her the story and she said "Well tell him to come on up here and he can stay with me until he gets himself together, and we'll help him figure out--" so I did; I flew up there and I stayed out in Newton, Mass [Massachusetts].  Her husband was a judge, and I stayed with a black family that was rich; I had never done that either, but I wasn't impressed with any of that.  I didn't leave the house, I didn't call MIT, I barely came to dinner, I was there for two weeks and finally the judge just had had it with me (laughter) and he called me in and read the 'Riot Act' to me and made his son take me to MIT and sit down with somebody there.  It was--this was late August man; the term was about to start (laughter).
Speaker 2: So did you sit down again with Clarence Williams, or was it somebody else?
Speaker 1: No, I sat there and there was a white man named Arm--Legg, Mr. Legg came in.  And again, I showed up for the admissions interview in jeans and a sweatshirt and that kinda disgusted him, so he was trying to talk to me for about ten minutes and he got mad and he said "Just a minute," and he left.  And then a black--a brother came in, John Mims, and he sat down and he let me know things (laughter), you know, what you need to tell a brother.  "Look, this is a special opportunity; not too many people get this.  I don't appreciate you coming in here--" you know man he tore me up (laughter).  And so he said "I'm gonna have another student walk you around."  He said "First of all, fill out this application."  He said "Then I'm gonna have a student walk you around and have faculty read your transcript and sign off on how much credit they're willing to transfer from Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland."  Anyway, it took me two weeks, and when the smoke cleared, after four years at Morgan, I was a sophomore at MIT and he got me in the dorm; transfer students don't get dorms.  Mims hooked me up, I was in a dorm.  So I started.
Story_ID: 26424
Speaker 1: Now I heard that they [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] accepted your credits from Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] as humanities courses, not even in science.
Speaker 2: Right; even my differential equations.  Well it turns out that's the best thing ever happened to me 'cause I don't know no differentiation--now, knowing differentiation, knowing what MIT taught me yeah, all my stuff was humanities (laughter) compared to theirs.
Speaker 1: So you weren't really--
Speaker 2: I wasn't prepared for that.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--prepared for it.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, I got Ds man, the first time (laughter).  That's how I came to the attention of the department--of the head of mechanical engineering at MIT.  My grades had gotten bad and I started being disruptive again; I threatened my undergraduate advisor and he went to the department head and the department head called me in.  So I remember walking over there thinking about my mom [Lillie Echols Hubbard].  You know I never liked for her to see trouble and how disappointed she was gonna be, and then I started getting mad.  I honestly thought about--this is how ignorant--I thought about jumping on the department head; I figure this is over, I'm leaving anyway.
Speaker 1: Just beginning, right?
Speaker 2: Ignorant.  So I'm sitting in there, looking at him like this (DEMONSTRATION); he's talking to me, and then he says something that changes everything.  He says to me, he says "You know I'm looking at your record here and it's not that bad."  You know I was prepared to be taken outta there by a campus police and sent back to Baltimore [Maryland]; I really was, but he said to me "I'm looking at your record and it's not that bad."  I had Ds; so I stood--I remember sitting up saying "What?"  He said "Well" he said "Yeah," he said "I'm looking at other minority students here," he says "And you don't stand out, I mean what's going on?"  I said--I remember looking at him saying "I got Cs."  And he said "Well, you know, but I'm just comparing you to the other minority students."  I said "I didn't come here to get Cs."  I said "You think I came here to get Cs?"  I said "I'm a licensed marine engineer, been all over the world; unlimited horsepower steam and diesel engines, and I'm here getting Cs and you think everything is okay?"  So then he turned red.  I said "You think all of us came here to get Cs and because we are, everything's fine."  And he closed the folder and then we started talking to each other man to man, and the rest is history; we did so many good things together.  He is one of my life-long mentors and we did so many wonderful things together.
Speaker 1: Now do you think--let me explore this a little bit.  Do you think that you really weren't that good?  Well you were saying you had to catch up, of course. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well there was a cultural problem; that's really--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah; and MIT is different.  We covered in two weeks what I covered in a semester at Morgan.  I got so far behind; I got depressed.  The crew from the waterfront came up to visit and they ended up disrupting the part--western part of the campus so the police gathered them all up and sent them home, and sent me to the department again (laughter).  But we ended up--I went from that to being--some people think I was the first African American to ever get a Ph.D. [degree] in mechanical engineering; I don't believe that.  But I went from that to getting three degrees and being on the faculty under his and Wes Harris' [Wesley Harris] and Clarence's [Williams] leadership.
Story_ID: 26425
Speaker 1: Do you think that discussion you had with the chairman [Herb Richardson, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) engineering department, Cambridge, Massachusetts] changed his expectations of you, or changed his perception of what you could do?
Speaker 2: Emm hmm, you know why?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You're not gonna believe this.  Years later, he got national recognition for his ability to work with minority students; national recognition.  If you call his name in the nation now, he's--they'll say "Oh yeah, he was former Secretary of Transportation, oh yeah, he pioneered academic relationships for minority students;" that's one of his credentials; 'cause he and I did a whole bunch of good things.  And he taught me--when he did something for me, I would have a burning desire to do something for him, and what I would do was win an award to show him how, you know, I really appreciated it.  So I won the Scott Foundation Leadership Award--I'm sorry, I won the Sott Paper Leadership Award, I won the Goodwin Medal for Conspicuously Effective Teaching, I won the Stewart Award for Community Service, I headed the IBM Young Faculty Chair (laughter), I just did it to show him that the time he was putting into me was worth it.  But I won every award you can win there after his--you know, he helped show me stuff, him and Wes [Wesley Harris] and Clarence [Williams].
Speaker 1: Well tell us about Wesley Harris.
Speaker 2: Well they picked--Wes--West don't--have you seen Wes?
Speaker 1: Inaudible response.
Speaker 2: So he's always been very top-shape and extremely disciplined, so I think they picked Wes because he could handle me; wherever it was gone be--he could handle discipline in me, no matter whether it was physical or whatever (laughter), and Wes was not afraid of me, and one of the first things Wes did was to fly to Baltimore [Maryland] and sit in the living room with my mom [Lillie Echols Hubbard] and ask her "What's this kid about, and what are your expectations?"  And that shocked me; he flew to Baltimore and sat in there and she explained it, and then it was on, you know?  He is the most distinguished professor that I know, he's everything a black scholar you would think of, he's a member of the National Academy, he's extremely proud of me and I, every chance I get, tell him "It's all because of you; you taught me how to be."  He's like, "Jim"--I just became Fellow-AIAA [Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics] Fellow and--there are people that think that it's exciting, he and I, because Wes is International Academy; there are very few blacks there; they think I might be headed there, and the thought that a black man could get in the Academy and mentor a black student in--people are very excited about that, very excited.  Now I don't know if that'll happen 'cause--I just don't know, but man you talk about exciting.  But I saw--I was with him a couple of weeks ago.  He, Herb Richardson my department head, and Donald Fraser were--are my three mentors.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 26426
Speaker 1: Well tell us now, what role did the Black Student Union play at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)]?
Speaker 2: I sat down with Herb [Richardson] and revitalized something called Black ME (BME), which was Black Mechanical Engineers.  I created a logo, he gave me an office and I organized the black students in my department under the Black ME club.  Herb provided funds to have faculty come and tutor us off hours.  We couldn't get, you know, old homework files like the frat boys had so he helped us do that, he helped us--through Black ME, there was a mechanism to do all kinds of great stuff for us and he did it--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --and so, well when people started seeing that happening, there were other black organizations that were under the auspices of the Black Student Union; there was something called BSEE, Black Students in Electrical Engineering.  They saw the success we were having and then they got organized, and then Black ChemEs [chemical engineers], but all under the auspices of the BSU, but I never had any direct affiliation with the BSU, I just ended up being one of three leaders on that campus because of Black ME and its success.  Not only that, the students had not seen somebody come and win every award that the department--and they were a little stunned by that.  Plus, don't forget, I didn't hang out, so I was kind of a mystery to everybody because when they talked to me, I was definitely street, which didn't match with all these awards (laughter).  I mean I was like an anomaly.
Speaker 1: Now had you met your wife by that time?
Speaker 2: Inaudible response (SHAKING HIS HEAD NO).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I ended up getting involved with NSBE [National Society of Black Engineers] and being the second Region One chairperson; we did a lotta great things with NSBE during its origin.  But I was not directly a part of the Black Student Union.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26427
Speaker 1: Was Shirley McBay [meant Jackson] [also a HistoryMaker] there [at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachusetts] too, at that time?
Speaker 2: Shirley was definitely there, and we talked a lot about many things.  A lot of--you know, back then Bell Labs was the place; they had more PhD's than anyplace in the country.  And they hand a four-year minority scholarship, and so if you were a graduate student with a Bell Labs Fellow, couldn't be any more.  Well there was--there were several at MIT and I knew 'em.  And I used to go out--in the summers they would go to Bell Labs and work, and I used to go out occasionally and visit them and Shirley was one of 'em.  Jim West was a mentor to those people out there, and--
Speaker 1: Inaudible response.
Speaker 2: --there were a lot of black graduate students out there.  I knew Ron [Ronald] McNair [astronaut]; he was a mentor for--while he was still alive, but he was a mentor to hundreds of people.  But I talked to Shirley a lot 'cause we had an ongoing debate about how effective or ineffective Bell Labs was at generating black scholarships; I had my own ideas about that and she had different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--What was the contention?
Speaker 2: My idea was I was mad because they were suckin' up all the top black talent and then you never heard from 'em again.  And anybody that was anybody, they would give 'em a Bell Labs Fellowship and you'd never hear from 'em again, so I would go there angry about that and Shirley didn't have that view (laughter).  You know, I was like "Where are they?"  (Unclear)  They just grab 'em up and then you never hear about 'em no more; I think that's ridiculous.  So we had a lot to talk about back then.
Speaker 1: Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Walter Lowe, Calvin's [Lowe, also a HistoryMaker] twin brother, was out there; you know I could go on--Roscoe Gi--not--yeah, Roscoe might have been out there.  There's just--
Speaker 1: Roscoe Giles [also a HistoryMaker] the computer scientist (unclear)--
Speaker 2: At BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Right.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--and--another brother who passed not long ago.  But then we all knew each other, but I was not a Bell Labs Fellow, I just--you know you start winning all those awards and stuff, people wanna see you and talk to you so yeah, we all knew each other.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 26428
Speaker 1: You're working on your dissertation I guess in '75 [1975] or so?  Is that about right?
Speaker 2: Inaudible response.
Speaker 1: At MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I got my bachelor's [degree] in '77 [1977], I got my master's [degree] in '78 [1978], and even though it says officially, I got my Ph.D. [degree] in '82 [1982], I finished the work in '81 [1981]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --December of '81 [1981].  And then I walked across the stage in '82 [1982].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That stunned a lotta people 'cause nobody can--I mean how do you do that?  On average, it takes five to seven years to get a doctorate; I just told you what?  Three years?  Three years in--one year for a master's, and two for the Ph.D.; I took a year off in between 'cause I was toast.  How do you do that?  It's ridiculous, it's impossible.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  So what were your days like?  Did you spend them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Nightmarish; the whole thing was a nightmare (laughter).  Wes [Wesley Harris] hired me, and then immediately left the country for the whole summer (laughter).  And he hired me in acoustics which I didn't know anything about; those were horrible, horrible days man; God.  Yeah, I could not get a fellowship in my department, so I ran to Wes and asked him to do something 'cause I didn't wanna leave, and he took me on so I end up getting graduate degrees in subjects that nothing to do with anything I trained in and that I had no interest in whatsoever.  I got a Ph.D. in Helicopter Rotor Acoustics (MAKES FACE OF ASTONISHMENT).
Speaker 1: Now that's--that's the Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: And the master's.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is a similar project that Wesley Harris was working on at the time to--
Speaker 2: 'Cause he funded me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --nobody else would.  But I was trained as a controls guy and a vibrations guy; I didn't know anything about that.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: So, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So they were trying to, if I may, just--think maybe he was trying to figure out a way to make helicopter blades more silent (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Quiet.
Speaker 1: Quiet.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that at war time, the enemy doesn't know your helicopters are coming (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--For, for a lotta reasons but yeah, that's one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: People don't wanna hear all that noise over their neighborhoods either, but in an emergency situation, it's the only thing we have that can hover over (unclear) land; there are lots of reasons.  But I did all my graduate work in that area; I wrote journal papers, I--we had a couple--we had actually two breakthroughs during that period.  Did a couple of firsts but you know, it's three years of--a lotta tears man; a lotta pain.  And the only reason it was three years was grace of God.  I mean there's--you can't get outta MIT, you can't get a Ph.D. in three years (laughter).  I guess God's hand came and He did something.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna pause here (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I remember my mom [Lillie Echols Hubbard] saying "If you can't do it with your mind, do it with your knees."  And she had me get on my knees and pray with her on the phone so many times.
Story_ID: 26429
Speaker 1: This is a story we don't often hear I mean, and just the deprivation of not even having any money at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I didn't have any money, sure.  I was saying that even though it says on my record three years to get a doctorate, it was three of the most difficult years I've ever had; nothing seemed to work.  I was telling you I didn't have any money, I was telling you I spent many hours crying uncontrollably on the phone with my mom [Lillie Echols Hubbard].  Look man, I'm in my twenties, Vietnam vet [veteran] (laughter), and she just prayed.  'Cause I was so out of control I didn't wanna hear what she had to say.  She was just saying "If you can't use your head to graduate, use your knees," and we would pray.  But I was trying to tell you that I remember one night I was so hungry that--it was about 11:30 at night; I wanted to call my mom and just say "Mom, please, you gotta do something (laughter), ten dollars, anything."  So I went to my graduate office to get a dime, and I was saying on the way there, I turned down this hallway and was walking and down on the ground was a $100 bill; back then.  Isn't that weird?  So I call her up, I told her, sent fifty [dollars] to her (laughter), and then I--man I was stuffed there for a while (laughter).  Isn't that weird?  I mean how is it that a $100 bill just be laying on the ground in front of you (laughter)?  Anyway, things weren't going, weren't going, weren't going, and then I made a technical breakthrough and finished.
Story_ID: 26430
Speaker 1: Now, about your [Ph.D.] dissertation [at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachusetts], you were telling us a little while ago that there were two aspects of--two things that you remember that were important aspects of your dissertation about helicopter rotor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well yeah, I--I mean we used to use scale model rotors, only a two-inch wide--two-inch cord and about, I don't know, two foot long, and there were all these computer codes that were trying to predict what went on on the blade surface when you were getting this noise but nobody really knew; it was just code.  So I decided to instrument the blade with pressure transducers and even these things called hot films [ph.] which could make measurements in the boundary layer.  Well people thought that was ridiculous first of all (laughter); they had trouble doing that on big blades, how you gonna do that on a little teeny blade?  And second of all, you can't use hot films on a helicopter blade because there's this thing that's called--they have low impedance and you have to use something called slip rings to get the information out; anyway, it was impossible to run hot films through slip rings.  So, it--people just thought it was joke.  And, even if you did all that, you actually tellin' me you gonna be able to tell when--you know what happens with the blades is, to produce lift, you have an angle of attack; you have to have a higher pressure than a lower pressure.  You get a little tornado coming off then--well it's a rotary blade so the tornado hits another blade and you hear that noise.  Whewww (SOUND MADE BY INTERVIEWEE).  And I had to time everything right; get the pressures just when the tornado was--anyway, I did all that; that had never been done before, ever.  I hired a sophomore to instrument the blade, guy named Mark Drela [ph.], and worked with him closely.  Mark Drela is internationally renowned now (laughter).  He was a sophomore; he wrote the best aerodynamic--he, he wrote one of the most used aerodynamic codes in the world (laughter), and I had dinner with him the other night; but can you believe that?  This guy was a sophomore (laughter) working for me.  But yeah, I made--I did instrumented blade measurements doing what they call blade vortex interaction; nobody had ever done that--
Speaker 1: Emm.
Story_ID: 26431
Speaker 1: But they played it [Hubbard's Ph.D. dissertation] down like it was no big deal.  You wanna hear somethin' interestin'?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There are only like maybe four things in my whole professional career that I view as life-changing; and so I got my degree and I sat in front of Wes [Wesley Harris; Hubbard's Ph.D. advisor and mentor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachusetts], excited to ask the following question:  I asked about my career, what's it like?  How--I viewed him as a sub--and then I said to him "Dr. Harris, what's the most difficult part of your job?"  I said it as a rhetorical question, but he looked at me and he said, he said "Jim, here's what's the most difficult;" he goes "The way it's supposed to work is you do the research, you publish scholarly papers, you go into the world and you present them before your peers."  He said "Your peers evaluate what you've done--the pros and cons, and then they give you feedback."  He goes "The most difficult part of my job is that there's just silence."  He said "No matter where we go, no matter what we present, there's no questions, there's no comments;" he said "Jim, there's just silence" (laughter).  He said "That's the hardest part of my job."  So that stuck with me.
Speaker 2: This is a--we're still talking about our cultural clash aren't we, at the University (unclear)?
Speaker 1: That's never gonna go away, but anyway--yeah, people just ignore what he did; it's like he never did it; unbelievable.
Story_ID: 26432
Speaker 1: Where did you focus your research after you finished your Ph.D. [degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Well my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--What was exciting to you?
Speaker 2: No, my mentor Herb Richardson the department head, right?  He called me in and he made me an offer to join the faculty at MIT which was exciting.  You know they don't take their own; no school does, they pick one in fifty of their own graduates to be faculty and what he told me sitting his office, he said "Jim, here is why we're excited about having you;" he said "You have a background in controls; you've taken all the courses, and you have a background in acoustics; you did research with Wes [Wesley Harris; Hubbard's Ph.D. advisor and mentor at MIT]."  He goes "Acoustics and vibrations are essentially the same--," he goes "--and you have a rare background to combine those two."  He said, "So we want you to come over here on the faculty and develop active ways to control vibrations."  And it turned out that was just before President [Ronald] Regan announced the Star Wars Initiative which involved a massive effort in the active control of vibrations (laughter).  The whole world ended up looking at that so it was right, very timely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: That's how I got into it.
Story_ID: 26433
Speaker 1: I ended up building--controlling this little test structure using some active plastic film.  Anyway, people looked at that as what you call a smart structure, and now there is a field called Smart Structure, a worldwide field called Smart Structure; so there's a book over there (TURNS HIS HEAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BOOK) that says "Jim Hubbard built the first Smart Structure" and now--and it created a field.
Speaker 2: Now this is the piezoelectric material?  And explain what piezoelectricity is for us.
Speaker 1: It's just--I mean it's a material; it can be plastic or it can be a crystal or a ceramic, and if you apply a force--it's like a wet sponge; if you push on it, a sponge, water comes to the surface, but if you push on a piezo [pronouncing it as "peezo"] or piezoelectric [pronouncing it as "pyzo"], charge comes to the surface.  "Pyzo" is correct but people just say "peezo" (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Okay.
Speaker 1: --but "pyzo" is correct; it is.  A charge comes to the surface, and if you put an electrode there, you can collect the charge; and so all of a sudden, you've got a material that if you (HITTING THE TABLE) put a force on it, it generates a voltage.  The funny thing is, if you run it in reverse and you put a voltage on it, it changes its dimensions, so if you glue it to a surface so that it can't move, it generates a force.  So now you've got this plastic that can sense and actuate.
Speaker 2: So like a magnetic field, or a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--No, it physically moves, man.
Speaker 2: So it actually--
Speaker 1: It moves (laughter).
Speaker 2: So if you have it, say around a ball or something and you apply electricity--an electrical current to it, what would it do?  Would it shoot away from it?
Speaker 1: No, it would squeeze the ball (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--It would squeeze the ball (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--but so small you wouldn't see it with your eye.  But it--this was my contri--(laughter).  So people used to say "Well who cares what Jim's doing with that plastic material?  It's plastic, it's not gonna be able to control anything significant."  Well it turns out, I went to [Charles Stark] Draper Lab and used it to control eight foot long solar panels on a satellite--steel; and then people was like "Whoa, what's goin' on?"  Because I learned that if you operate at what's called the resonance frequency, the natural frequency of vibration of things, even with that little bit of force, you can generate and suppress very large displacements; but you, you gotta work there.  People kinda saw that as ingenious (laughter) like--and you know I was like "what?" (laughter)  So I got--you know I got all these awards and recognition (laughter); you know I'm like "what?"
Story_ID: 26434
Speaker 1: The way it really happened--this is a great story for you.  So there was a very famous man named Stephen Crandall at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], famous because he made solid technical contributions in many areas over his career.  He was so brilliant that I liked being around him; most people were afraid 'cause he didn't suffer fools lightly.  So I end up getting to know him well.  He would invite me to his house for dinner with his family, and his whole family played instruments (laughter) so we would eat dinner and then they would all play jazz while I (laughter) (unclear).  Also, he could point to every beam in his house and give you the Young's Modulus, moment of inertia 'cause he designed his whole house, right?  So I went to him and I asked for advice when the department said "Jim, I want you to combine controls and vibrations and do something."  And so I went to him (laughter) all naive and, you know, he was all--he--you know he used to wear this bow tie with these little glasses and he would look down at you, so I go in there one day and I said "Professor Crandall, I'm supposed to do active control of vibrations--," I said "--but I wanna do something that people are gonna use; I wanna build something that actually gets used; I don't just wanna generate papers."  So he listened to me very carefully and he said the following thing to me.  He said "Jim, if you want people to use your stuff--," I tell this to my students all the time; he said "--you gotta meet the following criteria;" he said "when you put your sensors and actuators and control systems on a structure," I said "yes," he said "it shouldn't weigh any more, it shouldn't look any different, and it shouldn't use any more power" (laughter).  And I was "than when you didn't put 'em on there."  So I was like "okay."  (Laughter)  I walked out of there like "what?  How you gonna do that?"  (Laughter)  Well it turns out, piezo film is exactly that.  You put a piezo film on a beam, you can't even tell it's there.  The way the plastic film compared to steel beam is insignificant, and guess what?  It doesn't use any power, you can use it with a coin cell battery.  So ironically, when I finished, I met all those criteria, and that's when the research committee went crazy; they loved it.
Speaker 2: And so this is--is this the work that's cited around the--papers have come out of this, right?
Speaker 1: Typically, a professor will write a paper and he will get--if he's good, he'll get ten, eleven citations.  Paper's got a thousand, and continues to be cited.  The first paper I ever wrote, by the way, as a faculty member.
Speaker 2: Now what can--now you worked on something called a cantilever (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--That was just my demonstration.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you just demonstrated how the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--How you control a steel beam with a piece of plastic; how you can make something--a control system that doesn't look any different, weigh any different, or use any more power than when it wasn't a control system (laughter).  How do you do that?  Then I went on and I ended up with 24 patents using that mentality
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: Two dozen patents.  I invented things in medicine, in structures, military applications, optics for tonics, they're all over there in my lab; they span everything.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was a new way of thinking.  I did the patents just to prove to people that this way of thinking worked, 'cause even after I showed 'em, they still weren't using it.  Takes the world a long time to change, so I just got fed up, I quit academia and I was gone for over 20 years inventing (laughter).  I invented a new thing every year for twenty-somethin' years (laughter), but I stayed away from academia during that time.
Story_ID: 26435
Speaker 1: Now something happened over at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in '82 [1982] and I just wanted to raise it because it's in the outline, and both you and James Gates were brought onto the faculty even though you were trained at MIT and you were mentioning how rare that is that a school would bring on someone as a profession that they've actually--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--brought through the Ph.D. process, but when the two of you came up for tenure, neither one of you got tenure and what was that about?
Speaker 2: Okay, so none of that's true--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but everyone in this country and abroad thinks that that's true; none of it is true.  At MIT, here's what happens; you become an assistant professor without tenure; four years later, you go up for a promotion to associate professor without tenure.  Every school in the land--you do not come up to tenure until your seventh year.  If you check the records, you will see I was not a professor for seven years; there's no way I could have come up for tenure, no way; that's just a rumor.  How could I come up for tenure?  I left MIT after four years on the faculty; how could I possibly be turned down for tenure?  Huh?
Speaker 1: Okay. So, what happened was we had a dean who--the department was very excited 'cause I actually was doing good, and so when I came up for the promotion to associate professor without tenure, the department head thought it would be routine; I had journal papers, I had breakthroughs, I was filing for patents, and then he had other cases that he thought would be very difficult, but it wasn't tenure, it was just the associate professor without tenure.  So he goes up before the dean and when he gets to my case, he just started--the whole department thought "this is open and shut."  But that dean used to call me into his office to talk about foolishness; he used to say--he could call me in to tell me "How's it goin'?"  I'd say "Fine."  "Do you need anything?"  "I'm fine, why?"  "Because when you fail, I want you to fail because you're no good, not because you don't have what you need."  And it was just constant stuff like that, telling me about how hard the Jews have it compared to the blacks; stuff like that--what does that have to do with me, Larry?  Nothing, but that was the dean.  So he--when my name came up, he was ready to fight, find anything he could, but the department was like "Well Jim's not gonna be a problem;" well he turned it down.  Now the department came back and had a meeting and they were furious; they were gonna re-confront him except that was when I got the word that my mother [Lillie Echols Hubbard] was gonna be dead in two weeks from cancer.  What do you do?  Your mom's dying, you got a fool for a dean, you know that you've gone above and beyond, you tell 'em to go to hell, and you go see your mom; that's what I did.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So you're in your mid-thirties here, what is it, 1982?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but--the word tenure was nowhere in that--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I just--I got--you know, my mom's dying, I got some fool that (laughter) is looking at this record and telling me I can't get a routine promotion?  I'm outta here you know?  I'm outta here.  Well Larry, that sent a lot of--I got a call from a lotta people; just people in the community who were quote "counting" on me 'cause our people don't get those kinda opportunities; how could you just walk away?  People across the country were asking me "Jim, what is going on there?"  I mean it created a big stir; big stir, a lotta people were watching.
Speaker 2: So a lot of misinformation about it apparently (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--well I didn't say what happened and so people just dream up stuff, but you, you, you don't go for tenure for--until your seventh year; I was never at MIT seven years.
Story_ID: 26436
Speaker 1: Is that the same thing for Professor Gates too, I guess?  (Simultaneous)-- same time, right?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I don't know; I--I don't know.  Here's what--here's what happened to both of us.  Our departments [at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachusetts] loved and supported us; when we finally became faculty, we were exposed to the general community and there was a lot of racism there and we both simply got sick of it and left.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: We got tired of it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and left.  And the rest is history.  Ironically, we should end up at the same school with chairs.
Speaker 1: University of Maryland, right?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, both of us got fac--we're chaired professors--tenured chaired professors (laughter) of the highest rank; distinguished (laughter); it's so ironic.  We just got sick of it; a routine promotion and we gotta jump through hoops again; we got tired of it.  Because not only that, when you have a Ph.D.--you know, I used to tell people--tenure?  Man, I'm black with a Ph.D. from MIT, I got tenure by definition.  I'm never gonna have to worry about a job the rest of my life, and that was both of our mentalities so if they wanna play games, we're outta here.  And we went on to have wonderful careers; we were treated so well by everybody--forever.  We just got tired of it; we got tired of it.
Speaker 1: I mean when you look back at it now, I mean do you think MIT has--is it any better now than it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never went back, ever.  I just returned three months ago and I regretted that trip; I had to go there on business.  There's nothing there that I wanna see or visit.  I don't have any really good memories of MIT.  However--you know I told you everything's got two sides.  When they finished training me, I was a monster; there's no place on earth could have trained me like that.  I mean it's--the way they train you is incredible; painful but incredible.  Here's the irony that I would say to people out there and on this camera.  When I got there as a freshman or a sophomore--well look, before I got there Larry, I just wanted to be a diesel mechanic--but a master diesel mechanic.  Coming back from sea, I didn't wanna go back to sea no more, I just wanted to be a mechanic.  When I got to MIT, I just wanted a bachelor's degree.  In my humble opinion, the forces there--the place was set up for me to fail.  You know they had--only 13 percent of minority students even got a degree once they started.  I saw so many things there that upset me that was happening to me, and then I mean how could I be getting Ds and Cs when at nineteen, I could run a ten-stories of equipment on a ship with my eyes closed?  I passed the [U.S.] Coast Guard exams at eighteen, but you--it's against the law to give me the promotion so I had to wait.  How could I be failing at MIT?  So it upset me so much that the guy who wanted to be a diesel mechanic decided to take everything from MIT.  I decided to take it, and I didn't want any of it.  And so, to me, they created a monster that they didn't have to; they didn't.  If they had left me alone, I would have just went away and become a diesel mechanic or something.
Speaker 1: So the agitation basically (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, I think that's what happened to Jim too--Gates; it just made me furious and I wouldn't stop.  It's that military training I told you about.  If you rap me on the nose, you got a big problem; if you just walk past and let me sleep, everything's fine.  So they hit me on my nose and I won everything.  I finished my degrees in three years; I had every award they ever could muster, and then I spent the rest of my career with no boss, doing anything I wanted, funded by everybody.  You know, I would have never done any of that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --any of it; I wouldn't even be sitting here.
Story_ID: 26437
Speaker 1: When I left MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachusetts], the president of [Charles Stark] Draper Labs decided--I mean, sorry--Draper Labs decided that they wanted me to stay; long story short, they agreed to do whatever it took to get me to stay.  So I got to hand-pick a tiger team and write my own ticket for six years.
Speaker 2: Now Draper Labs is a--is at MIT, right?
Speaker 1: It's in Cambridge.
Speaker 2: It's in Cambridge, okay.
Speaker 1: They put man on the moon--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --they built the first guidance system that put man on the moon.  So I got to stay there for six years, and they let me do anything I wanted to do, and everything I wanted to do.  And that's where I met Don [Donald] Fraser and that's where he became my second ment--my third mentor.  And later on he became Deputy Undersecretary of Defense and introduced me to that world; he introduced me to the world of four-star generals, admirals, and clearances way above TS [top secret].  So a good run with him and then he decided to leave and become Deputy Undersecretary of Defense, and I left and ran a company for Cardinal Warde [also a HistoryMaker] called Optron Systems [Inc.]; I ran that company and got exposed to entrepreneurship there.
Speaker 2: Now tell us who Cardinal Warde is; we've interviewed him, but I want you to tell us, I mean--
Speaker 1: He's a black professor from the old school, Wes' [Wesley Harris; Hubbard's Ph.D. advisor and mentor at MIT] era, in electrical engineering at MIT, pioneered something called a micro-channel plate, built lots of devices out of it, and started a small business which is probably almost thirty years old now doing, you know, doing proposals.  He was trying to build something that I secretly had built for Draper Labs, and somehow he found out and he recruited me to come and help perfect his device--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but I did a lotta black work at Draper; a lot that won't show up on anything you got; for three years I did it because the head of Draper ended up being the former head of the National Reconnaissance Office, Ralph Jacobson.  Draper had a habit of hiring retired generals, and during my stay there, they hired the head of the National Reconnaissance Office (laughter).  So he comes to Draper and I got a tiger team.  You know it--my ti--there were only two people or three people that had tiger teams, and those teams were autonomous; they ran just like that recon marine trained us.  Nobody could boss us around, we didn't worry about anything; our job was to hunt down and kill the most advanced concepts we could dream of, and we did it; we're hashing.  So he naturally took us black.
Story_ID: 26438
Speaker 1: So what I was telling you Larry, was that Don [Donald] Fraser left [Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to become Deputy Undersecretary of Defense and I left because he was my mentor, and I left to help Cardinal Warde [also a HistoryMaker] because Cardinal was trying to develop a device that I had a lot of experience developing for Draper--
Speaker 2: Emm.
Speaker 1: --and, because of my background, he also wanted me to run the company.
Speaker 2: Okay now, what is this device?
Speaker 1: Do you wanna know technically what--well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, technically yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was during the Star Wars era, and there were a bunch of challenges for Star Wars; people were developing high-energy laser systems, alright?  And what they would like for them to be able to do is sit on the ground and shoot down missiles, trying to hurt the United States.  The problem, Larry, is when you shine a beam of light through the atmosphere, the currents in the air and all make the beam move all around.  I mean if I aim at you if there's wind blowing, it'll blow--literally blow the--you know; I won't hit you.  So one of the things you can do is take the beam of light and let it hit a mirror, and then steer the mirror to hit you; and then have a sensor that looks at all these air currents and as they wiggle the beam, the mirror wiggles in the opposite direction, and so the beam stays right on you and you're dead; that's called adaptive optics.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: Well it turns out, it's really hard to do (laughter).  The government, Lincoln Labs, had received a lotta money to develop the system I just told you about, but it turns out that the mirror has to be really flat and hard so they made it out of titanium.  But the biggest mirror they could polish that flat was six inches.  Then it turns out to do air currents, you have to have at least a thousand action waves on the back to wiggle the frequencies they want.  They can only get 300 because it's only a six-inch mirror, and they used 300 piezo crystals to move it.  Well, you gotta run piezos at 600 volts Larry; so they had 300 amplifiers in a room, air conditioned to get the 300 but I mean it was huge, it took up a whole building.  When I was at Draper, I developed a two-inch mirror that had a million actuators on it.  And, you could put it in your pocket; I have a patent on that--
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: --so Cardinal found out about that; I never published anything--a million.  And so he was trying to develop the same kind of mirror to do large projection displays for movie theaters and for military use.
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.
Speaker 1: And so it was a natural--he was a gem; come on man (laughter).  SAIC [Science Applications International Corporation]--I was interviewing with them 'cause I had worked with the founder of SAIC through Don Fraser; I had been on a government committee with him; his name was Larry Crowe and he was like--Larry Cole--and he was like "Jim, come and work with us."  But then Cardinal--so I went with Cardinal and developed this deformable mirror.  All kinds of photolithography techniques; I was there four years.
Speaker 2: Okay, and this was for Optron [Systems, Inc.]?
Speaker 1: Emm hmm (NODDING OF HIS HEAD YES), Optron.
Speaker 2: Optron, okay.  Cardinal Warde.
Story_ID: 26439
Speaker 1: Did you ever teach at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] again after you left in '82 [1982], I guess?
Speaker 2: I never went back.
Speaker 1: Never went back; okay, you said--I thought you said that.
Speaker 2: I had Ph.D. students that I finished up between '85 [1985]--I left in '85 [1985].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Between '85 [1985] and '90 [1990], I finished up Ph.D. students, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I never went back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went over to BU next.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you taught at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Well I didn't teach, I was one of the found--co-founders of the Boston University Photonic Center.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: It's a hundred million dollar center that was built from scratch.
Speaker 1: So you were a Senior Systems Engineer by then?  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yeah--well people say Chief Engineer.
Speaker 1: Chief, okay.
Speaker 2: But I was involved when they were trying to raise the money for it.  Let me tell you a little secret.  Who--you know who the director of that center was?
Speaker 1: Inaudible response.
Speaker 2: Don [Donald] Fraser.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I helped--I helped get him there (laughter).  Don't you find it kinda curious that the two of us would end up there, together?  (Laughter).  There was nothing but a thought; they had to raise a hundred million dollars and build that, and I end up being involved in that because I ran a photonics company and they needed support from the local photonics community which there wasn't that many.  Anyway, long story short, I ended up getting my old mentor to be the director of the new hundred million dollar photonics center and he, once he became established, picked me as his chief engineer (laughter).  And I sat down with the architect and designed my lab there from scratch; it was a very nice time.
Speaker 1: Emm.
Speaker 2: And, I--we also put in an incub--business incubator, so I founded two companies while I was there in addition to being the chief engineer of the whole center.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what were the two companies?
Speaker 2: Company called PhotoSense [Inc.] and a company called iProvica.  PhotoSense made skins for inanimate objects that could make them animate.  I made a skin for an automobile seat because air bags were killing kids, decapitating them actually; so I made a skin that went on the seat and when you sat in there, it could tell the car's air bag computer a lot about you.  And so when the air bag fired, it could mitigate damage to you--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I got a patent on a Smart Seat.  In fact, behind you is a plaque from one of the leading engineering professional societies where--in 1999, when I did this seat, I was competing against [Northrop] Grumman Aircraft, and I ended up winning the Top Innovation of the Year Award; beat Northrop Grumman, that was kinda sweet.  At iProvica, we made a hospital sheet that could monitor a patient.
Speaker 1: Back to the other one though, PhotoSense.  The auto industry didn't(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I tried (simultaneous)-- Well, there's a lot of history there but--yeah, I spent a lotta time in Detroit [Michigan]; the auto industry is--was then and is now very leery of working with entrepreneurial individuals; they have tier companies that they work with.  And they've gotten burned in the past, they claim, by working with entrepreneur individuals.  So that really was going nowhere for cultural reasons; I didn't realize that.  I made an insert for a shoe that allowed podiatrists to correctly diagnose problems; I used to say that "time wounds all "heels," instead of "heals" all wounds."  75 percent of America's feet hurt and they think it's okay, so I developed these things look like Dr. Scholl's where when you put 'em on and walk, the computer could monitor your gait wirelessly. You could also use 'em for sports.  Track athletes could watch a run; you know right now the coach watches them, after the run they get together and try to figure out what happened, wherein if the computer did it, it would have a record.  I used to say that what made me do all that was I realized that people spend eight hours a day staring at computers and then they never work, and when you call the 1-800 Tech Support number, the guy on the other end is usually dumber than you.  So it infuriated me so I formed a company to let--make computers stare at you eight hours a day (laughter) and do things like, you know, physical rehabilitation, you know, help you with athletic performance, but they would be staring at you for a change; you wouldn't have to--and, the technology would be invisible; so you didn't need to call; there is no tech support number.  And so iProvica means Invisible Products, Visible Care, iProvica.  All my technology from that point on had to meet Steve Crandall's [his colleague at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)] criterion of essentially being invisible (laughter) and they are, you know I, I, I stuck with that for many years.
Story_ID: 26440
Speaker 1: Now, the Smart Skin--now what medical conditions could Smart Skin monitor?
Speaker 2: Well, we did it for the following reason.  The baby boomers were getting older; most of the nation.  I was out on the soccer field with my kids and people were telling me--I would say "How is so-and-so?"  I asked about a husband and they would say--this happened a couple of times, "You know his dad had as stroke and now he's at home; he had to come into Georgia's home and now Georgia's trying to take care--"  You know, people don't know how to do that.  And so as the baby boomers were getting older, they were actually inheriting their parents with heart attacks, strokes, you name it, and had no clue what to do.  So I invented this sheet for geriatric patients; they could lay on the sheet--on the bed you wouldn't see it, it's invisible; but there was a shortage of nurses (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--It is a sheet though, right?  On the bed?
Speaker 2: It was made outta paper--
Speaker 1: Paper, okay.
Speaker 2: --so it can go under the sheet.
Speaker 1: But it's a paper with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Circuitry.
Speaker 1: Does it use a piezoelectric (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, but I can't tell you what it uses.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Proprietary.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: But the sheet looks like a sheet of paper (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--It was a sheet of paper; it was--it took me a long time to learn how to make it out of a sheet of paper but I did (laughter).  But it would just watch the patient and it would wirelessly log the results, and then if something--I had like ten anomalies; if it happened to those people--patients, it would call a nurse 'cause it was a shortage of nurses and instead I made basically a robot nurse that could watch the patients.  Smart Sheet, I mean Smart Skins for submarines that could do acoustic imaging under water, just a lotta stuff; it's all over my lab.  A lotta stuff.
Speaker 1: These are materials that have properties in themselves that allows them to react (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Like skin, like skin.  And some of them are like muscles.
Speaker 1: Are they able to send a signal to a computer or to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Emm hmm (NODDING HEAD, YES).  Well, some of them can--I mean for--ever, what people do is they take data from sensors into a computer and then they crunch on it and turn it into information for humans.  I learned how to process this data right in the material and so what comes out is information, and that freaked people out--directly.  A lot of the processing, the calculus, done right in the material.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was the reception to Smart Skin?  Or Smart Sheet?  Is that the right one?  Are there two different ones, or is it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Every--all of the twenty-four patents are Smart Skins of some type.  Their reception--that's a great question.  There's two things; the reception was everything that I touched, the U.S. Department--Patent Department was willing to patent, and some of 'em worldwide.  My--they were very excited.  My whole point was I was trying to show the technical community that these materials were ready because all they were doing was writing papers.  So everything I did or touched worked, and it was patented.  The stuff was so far out there that it took some of 'em ten years before the world started doing that kinda thing.  I did the cantilever beam in '81 [1981], and in 2001 you started seeing it at Johnson Space Center as a demonstration, in university labs, and everything I've ever done it takes a decade before people comfortable with it.  But the Smart Sheet was nice 'cause we actually had--before I left my company, we were lined up to do field tests at a nursing home.  And, I had an angel--investor backing that project.  So we were fully-funded, we had test sites, I developed the product, and then [University of] Maryland [College Park] came and recruited me away.
Story_ID: 26441
Speaker 1: At this point, were you just kinda tired of--or what?
Speaker 2: No, I was at the [Boston University] Photonics Center [Boston, Massachusetts], I had covered the wall in the hallway up where the (unclear) were with my patents, I was making good money, I had my own company, I had a lab that you would kill for overlooking the Charles River; I mean come on now; I was doing great.  And at that time was when this place [National Institute of Aerospace, Hampton, Virginia] was formed; NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] and six universities put up over Three hundred million dollars to form this place.  And they wanted a chaired, tenured professor with each of the six universities.  Soon as they told [University of] Maryland [College Park] they wanted somebody in Smart Structures, they just came after me.  They all knew my reputation, I had mentored half of the faculty at Maryland, and they just--they, they hardly even looked at anybody else, they just came after me.
Speaker 1: This is in 2004, right?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I told Maryland I wouldn't touch the job with a ten-foot pole 'cause I was pretty happy, and they offered it to me with a fourteen-foot pole and I took it; they did.  The dean--the current dean of engineering at Maryland--when I left MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to go to Draper [Laboratory, Cambridge] , he was a graduate student, and asked me to give him an RA-ship [research assistantship] and I said no 'cause I was leaving.  Now he's the dean of engineering at Maryland and almost everybody in that department--I have long history like that.  'Cause it's impossible, again, to have left academia for twenty-five years and return a distinguished, chaired professor with tenure; nobody does that, they don't even allow you to do that.  So--I mean there are people that spend their whole twenty years on campus and don't get that.  So how you gone just not even be a professor (laughter)--and the whole university has to vote on that by the way.  So it was a blessing; I still didn't wanna do it Larry and my wife [Adrienne Hubbard], bless her heart--because so many people protested--well, it has to go through the whole university for you to become a tenured full professor, distinguished; and it took nine months 'cause they basically gave me a body cavity search.  But during that nine months, my wife came and said "Jim"--'cause I wasn't gone do it.  She said "Jim, you should think about it; you know you're in your fifties; think about what you're gonna do with the rest of your career."  And I said "I am doing it."  I had been an entrepreneur for twelve years.  Every--I don't know if you know anything about entrepreneurs but they're like this; every year, if you talk to one, they'd be like "Oh, this is the year Larry, oh, this is the big one."  Man--so for twelve years, I put my family through hell, and every year I was like "Baby, I'm so glad you stuck with me; I'm glad 'cause this is the year!"  So she said, "Just think about it for me, alright?"  'Cause I told her I was doing what I would like.  Well guess what?  I thought about it, and after seven or eight months, one of the saddest days of my life, I came to a revelation and I sat down with her again and I said "I thought about what you asked me.  I spent twelve years as an entrepreneur putting y'all through hell trying to make money, and after what you told me and I thought about it, guess what?  I ain't never cared about money; don't care about making money."  And I start crying.  I said "I can't believe I put y'all through all this; I could care less about money."  And she said to me "I know, Jim; I know," she said "--but you seemed to be enjoying it."  So I realized (laughter) I don't give a--the second thing I realized, boy did I miss students; I can't tell you how much I missed students.  These words don't even come close; so that was the--she said "Okay, let's go; let's do it."  So I came down here and I'm with students; I'm training some of the best citizens in this nation, and some of the finest engineers that you will--you can produce.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this was in 2004, you're fifty-three [years old].
Story_ID: 26442
Speaker 1: And I didn't--I know I neglected to ask you before where you did this about the "wolf pack," you know, the "wolf pack" is--there's so many references to it here and (unclear), and that has to do with the business, you know, the entrepreneurial side, right?
Speaker 2: Emm emm (SHAKING HIS HEAD NO).
Speaker 1: No?  Okay, well I must have something wrong.
Speaker 2: Do you know what a totem is?
Speaker 1: No response.
Speaker 2: Well the totem is some people, and I guess it might come from Indians, but some people feel that their spirit is actually associated somehow with an object or an animal; I mean it's just--nobody ever told you that, nobody ever--but it just--you identify with that totem and for me it's wolves.  People ask me--they come in here and they see this (LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM), I mean this is kinda weird, I guess eccentric; and they say "Well Jim, what's up with the wolves?"  And I just look at 'em like this (DEMONSTRATION) and I say "I was raised by wolves."  But that recon [reconnaissance] marine trained us like a pack of wolves; he had us read about packs of wolves; we hunted like packs of wolves.  A wolf pack is extremely social with each other, and what I like about 'em--I mean you'll see--with each other they're so gentle Larry, and so caring.  But if you go to Yellowstone [National] Park and you ask a top ranger out there what is the deadliest thing out there?  It's not grizzly bears, it's none of that; it's the wolf; he is the top predator in Yellowstone National Park.  Five Hundred square miles of pure nature; it's the wolf.  When things get bad there in the winter when it's fifty feet of snow on the ground, and I am not exaggerating, and on an average winter day it's 30 [degrees Fahrenheit] or 40 below zero, and one by one, from the birds who left long ago to the bison who are dropping dead from the severeness of the winter, the wolves begin to flourish.  In fact, when it's at its worse, they begin mating; they're at their best, and so I train students like that.  They give me gifts; there's a book there how to-'The Art of Being A Wolf'.  Everything we do in this group, every way we think, every way we hunt, the way we interact with each other, the way we interact with others, it's all based on what I learned about wolves.  I don't--I never took a management course; I grew up in Baltimore [Maryland] on the street, but it works; there's a fierce loyalty.  Students that I trained decades ago will drop everything if somebody here needs them; they all do, so it's been very fulfilling, but it's all I know, I don't know anything else.  Sometime I forget that I even said that.  You want to hear something really strange?  So my wife's [Adrienne Hubbard] away this weekend and I went out back--'cause we have a date every Friday and she wasn't here; I didn't know what to do with myself.  So I go out back of my house and I have a fire pit; I light a fire, I get myself a glass of wine, I put on some music, I'm sitting out in my yard.  Now I never, ever look at Facebook [social networking site] because most of the people on there I haven't seen in a decade and now, over time, it's lost its novelty; it's just boring.  For some reason--I never look at Facebook.  I pull out my phone; fiddlin', fiddlin', I'm on Facebook.  There's nothing there; I'm scrolling, I'm scrolling, I get to this lady name Amanda Beck who I haven't seen in ten years, and all of a sudden--it's a white lady, she has four or five paragraphs on Facebook so I start reading 'em.  She starts talking about the history of the black man in America and about this and that.  And then she says--you know what?  She says "I had a mentor," and she starts talking about me.  Now what's the chance of that?  I haven't looked at Facebook in years.  I'm on there, and the latter part of her long dissertation is about me when I was there with her and mentoring her, and how grateful she was, and how wonder--and she even used the term, she said "He taught us that we were part of his wolf pack." (laughter)  This was Friday; unbelievable.  I showed my kids.  Who would--I mean isn't that weird that I would--that that would happen?  So I wrote her back and it stunned her; she hadn't heard from me in ten years; there's no way she would have thought I was looking.  So it's a very good way to do what it is I'm trying to do--produce excellent citizens for this nation; upstanding people, and the best engineers that you can think of.  They are pleasure to be around, wonderful to work with, very competent, and a handful if you decide you wanna rap 'em on the nose.  They won't stop, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I like that.
Speaker 1: So I'm glad I asked you about it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Sorry, I didn't mean to get carried away.
Story_ID: 26443
Speaker 1: So University of Maryland [College Park] and you're assigned out here to the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, yes, to the Aerospace.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, National Institute of Aerospace [NIA] here at Langley [Research Center, Hampton, Virginia] and the schools involved in this are Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], University of Maryland (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, be careful now, there are six founding schools--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia], Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], North Carolina A and T [State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia], University of Maryland, and--what did I leave out?  Anyway--
Speaker 1: But is--Hampton is one of them, right?
Speaker 2: Hampton is not; Hampton (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: --[The College of] William and Mary [Williamsburg, Virginia], and Old Dominion University [Norfolk, Virginia] are what they call affiliate member universities; they weren't the founders of NIA.  Hampton does not have a Langley professor; the founders each have a Langley professor--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hampton does not.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what you've been working here, from what I understand, is a morphing of aircraft structures.
Speaker 2: Well, I came here and decided to be the kind of professor that I always wished I had, alright?  And Langley had endowed--at the time--it's different now, the professorship that I had with an unbelievable amount of discretionary funds so that I could, once again, do anything I felt like, any way I wanted to.  You know I always had that at Draper [Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts], so I came in and Langley had put enough funds in my professorship to do that.  So what I decided to do was let the students decide what direction we were going.  Rather than impose my background in Smart Skins on them, I started just recruiting the very best, and when they got here, they were full of excitement, I let them decide.  So the first guy that came brought with him, to put on his desk, a bird skeleton.  I thought that was so weird; literally, a skeleton.  It's just scary.  So I went in and sat down and talked to him like "What's this all about?"  And he was fascinated with birds, and no matter what else--what I tried to get him interested in, he was just interested in birds.  And ultimately, he convinced me that you could build a robot bird, and so we started doing that, and flying 'em.  And the military got interested, NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] got interested, the world got interested; and over the next eight years, we went from knowing nothing--I happen to think we're among the best in the world right now.
Story_ID: 26444
Speaker 1: Okay, now does Smart Skin factor into these aircraft (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Sure.  I came here [National Institute of Aerospace, Hampton, Virginia]--if you Google "Hubbard Sky Walker," what you'll see is that when I got here in 2004, I wanted to show the world that bringing me back as a distinguished full professor with tenure after me not having been here (laughter) was not a mistake, so the very first program I created Larry, was a ten million dollar DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] program; professors don't do that.  And that's all over the Internet; it's called Sky Walker, and it's a way to keep an airplane up forever.
Speaker 1: Emm.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--And so one of the things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Explain; how can you do that?
Speaker 2: Well, I used the model of an albatross and I found out that albatross routinely circumnavigate the globe when their migration path, every forty-five days.  I learned that they even sleep on the wing, and it's because they can feel the air flow and they can take advantages--advantage of wind energy; updrafts, wind shear--because they feel it and they kinda can know what to do.  So I covered--if we were over in the lab--I covered an aircraft wing with a Smart Skin, and if you go over there to this airplane right now Larry and you do this (BLOWING OUT AIR), it'll move; it'll will react.  And so I took that whole idea of flying air craft in Smart Skins and turned it into the Sky Walker Program, and for several years we worked on that for DARPA.  That ended up getting canceled and resurrected as something called Vulture, which is a high altitude version of Sky Walker, and Vulture is a one hundred million dollar program run outta DARPA; we don't have anything to do with that.  But it's a plane that could stay up forever at a hundred thousand feet, not ten thousand like we were doing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so would it be like, I guess fuel--I mean powered by jet fuel to a certain height and then the engine shut off or something and it just stays up there or--
Speaker 2: Or electric motors.  There was a plane called Sun Seeker, and it might still be called that, but right now, they're in demonstration where they're flying across the country with no fuel or recharge.  So this plane searches for wind energy using a laser, and when it sees it, it goes over there and it has algorithm so that it can use the energy to gain altitude and stay up forever.  If there is no wind for a long period of time, yeah, it could--it will use jet fuel or electricity or whatever, but it's really designed to use environmental energy to stay up forever.  Sky Walker--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --It's famous; that was my first thought when I came here--my first project.
Speaker 1: And--but it's not--the whole project's been shifted to this Vulture project?
Speaker 2: Well the project ran for two years and was canceled, and I'm saying that we were doing--trying to do that at low altitude--what you call LALE, Low Altitude Long Endurance.  And then a year or so later, resurrected as High Altitude Long Endurance--HALE, and that program was code-named Vulture.
Story_ID: 26445
Speaker 1: What are you working on now?  I know we saw some prototypes out here in the lab--well we saw some things that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I can tell you the most exciting thing I'm working on.  So do you remember the earth quake we had here?  We had a earth quake on the East Coast not long ago.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: So that ended up, to people's surprise, completely jamming up all the roads and shutting down the cell phone system.  And we have a nuclear power plant here called Surry, and so the local First Responder Chief was very concerned that there might have been a HAZMAT released from Surry, and he couldn't get to it; he couldn't even call over there, I mean everything just went down for this period.  So he--that alerted him, and he ended up talking to a lots of people about what could be done, and they told him "You should get a UAV, Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle" because--it's a robot airplane and you just fly it over there and, you know, sniff and see if there's--so being naive about UAVs, he actually tried to obtain one, and the problem is at this point, they're military.  There's a lot of 'em out there that you can quote buy, but they're military.  So the one that he needed wasn't that big, it cost a million dollars; they laughed him right out of the state legislature, and it required a National Guard unit to fly.  Now this is typical, Global Hawk has 176 people to fly it.
Speaker 1: Why so many?
Speaker 2: For a number of reasons I happen to think personally, one of which is that the military is very afraid that these vehicles will get away from 'em and they don't know what they'll do.  Global Hawk could be done fully autonomous but all of the way (laughter), you know, you got people making sure it's doing what it's supposed to 'cause if that thing takes off on its own, the public will be mad.  So he came--somebody ended up sending him over her to talk to me about what could be done 'cause he didn't have a million bucks and, you know, he just wasn't--and so I listened to him--my wolf pack--asked him some questions about the way he operates, that's called CONOPS, by the way--Concept of Operations.  In fact, he gave us a CONOPS book for first responders.  And then we came up with this idea for Air Wolf, an aerial canine; we came up with the fact that okay, you don't wanna learn how to fly a UAV, right?  No; but you are a first responder and you're used to working with service animals, right?  Yes.  Why don't we program a UAV--if you go over there, it's a hexacopter--to think it's a dog, a German Shepherd.  And why don't we program it to interact with you the same way your German Shepherds do?  Why don't I give you ten dog commands that will allow you to carry out this CONOPS?  Why don't I put some of the CONOPS into this aerial canine so that you don't even have to tell it what to do in certain circumstances, it'll just go do it."  And so we came up with this Air Wolf, this Arial canine thing, and we're working on that now.  There's a guy at Langley that has developed a control architecture for it and it's called Horse Mode Control; it mimics the interaction of a horse and its rider.  When you get on a horse, you don't steer it anywhere; you just go (SOUNDING AND MOVING DEMONSTRATION), and the horse is off.  If the horse comes to an obstacle that it understands, it knows how to go around it; you don't steer it anywhere.  If it comes to something that it doesn't recognize, it'll stop and it'll wait for your command.  In the control architecture, this engineer at Langley has a tight lead and loose lead mode; loose lead the horse has control, tight lead he has control.  For the aerial canine--the Air Wolf--we have loose leash and tight leash mode (laughter) (laughter).  And so we're in the process now of kicking this project off and programing a hexacopter to think it's a service canine so they can work with first responders easily.  Ten dog commands, that's it.
Speaker 1: Well this is fascinating stuff.
Speaker 2: Oh, I love it.  But again, my ideas tend to be so far out there, when you tell 'em to people, you just get a blank stare.  Even other faculty, like they just look at you, and that's my frustration (laughter).  And so I'm at the blank stare mode right now (laughter).  People like "Where is Jim--what?"  (Laughter)  But that's what we're working on; very exciting (laugher) Air Wolf.  Wouldn't you have known it?  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 26446
Speaker 1: Well, I've also founded a company with my son [James Hubbard], so I'm working on that now, too.  Who could have asked for a better business partner and associate?  And do you know how fulfilling it is to build a company with your first born?  Oh my God, that's so nice.
Speaker 2: Well tell us about this, now this has been--what kind of company is it?
Speaker 1: Well, when he graduated a year ago, the economy was such that 300 resumes later (laughter), he still didn't have a job and so he said "Dad, let's start a company together."  So I said "Okay, but you know what you're asking me?  You see all these marks on my back and arrows sticking of it?  That's from being an entrepreneur (laughter).  You sure you wanna do, you know, long hours and short pay?"  And said "Yeah."  So I took it as an opportunity to train my oldest son in all of the techniques that I learned in being an entrepreneur.
Speaker 2: Now what's his training?
Speaker 1: ODU [Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia], bachelor's degree in management.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so he looked at those two dozen patents on the wall in my lab and decided that we were going to strategically commercialize as much of this technology as we could, so that's what we're doing--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --we're about to come out with--actually, there's a thing on line called Kick Start; it's a way of kick-starting a project; and if you go there right now, as we speak, he has set up a kick-start program to sell robot birds to the public (laughter).  He's about to put out a product that can harvest environmental energy of all kinds and convert it into electricity so that you can run remote sensors and things like that; stuff like that.  But it's a lotta fun to--you know I tell people "I've been waiting twenty-four years for this partner, and he's finally here."  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 26447
Speaker 1: Now is a good time, I guess, to talk about this, but you really enjoy your family; you've got three sons, right?
Speaker 2: I got three sons [Jason, Drew and Jordan Hubbard], I got a beautiful wife [Adrienne Hubbard].  I met her on a blind date.  I didn't anything about her but people got tired of me--you know I was at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]; I told you they didn't know nothin' about me 'cause I didn't socialize with anybody and so my sister-in-law, she used to say "Jim, where do you go on the weekends?"  "Nowhere."  You know, I was--anyway, she said "I got somebody I want you to meet."  So she set up this blind date with her husband's sister.  Her husband is now the president of Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and she's tenured professor at [University of] Maryland.  Anyway, I go there to meet this girl, you know what I'm saying, I'm thirty-five [years old], this little girl is twenty-seven, and I didn't think much of it like--and because it was a blind date set up by my friends, you know, everybody in the room is watching to see what happens, I mean it's real awkward.  And I just got sick of everybody waitin' for somethin' to happen so I go get a chair, I go over to this lady--this girl I don't even know, and I said "Come and let's talk."  So--her eyes was all big, she came and she--and I took a chair and sat it right in front of me, literally this far apart (DEMONSTRATION), 'cause I was gonna get this over with.  And I talked to her for two hours man, and it was so nice.  You know she's got this southern accent, 'cause she used to be here before, and just so--I don't know man, it was just wonderful; it was easy-flowing conversation; no matter what I threw at her, she just gently handled every bit of it, she dressed really stylish, so relaxed, and then man did I--Oh gosh, she was wonderful.  I feel like a fool, I mean I'm thirty-five years old; so she left, and I was driving back with my friend and he was like "What do you think?"  And like a fool, at thirty-five after talking to somebody for two hours, I said "Man I'm gone marry this girl."  So he panicked; he was like "What?"  So he took me over Calvin's brother's house.  He called Calvin, he called everybody over there; he was like "Man, we got--you gotta talk to Jim."  So all the fellows came over and we got a bottle of somethin' and they was like "Man, are you crazy?"  And I was like "Look man, I been around, I been everywhere, I done everything, I ain't never felt like that when I talked--"  so--anyway, they decided "You need to see her again 'cause somethin's wrong.  Call her up and see if she'll let you go out with her again.  You can borrow one of our cars."  'Cause she lived two hours from me.  So I call her up on the phone, she sound so sweet, and I talked to her and you know what she said?  She say "Yeah, I'll see you again."  She said "Matter of fact, I'll come over to pick you up."  Just so nice; I was like "Really?"  She was like "Yeah."  "What?"  She drove two hours to get me, and the guys was like "Look man."  So they sat down, they wrote down like ten questions that I was supposed to grill her with, right?  Take it--and then Calvin's brother said "Take her to this place here; it's quiet, it's a bar, you're gonna be able to--so fine man, and by that time, they had me all worked up you know.  I was like "Man, what is--what's going on with me, you know?  I need to come to my senses.  So I read these questions and they were hard questions.  I couldn't wait to get her over there and grill her.  And so I was ready to go; and the doorbell rang and we knew it was her; I went to the door and I opened that door Larry and, oh my God, she was dressed in all black, like a leather suit with a little burgundy silk scarf around her neck; it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.  And she just said "Hi."  And we went to the bar and I--oh man, we were there for hours.  I ain't take my eyes off of her.  And I came back and all the guys were waiting, they was like "Man, did you ask her this?"  And I was like "Yeah."  "And what about this?"  I said "We talked about that."  "So what happened?"  I said "I'm gone marry this girl man."  I saw her two more times and I asked her to marry me.  I had only seen her four times in my life.  She said "yeah."  I saw her two more times after that, that's six times; and then we were on our honeymoon.  And on our honeymoon, we realized that we were total strangers, knew nothing about each other.  And now it's twenty-six years later in September, and it's marriage.  So you have a lotta highs and a lotta lows; really hard; my marriage has been really hard, but when I see her about a hour from now, it's gone be so nice (laughter), you know?  We'll probably--her and I are just probably gonna go to a restaurant--oh, this is what it is, I'll sum it up right quick.  So my wife and I are like this.  A burglar could break in our house and, at gunpoint, force us into the closet and then rob us blind.  The police will come ten days later and discover us in there and help us out.  Guess what Larry?  The door was never locked; we're just in there--talking, laughing and joking; it was never locked, we've been in there ten days (laughter).  That's exactly how my marriage is (laughter).  I mean some of those days we probably argued, but we like each other's company.
Speaker 1: That is beautiful.
Story_ID: 26448
Speaker 1: Now tell us about your sons.  Now you told us about one on some level, but your oldest son is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--So I got three [James, Drew and Jordan Hubbard] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--going into business with you and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--they're all over this office.  The youngest one is six feet four now.  I'm a weight lifter, I've been lifting weights for thirty-one years, so they been lifting since they was able to walk, so they're all weight lifters.  My youngest is six [feet] four [inches]; lanky but a weight lifter, and we always refer to him as The Rock.  He's got my weird sense of humor but rock solid; as far as the family is concerned, his opinions never change, he just rock solid foundation.  My oldest we say is The Reason.  He always is able to reason out things and explain things and steer the family.  In fact, the times that my wife and I argue in front of him, which is rare, he will mediate and make sure that we do the right thing, so he's The Reason.  My middle son is The Fire.  He is a prodigy, which is weird, 'cause nobody knows how to deal with a prodigy.
Speaker 1: In what field?
Speaker 2: Whatever he tries to do, not only can he do it, he's like the best; it's weird, I mean anything; physical, mental, and because of that, he's having a hard time making the transition from childhood to adulthood; having a hard time working it out; you know, wanders off the reservation every now and then.  But he hardly touches away--I should show you pictures; and he looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger; I mean he's built like a God and he hardly does anything.  He is in school to be an aviation mechanic.  Always tells me "Dad, I don't like the school."  Guess what?  He gets hundreds; half the time, they give him the day off 'cause he's just acing everything.  And I could go on and on; he--whatever he touches, God--and very handsome (laughter).  If God--I get mad at him 'cause God gave him everything, and in this transition to manhood, he's struggling.  I mean what are you struggling for man?  You got everything (laughter).  And him and my wife have some special empathic bond; they are very close, the rest of us don't even quite understand it but--so those are my three boys.  My youngest is in--Management Information Systems is his major.  The youngest and the oldest have work finesse at Langley, and we're in our last family hurdle; I didn't know this, they told me about the others, you know.  When the kids are two, they're outta control--terrible two's; when they're sixteen, they're crazy, 'cause I thought I knew everything at sixteen; I been getting dumber ever since 16.  But nobody ever told me about this problem where they're technically grown but mentally they're not.  And so this is hard for, for us as a family, getting these three boys over the transom into manhood and adulthood.  We've never been there before, nobody ever talked about how to do it, and it's been difficult; but it's our last hurdle.  And then after that, just me and my wife chillin'.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You will not be able to find me then Larry, at all, no matter what.  You could tell me I hit the lottery; I'm not comin' out, you not gone find me.  I'm gonna be in that closet somewhere with the door shut (laughter) for the rest of my life (laughter).
Story_ID: 26449
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, what do you think is the most significant scientific research that you've done?
Speaker 2: Scientific research?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean--the most significant thing I've done is mentor.  I mentored hundreds of people, and that's why ten years later, with no communication whatsoever, you'll get somebody that will write something like that on the Internet.  I--when you go into other faculties' office, you'll see awards on the wall; you know what my awards are?  Mine are on the wall.  (TURNING AND POINTING TO HIS WALL).  You see those handwritten notes?  From mentorship.  They're just handwritten.  I got a picture of a wolf here, you look under it, it's a note; it's from a woman that's in her fifties who--she may be dead of cancer now, but she says "Jim, I've had this wolf over my bed for five years."  She said "Every time I see it, I think of you."  And she gives it to me as a gift.  You should always--when a person meet you and interacts with you, they should walk away thinking how it was better.  And so there are at least a hundred people I know that will tell you I did that for them, and that's the most significant thing I've ever done.  Everything else--well professionally, everything else is kinda irrelevant to me; it really is.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--All I've, all I've used the engineering for is freedom, financial freedom.  Found out that when you have knowledge, people kinda let you--they need you, and they kinda let you have your way (laughter), and I've used it to mentor.  And then that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in terms of mentorship, are there any specific mentorship programs that you were involved in?
Speaker 2: Sure, my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In was in the [Boston University] Photonics Center one day, trying to hide like always (laughter), and I get this e-mail; so--this was a strange e-mail, so I open up the e-mail and guess what?  It's from a fifth grade class in Danville.  Man, I ain't heard the word Danville [Virginia] in twenty years or something, you know (laughter), and why does a fifth grade class--first of all, I didn't even know how I was--where I was, how could they know (laughter).  A fifth grade class wrote me.  "Dear Dr. Hubbard."  And they knew that I was born there and they knew that I was at the Photonics Center, and I'm just reading, and they wanted to know if they could ask me a bunch of questions because they had a project in class where they were gonna write a book about somebody and they picked me (laughter).  So the next month, we just had the most wonderful dialogue and they wrote a little book, and then I went down there and years later--anyway, that's how I got the mayor of the city to give me the 'Key to the City' [award]--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --because a fifth grade class picked me.  And I ended up doing some mentoring with them.  I feel bad, I couldn't do as much as I wanted to but I do have in my book one day to go back there and do everything I can.  They even named a little building after me there--Hubbard Station where the fifth grade class is.  It was nice man.  They gave me a T-shirt and then they all signed me with their names; it was a wonderful day--that day.
Story_ID: 26450
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at everything you've done to this point, again, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think--I never cared about money, and so I don't have any.  I think I'd probably do somethin' about that.  Like I won't let, I won't let, I won't let my sons do that.  Like I never--I had a chance to start a 401-K [retirement plan] and I didn't, you know, stuff like that.  So financially, I probably would have been a little more responsible.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now I decided to help my son [James Hubbard], and he's gonna end up being a millionaire before he's thirty [years old] because I got the knowledge now, but I still don't care (laughter).  But when he came along, I decided 'okay, I care' and--that boy will be--he'll be--he gone be a millionaire before he's thirty.  But I never cared; so I think if--yeah, when I look back, I probably--do, do better financially.  The other thing I'd do is--I had too many lines in the sand.  I--this is the advice I give to my students.  I had way too many lines in the sand when I was young; you only need one or two, no more.  So I'd definitely get rid of some of those.
Speaker 1: By lines in the sand, you mean--
Speaker 2: If you do this, then--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--you know, especially with white people; you know how that is, you don't need all that, you don't need all that at all.  You know, I tell my sons--hell, most of my mentors were white, most of my students are white.  Nobody cares about any of that crap anymore, you know what I'm saying?  (Laughter)  I, I don't deny I'm aware--people make me aware every day that I'm, I'm a black man in America, but--yeah, that color thing is way over-blown (laughter) in the real world--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I wouldn't live with that chip on my shoulder like I did for so long.
Story_ID: 26451
Speaker 1: Just for the sake of history and for your kids that see this, you were telling us a story about your father [James Edward Hubbard, Sr.] being a pilot, an early black pilot, so you should record this for them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Okay, I will.  There is a news article from the Register and Bee, the Danville Register and Bee [newspaper]; I usually have it up there on my wall, but--I'll have to go find it.  But--he was in World War II, he was a communications--a radio man.  Now this is how my dad was, and this is how, why my mom [Lillie Echols Hubbard], when she said she used to see the way he carried himself in Uncle Froggy's barber shop, she was attracted to him.  So when my dad gets out, he decides to apply for education under the GI Bill.  You know, most blacks wouldn't do that; they didn't even know what the--worry about what the GI Bill is.  So he stayed with it; they kept denying him and turning him down.  Anyway, he ended up getting admitted into pilot school under the GI Bill, and I have a picture of his graduation class that I used to hang up there.  So he graduated as a pilot, and then he saved the money and bought a Piper Cub; those are those yellow airplanes.  And he was a little crazy when was young, I'm told, and so--daredevil--my middle son [Drew Hubbard], The Fire, is a daredevil, and he gets that--so they told me my father would go up and do aerobatics with this airplane.  One of the things that he loved to do was have them tie a handkerchief on a pole, and go out on the field and stick it up.  And then he would fly around, dip the wing, and go so low to the ground that he could pop the handkerchief.  You know that's how crazy--so a lotta that's where I get my spirit from, and my sons [James, Drew and Jordan Hubbard] do.  But my mother hated him putting me in there because he, he had this care--this daredevil side, but I went in there--I went up in there a couple of times when I was a baby.  But he owned a Piper Cub and--here's what's funny.  When I won the--when they told me there were gonna give me the 'Key to the City' [award] at Danville [Virginia], I rented a private plane and I flew directly into Danville Airport on a private plane, and so I get out and I'm going in there, I got a limo waiting to take me to--and I get to chatting with the guy there and that's when I find out my dad was probably the first black pilot to ever fly into that airport and, you know, gave me some pride.  But those are (unclear) grill stories.  There was nothing down there that's (laughter) (unclear).  Maybe you guys, when I give you this article will be the first one to say somethin' but--yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's exceptional.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was somethin' else.
Story_ID: 26452
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?  I know you were talking about some of them before we started the interview.
Speaker 2: I, I got a lot.  There was a time when I grew up when Black and Proud was the motivator, and it was one heck of a motivator; I mean my mom [Lillie Echols Hubbard] went to jail behind those words, but we've come a long way now and I think one of the things you gotta be careful about is letting people--you know we're taking the fact that we're black and limiting ourselves now.  I happen to think now, there's nothing that can stop you from doing anything.  And so to stand up--you know when you hang up a bunch of great reasons to fail, people will grab on to 'em.  And so I'm concerned that there's still these things hanging up there by way of excuses because you're black, and soon as you grab one, nobody can argue with you; you failed.  And you say "Well look," and you're right.  This is a racist world, tough on a black man.  I tell my sons [James, Drew and Jordan Hubbard] to stay outta those rooms; stay away from those excuses.  And so how do you--we need to find a way to let black youth know now that yeah, there's still issues and problems, but none that will limit you anymore; you can do anything you want, and go anywhere you want, you know.  You will not be stopped because of your race anymore; you won't, it simply cannot happen if you have the mind and will.  That's one of the things I would say.  The biggest problem we have is the family structure seems to me destroyed; respect for women, respect for life, black on black crime; yeah, it's horrible.  And as always, young black men are in trouble.  Now they're in trouble not only because of crime and drugs and jail, but they don't have a solid family structure anymore; they don't.  They don't even--you know, you used to be able to go on TV and find one (laughter) if you didn't have one.  We don't have anything on TV now but fools and idiots.  And they don't even have a hunger to know about the past.  They don't have a hunger to know what strong black families used to be and how important and significant it was.  I try to talk to my own kids about where they came from and their ancestry; you know it's not driven into them--the importance of it is not driven into them like it was into us, so they're pretty cavalier about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can't--there's some good things.  If you--you're in here with me, you think I'm a history-maker or whatever, but if you go and you look at the generations of black history-makers, the pioneers--like Wes, what I see is those guys went through a lot and so yes, they've arrived, but they have a lotta marks and bruises--scars actually.  If you sit down and you talk to Wes [Wesley Harris; Hubbard's Ph.D. advisor and mentor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachusetts], you will see some bitterness and hatred in him that is a little scary, but it's characteristic of that wave of brothers and women that had to deal with that; they all came out scarred like that.  And then you get the next generation--me, and you talk to me.  Well, quirky but--quirks and issues, but they don't have that hatred and that edge that Wes' generation needed.  They came through a little softer and a little more open.  And then when my sons' generation gets up there and they're the leaders of the world, I think they will have forgotten about all that stuff and they won't have scars due to that racism and that hatred; they just won't.  So you see it diminishing in each generation.  And I don't wanna keep it alive; I mean I wanna keep black history alive and black pride; I mean I'm amazed that I know all of the free people in my family which means that we went from my great, great grandmother Dotson [ph.] being a slave to her grand--great, great grandson being a professor (laughter), with a chair; that's a very short time for all that to happen.  So I don't buy into any of the failures of us; we're doing great, really great (laughter).  But I do have these concerns.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26453
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm on my soap box so I'll take my five minutes.  You know I've been here [University of Maryland, College Park] ten years now, back with students, and I sit in that class room every day and I have a deep concern, and it became so over-whelming I actually formed a class on this and here it is.  This generation, to me, is inheriting garbage from my generation; they got no health care, no chance of retirement, trillions of dollars in debt, I mean I could go on and on.  Senseless, mindless killing; it's what we're handing 'em.  And you know what?  I told my--I told a class this:  "We don't care."  You wanna know what I think?  I think I gotta find out where I'm gone pay this tuition for my three sons [James, Drew and Jordan Hubbard] right now; I'm not thinking about y'all.  Now.  The most corrupt congress that just simply won't do anything?  I could go on and on about what my generation is handing them for an inheritance.  They're strangely quiet.  You hear nothing from anybody; it's the most bizarre thing I've ever seen in my life.  I told my class, I said "When we were upset with the war, we threw lit bottles of wine up against the White House" (laughter), "and turned out in massive numbers."  When we got interested in drugs, we designed our own drugs and man did we get high.  When we decided that we were gonna settle down and do business, we became billionaires; you guys, you're just quiet, and you're inheriting a garbage can.  You're the first generation that's gonna be terribly worse off than the one before you, and you're quiet.  You're being taught in classrooms the same way people were taught a hundred years ago" (laughter); "nobody's talking about reform, and you're quiet.  I find that most disturbing and annoying."  That is the last thing I would say.  What, what's up with this generation?  They're quiet, and they're getting the worst of everything.

Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: By who?  My--if it's my wife [Adrienne Hubbard], just as a good father.  If it's by my sons [James, Drew, and Jordan Hubbard], as a dad, not as a professor or an engineer, just as a dad.  If it's by God, I just hope that he thinks that I made some people's lives a little better.  It's like a movie, you know?  I thank, thank him for the good and I'm sorry about the bad.  I don't really, I don't really care what the world thinks about me or what they remember about me 'cause whatever it is, it's gonna be wrong (laughter); it's irrelevant.  It is; it means nothing.  I use my time here to mentor; I use my time here to learn about God; that's what's so nice about engineering, you get to look through His eyes (laughter).  I use my time here to raise three boys in honor of my mother [Lillie Echols Hubbard] and my father [James Edward Hubbard, Sr.], and I hope that they--I hope each one of the Hubbard generations takes what's--take the good and propagates that, and I hope I've passed some of that on to them.  But I don't really care what the world thinks, I really don't--have no idea; I never tried to create anything for them to think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: All right.
