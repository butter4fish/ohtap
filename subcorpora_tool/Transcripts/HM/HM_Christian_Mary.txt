Story_ID: 578055
Speaker 1: Now if you will Dr. [HistoryMaker Mary T.] Christian let's talk a little bit about your mother starting with her name and where she was born and where she grew up and that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Okay my mother's maiden was Webster.  Her name is Viola Webster Robinson and she grew up in a little homestead on Lincoln Street, 273 Lincoln Street in Hampton [Virginia] a few blocks from where we live now.  My mother was a homemaker, she was one of the few of her age group that stayed at home most of the time and also she had-- she finished high school and was a very quiet, demure but articulate lady and everybody in the community called her Mom Vi [ph.], everybody old and young because she kept children in the community.  A that time salaries were low and young people who were just married having children and as soon as they could get back to work they brought their babies to Mom Vi (laugh).  So everybody called her Mom Vi because she just kept all of the neighborhood children and they would want to pay her and she said oh no wait till you get on your feet.  So she just kept children and was a neighborhood icon whose name was Mom Vi.
Speaker 1: And did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her growing up as a young girl?
Speaker 2: Yes she did.  We didn't have the sense of genealogy at that time growing up as we have now and we often sit back and say oh we wish we had this but you never think of your mother leaving you, you think they are going to be there all the time.  But she did tell us about her, her family and we had two ministers in the family and she would tell us about the ministers and one who was really a keen dresser and she would tell us that all the ladies just loved him.  He didn't have a church but he would preach for funerals and weddings and at different times he was asked to preach.  She had two brothers and there were two sisters and two brothers all of whom are now deceased and my mother's sister's name was Lillian [ph.] and they were very, very opposite.  My mother was very quiet and a little tempered person and Aunt Lilly was very gragacious [ph.] and exuberant and full of life they were just two opposites.  But we'd have the family get-togethers especially Christmas and my Aunt Lillian was from New York and she would come down and when we had the celebrations she'd put on her satin hat and she would do songs and dances like choreographers right up until her eighties she still would do--we'd look forward to her dance every Christmas morning.  So mother as I say was a very quiet person but she was very, very kind and she would do anything for anybody even though she didn't have a lot there was always an extra plate at the table and she would call in the neighbors, she would take food and gifts to neighbors who were sick and who were older than she.  So she was really like a guardian angel kind of mother.
Story_ID: 578056
Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker Mary T.] Christian let's talk a little bit about your father starting (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now my father's story, now that's a different story. My father (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Please share his name with us first.
Speaker 2: Okay. His name was John Robinson and my dad would be what you would call now one of the old storytellers and he would tell us--everybody would gather around and listen to John's stories.  He would tell the story about the bull and anytime anybody came, "John tell us about the bull," and he would tell us about how he defeated the bull and the bull fell over the mountains.  Half of the time as children, we didn't know which were stories and which were true and of course, he danced with [Bill] Bojangles [Robinson] and he told us all about when they danced together until Bojangles age was given and then he said--I'd say, "Dad John you said you're not that old," and we never knew how old he really was.  He'd say, "Oh I meant to say I was a little, teeny boy when I danced with him (laughter)."  But he organized, in fact Willie Mays-- he was very, very into sports and promoting young black athletes.  In fact, Willie Mays played for him at the time we had what was called a Negro League of Hampton [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Your father did?
Speaker 2: My father did.  What was so interesting about my father is the fact that he could not read or write and we had no idea and my mother [Viola Webster Robinson] didn't tell us.  So we wondered how when we found out he couldn't read or write, we wondered how he was a foreman in the coal mine in West Virginia when she met him.  So Mom Vi [ph.] at that time she thought it was a stigma and when I had a radio interview and a newspaper interview and I said my dad couldn't read or write and Mom Vi would say, "Lucy [ph.] why would you always have to say your dad couldn't read or write?"  I said, because I'm proud of that, he raised four children, sent them all to college, and was a foreman and so he finally told us how he did it.  Everybody in his crew had a symbol, he gave everybody a symbol a leaf, a pear, an orange and he had a really, I guess a photostatic memory.  So he had about twenty-two people in his crew and each of them had a symbol and he was brilliant in mathematics.  He could just count, he couldn't read or write but any calculation at all he was ready to do it.  So what he did, he kept the hours for everybody and he would tell his workers now you are a pear don't tell anybody what your symbol is, don't tell anybody how much you made because you may make more and so forth.  So nobody in his group knew that he couldn't read or write.  So he remembered the symbols and the names and he put down the hours and so he received an award, you know, for having had one year without any mistakes in calculations and paychecks for his people.  So we thought that was remarkable.  He had a great sense of humor--
Story_ID: 578057
Speaker 1: And unfortunately he [Christian's father, John Robinson], he really even in his speaking you would not know it but he was concerned then really about English and I can remember when we were talking about black English, et cetera, et cetera.  People during my time were very, very into making us speak correctly and so forth and I remember my dad and I said--I can always remember I said, "She ain't got my, she ain't got my," something, I can't remember what the exact sentence was but I remember saying well she ain't got it and my dad said, "[HistoryMaker] Mary [T. Christian] don't say ain't 'cause tain't right" (laughter).  So I always remember that even though it was tain't, he knew ain't was not the right word.  He, he certainly was, he was a business person, he had a little shop, sold papers, he did all of that and he joined the Crusaders Male Chorus at Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] then under the late Mr. Charles [H.] Flax and these were a group of men from professional, laymen all and they were singing and this is where we really learned he had a photostatic memory so, and at that time we didn't know he couldn't read or write.  So he would call us to do the music for them and I'll never forget this song was 'No Man is an Island, No Man Stands Alone' [sic. 'No Man is an Island'] and he would tell us, he say, "I can remember better when you say it and then I say it after you," still not knowing and so we would read it and he would say it after us.  So we didn't know when we were saying it after--he would say it after, he was really committing it to memory.  He knew every song in the repertoire, well this particular day when I handed him the music to read it and I noted that he was reading it and it was upside down and he was reading all the words and I said to my sister you notice that page is upside down so Daddy John, we called him Daddy John because he was the same way to children and people as Mom Vi [ph.] so they were Daddy John and Mom Vi. And so that's when we approached my mother [Viola Webster Robinson], I said, Mom Vi, Daddy John had his paper upside down and he was reading, he knew all the words but it was upside down and that's when she told us the whole story about the coal mine and how she didn't know it until they went to get married (laughter) but she never told us and then it was all in the open.  But we never let him know that we knew and then we started teaching him how to write his name because he'd always sign with an X.  And before he-- but he was so brilliant that had he had probably one year of quote "schooling" that he really would have been an educational genius, he was just that bright.
Story_ID: 578058
Speaker 1: Did he [Christian's father, John Robinson] ever share any stories with you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh my goodness gracious.
Speaker 1: --about the Negro baseball team?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah well, during that time we were very tiny and he would have--it was a little before time when people really were not that concerned.   Many of the men in the neighborhood would go to the games, it was an old baseball park up on Shell Road [Hampton, Virginia] and he had the lot cleaned and set up for baseball.  One other player went on to the big leagues at the time when he was there.  He would have the whole team and mother [Viola Webster Robinson] would cook for them, he'd bring all his baseball players home to eat.  He just had them enthralled because they would sit all around and listen to my dad tell his tales.  So, you know, we learned, as I say we didn't know which was fact and which was fiction so we'd all come up and say now which is this, fact or fiction.  He had a way of saying when he told these stories so that became a part of the ritual, he'd look over at mama, "Ain't that right Vi [ph.]," he'd say, "ain't that right Vi?" and my mother would always say, "yes, John," (laughter).  "Telling the truth Vi?"  "Yes, John," and she would kind of laugh.  We all knew that was one of his tales.  He passed first and then mother would share with us some of the stories and I said, "Mother, do you really know when he asked you?" She said, "No, but I just said, 'yes John.'" "Is that right Vi?"  "Yes, John."
Story_ID: 578059
Speaker 1: We had happy memories, we were poor but we didn't know it at that time we did not know we were poor and at the time during high school [George P. Phenix High School, Hampton, Virginia] I was selected to be Miss Phenix during homecoming and it was a neighborhood thing.  We didn't really have money and usually the high school people were at the time we came, those who had light skinned, long hair, et cetera.  So I think I was in the history being the first brown skinned or dark person who had been Miss Homecoming.  So when I got home it was news to the whole community and I remember a neighbor across the street, Miss Northcott [ph.] was a seamstress and my grandmother [Mary Robinson] went to the store and bought a piece of fabric and our colors were maroon and gray.  So she bought the blouse and somebody else bought the gray to make me a jumper, it was a little jumper dress and then we had to have shoes so there's a Jewish place in Newport News [Virginia].  Well I had--it was something like a five (unclear) and in those days the people would say, oh she's got white folks' feet, 'cause black folks didn't wear (unclear) and triple and so forth.  So in the meantime, in order--because I couldn't go to the store that would have (unclear), triples and so forth, double A and so forth, I always got shoes that one size too small and I had to hold my feet up in order to keep my feet in the shoe 'cause I always had slender, small feet.  So I remember I got a size four but they were maroon, suede shoes with a little hole in the wedges and I had a gray hat and my neighbor put the band on, somebody else made the little flower and when I stepped out, you would have not have thought I didn't step out of Vogue.  It was all put together clothes and all the neighbors and we had a parade of course and all my neighbors--they all had a part in dressing me up and that's what the neighborhood was like.  It was a sharing and everybody's child was everybody else's child in the neighborhood.  Everybody knew everybody else and as small children, we would go to the various houses, "Go see how Miss Molly's [ph.] doing this morning, see if she needs something," and that's just how we grew up.  And I think when people say you're just like your mother [Viola Webster Robinson] people say you're always so giving; I got it from my mom.  But she didn't have much she was always giving of everything that she had.
Story_ID: 578060
Speaker 1: Now how far back can you trace your ancestors?  Do you know if your people came from slaves or were they free people, how far back can you trace?
Speaker 2: Well that is one of the things that I was supposed to be doing upon my retirement.  I've already joined the genealogy club and haven't gotten there yet 'cause I haven't reached the R-E in retirement; I'm still doing all of these things. And I really don't-- my dad [John Robinson] said he was from the Indian [Native American] tribe, he said I'm Mohawk Indian and we have not traced that.  My mother's [Viola Webster Robinson] people we could trace back three generations.  My grandmother was a slave.  She was a mulatto slave because a picture was in there and we asked was that somebody you all worked for because they worked for whites in the kitchen as domestics during that time.  They would say no that's your great-grandmother.  So she was the daughter of a slave but certainly one of a mixed race.  So we had three generations from slavery but Uncle Benny [ph.] was another person who was just out of slavery and like now, we would treasure his stories but we just didn't at that time, know how we'd like to do it.  So that's one of my goals for my retirement is to trace genealogy, get my family tree in order.
Speaker 1: Now let's talk a little bit about your grandparents starting with your maternal grandparents, your grandparents on your mother's side.  Can you tell us their names and what they were like and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well on my father's side, we never knew my grandparents.  I can barely remember, her name was Nanny [ph.] and we knew Mom Nanny.  I can only remember when she died because during those days they brought the bodies to the house and I remember them taking the window out to put the body in and I was too small to really remember a lot about it.  Unfortunately we never really talked about it except my grandfather [John Robinson, Sr.] was a minister.  They would take out the colorful parts of it and the other part of it they sort of kept to themselves.  Like one of them would always hit the bottle too much but my mom wouldn't let my aunt tell us about that. She would say, y'all hush. They still had such high morals and we were grown, grown and married but she--anything that looked like it was sordid or anything, looked like it was--Aunt Lil [Lillian (ph.)] was just the opposite, she was ready to tell us anything.  So I don't know much about my, my grandparents.  I remember my dad's mother and she was named Mary Robinson, I was named after her and she was, I guess she must have been ninety-five or more.
Story_ID: 578061
Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker Mary T.] Christian if you will please share with us your earliest memory of growing up?  What's your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness, well my earliest memory growing up I think was, it was in high school.  I-- during my childhood at the time I went to school if you could read very well, you were skipped from one grade to the other.  So I went to school a year ahead because I went to kindergarten and a lady named Ms. Violet [ph.] taught me to read and I was doing the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm and all of that and my great aunt who reared me after my mom [Viola Webster Robinson] moved to the other house, I stayed with her and that was our birth place on Lincoln Street [Hampton, Virginia] and she would parade me up and down the street.  I did a lot of recitations of poems and stories and so forth.  So I went to school, I was really two years ahead of myself because I went one year earlier and I was skipped to the second grade and so I got to the fifth grade and I was still the smallest person in the class.  And I can remember Mrs. Broadfield [ph.] was the teacher.  It was right around Christmastime and they were giving their experiences about Santa Claus and so she said--we were talking about Santa Claus and how we used to think and somebody was pointing at me and she said which one are you pointing at and she said everybody knows--[HistoryMaker] Mary [T. Christian] don't you know who Santa Claus is and I said yes ma'am, he is a big fat man, I'm in fifth grade, a big fat man with a white beard and big tummy that shook like jelly and the class roared.  And I was never-- so when I had to ever counsel parents and children my grade to skip, never skip because you're chronological age and your social experiences is far below.  So I was just so devastated about that, that I repeated the fifth grade, I just would not do anything.  I wanted to be with my peers and so forth.  So I think I started growing up during that time but when I was a freshman at [George P.] Phenix [High] School [Hampton, Virginia] that was when I think I really knew that I was growing up and I was in the choir.  I was always tiny and very skinny and I didn't want to wear silk hose because in the choir you had to wear silk hose.  So I dreaded it, I was so much younger than the others and small in stature.  Had I been larger, I wouldn't have been so much aware of it.  My growing up days were--when I first started growing up and I was in my older sister-- the same grade with my oldest sister [Lillian Robinson] and peers.  So my growing up days were not as happy as theirs because I was always very ashamed of my size and everybody would say little Mary.  I just remember those days when I was in--my dad [John Robinson] called me when we were growing up, string bean and those were the names that stood out in my mind.  I remember when I was going to high school and all of the people were developing and so forth. On little story. So at that time people had their Sunday clothes on and my mom had one pair of silk stockings and we had to dress up that day and I took my mom's silk stockings and I tucked them down to make them look like (unclear) and so I actually forgot to put them back. So this Sunday morning, my mother said, "Where are my-- who has seen my silk stockings," and I had the silk stockings and I had fabricated to make myself look like I was older than I was.  So I had to share that I had my mom's silk stockings and also when we went to get weighed at school, in high school and all of the children-I didn't weigh but like seventy pounds and everybody else weighed about 110 and so forth.  So this particular day when we had to go to the weight room, I got violently ill and so they had to take me to the clinic.  I was just so sick because I didn't want--they call out your weight after you lined up and they call out your weight.  They would say Lillian, Lillian Brown [ph.], 110 so and so, Mary Robinson sixty-two pounds and everybody broke out laughing.  So I learned how to get ill when that happened and then they had to weigh me separately.  So it was coming up that I always had this-- I always wanted to--I would always say oh God if I could just have enough hips to wear a girdle. Now I wish I didn't-- but that was what my growing up years were and then when I found out people accepted me, I think I was in the National Honor Society and then I was Miss Homecoming so I had arrived because people had accepted me and then my early growing up days were much more comfortable but I just had that.
Story_ID: 578062
Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker Mary T.] Christian let me ask you to please give your siblings' names and their birth order including yourself?
Speaker 2: Okay. There were five children in the family and my oldest sister whose name is Lillian Robinson now deceased just about five years ago.  I was the second born and of course I married and the third born was Viola Robinson Brown who now resides in Richmond [Virginia].  The fourth born was my brother, John Robinson named after my father [John Robinson], he's also deceased and John went to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and he was a lawyer.  So my dad always had these high aspirations for us and then my baby sister whose name is Madeline Robinson Lee, she is now in Cambria, California and she just visited here and her daughter stays next door to me.  So we were five, one boy, four girls in our family.
Story_ID: 578063
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about the name of the street that you lived on and just kind of describe it for us and what you can (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Well I lived on Lincoln Street [Hampton, Virginia] and I wish I had a poem.  One of my colleagues really one of my students wrote a poem on the passing of Lincoln Street because it was a street at that time--later has been what we call redevelopment.  So the city took the street, made apartments and so forth.  But Lincoln Street was one of the, I would say most respectful--in terms of prestige, if you lived on Lincoln Street, you know, you're arrived.  I mean all the old houses, people had gardens, people had--grew their own flowers, they had chickens in their yard and as I said before everybody knew everybody else.  One of the other things I think unique about Lincoln Street and also many of the streets in Hampton [Virginia] the teachers, the school teachers lived in your same neighborhood and your school teachers were also your Sunday school teachers.  So the church was really an extension of the home.  So we had teachers living on Lincoln Street.  My pastor, Reverend [James Waddell] Patterson when I got converted and was baptized under, lived on the upper end of Lincoln Street.  So people were not stratified like now living in a ritzy neighborhood as you see I'm still in my own neighborhood.  This is what my father [John Robinson] gave me so I had moved Farmington [Hampton, Virginia] on the water and so forth.  Lincoln Street everybody lived together and I think that was really a plus because Sunday school was extensions of your daily living and also neighbors took all of the responsibility on Lincoln Street and we could name everybody and everybody was either cousins or uncle, aunt or uncles.  You always had a handle on everybody's name when we lived on Lincoln Street.  One story there was a little street, a lady named Mrs. Cherry [ph.] and she always would tell on us if we stayed out after six o'clock or any little thing she would see us doing.  So she would tell on us, so this particular day a group of us got together and we went under her window and we would say, "Oh Ms. Cherry, black as a berry," and black wasn't beautiful then in my day, okay (laughter).  "Sitting in her chair with her store bought hair," my goodness we chanted that outside and then we all ran but somebody told my mother [Viola Webster Robinson] and the neighbors came and they got us.  "Who is that that's been talking about Ms. Cherry?"  All of the kids said, "[HistoryMaker] Mary [T. Christian] told us the verse," and it was me so I go into trouble.  But any child that did anything on that street, they had the license and the authority and if they want to tan them, they could or they'd bring them home and let you know and you got what was due.
Story_ID: 578064
Speaker 1: What sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights, let's see well I imagine still what's left of Lincoln Street [Hampton, Virginia] in terms of sights and let me see about sounds.  I guess I can remember but we don't have them now except when I go to Bluebird Gap Farm [Hampton, Virginia] but sounds that I can remember are the chickens and the roosters, cocka-doodle-doo.  Wake up early in the morning so the sounds of roosters sort of awakened us in the morning, we all got up.  And smells is my mom's [Viola Webster Robinson] cooking (laughter).  She had--she was just a great cook and even though after time when many of the foods that we eat now have become delicacies and folks used to say, oh my, you're eating high on the hog today.  I never knew what that meant but I knew that food came from the hog and the higher up it was, the more expensive it was but they would eat pig feet and chitterlings, they were "chitlins" then but now they're "chitterlings" and they cost you money.
Story_ID: 578065
Speaker 1: We talked a little bit about your elementary school years but what was the name of the elementary school and who were some of your teachers there?
Speaker 2: Okay, the elementary school I attended was Union [Elementary] School [Hampton, Virginia] and of course they were all neighborhood schools then because they were all segregated and the schools in black neighborhoods were central to whatever the particular neighborhood and of course I walked to school every morning.  My first grade teacher lived up the street from me, Mrs. Keaton [ph.] was my second grade teacher, Mrs. Bright [ph.] was my first grade teacher and Mrs. Hobson [ph.] was my sixth grade teacher.  At the time we did not have junior high school, we went seven grades and then to high school during the time I went to school.  So my school days were usually very happy and as I pointed out, I couldn't wait until school ended and then I'd go play with my peers, the other kids were beyond playing hop scotch and things like I was playing.  But one of the situations that I remember during my elementary school days and I guess I took after my father [John Robinson] with the memory.  So we had to try out for Snow White and the Princess.  They gave us our parts to go home and my friend whose name was Margaret [ph.].  Margaret was very, very fair with long curly hair, of course and so we went to do try outs for the play.  I had memorized every bit of it, all of it not just the part she asked me, I just went through the whole play and everybody just knew Mary's [HistoryMaker Mary T. Christian] got the part, and guess who got the part, Margaret got the part.  Because I could not be a princess and not be light skinned with long hair.  So even in those days as a carryover from tradition of the people who were in the big house who were fathered by the masters and so forth, they got special treatment.  Well during the earlier days, we found that among our own race and if you would look in yearbooks--the Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] yearbook, I started looking at it and thinking about all the professional men--the doctors and the lawyers they all had very fair skinned wives and even at Hampton I could tell in the '60s [1960s] and Malcolm [X] and the black is beautiful.  I was at Hampton when the first brown or dark skinned person was crowned Miss Hampton and I started just looking back into all of the earlier years and you found all the queens were very, very fair.  So it happened really right in our face.  But that was the most time I was really, really hurt in elementary school and then of course the teacher tried to give me some more things in the calls but I could never get on stage.  I laugh about it now but I say we were about the only ones who had segregated ourselves through color and class and so forth.  But on the whole I had a really happy childhood.
Speaker 1: As a young girl in elementary school did you have dreams and aspirations at that time?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be an actress (laughter) that was my dream and aspiration and because of the fact that I knew all of these plays, I knew the poems and everything and everybody would say this girl is going to be an actress and during that time I was in all of the plays at church.  I was always a little angel and I knew all of the long parts and so I grew up wanting to be an actress and most people say oh she's really going to be good.  So this is a connect when I grew up I started directing plays at my school.  I'm getting ahead of the story but it was a connection with the acting dream that I had but since I couldn't be one, I directed all the plays at school.  I did all the early morning Easter dramas at my church so I directed sometimes, I acted in them and when I went to Columbia [University, New York, New York] to do my master's [degree], that's another story but I also took speech and drama.
Story_ID: 578066
Speaker 1: --You mentioned church.  What were your family's experiences like in church?
Speaker 2: Every Sunday church.  Sunday school first and church after we--about eleven or twelve we were converted baptized and church on Sunday and six o'clock service BTU [Baptist Training Union], we call it BYPU, Baptist youth training union [sic. Baptist Young People's Union of America] I later found out, all we knew was BYPU.  So we went three times a day to church, my family.  We just knew it was--that was--it was no change at all in church and I participated in church as a missionary and we washed the communion glasses.  As a child we belong to this little club and we washed the communion glasses after communion and we set it up for communion.  Also I directed a children's choir that went on tours and concerts and so forth.  So I'm a fifty year plus member of my church and now I'm chair of the constitution committee, we are rewriting the constitution, a member of the Christian fellowship choir and a member of the women's auxiliary.  So I have about four church affiliations now but it stemmed from the time I was very young.  We were brought up in the church.
Story_ID: 578067
Speaker 1: I know that you said that you didn't go to junior high school but during that time, during the early teen years who was influencing you and who were some of your friends and that kind of thing during that time in your life?
Speaker 2: During that time in my life as far as I can remember, the only people that I really knew about in terms of black role models were writers and poets and Phillis Wheatley I remember reading her poems and I would say that I wanted to write poetry and Dorothy Dandridge with her shoes and acting.  But I portrayed that and during that time an aspiration but we didn't learn a lot about our people except for at that time Negro History Week [Black History Month].  But they poured it all in that one week and with some more smatterings but even the black schools were Negro History Week and we didn't learn a lot about our contributions.  It was not an integrated curriculum at all.  So we didn't have like children now would have [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], Malcolm X.  We didn't have--most of my heroes were Langston Hughes, writers.
Speaker 1: And who were some of your friends?
Speaker 2: My friends were all neighborhood friends it expanded when I went to high school and there's an area over across the bridge, we had to walk to school, we had to walk because we passed Hampton High [School, Hampton, Virginia] which was right near us because that was an all-white school and we walked across a whole bridge over to where Hampton University [Hampton Institute, Hampton, Virginia] is now and George P. Phenix [High School, Hampton, Virginia] which now still stands.  So were elementary up through seventh grade and as I was saying, I didn't kind of grow up until I got to be a freshman, a sophomore in high school.
Speaker 1: And what were your high school years like?
Speaker 2: My high school years were--after I got over my complex of being the youngest in the class, I had a very interesting and I think very happy high school years.  I always as you say read well so I was in the National Honor Society and I played basketball and could never play tennis because they say my wrist was too skinny.  I couldn't hold a racquet, I wanted to play tennis but I ran track and I was pretty good at track, I was pretty good at basketball and I was in the drama club, of course.  I was in the debate club and elected to the National Honor Society.  We just, you know, we just had--we sorted quote unquote say we would hang together by neighborhood groups.
Speaker 1: And did you still have your same dreams and aspirations when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah I still had my same dreams and aspirations when I was in high school.
Story_ID: 578068
Speaker 1: What were you thinking about college?  What were your thoughts about college?
Speaker 2: Well during the time I--during the high school [George P. Phenix High School, Hampton, Virginia] time going back a little bit into my life when I finished high school and at that time you had to be eighteen to go to college so I couldn't-- I was too young 'cause I was still two years ahead.  So during that time and it was just before the wartime and I fell in love and got married.  So that drowned out my college, I said okay I don't want to go to college anyway, I'm going to be a housewife and mother and so forth.  I had my two children and well that was right after, I don't want to get too much ahead of the story but during that time I still, when I finished high school, I still had aspirations to go to college and then I wanted to go into drama and then become an actress and win the Academy Award (laughter).  That was always one of my dreams and aspirations.
Speaker 1: So after high school you decided to get married (simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that was during the war [World War II, WWII], my husband was in the [U.S.] Navy then, I had two children at that time and we were both too young to know anything about anything so it didn't last.  And when I get into now the part of my life that after having divorced, I still was at home, I had a family that would say to me, go on and do what you want to do we'll take care of the children.
Speaker 1: And how old were you at this time?
Speaker 2: About nineteen and so I had worked at various jobs which I didn't put there Langley Field [Langley Air Force Base, Virginia] cafeteria and we had a black theater and I was a receptionist at the theater, cashier at the theater and then I went to HU [Hampton University; Hampton Institute, Hampton, Virginia] but then it was Hampton Institute and worked in the laundry.  So in working in the laundry again there were two or three of us early marriages folks, we got to work on the campus and there was a lady and all of the older people on campus would ask me to represent them on the unions and all the things 'cause having had a high school education and being fairly bright.  Most of the older people didn't have a high school education.  This one person who I did an eulogy for a couple of weeks ago would say when the professors would come in they would say, "We have a little girl in here named Bootsie [HistoryMaker Mary T. Christian]," name Bootsie they call me, and, "she doesn't belong in this laundry, she needs to go to college."  And every professor that would come in there she would tell them the same story.
Story_ID: 578069
Speaker 1: --Can I go back to my childhood?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: To something that is important. When I lived with my Aunt Delia [ph.] and she took in washing and ironing, she was a wash woman and that's how she had money to buy my clothes and so forth.  When I was a child and this had a profound effect on me, when I was a child she would take me to Mrs. Schuyler [ph.] house who was a white family that she worked for and they had a daughter named Amy [ph.] who was my age and Amy and I would play together and Aunt Delia would wash and iron the clothes.  But she taught me how to iron too because sometimes I would help her.  She would give me some of the flat pieces.  So this particular day when we went and little Amy said to her, "Delia bring my clothes to me."  I thought about that and I said Delia and I heard my Aunt Delia say, "Yes Ms. Amy," and I said, "why are you letting her call you Delia?  You always tell us we have to have a handle on everybody's name.  Why are you letting her call you and why are you calling her Miss, and she's the same age as I am?"  I remember her telling me don't worry about it.  I said, I'm going to mess all these clothes up that I ironed and she said, "No, I'm ironing these clothes for you now so that you won't have to do it tomorrow.  But whatever you do, you do it well."  So you iron those clothes like you have always been ironing them but it always stuck in mind.  That was the first time and I realized what racism was and what our position was even though--and I loved her, she was a respectful, beautiful lady and to think this little child was calling her by her name and that stuck with me all the way.  She said I'm washing these clothes for you today so that you won't have to wash them and I always remember that.  That's a part of my childhood (laughter) I thought it was important (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thank you.
Speaker 1: -- to back and the connection came in the laundry [at Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] because I knew how to iron and they graduated me to special shirts.
Story_ID: 578070
Speaker 1: So when this professor, Cooper, Mr. Cooper, William Mason Cooper for whom a school is named, the first school named after a black living person and he was also the first member of the Hampton School Board.  When he came in he saw me and she transported me up again and at the time it was vacation time and his secretary well during that time I went to take courses and I took typing courses.
Speaker 2: At Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 1: At Hampton, I was in the laundry still and I would spend my afternoons--my lunch hour taking typing courses because the one upward mobility job we had at Langley [Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia] NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] was only African Americans they had them in typing positions which you had to do at least eighty or ninety words a minute.  So anyway I took typing and he let me substitute because his major secretary had gone on vacation.  So I did my typing 'cause I knew how to do the typing and in the meantime, one of the--(unclear) Walker [ph.] who was getting a master's degree had me to do her thesis and I didn't know a thing about all those charts and graphs.  I prayed through it, I cried through it and she turned it in.  He asked who typed her paper well you are supposed to be on their approved list and she said this person is not on the approved list but there was not an error anywhere and he said what's the name of this person because I want to put them on the approved list.  So that happened to be, you know Mary Taylor [HistoryMaker Mary T. Christian] at the time.  So I want put on the approved list and they gave me a job in the registrar's office.  So when I worked for three years in the registrar's office--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: What years were these Dr. Christian?
Speaker 1: That must have been in the (unclear) that would have been in early '50s [1950s], late '40s [1940s] and early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I left the laundry after I worked filling in for various persons who were on vacation.  He said, "Well, you know, you're doing so well" and I was still taking classes and so anyway I remember he sent my name down to be a permanent secretary and prior to this Mr. Cooper--we had summer school people from all over the country came.  So I did all his personal letters.  He had received a citation from the president's office saying that the letter, everything was so great he commended him.  So anyway when he sent my name down among the ones to be considered for permanent secretary the president who was Dr. Alonzo [G.] Maron, the first black president wrote back, and said, "Well I don't see how we can a person who has just come out of the laundry to have a professional position," and Mr. Cooper wrote back and said the commendation that you wrote me for having all this perfect correspondence was done by this person.  So of course he gave me a job.  So I went to school and they kept pushing me to go on to school and when I went to Mr. Cooper's after I had gotten my typing and finished all of my typing courses, so I went to him and I said, "Mr. Cooper I'm going to be leaving because I think I can pass the test at Langley and I like here but I have children to support and we do get more money."  So he said, "Don't do that."  I said, "I know I can pass the test" and he said, "I know you would pass the test and if you pass that test, that's where you stay for the rest of your life but I see other potential, go see Dr. Eva C. Mitchell."  So I went to see Dr. Eva C. Mitchell and I said, "Mr. Cooper sent me" and she said, "Well let's see if we can get you a scholarship."  So I went at six in the mornings and worked from six to eight--six to nine.  I took my class at nine and every semester I'd add on a couple of classes until I got enough to do student teaching and that's when she said I wouldn't be able to go to school.  So she made certain that I got a scholarship for my last year at school and I went did student teaching and I graduated from Hampton Institute with the highest honors.  Even though I went to school at six a.m. in the morning, did all my class work, worked in the office until five and then went to class and I worked two hours usually till nine o'clock because I made up every hour.  I didn't go home and Mr. Cooper said, "You don't have to make up every hour" but I said, "You've been kind enough to let me do this so I'm going to work and I'm going to get home at nine or ten and do my studying" and still made it.
Speaker 2: And you graduated, you earned your bachelor's [degree] (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Bachelors of science degree.
Speaker 2: In education?
Speaker 1: In education.
Speaker 2: And what happened to that dream of becoming an actress at that time?
Speaker 1: Well that time I had put the actress on hold because it was unrealistic and we didn't have but one or two black actresses and so forth.  So I put that on hold and I wanted to really be a teacher because during that time I had worked with children and I had the little choirs and I had really gotten a knack for working well with children and so forth so I wanted to be a teacher.  So when I finished and went to elementary school to teach, I did all my acting with my drama class with my children so I was fulfilling my dream through the children.
Story_ID: 578071
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this Dr. [HistoryMaker Mary T.] Christian--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was it like being a single, working mother in the late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s]--mid to late '40s [1940s] early '50s [1950s]?  What was that like, back then for you?
Speaker 2: Well it was, I guess it was--during that time I was lucky because I was still living at home.  So I didn't have to worry about paying rent or mortgage even though I would just help out in the home and at that time we were not as conscious--race conscious.  We knew that there were white schools and there were black schools.  We knew there quote unquote black jobs and white jobs and during those earlier times we just took those things for granted.  It was a way of life.  I know at that time earlier and it was right after I had that experience with little Miss Amy [ph.] that I started making Christmas cards with black faces and so forth but it was not this consciousness, it was a way of life.  So I was in my job as a theater cashier which was like kind of expected for us not to be in the kitchen scrubbing and so forth and in the earlier times, as I said, our society was a very close knit society.  The black night clubs, we had them--we had Duke Ellington coming to Hampton University [Hampton Institute, Hampton, Virginia] and Fats Waller would come to the clubs we had.  So before integration we had our own life that was entertainment and so forth.  It was a little bit hard when we would go to apply for higher paying jobs and segregation was certainly rampant at that time.
Speaker 1: Do you think being a single mother during the time when you were a single working mother, how does that compare with the plight of single working mothers today?
Speaker 2: I think it's quite a difference in that number one, I was a young single mother it's true but I told you about, you know Hillary [Rodham Clinton] popularized "it takes a village," but during that time most of the young single mothers, it takes a village and as I also told you my mom [Viola Webster Robinson] helped single mothers by just keeping their children and it really was not as blatant segregation, wasn't any blatant--drugs were almost unheard of.  Especially when you see an old gentleman who may have, Mom Vi [ph.] said, "Had a little too much tea.  Go walk him home."  And, and, and we could leave doors open and it just was a different kind of community and today many single mothers--there was no such thing then as welfare you did well by working.  So now we have a very, very different--one of the things I'm dealing with or trying to work with now and I work with mothers teaching on welfare, teaching parenting skills and many of them are having children earlier, haven't had parenting themselves so how can they be parents to other children.  So I think that the young mothers and those who have had the benefit of a family, who was a nurturing family who would say, "You can do this and you will do this," and I think there is a difference in the young single mothers today; just the general environment which at my age was so supportive.
Story_ID: 578072
Speaker 1: So Dr. [HistoryMaker Mary T.] Christian after you earned your bachelor of science degree from Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] you began teaching and what was it like teaching in the mid to late '50s [1950s] in Hampton, Virginia?
Speaker 2: It was wonderful, it was a black school [Aberdeen Elementary School, Hampton, Virginia].  Mr. Owens [ph.] who is Dr. Owens who is the principal now deceased.  It was a small school, parents were all--I guess you would call it today a magnet school or a charter school.  In the Aberdeen [Gardens, Hampton, Virginia] community which is now listed as a historical spot and state history and I had the good fortune of--I did my student teaching there plus I was older than everybody but when I went in the classroom but at that time I looked younger than my age so nobody even knew any different.  I went through sororities and all of that just like the younger kids did.  So anyway school I enjoyed my teaching, I worked hard, I would go to school and teach like seven in the morning and there was a teacher at another school who lived next door to me and my folks would say, "Why is it that Ms. Smith [ph.] comes home every day at 3:30 and you're getting here seven to eight o'clock?"  It was because I was teaching the drama kids, I was doing choirs and it was just a wonderful experience and my mentor and teacher, Dr. Eva C. Mitchell was still the supervising teacher and I had student teachers.  I did my student teaching there then I had student teachers and so she came to me and said, "Now my dear not that you've finished school you must go on and get your master's [degree]."  I said, "Dr. Mitchell I can't--I'm just paying."  Okay at that time in the State of Virginia paid you because we were not to go to UVA [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] or [College of] William and Mary [Williamsburg, Virginia].  So all we had to say is that you're not offering that course at one of the universities.  So they paid my airfare, your tuition, your board, lodging and you didn't even have to turn in a receipt you just go.  So Dr. Mitchell said, "Integration is coming and they're going to cut out them scholarships," you better go.  So I went to Columbia [University, New York, New York] because my sister was an [U.S.] Army wife and she lived in New York [New York] so I could live with her and so my dream again.  So everybody was taken reading or guidance, not [HistoryMaker] Mary [T. Christian], I go in speech and drama (laughter).  So the first thing they did, they gave me a test to see where my placement was going to be.  They gave me an IQ test and a test in my major.  Well blessed goodness I didn't know any of the vocabulary terms or anything in my major and I said oh my God, I'm going to look like a--illiterate almost.  The whole thing in speech I knew just the generic speech but in my IQ test I made a high score.  So I went to the professor, Dr. Caselica [ph.], I'll always remember him and he said, "I'm looking at your test scores here," I said, "oh, my God." He said, "But you know what this one here shows that you have the ability and this one here shows you just haven't had--are you sure you want to stay in speech and drama?"  I said, "Well I could go into reading or counseling," I said, "but I really love it and I want to do it because I've been doing this and I want to really know how to do it professionally."  He said, "Okay, we'll give you a try."
Story_ID: 578073
Speaker 1: So Dr. [HistoryMaker Mary T.] Christian you did have one story you wanted to share with us while you were at Columbia [University, New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, when I was at Columbia and I was in the speech and drama without a speech and drama background.  So there are several things that happened.  First of all when I was doing my speech you had a person sitting in the audience and we had to do a spontaneous speech.  There were certain things that asked us that we were supposed to involve the vocabulary of the major we had which I didn't know the vocabulary, I glanced at the word and I learned from this and they were all sitting all white, no black, and there was one nun and I say these things because I learned lessons from them that when somebody is speaking--the speaker always tries to have a very relaxed smile.  I was getting ready to run from the podium because I was nervous, I was upset, I didn't know the vocabulary and they sat like this.  There was one nun sitting all the way in the back and she said (gestures shaking head) as if to say come on honey.  I started speaking and she smiled and I smiled and I got through it and I was placed again in advance class and I didn't have any background.  So the one experience that I really wanted to tell you about, we were Kabuki theater and this was making crafts all for this theater.  It was a Japanese theater so things would be flying through the air and everything and we had a professor who was very temperamental genius, and he used expletives and we're getting to the end of it and he had to have this thing done by the next day, the play was going to be opening.  So I'm on the stage, I'm working and I'm just doing the thing and he said, "Mary bring those black legs over here."  I looked at him and I know what I was going to say, I'm the only one on the stage, I'm the only African American and he said, "Didn't I tell you to bring them damn black legs on over here and in a hurry."  I froze and then one of my colleagues said, "Black legs that's his way of saying logs down there, they're not black."  I grabbed them and I said, "Okay I'm coming (laughter)."  I didn't know the terminology so I had to bring the logs back so I got the logs.  So we were doing--in the class we were doing [William] Shakespeare and Desdemona and there was going to be a love scene so we had to learn improvisation.  So here again I'm the only black one and so every time we'd get to do the scene, I'd get--and the guys would have to choose their mate, it's a love scene and you've got to make love, right?   There was no black man in there for me to make love with.  So I sneezed and I ran out.  The next day we hadn't gotten down to it and then I got a coughing spell just about time.  So I coughed until everybody had selected their partners.  So the third day, we're getting down to the wire and this guy came over to me and said, "Would you be my partner," I said, "yes."  He said, "I noticed that you had a spell every day when you they had to pick partners and I know how you feel, you see I'm Jewish."  So Mike [ph.] and I did the scene, not only did we do it, we were in first place, we were selected.  That was again one of those times when you're very race conscious when you're the only African American, the only female, African American and so forth.  So there are two of my Columbia stories but I finished and I did get a chance to do '[A] Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry].  That was just before and I was selected for it but having to come back home and see if I had been single I probably would have gone into theater.  But I had a chance to do off Broadway with that.
Speaker 1: And what was the part that you--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In 'Raisin' I played the mother [Lena Younger] in 'Raisin in the Sun.'  I probably would have actualized that dream had I not had children and so forth but I was not a risk taker.
Story_ID: 578074
Speaker 1: --So I came back to Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and at the time when you were a professor--well I was an assistant professor because with a master's degree (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When you came back in 1960 you went to teach at Hampton.
Speaker 1: I went to teach at Hampton.  The same mentor, Dr. [Eva C.] Mitchell was about to retire and I really didn't want to go to the college to teach but when she said, "Of all the hundreds of my girls, it would make me so happy if one could replace me at Hampton."  Another person had been hired but I was one of her girls and I thought about it and I said if it had not been for this lady pushing me I would not have been able to have gone this far and so I loved my teaching job and I went to my principal and told him that Dr. Mitchell really felt that she would be so happy if one of us took her place.  So I did and I got at Hampton and you don't get promoted if you don't get your hours above your master's.  At that time UNCF, United Negro College [and Educational] Fund [Inc.] was giving scholarships and another scholarship I was able to get and I went to get my doctorate [degree].  Well when I went to graduate school and I was only going in order to get my sixty hours above so I could get promoted to assistant professor.  So I got my sixty hours above and--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you were at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]?
Speaker 1: I went to Michigan State University, East Lansing [Michigan].
Speaker 2: I'm sorry Michigan State, East Lansing.
Speaker 1: And the only reason that I went there, I was received this nice letter and in there I told them that I was really--I had a background in speech and drama and I wanted to do a major that would be a combination of education and speech and Michigan was the one that wrote back to say we'll be happy to have you and we think we can put together that kind of major.  And of all the letters I just got that one letter and off to Michigan not knowing a soul in Michigan.
Speaker 2: And did you do the same thing, did you attend during the summers?
Speaker 1: Yes I attended during the summers.  When I got my sixty hours above Dr. Jerome [H.] Holland was president and he said you've done so well, you need to just go on and get your doctorate and so he was able to get me a scholarship and so I went on to Michigan State--I mean I went on for a full year and at the time we had a non-graded--we were just beginning the non-graded school concept at Hampton University in our laboratory school.  So by that time I was head of the department so I got to be department chair after I got the sixty hours.  Then I went on to Michigan State and had some very, very nice experiences and also one very dreadful experience which turned out this one is very memorable to me.  We had to take the exam and here again, in terms of test taking skills, sometimes you don't make the highest but I felt like goodness gracious my race is on my shoulders and I know I flunked this exam.  But needless to say I managed to pass it.  But one experience stands in my mind because when we were doing the dissertation and also being usually the only black in the class, I would just go overboard in order to make sure that we didn't have grammatical errors or if they said we don't have good grammar, et cetera, et cetera.  So I would make very sure that I had all of my grammar and sentences and so forth.  So I had to send in a preliminary for my dissertation and when I got it back it was all red marks everywhere.  Needless to say I was devastated, too broad and I said here it is again black and female and my paper gets to be all red.  Between the tears and I called and said I'm just coming home, I'm not going through this racism, I'm not going to do it.  I went to the library and it was so almost pathetic, I was just looking through it--had the paper there and I was looking through the book and research things and I saw this quote and it said, "Find some time to be alone, look into that cupboard for tears thine own, reflect on it and tumble up and down," what that (unclear) saying.  It looked like my eyes kept on going on that, looking in my cupboard.  I said there are people that are just racist; I don't need to look for anything.  But then I looked down at the paper and I saw--I looked at the title and it had too broad, I looked at it real good and I said well it is too broad.  I looked further down and I said that doesn't give a total picture anyway I did my own critique of it and then I wrote it over and by looking at it and critiquing it and carrying it to the professor.  He said now this is it, you passed your defense; you go on and do your dissertation.  I say that because sometimes we are so conditioned by being the only female, the only black that the first thing is hey this is it.
Speaker 2: Get defensive.
Speaker 1: Sometimes you just reflect on it and you will find that sometimes that it really isn't that and you really need to.  So that's what I tell my students sometimes about that experience.
Story_ID: 578075
Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker Mary T.] Christian you earned your Ph.D. [from Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] in 1968 and went back to teaching at Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and just tell us a little bit about actually in 1968 also you initiated a voter registration drive at Hampton, tell us a little about that.
Speaker 2: Well during that time I think we had become more politically inclined and more conscious about politics and so forth because we had no African American persons in city hall, none on the school board, none in the legislature and so forth.  So one of things that we had not done, I had done--I had my students to do some research and we found that so many of the people were not registered.  So we set forth this voter registration drive and we said our goal was five hundred and if we could get five hundred people to be registered.  So we appealed to the churches, I headed up the drive and we ended up with over a thousand persons being registered.  So as that then almost every year in sororities and fraternities would have voter registration drives and as a result also over here in the low-income area we had a community center and that community center--well after desegregation the schools were mixed naturally they couldn't come into the black section so they closed the school.  It was a brand new school.  It stayed closed for about ten years and it was just desecrated.  We had people to get together and they had gone down because our children had nowhere to go for recreation.  To make a long story short, I organized community pride and progress and put coalitions so we put together Y.H. Thomas Athletic Society [Hampton, Virginia], Association for Concerned Citizens [ph.], four groups that had been individually to the city hall and naturally couldn't find money to do it.  So we went as a group and we formed a coalition and we filled the courtroom, we filled the chambers.  By that time I was in my first year of legislature [Virginia House of Delegates] too so I said, "I'm not speaking as a delegate, I'm speaking as an individual resident, 1104 West Avenue in the old North Hampton [Virginia] of the city," and so forth. But no they couldn't separate me from the (unclear) and so forth.  But before we left that meeting they voted a half million dollars to do the roof at Y.H. Thomas [Community Center, Hampton, Virginia] and now it's a center that's flowing very fast and also many programs that I was able to get $75,000 for a computer lab there.  So they have a computer lab; it's named after me (laughter).
Story_ID: 578076
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little bit Dr. [HistoryMaker Mary T.] Christian (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, sure.
Speaker 1: --to the early '70s [1970s] mid '70s [1970s], tell me a little bit about what the climate at Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] was like and were you noticing any change in students or were students pretty much still the same or what were times like in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Okay it sort of transcended because I worked there for a long time in the registrar office and still had contact with the students and there was a change in the '60s [1960s] of the students and they did have a sit-in.  That was during the time when the revolutionary students were at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and I remember at Hampton we were a little bit, I wouldn't say slow but Hampton was sort of sedate and so forth.  I remember Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] came to Hampton for a student and he looked at Hampton and he said, Hampton where are your voices?  So he stirred up this revolutionary spirit.  Well the students at Hampton took over the A Building and they had the sit-in on the campus.  There was the one class that didn't graduate because the president had to close the school because they were sitting in and so forth and there were some of my majors and of course I was considered a radical professor because I fed the students--carried them their lunch.
Speaker 1: And what year was this Dr. Christian?
Speaker 2: I can't exactly say what year that was.
Speaker 1: The late '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: The late '60s [1960s], very late '60s [1960s].  So the students--they were really not disorderly.  Somebody did something on a boat named Hedda [ph.], a small fire but they were peaceful.  They just wouldn't let the president out of the office and so forth.  So I saw more of a revolutionary spirit among the students in terms of the sit-ins and they joined the sit-ins at the lunch counters and everything during that time when I was there.  I also saw that the students became more aware that Hampton being a private school, many students and I found my students and Hampton had more students from out of state than they do just students in their area but they had not seen (unclear) going through this thing that is supposed to be the disadvantaged.  We have all these areas of the disadvantaged and so forth and the books and so forth.  But our students, many of them were from upper level or upper-class and so forth, they'd really hadn't seen poor people.  So I gave them a project out at Pine Chapel [Village, Hampton, Virginia] which was a project--a low income project and the students--I gave them credit for a field experience.  So I had noted at a meeting that [William Mason] Cooper [Elementary] School [Hampton, Virginia] they said twenty-eight kindergarten children failed.  I said my God who could be heartless enough to fail kindergarten children, just coming to school bright eyed and say you failed.  So I found that they were all from the projects, so I had my students to go and they got carpeting from the mill, put it together with 'Sesame Street' characters all painted up and they got so involved in it.   The parents they helped them to get their GED [General Educational Development], the children went to school and they made honor roll.  So the year that I didn't give a big--the students had gone out of my class into other classes, they came back and said Dr. C we will do this without credit. So--
Speaker 1: And what year was this Dr. Christian?
Speaker 2: God, I didn't even get all my years.  That should have been, let me see, that was, should have been, 'cause I went into the-- '85 [1985] that should've been around between '75 [1975] and '80 [1980].

Speaker 1: In 1980, you became the dean of the school of education [at Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and what was that like for you and also what kinds of changes were you noticing in terms of education on the collegiate level and also in students as well as dean?
Speaker 2: As a dean, there was a lot, of course, I had always been involved with students in terms of I've always taught them their senior seminar because we had to talk about life and what it's like when you're in this black environment and everything looks rosy but you're going out into a different environment so I would always teach that seminar.  When I got to be dean, I was not able to be as academically involved with my students as I would have had I'd been instructor and chairman of the department.  Because at that time you had to be all things but I was dean, I was also chair of the department, I was also head of the lab school [Hampton University Laboratory School, Hampton, Virginia] and a program called non-graded model for the U.S. government, Follow Through which is a sequel to Head Start.  So during that time I was doing that, I was executive director Follow Through and we had cites using the non graded model in five states; in New York, in Arkansas, in Cleveland [Ohio], the New York dioceses and Tennessee.  So I didn't have a lot of time really to interact with the students 'cause I was doing this modeling in low income areas when we had to do our model.  But the concept was changing with students.  They were more docile, more receptacles of knowledge, they'd just sit down and lecture and during that time they were fishing for more black studies on the campuses.  I remember the very first afro student who came.  We had a story that we were doing registration and Charise [ph.] came, beautiful black girl and she had an afro that was very neat and so forth.  So my colleague, we are very good friends, when she came up to the table to register so Dr. Dorsey [ph.] said, "And may I help you?" And she said, "Yes, I want to be a teacher, I want to register for elementary education," and Dr. Dorsey said, "with that hair, you will not come into elementary education in my department, not with her hair looking like that," and she looked so dejected.  So I said, "Dr. D. why would you do that?"  I said, "That child is neat, she's immaculate what does her hair have to do with it."  "Anybody in my department, student or faculty--if any faculty comes in there with it, I'll fire them."  So my sister was a beautician, I said look--that was before perms so the kind of hair we had, it could be afro in a little bit.  I went home and I said Lillian [Robinson], wash my hair, cut it I'm wearing an afro.  So I went and knocked on Dr. Dorsey's door and I said, "Here I am, would you like me to resign or do you want to fire me?"  So I started an afro trend you know being at the top.
Speaker 1: And what year was this [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Mary T.] Christian?
Speaker 2: This was in--I don't have that yearbook but they did a yearbook--they dedicated a yearbook to me that year and here I am in the book with all the afro, the big afro, I mean.
Speaker 1: This was the late '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah this the late '70s [1970s].
Story_ID: 578078
Speaker 1: We did black poetry and I had a singing group and a poetry group and a speech choir and all of those dramatic kinds of things and people would give us money and then we'd go and put it in Pine Chapel [Village, Hampton, Virginia] for the quote, unquote poverty kids.  So it was a very enjoyable experience.  I carried my students to do voter registration; I had them during the elections.  I worked a lot in the community.  I was appointed to the [Hampton] School Board and I was on the school board for six years and I've had the students but at the time they said Dr. C [HistoryMaker Mary T. Christian] we don't mind working but you never have a candidate who wins and I said but we keep plotting, we had no blacks on anything.  So anyway there came an opening at the [Hampton] City Council and so the folks came to me and said Dr. C. you've been in the community all these years, we'd like to run you for city council.  So I said, in a very cavalier manner, I said, "Look I have paid my dues at the local level, I have worked hard on that school board, should anything come in Richmond [Virginia] or Washington [D.C.] then you come and get me."  Knowing that we had a white representative and knowing there wasn't going to be anything, I just shooed them off.  Dick Bagley [Richard M. Bagley, Sr.] who was in the [Virginia] General Assembly was leaving to throw his hat in the pool to be governor so it left the delegate from Hampton [Virginia] slot open.  So people came knocking on my door, "Dr. C. you said and something has come open in Richmond," and I said, "What?"  They said, "We want you to run for delegate in the general assembly."  I said, "Now wait a minute, I'm a behind the scenes person, I'll do voter registration, I'll work to get people"--I said, "you know how I work but I don't want to be the delegate."  I said, "If I'm that I can't mobilize the community, that's my gift getting people together," but they insisted.  They said, okay we're going to all put in a hundred dollars and everybody here will put in--one person was a doctor who put in one thousand.  I said, oh my God, I don't know what to do and so that night--I'm religious, I go to church and but I didn't--I was exhausted.  They're trying to convince me, I didn't get down on my knees to pray but as I step into the group I said, oh Lord what in the world am I going to do.  That morning I woke, there was no ambiguity, I called my minister at the church, I said, "Revered [Jason Carl] Guice, I'm making a decision, I decided to run for house delegate."  "Go my child with your blessing."  I called [HistoryMaker] Dr. [William] Harvey my president [at Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], I didn't ask him could I go, I said, "Dr. Harvey I'm going to run, I made a decision, I'm going to run for delegate for the general assembly."  He was getting ready to go on a trip and he said, "Okay why don't you"--and I said, "I've got to make my declaration today."  He said, "Why you do it under the Emancipation Oak that's historical and that's where the Emancipation Proclamation was read at the big oak."  I did all of that in two hours, had all the politicians there, had the press there and I made my declaration to run for the [Virginia] House of Delegates.  The Democratic committee was there, students came and oh it was a big time.  So I had to go and speak in Baltimore [Maryland] and coming back I said oh my God what have I done, all of this before me.  So I said oh my goodness, what have I done.  They said you have just become a candidate, my family said, that's what you have done.  So anyway people were rallying toward me and so forth.  Less than two days before and what had been our plight is that too many African Americans--blacks would run, split the vote and that's why we never had anybody anywhere.  So as fate would have it, there comes a black minister who was running, there is a white commonwealth attorney who was running, I was going to run against him.  Now the vote is split, here we are just before the primary, just before I had to send in my petition of voters.  So I'm at this dilemma and I said what am I going to do, you're black, you're female.
Story_ID: 578079
Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker Mary T.] Christian we left off, with someone else, another African American had decided to throw their hat in the ring and what happened?
Speaker 2: Well after the other person had come into the race, Dr. Gant [ph.] I said, same old story divide and conquer, oh okay.  So the only thing I could do--I didn't think I could win with that split because it was a very popular minister and he had his congregation, et cetera and with the number of people who probably would not be voting.  So I said the thought of running as an independent and so then people said, well look now you're black, you're female and you don't have a party, so you can't win.  So I said, I can't win if I go in this divided campaign plus if I'm running as an independent that gives me more time to do some fundraising and get the community involved.  So I decided to go as an independent.  Well that morning when the headlines came out, I was on my way to HU [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and stopped at a traffic sign and this man jumped out of the car and he was beating his fist, "Why did you let us down like that."  I didn't know what he was talking about.  I said, "What do you mean?"  "Why did you let us down and drop out and not turn your things in?"  So I said, "I'm still running, but I was running as an independent."  It was so uncommon to run as an independent that even the press said, "Delegate Christian did not file on time."  So therefore I had to get the press and tell them I was in the running but independents didn't have to file until thirty day later.  I said, I'm running as an Independent and I was a Democrat but I'm running as an Independent.  So I ran this race as an Independent which again was another first because I had all the options against me running as an Independent.  But I ran a grassroots campaign and the people that I had helped my students and Pine Chapel [Village, Hampton, Virginia] in the projects, those people, oh gosh they--I wasn't just going to them because I'm running--as they say politicians come and see you and they don't see you again.  They knew what my track record was.  They sold fish dinners, people cooked dinners, and they came up with money.  All the children designed flyers and we had, one of the persons said during my campaign we had everything from a champagne luncheon from my colleagues at Hampton University to a pigs foot dinner from my people in the projects.  So all that pulled together and we went from zero money to over $47,000, all grassroots went to maybe doctors or something gave $100 and so it was a very historic event.  The paper said, "Christian makes history in Hampton [Virginia], first black since Reconstruction."  So I just--during that night before and so forth, I had no idea at all that we were going to win because that person was such a prominent--he'd been the city commonwealth attorney, in fact he was an attorney when I was on the [Hampton] School Board.  It worked out that I, I went into the [Virginia] General Assembly as an Independent, however I was always a Democrat but I had to go two years as an Independent before I would be able to declare to be in the general assembly as a Democrat.  So they put me in a little spot somewhere between Democrats up here, we were in the majority of the house then and all the Republicans over here.  So I'm closer to the Republicans, so at that time they came down, they had no blacks and no women in the Republican Party.  So I had the majority leader and everybody coming down to Hampton wanting me to go Republican and so forth.  So I was a real VIP, they wined me and dined me and so forth.  The Democrats were getting a little bit like you know you're not supposed to be going to those places where the Republicans are if you're going to want to declare as a Democrat.  But they thought--and I was but they were so afraid that I was not going to do that, that they took me in earlier than the two years so I became a Democrat and that started my legislative career.
Story_ID: 578080
Speaker 1: And while you served in the Virginia legislature [Virginia General Assembly] you also had the privilege of serving or working with the first African American governor--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --of Virginia, Governor [HistoryMaker L. Douglas] Wilder.  What was that like?
Speaker 2: Well, it was sort of early in my political career, however it was--he inherited the very first deficit and he was able to weather the storm and get that through without raising taxes and history will probably record him as being one of the greater governors to have waded through that without any kind of tax and there was still this little overtone of racism because he was a governor.  So we knew that anything that--we supported the governor, we had organized our black caucus [Virginia Legislative Black Caucus] and we unified some of the programs.  But it felt very good to have an African American in the governor's seat and when he would come in to do the first speech, we would all just go crazy and applaud, it on the desk.  We made sure some of the other ones did a little--so we made it up (claps hands).  He was a very good governor.  He had so many hurdles because of the budget and he was probably criticized because some things like in higher education and education, he could not do because of the budget.  This was not known that he had inherited--he didn't know this until he got in the governor's seat and inherited it.  But I think he still made a great contribution to our history as well as to all Virginia.
Speaker 1: And you were also one of the first African Americans to sit on the appropriations committee--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the general assembly.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was a very interesting story too and it probably didn't happen because they loved us or they thought we were as competent as others.  It happened because there was going to be a contest between two other Democrats, Dickie Cranwell [C. Richard Cranwell] and Tom Moss both were vying to be speaker.  So nine votes would make a difference, it was going to be very close because it would have been something like forty-five, forty-eight and five people would have made the difference.  So we banded as a caucus and we said, okay if we vote for you, what are you going to give us, this is what we want.  I had been eight years or ten, I had not been on education even though I'm just only one of two Ph.D.s and I never got on education.  Those of us who were in education, we want education, we want appropriations.  Well we decided we wanted to ask for two and then we said no 'cause they would only give us one.  So we asked for four and we got three out of four delegates, Billy Robinson and Delegate Jean [W.] Cunningham.  So these were the first--we were the first African Americans that had any input into all of the money, how it would be divided and I guess just to tell you those stories would take a whole interview.  That's when I learned there was a disparity between Virginia State University [Petersburg, Virginia] and Norfolk [State] University [Norfolk, Virginia] then [College of] William and Mary [Williamsburg, Virginia], University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia].
Speaker 1: The historically black colleges [and universities, HBCUs].
Speaker 2: Historical black colleges all of them, such a big disparity but we were able to say hey, nah uhuh this doesn't happen, we're not voting for this and they started giving increments for the black colleges.  Many of the contributions of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus will go unwritten and unknown because when you--we don't wave the flags and being so open about it then we would get more opposition.  So many things we had to do very unobtrusively and move but we made a lot of differences in terms of what was going on especially in terms of the funds and how the funds were done.  Another thing in the general assembly, being a teacher I was aware of the impending shortage of minority teachers and knowing that our kids in these schools needed black teachers and I'm certainly not saying that some Caucasian teachers weren't good teachers but many of them needed just to see the role models and so forth.  So I organized the very first bill in terms of giving scholarships to teachers in critical areas later but we did a study to show just how the difference was.  I knew the difference being at Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] when I became dean, we had the department of early childhood education, department of elementary education, department of special education and secondary education, we took in all English majors and so forth.  When I left, we had to combine all of three departments in order to hold one department, we were a school and since I had left it's not a school of education anymore, it's a department of education.  So I knew first hand that our students were not going into education and rightly so, salaries are poor, opening up of other avenues there's business opening, there's technology (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Information technology, healthcare--
Speaker 2: --communications and so forth.  So the pool of teachers and now it's being felt even, even more. So a lot of my legislation was to help teachers get scholarships to come into education.
Story_ID: 578081
Speaker 1: What are you most proud of Dr. [HistoryMaker Mary T.] Christian of all of--?
Speaker 2: Of legislation?
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the one that was the most challenging; I can show you what has come as a result of it.  That same article that I showed you in the green dress well one of the teachers at Bethel High School [Hampton, Virginia] during Black History Month brought that article in so the children chose Dr. Christian as their hero for Black History Month.  So they wrote me all of these letters and so forth.  So I answered each letter individually and the teacher at the time had been working on a fund raising campaign, for Cheryl Grimmel who needed a bone marrow transplant and had to raise $175,000 in order to get it, insurance would not pay for it.  So I worked on a task force with them and it never past--the legislation never past because the big boys--insurance companies were lobbying people would not, would not support it.  So here is me with my little self saying I'll take it on.  So anyway we proposed a bill which would mandate insurance to cover bone marrow transplants for cancer victims.  So that was--that could be a whole story tell you how to get through it, but anyway I went individually to the officers, it had failed two years prior.  Well number one is that males always did it and they didn't think--there are certain things in the [Virginia] General Assembly they would call it a women's bill, certain things they'd call a women's bill and they categorized us just like they do racially.  So I knocked on doors and I said, "Hi."  I said, "I'm here."  I said, "Your mother living, wife, sister and then I would say do you know how many people will be struck with cancer, how many lives here in Virginia, how many are projected in Virginia."  I said, "It could be a member of your family, God willing it won't but it could be a member of your family."  Some of them had had cancer in their family, others had not.  But I made it very personal and some would say Mary, "I can't co-patron it," 'cause they didn't want the insurance--big boys to see it.  They'd say I'll vote for it but I can't co-patron it.  Well the group had a real grassroots program and people started calling the American Cancer Society and they came in and all the other help and they started calling in and people were knocking on my door saying Mary can I co-patron your bill.  One person said Mary call the dogs off, just tell them (laughter)--'cause they did emails and telegrams and phone calls and needless to say that bill passed.
Speaker 1: What year was this Dr. Christian?
Speaker 2: Is that the year, no that's the picture I had with George Allen--Governor Allen.  So you have a picture of that, he signed that bill.  Why it is significant is because that bill became a model for the teacher who asked me to carry it and she started a small organization, Patient Advocate Foundation [Hampton, Virginia].  It is now a national foundation and I will show you one of the brochures from there.  It all started from that little bill.  So I would say that one was the most significant, I'd say that touched more lives of people.  But I think some of my most rewarding ones were working with the bill with infants and toddlers with disabilities and at that time we had no legislation and money, so this was a federal grant and I led a lot of that legislation so that, that became a program throughout Virginia--
Story_ID: 578082
Speaker 1: Let me ask you some of your thoughts on just a couple of different things Dr. [HistoryMaker Mary T.] Christian.  As a lifelong educator, what are some of your thoughts on--as fifty years later we celebrate Brown vs. the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  What are some of your thoughts, do you think integration and desegregation helped us as African Americans or hurt us?
Speaker 2: There are ways that I would look at it on both sides of the scale.  In terms of helping, on both sides with whites and blacks, other people of other races number one will know--you know the stereotype that blacks are lazy, blacks are not as intelligent and whatever.  For them to mingle to see that we have thoughts and attributes and talents and so forth like they do, like any other race will have and in some ways we're superior in some things.  So the fact that people were educated together to know that people are more alike than they are different except for race and skin coloring configurations, it was good.  Also for us as black people to know that we're going to live in a broader society where we have to interact with people of other cultures and other races.  In terms of what it has done, I can only speak of this area and so many of the areas that I visited being on the education committee, in areas in terms of self-concept being a minority all of the time-- a minority situation gives that same feeling that you may not be as self-worthy as other people because you are working in a minority situation.  In terms of teachers, teacher expectation, good teachers but their expectations for black students were not the same as for white students and doing student teaching when I went into a classroom to observe a student teacher, whit teacher, there were two black children in the class and the teacher said, "Dr. Christian you see the little girl, that's Rose [ph.]." Never shall forget it. "Do you know she did ninety-nine percentile on the standardized test?"  I said, "She did, so what does that mean?"  "It means that I had her retested and she's taking another test."  I said, "Why are you retesting?"  "Well I mean she made the highest in the whole class," and I said, "so."  I said, "Well has the other test been done," and she said, "she still made a high grade."  So I marched myself right down to the principal and I said your teacher needs some sensitivity training because that child is black, there was no way that she could have made the highest in the class, there was no way she could have made it.  I would find them in groups and the black children always, without even testing them, the second group plodded along to becoming the first group founded in gifted education.  I had a class at Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and my students came downstairs, we had the gifted education children to come over to HU [Hampton University], we had a gifted class.  We did a nexus with the public school system so my students can go and say, "Dr. C. he got himself there in that gifted class and there is not one black child up there and we're up there doing"--and I say, "you may go in a classroom with all white children, go right back there, get your work, teach those children that you have," won't let them know in the meantime I called the director.  I said, "Director Harkavey [ph.] are you telling me that there are no gifted black kids in the public school?"  She says, "According to our tests"--I said, I won't tell you what I said the test.  I said, "We have gifted black children, now do I have to come out there and find them?"  So she said, "We'll work on that."  So then get a class that's at two and I said okay that's the token we were supposed to have so I taught at Aberdeen [Elementary School, Hampton, Virginia] and I called my Aberdeen principal that I had taught with and I told black teachers just intuition, send me your brightest students and I don't want to look at test scores, send me those brightest students.  I told the teacher who was white; I said we have another class of gifted students that came in from Aberdeen.  Those kids made the same grades, they were achieving at the same level that the other persons achieved.  So then we started multiple criteria and even in the state they mandated that all of the children had to be tested on multiple criteria meaning not just the IQ test alone because we know many of them are culturally biased.  So that was another thing we did in the [Virginia] General Assembly but also in terms of our own experiences.  So I find that in that way, we have not been identified as gifted.  Many of the children who--we always had a top ten and for a while little black children got in top ten and right here in Hampton [Virginia] when one did then they had to pull that away because they said well the child had not gone throughout the public school (unclear).  So there are some advantages and I think some disadvantages and so many of the schools almost have resegregated now since Brown.  They were first unintegrated number one, many of the white parents pulled out for private schools and many of the schools now are still predominantly black.
Story_ID: 578083
Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker Mary T.] Christian why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it's just so important because we need to know where we have been in order to know where we are going and it's also important because I always try to help children even the negatives that came from slavery.  I try to point out the positives.  Let's say look at these people, not only are they not inferior, they're superior.  Look what they had to do under the bonds of slavery, no education, couldn't even speak among themselves because of the multiplicity of languages in Africa, they couldn't even converse among themselves.  They formed this language which we now call Negro dialect and I say they built our schools, they built our churches and they need to know the people that emerged as which are not in the history books because if students can see other people like themselves it certainly improves their aspirations and they can become because they see those of us who have become.  So I just think it is so important to know yourself and it gives you-- know yourself.  I'm proud of who I am, I'm proud of my ancestors.  I mean proud of not the slavery--the system of slavery but what those people did in spite of slavery.
Story_ID: 578084
Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered Dr. [HistoryMaker Mary T.] Christian?
Speaker 2: I guess I'd want to be remembered as a person who will give as much as God has blessed me to have and looking at what is said to those to whom much is given, much is expected and I think God has blessed me with many talents and as long as I live I'm gonnatry to share them in making lives better for others.
Story_ID: 578085
Speaker 1: And what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community, more particularly the African American community in Virginia, what are some of your hopes and concerns?
Speaker 2: Well again I'm looking at history and I'm seeing when in the '40s [1940s] we had from one corner to another we had black businesses, all down.  Number one we have lost to redevelopment when they took over.  Then the prices were so astronomical, very few, it's only one black business.  I would like to see us span and expand our entrepreneurial power because it's the green that's so important and I think that there are many barriers.  We've worked in a state level in terms of the big contracts and not given to African American contractors, they are not able to place the bonds that necessary for big things like shopping centers and churches.  But I think that we can do more by pooling together what wealth we do have.  You know (unclear) and one person talking to black families said just think of all the black churches in this country and how much we put into those banks, suppose we consolidated into one big bank--to have an American, African American bank.  So I'd like to see us pool together, unite much more as a community and as one said I think the little class and caste as we've become middle class that we remain this and we move into neighborhoods and I'd like to see us embrace all people because as Malcolm [X] said I don't care if you're Ph.D. and I won't call the N-word but he said that's what you is.  But I'd like to see--that's what I'd like to see back to basics when we were the kind of community when everybody shared together and I think the political clout is so necessary now, and in voter registration and people to get them out to vote so you can mandate.  You don't have to beg these times, these politicians they need your vote and I think a lot of times we don't hold them accountable enough.  So I'd like to see our economic, I'd like to see the quality education because I think we have lost a lot and I'd like to see the political life expand.
Story_ID: 578086
Speaker 1: How do you think the political climate has changed under a recently elected (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh my goodness.
Speaker 1: --Republican, I mean a Democratic governor [Governor Mark Warner]?
Speaker 2: I don't really want to sound biased because I am a Democrat but I must say that in terms of those values that we hold dear and in terms of human society and the things that people need, much of that has been wiped away.  The impetus on building prisons, more prisons and prisons as an industry.
Speaker 1: Do you think it will change now since there is a Democrat in the governor's mansion?
Speaker 2: Well he's trying but we have a Republican controlled legislature.  So he can do a few things with the veto but we are one short of being even veto proof.  But Mark has done a lot, he's been trying to be a centrist in terms of making inroads in both and I think there's some change but not as much as I would like to see.

Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker Mary T.] Christian what do you think your legacy is?  What would you like for your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Somebody asked me that once before and I guess what I said I guess my legacy would still be giving of what we have for those who come along.  And, you know, as the song goes if I can help somebody along this way than my living would not have been in vain.

Speaker 1: Any regrets?
Speaker 2: Many (laughter), but I said, had I known then what I know now but a lot of things will come with age.  I'm learning every day even though I just, just reached my eightieth birthday and I say I'm thirty-nine and still counting.  But I guess maybe my biggest regret would be that knowing that we have not harnessed the power that we have, regret to having mobilized when all of our homes were being taken and redeveloped and knowing that had we come together and if I had brought people together, we could have saved our homes and as we meet another milestone I might think if I was just twenty years younger I would do this and so forth.  But basically it's just really wanting to be able to do more and as you get older you'll find that there is so much more you want to do and there is so much you see undone.  Like in there is filled with papers and junk, I've got the cemetery project, cleaning up (unclear).  All the black cemeteries in Hampton [Virginia] had grown up in weeds so I'm out there on Memorial Day, we cleaned up the cemeteries and so I'm working with the children in the low income areas trying to get them to our speech choirs so they can improve their English, un, huh, dit.  So I'm working with that and it's just that I guess my regrets are fewer than what I would think my accomplishments are.
Speaker 1: And do you ever regret not being able to pursue your acting career after getting that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well let me tell you about my acting career.  Yeah I still sometimes when I look at the Academy Awards and people would say oh you'd be great.  So they dedicated an auditorium, I think you have a little thing there, the [Dr.] Mary T. Christian Auditorium [& Theatre].  So the president of Thomas Nelson [Community College, Hampton, Virginia] had seen me do a tribute to [HistoryMaker] Dr. [William] Harvey and I did it in poetry.  So I had my own stage the Mary T. Christian stage and the night of the dedication I did two dramatic readings or recitations.  I did 'The Creation' by James Weldon Johnson and in honor of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] I did 'Let my People Go.'  So I said, well I have had my drama on my own stage (laughter).
Speaker 1: Thank you so much [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Mary T.] Christian--
Speaker 2: Oh it's been enjoyable.
Speaker 1: --for your time and sharing your story with us, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: And thank you.
