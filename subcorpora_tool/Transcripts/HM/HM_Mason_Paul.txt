Speaker 1: Let's begin talking about your mother, starting with your mother's name and where your mother was born and where she grew up as a girl.
Speaker 2: Sure, my mother, my mother's name was Beverly Elizabeth Sinkford.  She was and and then obviously married my father [Theodore Mason] and became Mason.  She was born in Bluefield, West Virginia and she grew up in Bluefield, West Virginia.
Speaker 1: And did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her growing up as a girl in West Virginia?
Speaker 2: Where do I start?  Yeah, I mean, my mother was from a very, very well-to-do black family in a very small, in a fairly small town in, in very southern tip of West Virginia.  Her father [Stanley Sinkford] was, was the town--was the black undertaker in town.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And this was a business that her grandfather had started.  And so, and so as you might imagine everybody knew him, everybody knew the Sinkford family.  She was one of eight girls.  They had one brother and, and you know the girls were fine.
Story_ID: 245290
Speaker 1: Talking about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Sinkford family in Bluefield, West Virginia was, was pretty well-to-do and everybody knew 'em.  They were you know prominent members of the local A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.  They were--my grand, my great-grandfather I didn't know him.  He died shortly after I was born but, but he really--my mother [Beverly Sinkford Mason] lived with him and his wife which she lived with her grandparents.  She was the oldest of the nine children and, and so at the time part of what became custom was as the oldest child, she went to care and live in and care for her grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so she learned early how to cook and she learned how to keep house and she learned how to basically you know care for you know her aging grandparents and she was also sort of the chief among her siblings.  This was a family that was not only well-to-do, but was very well educated.  My mother had--she sort of became the little sister of her aunts and her aunts Libba [ph.] and Vernon [ph.] had both gone to [The] Juilliard [School, New York, New York] in the 1920s.  She had other you know there were other relatives in this family who were at [University of] Michigan [An Arbor, Michigan] and Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] at that turn of the, the turn of the 20th century.  And so this was, this was--this side of the family had been college educated for you know from the very, very beginning of the 20th century.
Speaker 1: And did she ever talk about some of the things that she enjoyed doing as a girl growing up?
Speaker 2: She was studious and she, and she spent a lot of time again caring for her, caring for her grandparents.  That's, what I, what's pretty much what we know about my mom.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Extraordinary.  She was gifted socially.  She was very verbal, brilliant.  She was also very conscious of social situations and, and she was very exacting.  She wanted to make certain that, well she certainly passed on a lot of what she was schooled with.  You know her grandmother really raised her and so she always had little sayings you know.  "Whistling girls and cackling hens always come to no good ends."  You know, you know "pretty is as pretty does."  And she pretty much made use of those on a day-to-day basis as she got older and we got older, she repeated them in some ways almost mocking some of her trials and at the same time sending us a little message about decorum.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: She believed in that.  She was both extraordinary and, and tough but at the heart.  Just you know, just the finest.
Story_ID: 245291
Speaker 1: Let's talk now about your father starting with your father's name and where he was born and grew up as a boy that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: My father is Theodore Oliver Mason was, he passed away about a year ago.  He was born in a small coal mining town in southern Ohio called Cadiz, Ohio, C-A-D-I-Z.  This was in the heart of what was [M.A.] Hanna [Co.] coal country.  The Hanna family was a very prominent family that, that really sort of bankrolled the Tafts who you know [President] William Howard Taft who became president of the United States and the Hanas, they were the big power in, in this area.  My father's father [Noble Mason] was a coal miner, an electrician in the coal mines.  He worked on the interstate highway commission.  The State of Ohio had some of the best highways fairly early on and, and my grandfather did that.  He worked on the railroad.  He was--he was--his--my father's family was quite a contrast from my mother's [Beverly Sinkford Mason] family.  My father was the first college educated in his family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his father and mother [Mabel Fullum Mason] were salt of the earth.  They were extraordinary people.  But they were very proud and, and very you know very working class.  My father was the third child of six--seven I'm sorry.  He had five brothers and a sister.  He was the third. From the beginning my sense of my, of my pop was that he, he was both intellectually gifted and physically gifted.  He was the kind--he had always had tremendous bearing and stature and I think from the very beginning he had the cut of a leader and everybody knew it.  And so he was a great athlete. He you know he used his abilities as a football player to get a college scholarship and move to the big city Cleveland [Ohio] where, where he became a standout football player at, at Case Western Reserve University [Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio] and that was where my parents met. My mother was, was in graduate school in social work.  My father was in his first year of dental school.  And but because he had gone to the [U.S.] Army Air Corps, he still had a year left of eligibility for football so he was playing on the football team but he was actually in dental school.  When my mother saw him he was wearing his letter sweater and she thought he was an undergraduate, but she--the minute she saw him, she said that's the man I'm gonna marry.  Told her friend Marilyn [ph.] you know that's who I'm gonna marry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And well she had it right as usual.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: My father was a Tuskegee Airman.  He, he was with the 477th [Fighter Group] which was the second wave of airmen.  The first airmen fought you know flew pursuit and protected bombers.  And once that part of the experiment was proven, the next phase was to train bomber pilots.  It was long thought that they couldn't get enough intelligent black people to actually staff the bomber planes because it took you know a pilot, co-pilot, a navigator, a bombardier, it took, it took a larger crew and they thought that the, that the blacks at the time intellectually did not have the capability to do that and my father was among the group that proved them wrong. He was a pilot and, and learned to fly [North American] B-25 [Mitchell].  Never actually made it to the, to the, to the war [World War II, WWII].  The war ended before his training ended but and then he went back to Cleveland and, and continued his schooling, went to dental school--
Story_ID: 245292
Speaker 1: What kind of work did your mother [Beverly Sinkford Mason] do?
Speaker 2: My mother was a social worker. She had a master's degree in social work.  She--ultimately she became a, a school social worker in the Shaker Heights [Ohio] school district in suburban Cleveland [Ohio] and then she went on to really sort of pioneer a voluntary bussing program for integration.  My parents were devout integrationists in the 1950s and '60s [1960s].  That was really, they, they sort of--they had a, I guess they, they--my parents believed and instilled in us that we could do anything we wanted to do.  We were the equal of anyone.  Not better, but we were equal to anyone and that there was--we were Americans and there was nothing that could hold us and keep us back.
Story_ID: 245293
Speaker 1: And just a couple of brief notes.  My mother's [Beverly Sinkford Mason] family, we found some, recently we found some documents about my mom's family.  And they traced themselves back to, to Native Americans who came up out of the Carolinas.  And one branch of the family there was six brothers.  They were called the Holi [ph.] Indians.  They were from a tribe of the Holi Indians and they took the name Holi and six of them fought in the, in the Revolutionary War.  One of them was [President] George Washington's barber.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: My father's [Theodore Mason] family came out of Virginia and the area that was, that was known where George Mason lived and we believed that his family was from the slaves of George Mason who was, who wrote the Bill of Rights [sic. Virginia Declaration of Rights].  In 1836 my father's, one of his early prote--progenitors was a, a woman who had been a slave and was freed who left Virginia and traveled to Ohio after her mate had been sold into slavery down into Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and so about 1836 is when the Mason family first came to Ohio and we trace our roots back to that. And he's--my father is named for a great uncle who went to the Civil War and never came back.
Story_ID: 245294
Speaker 1: Was your mother's [Beverly Sinkford Mason] family accepting of your father [Theodore Mason]?
Speaker 2: My grandfather initially thought when my mother told, told him that she wanted to marry a guy from Cadiz [Ohio] he thought he was from Spain.  Yes, they were, they were thoroughly accepting of him.  But also if that's a question about class--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you know you have to remember that my father was a college graduate [from Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio] and my grandfather, well he'd gone to embalming school [Cincinnati College of Embalming; Cincinnati College of Mortuary Science] at the University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio].  But you know my father was formidable and there was no one who would have met him that would have said anything but.  Oh this is, this is good news.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And my mother was formidable and so in that sense you know it would have been--you would have considered probably a good match.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  You told us a little bit about your paternal grandparents.  You talked a little bit about them.  What about your maternal grandparents, did you know them?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In fact my grandfather and I shared a--my, my grandfather, my mother's father and I shared a birthday.  We both--he was born September 14, 1900 which was the day [President] William McKinley was shot.
Speaker 1: And what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Stanley [Sinkford], which is where I get my middle name from. And my grandmother was named Marjorie Adams [Sinkford].  She's the child actually of--her father was a guy named John Quincy Adams.  John Quincy Adams the tale has it was a full blooded Native American who was lost from his family and found as a young child and adopted by a white family in Virginia named Adams who, who raised him.  He was--actually his, his original name was Kiyana [ph.] and they, and they--his nickname became Johnny Kini [ph.] and that was my great-grandfather on my mother's side, one of them. So, so we have a lot of Native American blood and a lot of--and we're just all mixed up.  We got a little bit of you know we got it all you know.
Speaker 1: And can you just tell us what your paternal grandparents' names were?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My, my grandfather was named Noble William Mason and my grandmother was named Mabel Fullum [Mason].
Story_ID: 245295
Speaker 1: Tell me what is your earliest memory of growing up?  What's one of the earliest things you remember?
Speaker 2: Standing at the window, at the picture window of the--of our house on Ashwood Road [Shaker Heights, Ohio] crying because my mother [Beverly Sinkford Mason] was going to the grocery store somewhere and my aunts were keeping us and I you know she was going somewhere.  And I remember getting--being licked by our beagle.  His name was Boots and my brothers, being with my brothers [Theodore Mason, Jr. and David Mason].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And can you--
Speaker 2: And I remember the day my sister [Elizabeth Mason Hopkins] came home as a baby which would be 1959. Yeah I remember that very clearly.
Story_ID: 245296
Speaker 1: Can you give us your siblings' names and their birth order including yourself?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  My oldest brother is Theodore Oliver Mason, Junior.  He was born in 1950, November 13, 1950.  My next brother is named David Warren Mason and he was born November 19, 1952 and then there's me and then I have a sister Elizabeth Anne Mason who then became Hopkins.  She was born January 4, 1959 and she died in a car accident in 1989--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --in August of 1989.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Okay.
Speaker 2: The great tragedy of our family, really.
Story_ID: 245297
Speaker 1: Can you talk a little bit about what holidays were like in your house growing up, birthdays, Christmas, Thanksgiving?  Were they very festive times?  Your parents [Beverly Sinkford Mason and Theodore Mason] both had big families so was it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a gathering place your house?
Speaker 2: Our house was a central gathering point particularly for my mother's side.  As you know with girls, particularly with that many girls--they hung tight and once my mother went to Cleveland [Ohio] and then another one came to Cleveland and another one came to Cleveland and soon you know we had quite a, quite a clan you know in Cleveland.  My father's family a little less so but he had two brothers who followed his exact path which was he played football.  Ended up using that to get to college, went on to professional school so one of them was also a dentist the other is now a retired pediatrician. But yeah our house was, it was the central point.  And, and birthdays were, they were laid back.  I mean you know there was always a cake which my mother made and you know a few presents but more just people gathering.  Christmas also you know, wonderful holiday.  But it was Thanksgiving though that became the, the big holiday in our family. And we tend to have and still to this day gather at Thanksgiving and it's a very large gathering.  We tend to--I think we are in San Antonio [Texas] this year and we had I think about 45 or 50 for dinner.  And that is pretty typical. That becomes sort of a four day party and everyone from all around the country gathers.
Speaker 1: And what made Thanksgiving so special?  Was there lots of food and lots of people?  What made it so special in your mind?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was food and it was people and it was the celebration of family. You know it was--and it is a classically American holiday and I think that we view ourselves as quintessential Americans you know.  And it is, it is really non-secular.  Not that I have anything against Christmas and Christmas also was important but we were spiritual but not necessarily, not necessarily religious in the, in the way of regular church goers, but we certainly as a family we, we bought that whole American dream thing, lock, stock and barrel, you know.  We were, we were and still are you know we're American--
Story_ID: 245298
Speaker 1: What other memories of childhood do you have of early childhood?
Speaker 2: School.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your first day of school?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Sure, I do.  I remember Kindergarten really, really clearly.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: My elementary school was Ludlow [Elementary] School [Shaker Heights, Ohio].  And, and it was a neighborhood school in Shaker Heights [Ohio].  It really was you know--we all walked to school and we walked home for lunch, and we walked back to school, and you know every morning my friend Winston Richie, who lived right behind me, picked me up and we'd walk to school and stop at the corner of Sullington [ph.] and Becket [Road, Shaker Heights, Ohio] and wait for Cheryl Crawford to come and we'd you know walk to school and we did that for you know like that probably for years. Ludlow was, was an experiment really.  You know about this?  You want me to talk about this?  Do you know about this at all?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So this is the subject of a documentary film that I made.
Speaker 1: Oh, on Shaker Heights?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My parents [Beverly Sinkford Mason and Theodore Mason] sort of spearheaded the integration of Shaker Heights and, and so maybe I should talk about that before I talk about my elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember when you moved to Shaker Heights?
Speaker 2: No.  'Cause I would have been about two months old.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  All right.  So you were very, very young.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  So I don't remember it.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: No.  But I've, but I've learned quite a bit about--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --it since.  What I remember is I remember, I remember kindergarten.  I remember my elementary experience really, very, very vividly.  And what I remember about it is it was idyllic.  I you know as a five year old I wouldn't know that but as I look back on it and what I've learned about it, it was pretty extraordinary and I have an elementary, elementary aged daughter now and so from the, from the perspective of, of a parent looking back, knowing what I now know, it was, it was really extraordinary. And what was extraordinary about it was that we lived in a neighborhood that was, that really was carefully controlled and it was, it was integrated living and you know in the late 1950s.  It was half black and half white.  We lived side by side and it was carefully controlled to maintain that racial balance.  And that was very rare at the time.
Story_ID: 245299
Speaker 1: My parents [Beverly Sinkford Mason and Theodore Mason] were really were the first family to, to buy a piece of property and, and actually build a home in the Shaker Heights [Ohio] school district as African Americans or Negroes back then.  Until then that had never actually happened.  There might have been a few African Americans.  The few blacks that lived in Shaker Heights but, but the entire process of buying a piece of property, getting the permits, actually being able to build and then successful building had never been done and in a way it signaled--it sent a signal that this was sanctioned by, by the government of this little community and by the, by the community itself when in fact it really wasn't and they kind of sneaked it in.  It was interesting because this was, this was a model suburb that was built in 1911 is when it was started.  And, and there were restrictive covenants that had been put in place and part of the restrictive covenants was you couldn't move into Shaker Heights unless ten neighbors on one side of the street and ten neighbors on the other side of the street agreed that you could move in.  And this generally was the bar that was set and this was how you know Jews, Catholics, blacks were kept out of this suburb.  Then in 1948, the Supreme Court, I think it was 1948, the [U.S.] Supreme Court ruled [in Shelley v. Kraemer, 1948], struck down the idea of restrictive covenants and said this was unconstitutional.  But it took years for this to for it to actually, even though the Supreme Court ruled, it took years for this to actually become part of the way that people did business.  And so by 1954, my father had two kids and another one on the way.  Brown vs. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] had been decided and my parents had a vision and they decided they were gonna get their kids into the best school district that they could find.  And that meant figuring out a way to infiltrate Shaker Heights, Ohio.
Speaker 2: And had the, by that time, was it, were restrictive covenant still an issue in Shaker Heights?  Like at the time your parents bought their property, did folks know they were black?
Speaker 1: Well, they did it in a funny way.  They didn't actually buy the lot.  My father had two--owned two lots in a near--nearby community that was largely Negro and he knew a Jewish realtor.  The guy was kind of a hustler named I think his name was Maury Freedman [ph.] and, and Morey owned this lot that was in Cleveland [Ohio], but it was in the, in the school district in the Shaker school district. It was right, it was right on the edge.  And, and so they made a trade.  And so Maury took these two lots from my dad and my dad took the one lot in Shaker and I think maybe paid him a, you know a couple thousand dollars in addition and the deal was done.
Story_ID: 245300
Speaker 1: So the next thing was okay, gotta get a loan.  So they drew up some plans.  My father [Theodore Mason] knew an architect who had been in the airmen with him named Art Saunders [Arthur G. Saunders].  They drew up some plans, they went to the Shaker Savings [Association] to get a loan and they were denied.  So then they went to the black savings and loan called Quincy Savings [& Loan] and they got the loan.  And then the guy the head of the Shaker Savings was head of the S&L association [savings and loan association] and he called in the head of Quincy, the black bank, to say what are you doing making a loan on that white street?  Well the day this meeting happened, my father, the local minister and the head of Quincy Savings went into this meeting with the head of Shaker Savings and when he asked this question what are you doing making a loan on that white street?  The head of the Quincy Savings and Loan said that's not a white street.  And the man said yes it is.  And he said no I've been there and that asphalt is gray.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And a lot of words were exchanged but in the end there was nothing they could do about it.  Then the plans were drawn and, and the architect managed to have a--he knew a white firm that he had done some work for and he submitted the architectural plans to the architectural review board via the white firm and it was in a stock of documents setting a lot of other documents and it got through.  So the Shaker Heights architectural review board unknowingly approved the plans for a black family to build a home.  Same way it had to go through the Cleveland [Ohio] process and a black councilman did the same thing.  He submitted it with a bunch of other documents, got through and the next thing we knew, they had the approval.  So the next thing was that then they went to the site, the architect and a surveyor and my dad and this was the first time that the neighbors actually realized what was going on.  And the neighbors were up in arms many of them and they called the police.  So there's--if you imagine there's a big crowd of people all around and the police come up and, and, and the architect and my father apparently had an argument about who was gonna go confront the police.  Because both these Tuskegee Airmen were ready to just take it on.  And so they went up and basically together they went up and the cop said what's going on here?  And I said I'm the owner, this is my architect, and this is our house and we're laying out the plans and the--and he said you own this--yes, yes, you, yes, you got the permit, yes.  Said then I don't have anything to say.  And the police drove away and suddenly the neighbors realized that was it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And did your parents talk about what those early years were like when they first moved in?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah they did.  What's interesting is that we moved in to this house probably six weeks before Rosa Parks refused to give her seat up on the bus in Montgomery [Alabama].  And, and I think that we often think about the Civil Rights [Movement], the struggle for civil rights starting at that moment and in fact what is interesting is that of course if you look at the airmen and what was happening there and what had happened in a series of, of events where, where actors like my parents, principled, believing in themselves, believing in their education and believing in their gifts to America and what they represented made steps that helped also ground, you know ground the movement. I'm very proud of them about that and I've only learned about this since I start doing this research in the last couple of years.
Story_ID: 245301
Speaker 1: Based on what your parents [Beverly Sinkford Mason and Theodore Mason] may have shared with you, what were those early years in Shaker Heights [Ohio] like when they first moved in, were there a lot of resistance from the neighbors?
Speaker 2: Well, I watched a documentary recently that my mother was interviewed about those years and so this is what I know.  We moved in in November and then it became winter and so you know you didn't see people as much but by springtime word had gotten around and the for sale signs had gone up, all up and down the street.  And, and so property started to change and, and same pattern followed the next year on the neighboring street.  And then the other you know adjacent street and, and this was the beginning of you know of essentially white flight in this particular neighborhood. And you know what was interesting was that the folks who were moving in it became known that, that, that this was a place where, where if you were black and, and, and aspiring you could move into this neighborhood. So it really meant that it drew an extraordinary crowd of folk around Cleveland [Ohio] I mean this was you know this was sort of like the first exodus point and so you know they were doctors and lawyers and Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] educated people and, and the white folks who were the neighbors who end up staying, they've you know they've been quoted as saying things like our black neighbors, they were much better educated than we were. And they were better dressed and they were you know, they were you know.  In fact in some sense of some of the white folks actually began to think that they needed to step up their game a little bit in order to, in order to keep up with what their neighbors were.  And so they--everyone--the lawns were, were beautifully manicured and the homes were very, very well cared for and you know there was a, there was a values transmission from the very, just from the visual. By the spring of 1960 it became clear though that they really had to all get together to think about how they were gonna preserve the neighborhood because they were close to a tipping point you know.  And I think it's generally was considered at the time that if about 45 percent black would be a tipping point and if it went much beyond that, chances are the neighborhood would, would revert to being all black.  And, and no one wanted that. They wanted tom they wanted to really kind of keep it--this is when it occurred to them what if we could make it exactly half and half. When no one, no one in America, it's 1960.  [Senator John Fitzgerald] Kennedy, Kennedy and [Vice President Richard Milhous] Nixon hadn't even debated.  You know the New Frontier if you will hadn't even been born.  And so this was a, this was a really dynamic time.  And so they created a neighborhood association.  And they got together with some realtors to say okay, let's agree that if a house is gonna go on the market, if a white family is selling that house, let's try to attract a white family to move in.  And if a black family is selling, we'll try to attract a black family.  And of course it never quite worked like that.  It would be like there'd be six houses on the market and there might be three from black families and three from white families and so the object would be let's maintain that balance.
Speaker 1: So some blacks were moving out as well as when time went on?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean you know I mean that if, if, yes.
Speaker 1: And did Shaker Heights still remain one of the best school districts?
Speaker 2: Oh it was the top school district.
Speaker 1: In the area?
Speaker 2: In, in the country.  It was certainly it consistently ranked among the top school districts in the country.  And so they managed to maintain that balance through the '60s [1960s].  Not without you know, not without some bad feelings about it frankly.  I mean there were certainly, there were blacks who were denied the opportunity to move into this--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --neighborhood and there were a lot of hard feelings about that. There were unusual incentives used to attract whites to move in you know, low interest loans and that sort of thing, just to encourage whites to keep that balance.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and that was extraordinarily controversial but there was a higher vision that was sort of in operation.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Can you tell us the name of the street that you lived on and kind of describe your street for us a little bit?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was called Ashwood Road [Shaker Heights, Ohio].  Our address was 3166 Ashwood.  It was you know, it was a, it was a, a series of 50 x 100 lots, sort of the classic you know American you know post-World War II [WWII] sort of a development. I mean obviously this was developed long before, but, but this was--it, it became the suburban development that, that Levittown became and it became so familiar in post-World War II.  And what was interesting was that there weren't really--I can't think of anyone who was wealthy in our neighborhood and there also, there wasn't really anyone who was poor or if they were frankly they were Eastern European immigrants. But for the most part you know this was an aspiring community but not ostentatious at all.  It was you know simple clapboard houses, a few brick houses, but they were all about the same size and, and there was, you know, if you will, the playing field was level.

Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up, and remind you of your childhood [in Shaker Heights, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Had a lot of cottonwood trees all around.  And the sound of the wind in the cottonwood trees reminds me of home you know because it's the big, big leaves and the wind comes and you can hear 'em and you know in early summer you know the cotton would explode with these little you know sort of seed pods that float around in the air and it looks like sometimes like it's snowing in the summertime and that's very much like my old neighborhood.
Speaker 1: What smells?
Speaker 2: You know that's interesting.  I, I--it's more visual than it is olfactory for me.
Speaker 1: Any food smells that really remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: Oh my mother [Beverly Sinkford Mason] could cook so you know she and you know you name it.  But certainly you know--my grandmother you know my grandmother was a--she was extraordinary, both of them, but on my mother's side what I remember is my grandmother frying chicken.  And my grandmother baking pies, baking biscuits in the morning.  My grandmother, my mother's mother, Marjorie [Adams Sinkford] was her first name, and, and Margie cooked three squares every day.  And it started with biscuits in the morning, hot lunch in the afternoon and a full dinner at night and when her grandchildren were around and she had I think I have twenty-two first cousins on my mother's side--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --and about thirty first cousins on my father's [Theodore Mason] side.  And when on my--when we're at a--in West Virginia in the summertime, my cousins were everywhere and each night my grandmother would each one of the grandchildren had a choice with dessert.  So if it was your day you could pick whatever you want and she would make it.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite dessert?
Speaker 2: Oh, blueberry pie.  Blueberry pie; that was it you know and she could make the best blueberry pies.

Speaker 1: Let's talk now about elementary school.  Can you tell us again the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  It was Ludlow [Elementary] School [Shaker Heights, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Um-hm and were there any particular teachers there who had an influence on you?
Speaker 2: Well Ms. Wheaton [ph.] was my kindergarten teacher and she also taught a second grade.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about her?
Speaker 2: She just was, she was kind and, and young and I had a crush on her. I remember story time and she had a wonderful way with all of us.  I remember, I mean I remember most of my teachers.  I had Mrs. McDermott in first grade and she was a little older and a little bit more stern, but she was a very good teacher.  And Mrs. Klein [ph.] in third grade and she was probably the first Jew who taught and, and we learned about that.  And we certainly you know there were--we had Jewish neighbors.  One of our Jewish neighbors during that, during the early '60s [1960s] when the during the wintertime and the for-sale signs went up, she tells the story of how they thought people were selling their houses because Jews had moved in.  Which I thought was pretty cute.
Story_ID: 245304
Speaker 1: But what I remember about Mrs. Klein's [ph.] class was that I was in Mrs. Klein's class in November of 1963 when [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy was shot.  And I have a vivid memory of being told about that and that we would have an early dismissal that day.  And I and Winston Richie and I walked home together.  What I remember most about that day in walking home was that we had taken these little washers, metal washers and we tied string onto the washers and throw them up in the air and the washer would go up trailed by the string and then the parabola it would come back down and then trailing the string and I remember throwing this up in the air and, and pursuing them and watching it come down and it was a one little piece of joy in what was a really, really sad, sad afternoon.
Speaker 2: And were your parents [Beverly Sinkford Mason and Theodore Mason] home when you got home that afternoon?
Speaker 1: My mother was home yea, my mom was home.
Speaker 2: Did you all talk about it?
Speaker 1: I don't--I think I went out to play. I think I went out to play. I had a green space suit you know.  It was early in the space program you know and I had a little green jumpsuit and Winston had a little green jumpsuit together and it said NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] on it and I think we went out to play and we were and there was something about the you know about the washer and that string and it was like a, you know, it was like a space shot coming back down to earth.  And this was a lot in our consciousness at the time.  What I remembered very clearly though is when [Lee Harvey] Oswald was shot days later.  My father, I think it was the first sort of like television event and I really remembered clearly my father jumping up and, and coming in and saying, "Oh my God, they shot him."  And we all ran into the house to watch and we saw it happen and again, and then I very vivid memories of the funeral you know.
Speaker 2: Did you understand what was going on?  Did you understand what was happening?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 2: You did?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I knew the president was dead.  I mean I was eight years old at the time. So I was old enough to, to have an understanding of it and my parents were really sad.  There was you know what we were doing in Ludlow [Elementary School, Shaker Heights, Ohio] was characterized by an extraordinary sort of optimism and forward lookingness.
Story_ID: 245305
Speaker 1: What we were doing in Ludlow [Elementary School, Shaker Heights, Ohio], this was a New Frontier kind of an idea.  And, and, and it was full of optimism and hope and the sense that, that we were overcoming you know.  And if you think about it that fall right before [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy was killed, well that was the March on Washington and, and many of our neighbors went to the March on Washington.  My parents [Beverly Sinkford Mason and Theodore Mason] didn't because well there were so many of us at home, but, but what [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was talking about at the March on Washington, we were already doing that.  We were living that and we were so proud of the fact that we were in this vanguard.  I don't think I had a conscious knowledge of that but I knew that there was some pride that was being transmitted from my parents and reflected back to me and we were you know Kennedy was like there he is. What I learned later was he really was dragging his feet dealing with the Democratic governors in the South and, and the ways that they were very scared of what Martin was doing and what the [Civil Rights] Movement was doing and how it would jeopardize their ability to be re-elected.  But what we knew was that something was happening, it was you know if you will, it was sort of revolutionary and we were in the middle of it.
Story_ID: 245306
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite subjects in elementary school [Ludlow Elementary School, Shaker Heights, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: All of them.  All of them.
Speaker 1: And what kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was top of the class you know and I knew you know, I mean I, I you know--I liked everything, I loved school.  I worked really, I worked hard but much of it came naturally to me and I was a very high achiever.  I didn't read as well as or let's say I didn't read as fast but I remembered everything I read. And I was very good at making connections.  You know learned this, something I learned over here and how it worked over here and you know. Which, I suppose it makes sense given now what I do.  That's sort of work, that's--
Speaker 1: And what kind of child were you during elementary school years.
Speaker 2: Well, I was a natural leader and I was sort of in charge of everything I knew all the rules in football so when we played football on the playground you know I knew what the rules were and who was doing what and I was sort of assertive about that.  I'm a little embarrassed now when I think about that.  But also I mean everybody listened to me and I was a very good athlete. I was very good at you know football and baseball.  Those are my big sports and we and we just we played all the time and I you know I wanted to be a professional football player that's what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: So when you--that's what you wanted to grow up to do when you were in elementary school?
Speaker 2: I was gonna be a doctor and a professional football player.
Story_ID: 245307
Speaker 1: And I remember one day you know I lived in Cleveland [Ohio] so you know the Cleveland Browns, they were it.  And Jim Brown you know he was it.  And my father [Theodore Mason] was a golfer.  He was a very good golfer.  He was you know a top amateur golfer in northeastern Ohio and had he not been black my father certainly had the opportunity, he could have been a professional golfer but that was not something we did at the time. But my father he knew what he was doing.  And one Sunday afternoon my father came home from the golf course and he--somebody was with him.  It was the biggest person I ever saw.  It was Jim Brown.  And I remember he sat in our kitchen and he did this (crossing arms).  He was wearing a white t-shirt and he did like this (crossing arms) and I, I never seen anything.  Well as it turned out Jim Brown talked a lot of trash at the golf course.  And, and he, and basically he wondered you know he bet a lot and he wanted to play my father and so my father they, they played and my father basically, my father wasn't a big better, but he said I tell you what if I win you get to come home meet my kids.  He kicked Jim Brown's ass.  He brought Jim Brown home.  I remember that, it was really, it was quite a day.
Speaker 2: So were you just like in awe?  What--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) you know just it was Jim Brown--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --oh my God. And football was, was part of the you know it was part of the tradition of, of our family you know.  That's how my father got to college [Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio] this is what we all did you know.  We played a ton of it.  And it was, was really what it was one of the drivers for me you know.  I mean every single day after school we played football in the playground that's what we did.  And the Browns of course, were great then.  And I mean they had a great team and, and we always had seats so we you know every Sunday if there's a home game, we had two seats up in the bleachers which is now called the "Dog Pound" in Cleveland.  But before it was the "Dog Pound," we were, we, we sat there and, and I remember going to the Browns games with my dad and I never saw so many people.  It was a sea of people.  We'd park a ways away and you'd have to walk and there's a big staircase that you walk down to what was the stadium [Cleveland Municipal Stadium; FirstEnergy Stadium, Cleveland, Ohio] then and you could see the lake [Lake Erie] and I never seen so many people and I remember holding on to my father's hand so tight cause I you know. And, and, and he, he, he, he was God he seemed so big and strong and had big hands and, and, and I felt so confident and loved when I was with him. And the Browns they always won.
Speaker 2: And were those very special times that you spent with your father, happy days?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Because he also he taught me how to watch football.  He taught me how to watch.  Taught me what to watch for.  We talked about strategy.  We talked about you know, you know he said watch the guards. Wanna set what they're doing, just watch the guards.  They go forward they're gonna run.  If they pull, they're gonna run a sweep.  If they do--if they back up, they're gonna pass and that's how you know what's coming.  He said and, and, and I you know I watched very closely.  I always studied.  And I went on to become captain of my football team in high school [Shaker Heights High School, Shaker Heights, Ohio] and--
Speaker 2: Did your brothers enjoy it as much as you did?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yeah to be able to go to the game. And we alternated because we didn't get to go to all the games--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but you know you got to alternate.  But then in 1964, they went to the [National Football League] Championship and, and my father got tickets for all of us and we all went and it was, and it was the last time the Browns won but they won that year.  Yeah, they beat the [Baltimore] Colts [Indianapolis Colts] 27 to nothing.  I'll never forget it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It was a real badge of honor now 'cause there're a lot of Cleveland Browns fans still out here in the world and if you can run into somebody a Cleveland Browns fan and say I was there in '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: That's you know, that's old school.
Story_ID: 245308
Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: Not, not regularly but we did.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: We--
Speaker 1: What was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: We started in a place called St. James A.M.E. [Church] which was in Cleveland [Ohio], not too far from where my father's [Theodore Mason] original dental office was, which was on the east side of Cleveland in a predominately black neighborhood.  It was a black neighborhood that's what it was.  We had of course moved to the suburbs but my father kept his practice in the city and that was where most of his patients were.  And as the years went on it became a progressively tougher and tougher neighborhood.  And of course you know I mean this is part of what the suburbanization, the, the growth and integration of the eastern suburbs of Cleveland, part of what it meant was that the middle class base of the east side of Cleveland that was largely black was drifting out into the suburbs and the intra-city itself you know the, the financial base of that community was dropping which meant that the neighborhoods around my father's office were getting tougher, meant that his patients needed him more.
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like in church?
Speaker 2: I--what I mostly remember about, about the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church was that my mother [Beverly Sinkford Mason] and I always had a struggle about I hated wearing ties and I always want to take the tie off and, and of course she always needed me to keep the tie on.  And it was always a race to see whether I could keep the tie on before I got my last foot out the, out the front door of the sanctuary.  That's mostly--excuse me--that's mostly what I remember. I was also sort of a Jack and Jill [of America, Inc.] fugitive.  You know we had started Jack and Jill but the truth was they like wanted us to sit down and sing getting to know you and act like we were sipping tea and I, I just wasn't about all that.  I, I just, I couldn't get with it.
Speaker 1: What did your parents think about Jack and Jill?
Speaker 2: You know I thought--I think that they thought that it was rampantly, rampantly aspiring middle class and that there was something about it that, that my mother knew that my father couldn't get with.  My mother you know was, was as I say you know generations--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --black middle class.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: But my father you know he was--he did not like pretention. And, and he did not want to subscribe to the idea that you had to essentially take on the trappings in order to maintain a place in the social ladder. And, and my mother was also, she was very real and, and so you know it was too saddity.  It was like you know--
Speaker 1: Did your sister like it?
Speaker 2: I, I think by the time my sister [Elizabeth Mason Hopkins] came along, it was--
Speaker 1: You had already given up (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) it was a non-start.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a non-start and we, and we just you know we, we were, we were little rough necks you know.  We wanted to go outside and play and get dirty and, and, and that's what we considered you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Back to church, we as was you know as probably was typical by I think probably the mid-1960s just as the neighborhoods were integrating, the suburban churches were trying to integrate and so we were recruited and we went to a suburban Methodist church.
Speaker 1: You left the A.M.E. church--
Speaker 2: We left the A.M.E. church went to the United Methodist church, a very big united Methodist church [Church of the Saviour, Cleveland Heights, Ohio] in the suburbs, early '60s [1960s], mid-'60s [1960s], '63 [1963], '64 [1964].  And, and I remember going to you know doing bible study and all that you know, largely white and then I remember after [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was assassinated I went to church and the minister didn't say anything about it.  And on the way out of the sanctuary that day my father, his name was Howard Brown, Reverend Howard Brown, and my father went up and said Howard you blew it.  And my father never went back to that church again never, ever returned.  We went.  We went occasionally.  Mostly because the church had a basketball team and they played in a league.  And it was, it was very competitive.  It was very good basketball and, and you know we could like bring our friends and we were on a, we had a team.  So I'm ashamed to say we but we went to church 'cause, 'cause we play basketball.  But it was, it no longer the religious experience of it, it really escaped us.

Speaker 1: Where did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: I went to a junior high school called Woodbury Junior High [School; Woodbury Elementary School, Shaker Heights, Ohio].
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like in junior high school?
Speaker 2: It was--it became very different.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: Because in junior high, we were grouped together with about four other elementary schools that did not have the same neighborhood integration experience that we had.  Three of the junior highs, of the junior highs were all white.  One was all black, well almost all black.  And there was a lot of tension and there was my little group from Ludlow [Elementary School, Shaker Heights, Ohio] who were all kind of you know, you know every things every things.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then there were the, the white kids who really did not know any black kids and then there was the black elementary school and they you know I mean and I'm making fairly broad generations.  Of course there were great kids in all from all these neighborhoods and the question was how do you find the great kids?  And in the process of finding the great kids this is you know, you know that's a tough age.  The process of finding those kids there was an awful lot of other kids who were either little racist white kids who didn't know any better and also you know and then there were little you know little rough neck black kids who you know who didn't like us from Ludlow 'cause they thought that we thought that we were better than them and, and it meant for a lot of tension.
Speaker 1: How did you find a way of fitting in?  Oh I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Well I guess my, my number, my top two tools were one that, that I was smart and I worked hard.  And two, I was a good athlete.
Speaker 1: So, they didn't conflict with one another?
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: In terms of you know being a really smart kid and also being a jock so to speak?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.  In fact there was you know it was encouraged. And there was a group called the leaders and, and it was, it was a phys ed [physical education] based group but you know it, it--if you had good grades and you were a good athlete you could be in "leaders" and being in "leaders" meant that you got to wear like you know a special uniform during gym class and you know chances are it was from the group of the "leaders" who you know most of the captains of the teams were picked and so that was a goal that was like I'm gonna be in "leaders."  Both my brothers [Theodore Mason, Jr. and David Mason] had been in the "leaders" before that and I was you know I had to--there was a bar, the bar was set that's where I was gonna be.  And I, I suppose, I suppose my parents [Beverly Sinkford Mason and Theodore Mason] just taught us that you get good grades you know, you perform you know in sports and everything else will work itself out. That's just how it will be. And, and you know I became captain of the football team and you know and you know I played baseball and basketball but football really was my sport and I became president of the student council and, and I got you know straight A's or close to straight A's and that's what I did.  I was always on the honor roll and you know that's, that was how I coped for the most part.
Story_ID: 245310
Speaker 1: And who were you being influenced by at this particular time in your life, who were you most being influenced by?
Speaker 2: Combination you know.  I mean I had--somewhere I had a pretty good political sense if you will.  So you know I had my friends from Ludlow [Elementary School, Shaker Heights, Ohio] who were both white and black. I made a very, very close friend from the all black elementary school who was--he was a little marginal, he was a little bit of a marginal character.  My parents [Beverly Sinkford Mason and Theodore Mason] were a little upset when we first got to be friends but in fact I kind of rubbed off on him a little bit and he rubbed off on me a little bit and I was a little less of a little goodie too shoes and he started studying harder and, and that was a good friendship. And then I had friendships among the other you know, you know I really sort of and politically who was I?
Speaker 1: Or just in general like were your older brothers influencing you?
Speaker 2: My brothers were very influential. And I was competitive you know.  And I certainly wanted to be able to do and be all that they were. Maybe a little more.  My oldest [Theodore Mason, Jr.] brother he is a genius.  He is a certified genius and he was brilliant.  He'd skipped a grade and I mean and he, he just chewed everybody up academically.  He was, he was extraordinary.  My, my middle brother David [Mason] is also really brilliant but amazingly social.  He had a social gift like few that you would ever see.  My oldest brother is kind of shy and little retiring. My brother David just unbelievable gift.  And my grandfather used to say he would come, come visit us and he would drive around with my mom and my dad and he said in every single street corner I'd see David talking to somebody.  And that was him.  And so, and so I tried to basically do a little bit of both. You know combined the, you know the attributes that they both had.
Speaker 1: And what was happening with your dreams and aspirations?  Were you still aspiring to be a doctor and a football player?--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --during junior high school [Woodbury Junior High School; Woodbury Elementary School, Shaker Heights, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.  That's certainly what I, what I thought. That's what I wanted.
Speaker 1: And what were some of the things that you enjoyed doing during your spare time during junior high?
Speaker 2: Sports.
Speaker 1: So I mean even--
Speaker 2: That's what I--
Speaker 1: --like on the weekends?  Did you like to go to the movies?
Speaker 2: I, you know I mean I think movies some, but they weren't, it wasn't as big a deal at the time. Shopping malls were just starting to be built so that going to the mall was not really the option.  Really what I wanted to do was go play you know and I wanted to you know be on teams and, and compete.  I'm very competitive and I also wanted to compete.
Speaker 1: What about reading?  Did you enjoy reading?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I read sports books you know 'Touch Down Twins,' [Philip Harkins] you know, you know I mean you know that, that's what I read. And then I read Sports Illustrated which sort of started up and--
Speaker 1: Did you have a subscription to Sports Illustrated?
Speaker 2: I think yeah, yeah you know it was certainly, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the high school you attended?
Speaker 2: Shaker Heights High [School, Shaker Heights, Ohio].
Story_ID: 245311
Speaker 1: Were you influenced at all by like any of the nationalist movement or that kind of thing?  Were you influenced at all by that growing up?  Or were you kind of removed from it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Well I mean part of what the, what the rise of black nationalism meant was that was in the course of a decade we went from being essentially revolutionaries to being counter-revolutionaries if you will. I mean the rise of Malcolm X was, was sort of scary in the world where I grew up.  Not for everybody but certainly you know my parents [Beverly Sinkford Mason and Theodore Mason] for the integrationists that my parents were, the idea of going back to Africa was like you know huh?  You can go back to Africa, this is where we live.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and as I now know what I know about our family you know Africa? I, I you know I didn't get it.  And I think that tension has been in black America you know.  Going back to you know the Garveyites and [W.E.B.] Du Bois you know that is, that is sort of classic. And this is just another, another sort of incarnation of it if you will which was you know as Eldridge [Cleaver] and, and H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] and, and Stokely [Carmichael; Kwame Ture] came up and SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] rose, it created a challenge and, and this is really well documented in '65 [1965], '66 [1966].  This became a challenge for [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  And that was exactly when I was going to junior high school [Woodbury Junior High School, Shaker Heights, Ohio]. The question is how you reconcile nonviolent revolution with violent revolution or, or at least the idea that we're gonna call ourselves black and we're not gonna be afraid of confrontation and we're gonna get up in the man's face if the man is not gonna acknowledge who we are.  And, and that created an extraordinary tension that played itself out in junior high. Because you know as I say you got these integrationists, which is what we were, and then you got the kids from Moreland [Elementary School, Shaker Heights, Ohio] who were really from a--lived in a segregated community which is largely a black community who represented a lot of the dynamic that, that Stokely was talking about and then you got these--all these kids from the white elementary schools who kind of represented the power elite if you will and, and it all played out in, in, in all of the other tensions that represent junior high school. So, so you know you had elementary school friends who suddenly weren't necessarily talking to one another or they, they were separated by either race or class. And I find myself trying to bridge all worlds you know 'cause I kept my white friends and I made new black friends and I also and I got called an Uncle Tom and an Oreo and a, and a you know and a nigga and I mean I got called everything.  And all I did was hang on to my schoolwork, hang onto my sports, get involved in the student council you know just sort of try to stay on the beam. And, and then you got all the stuff of hormones and you know girls and learning how to dance and, and all of that which is an entire 'nother layer here that, that just sort of made it a strange stew. And I, I wouldn't want to go back there for the life of me but I, but I think that it was important and a great lesson.
Story_ID: 245312
Speaker 1: In high school [Shaker Heights High School, Shaker Heights, Ohio] you were on the football team?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you said student council?
Speaker 2: In high school I was not in student council but I was president of my sophomore class and president of my senior class. You know gave the graduation speech you know, captain of the football team, was on the baseball team you know, I was in a choir you know.  I was in the musicals.  You know I sort of, I sort of did all stuff.
Speaker 1: And so when you were in high school, what were some of your thoughts about college?
Speaker 2: I was going to school where my brother went.  I was going to Wesleyan [University, Middletown, Connecticut]. I was going east and I was gonna go to Wesleyan 'cause my brother was there and I been there and I knew it was kind of cool and that's what I was gonna do and I you know and I pretty much knew it from you know from my sophomore year.
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-three [1973].
Speaker 1: So when you went to Wesleyan, what were your experiences like there?  Was your brother still there?
Speaker 2: No, he, he had gone by then. It was, it became very confused for me because while I was--as long as I was in Shaker Heights [Ohio] I lived in a world that, that at least the world around me was somewhat grounded and however conflicted and understanding the world that, that all of us more or less got.  Shaker Heights was a little cocoon at the time and, and you know there're very few places that would be like that or that might understand that.  When I got to Wesleyan, there was a lot of conflict.  I was greatly conflicted about racial identity and about, and about achievement and about fitting into a world and, and by then Watergate [scandal] had happened.  And I say that because for all the revolutionary change that happened in the '60s [1960s] from you know from both the movement and the assassinations of both the Kennedys [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy] and [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  There was still a sense of possibility.  I think that Watergate which really happened as I was you know [President Richard Milhous] Nixon resigned after my freshman year, but the turmoil of, of Watergate and the fact that government was truly corrupt, really shook me and I don't think I understood at the time, but it, but it sort of shook a lot of my understandings, my notions of the world because being an American who believed in America that the president would lie and as we later learn what the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] did to King you know I, I was really, I was really idealistic and, and, and suddenly a lot of my fundamental understandings of the world changed, and, and, and as that changed, my concept of race and my questions about race were shaken.
Speaker 1: Shaken how?
Speaker 2: Well you know I mean when I got Wesleyan, the black community was, was extraordinarily separate and much more militant, strident.  I remember Stokely [Carmichael; Kwame Ture] came and spoke.  Got to remember it's '73 [1973] now '74 [1974] and people were talking about the [Civil Rights] Movement had died and people were complacent and you're kind of revolutionary and how come you're not, if you're not part of the problem, you're part of the solution and then you know but [the] Vietnam [War] was ending.  And Vietnam had been a galvanizing experience and we understood where things, where things were, but when Vietnam ended suddenly what was, what were we talking about here.  And it became about economics and about social justice.  But, but true about economics which means when you get out of here what are you gonna do?  How do you get a job?  Where do you stand?  How do you make it in a world that, that the man controls? And, and I think that as you're coming into your adulthood, I think when I--as I was coming into adulthood I wondered whether or not the deck was stacked and that was really quite different from the understanding I had of the world of, world of infinite possibilities as a child.  And I had to; I had to seek out my own definition.  I had to, had to test it to understand.
Story_ID: 245313
Speaker 1: Suddenly I met black folks who didn't understand the Shaker Heights [Ohio] experience and who hated white people and didn't wanna talk to any white people, didn't know any, didn't understand it at all.  And I met white people who in the same way didn't understand why all the black people were at the black house and you know what's wrong with them and once again I was kind of straddling the two worlds trying to understand that.
Speaker 2: So y'all had a black house on campus?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you spend a lot of time there?
Speaker 1: Not a lot of time. I mean I would never life at the black house, but did I go to you know the black student movement, you know the Ujima meetings?  Yeah, I went to the meetings.  Hung out just to see what was going on and you know when to the parties and you know.  My freshman year I lived in a you know everybody gets assigned to dorms and so I lived in a dorm called Clark Hall and it was--Clark Hall was like the zoo.  It you know, it was a lot of wild stuff going on at Clark Hall and, and I was on the--I went out for the football team at Wesleyan [University, Middletown, Connecticut] but and I would have made it I would have started as a freshman but they, they, they really didn't--I felt that the coaches didn't really want me to you know work as hard in academics.  They were scheduling practices that would make it difficult for me to do the studying I wanted to do so I quit.  And they were very angry.  They were very upset that I quit because again you know I was really a promising player. And I went back to play intramural football and I played for my dorm team.  And we had a good team and I was like one of the you know top players on this team and we played against the brothers one day.  And, and the brother's team was called Superfly.  So I played--we were Clark Hall against Superfly and I think I caught like five touchdown passes on, on a couple of these brothers you know.  And I was diving and making all kind of--and, and the next thing after that game was over I was in my dorm room just kind of hanging out and, and a knock on my door and here come a couple of brothers from Superfly going who are you?  What are you doing and how come we don't know anything about you and, and, and they became you know they like brought me into their group and I mean a bunch of these guys are my buddies now. We've been lifelong friends. And it began a contact with just again I suddenly you know sort of like through athletics and, and you know I sort of had a foot in both worlds and it was something that I managed well at home but didn't manage as well in college because I think that, that at the time you--a lot of people gave you a sense you had to make a choice and I was never comfortable making that choice.
Story_ID: 245314
Speaker 1: What did you decide to study when you went to college?
Speaker 2: Well I thought by then I'd given up the idea that I was gonna be a professional football player and I'd also given up the idea I was gonna be a doctor because I really did horribly in tenth grade [at Shaker Heights High School, Shaker Heights, Ohio] in chemistry.  And, and I thought by then maybe I was gonna study psychology.  But then I took a psychology course my freshman year and I did horribly in that.  But the one thing that I had started in college--in high school, my senior year of high school, I, I learned to read Greek and I, and I continued in Greek at--as a freshman at Wesleyan [University, Middletown, Connecticut] and I'm really good at it.  Like I, I read Greek and I do it very, very well.  And I, and I was kind of like an ace.  And I said well, I'll just keep doing it and I'll, I'll study others, but I'll just keep doing it.  And, and I did and I expanded my studies to philosophy and classical history and, and finally after sophomore year I realized I had enough credits if I just kept going, I could--this could be my major.  And I thought maybe I'll go to law school but I enjoyed the process and I enjoyed this liberal education.  And, and I, and I, and I excelled.  So I said this is what I will do.  So I, so I was a classical civilization's major and I read you know, read Herodotus and I read Homer, I've read you know 'The Odyssey' and 'The Iliad' in the original and, and I read you know Sophocles and Plato and you know Herodotus' '[The] Histories' and Aristophanes and, and I went to Italy and I studied, I studied history and archeology in, in Rome [Italy] and all throughout the Italian peninsula.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  What--you went to Italy as an exchange student?
Speaker 2: This was a semester abroad as a--when I was a senior, yeah.  And it really was my first time in Europe and it sort of blew my mind.  And it took--
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: One, because then I was--this was part of consortium with twelve other schools you know Harvard [University, Cambridge Massachusetts] and Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] and Stanford [University, Stanford, California] and so you're in a--I was in a group of with classicists from all these schools and, and, and I was, I was like the top Greek reader you know and we performed you know like Aris--a play by Aristophanes and, and you know literally in a big--in Sicily [Italy] in a bid stadium near Syracuse [Italy].  And we performed 'The Clouds' and, and I was the best Greek reader.  I played Socrates you know and in Greek you know.  I mean it was, it was quite an experience but, but it, it blew my--it blew the world my concept of the world open 'cause I'd been you know for three years in sort of this very, very superheated environment of Wesleyan and race. And it fucked me up, excuse me.  It just, it just sort of messed me up.  And I went to Italy suddenly I was out of sort of that tinder box and, and I came to a more, a broader understanding of myself which was you know what it's a big world out here and this is a very, very small sort of you know I loved Wesleyan and I thought I learned an awful lot that were things that were really, really important.  But I thought it was narrow it was very, very narrow. And if I had to do it over again I'd probably would have picked a much--a big school.
Story_ID: 245315
Speaker 1: What, were you thinking that you still wanted to go to law school your senior year?
Speaker 2: Yeah I thought I was gonna to law school. Yeah I thought I'd end up you know I'd take a couple of years off and, and work and then apply to law school and go to law school.
Speaker 1: So when did journalism come into play?
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: How did that happen?
Speaker 2: I, I went to where?  I went to--when I got out of school I went back to Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: What year did you earn your degree?
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977].  Went back to Cleveland and, and I worked in a restaurant, waited tables for a summer.  I figure I just wanna earn some money just you know kick back.  And, and then I start substitute teaching.  And so I was waiting tables at night, substitute teaching in the day and I was kind of enjoying that.  It was kind of fun and I really didn't like waiting tables very much.  So then I decide I wanna maybe I'll work for a couple of years teaching and I did and I, and I got a job at a Quaker school on Long Island [New York] where I was teaching English, high school English, coaching football, basketball and baseball, driving the school bus in the morning for preschoolers.  I mean I, I you know it was wall-to-wall you know Friends Academy [Locust Valley, New York].
Speaker 1: What is the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Friends Academy.
Speaker 1: Oh Friends Academy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and I lived on the campus.  I mean it was basically it was indentured servitude you know I got paid $11,000, I lived on the campus.  I woke up at 5:30 in the morning, drove the school bus for the preschoolers, taught all day, coached at night, graded papers, woke up did the you know it was crazy.  And just as I was just starting to do that the second year, the hostages were taken in Iran.  And this whole Islamic fundamentalist thing blew up and I was like whoah, and every day I would listen to news on the radio as I was shaving.  I never watched any television. You know television was--I watched television with my mom [Beverly Sinkford Mason] in the late '60s [1960s], watched network news every night with my mom to watch [the] Vietnam [War] and then Watergate [scandal] and she and I spent you know from '67 [1967] through '74 [1974], we'd watch the evening news and we talked about it but then after '70 [1970]--after I went to Wesleyan [University, Middletown Connecticut] I stopped watching television, I never watched any television except I watched baseball games.  And then so I started listening to radio.  I was re-injecting myself into media.  So I'd listen to radio and news as I was shaving in the morning then I'd go into class and I'd talk about what I heard on the radio.  And my students of course being students would encourage me to talk about what I heard on the radio so I didn't talk about [William] Faulkner or you know or, or, or Nella Larsen or whatever and interest captured my imagination.  And so I, I said you know two years doing high school, teaching high school, this is fine but I gotta go.  And I applied to Columbia [University, New York, New York] for journalism school and I applied to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to get a master's [degree] in education and I applied to the Peace Corps.  I said at the end of this year I'm gonna, I'm gonna choose one of these three things.  We'll see what happens.  We'll see where I get in and what happens.  And I got into Harvard and I got into Columbia and I got into the Peace Corps.  And so the choice was was I gonna go to [Republic of] Sierra Leone?  Was I gonna go to Harvard?  Or was I gonna go to Columbia?  And just the, you know the journalism it just grabbed me.  And so I went to Columbia.
Story_ID: 245316
Speaker 1: What, at that particular time when you went to Columbia [University, New York, New York] what was happening with TV and journalism at that time?
Speaker 2: To be absolutely truthful with you, I don't have a clue.  Because what, what I, I was gonna go be a reporter for The New York Times.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. So you were gonna be a print man.
Speaker 2: I was, I was gonna go to print. You know, I--it didn't matter to me you know.  Television was not something I was thinking about.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know I wanted to go write. But it happened that, that everyone takes six weeks television and, and my mentor, a guy named Penn Kimball at Columbia, who was a senior faculty member, he, he noticed. He said, "You know you got a, you got a kind of knack in television.  I think you ought to think about that."  I said, "Penn, I wanna, I wanna be in The New York Times like you were."  He said, "Don't be stupid.  Go to television, you can go, you know, that's a license to print money, go into television."  And, and it happened that I was--I entered the fall of 1980 at which it would mean I'd graduated the spring of 1981 and in March of 1981 Max Robinson went to Smith College [Northampton, Massachusetts] and he was, at the time he was one of the three anchors of, of Roone Arledge's 'World News Tonight.'  Roone had started here at ABC in 1978. And he was revolutionizing what ABC News was.  He was bringing some of what was ABC Sports and 'Wide World of Sports' into news and so what had been a staid and somewhat stodgy and also--ran news division was suddenly picking up and they hired Max to be an anchorman, so here was a black anchorman at ABC.  And after three years of that Max went to Smith College and gave a speech and marched where he basically criticized the network for being, you know, basically back in the, back in the '50s [1950s] in terms of race and in terms of, you know, he was window dressing, that there was no one behind the scenes making any decisions.  There was no one--you know you couldn't find a black anywhere in a position of power who actually called the shots and that all he did was came on and he, and he read the news. And, and at the time I was, you know, I wasn't paying much attention to this but I was excelling in television.  And by then I was in our television workshop and I was kind of, I was kind of running the deal you know.  We'd put on a weekly television show and, and--
Speaker 1: Was it a news show?
Speaker 2: Yeah we put on a weekly news show and when it--and we worked Thursday and Friday.  And by Friday afternoon the show was on and whenever I had an opportunity to run the deal, that's what I was all about.  Let's run it, let's go. Let's get it, you know.  And you know I mean it was--I was back to being the captain of the football team.  Back to being student council president you know, like here we go.  And I was very, very comfortable and I loved the edit room and I loved being out in shooting and I loved everyday kind of talking to people, it just, it just you know I was in my, I hit my stride.
Speaker 1: Did you ever think about, were you loving the producing aspect and the decision making that went into producing or what was some of your thoughts about being on air?
Speaker 2: Well I loved it all; I loved it all you know.  It just all was--it was a whole new world. It was, it was something that, you know.  And my father [Theodore Mason] was a dentist as I said.  My mother [Beverly Sinkford Mason] was a social worker.  I had a--my mother has a cousin, had a cousin who worked for NBC in the '60s [1960s] and was a reporter at the White House [Washington, D.C.], a guy named Bill Madden.  It was one of the few black people who ever you know, you know, you could imagine when I was growing up, when a black person was on television everybody would call out, oh my god quick--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --come look.  But somebody was making decisions behind the scenes, unheard of.  So, so by the spring of '81 [1981] Max gives his speech and I'm, I'm not paying attention, I'm just trying to, you know, keep my head down and do what my parents taught me to do which was achieve.
Story_ID: 245317
Speaker 1: And unlike undergraduate [Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut] which my parents [Beverly Sinkford Mason and Theodore Mason] paid for I was paying for grad school and so this was you know I was gonna come out with something.  And, and in the spring time as you graduated, Columbia [University, New York, New York] they had a series of things that you might win and the top people in the class win money and they go somewhere to do something which gets you a leg up on getting a job and the top ones are the traveling, traveling fellowships which typically go to print reporters and I had made a decision I was not gonna--so I was kind of not getting the, the, the traveling--they call them the traveling Pulitzers I think that's what they called them.  I was not gonna (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause by then you knew you wanted to be in TV?
Speaker 1: I was, I was concentrating on television.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: So I knew I was gonna get that, but there was this other thing from the Overseas Press Club [of America] which was, which was a grant several thousand dollars and my mentor [Penn Kimball] pulled me aside and said look, get one of these.  And I said okay.  And there'd been some riots that had broken out in England, race riots, that had broken out in England that spring in Brixton, South London [England].  And I thought that's really interesting.  I wanna go there.  I wanna go there, I'm going to live in that community, I'm gonna check out what's going on.  So I wrote a proposal, submitted it and I won.  So I got I don't know I think five thousand dollars and I went to England and, and I, and I you know and I lived there for the summer and, and as I was on my way out the door, one of my professors had been an ABC producer and so she said look while you're there, go look up this guy and it was the bureau chief for ABC News in London.  So I went to go meet him.  I went.  I got an apartment in South London in Brixton and I started going to the pubs, being a reporter just hanging out listening to what people were talking about, making contacts.  There was a trial going on because there had been some mess in the, in the April riots that had led to a trial so every day I was going to the what was called the Scarman Inquiry [Brixton Inquiry and Scarman Report] and it's not quite famous. And every day I was at the Scarman Inquiry taking notes and making contacts and I was in the pubs at night and I was you know meeting all the Rastas and, and, and then I hooked up at ABC and, and I started saying you know y'all need to understand that something's about to happen.  And I met this guy who their correspondent over there Peter Jennings and I met his senior producer and we sort of had to--and I said dude you got to you know, you got to understand that something's happening.  [Bob] Marley had just died.  Marley had died the day I graduated from Columbia, and, and so we were all listening to Reggae and everywhere you went and, and on Railton Road in Brixton they were listening to reggae and they were talking about burning and looting and you know it was live and I said it's about to go down.  You need to, you need to pay attention.  And they're like what are you talking about.  I said everybody was talking about the royal wedding.  I said that's not the story.  So, so sure enough they said well that's interesting.  That's interesting young man.  And if you'd like to work on the weekends on our assignment desk you can, you can come in and work on our assignment desk.  I said great, sure.  So the first weekend I went to work on the assignment desk and it came up on the wires that, that smoke was coming up from the black section in, in Liverpool, called Toxteth [England], and that there'd been a little bit of unrest the night before but that it was sun down and it was starting again.  And I, I left my post.  I went right to the train station, got on the train.  I was in Liverpool.  I got there about eight at night and I went right to Toxteth and, and it blew up.  It just blew up.  It was huge.  I mean they were like, I watched as they blew up a bank.  They like Molotov cocktails boom, blew up the bank.  Went in the liquor store, blew up the liquor store, started putting chairs on the street watching as the bank was burning.  They were throwing you know Molotov cocktails at the, at the fire department who was coming in and the cops came in with rubber bullets and, and the whole--it was such a big story it was on the cover of Newsweek and Time that week.  And I was in the middle of all of it.  And I called into ABC to say well I, I was there I saw it all and they said don't move.  And they sent their folks in and I gave them the whole tour and I told them do you need to meet this person, meet this person, bah, bah, and and they said, "You're hired.  We want you to work for us.  And we'll pay you one hundred dollars a day" and I thought, "A hundred bucks a day, wow that's a lot of money.  Great."  And I've worked for ABC ever since.
Story_ID: 245318
Speaker 1: And so you were hired as a producer?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't have a title for what I was. I just kind of was you know, you know basically I mean frankly I was the nigga who, who knew a bunch of stuff.  So I came back, I came back to London [England].  I'll never forget this because they had the tapes, they had the videotape and I was up in Liverpool [England] and, and they had to get the tape back to London to get on the evening news so they said listen we want you to bring the tape back.  I said okay great.  And they said there's a plane waiting for you at the airport.  And I said a plane, my own plane?  And there's a motorcycle that's gonna take you to the airport.  So I'm carrying and I'm on the back of the motorcycle, got the tapes, I'm going to the airport, I'm going like oh man my parents [Beverly Sinkford Mason and Theodore Mason] won't believe this.  I get to the airport and there's a pilot, he's waiting for me.  We get up in the plane and he says oh great and we take off and now we're up over the Mersey River [River Mersey] and we're up over Liverpool and I realize it's me and this guy and I go you know if he has a heart attack up here, I'm fucked, I'm, I'm done.  So I, so I start asking him everything about how to fly a plane.  Oh so what are you doing now?  How do you do that?  Now what?  I was gonna learn how to fly this plane in case something happens make sure, but everything was fine and we landed.  I later learned it was completely against company policy to have anybody flying a single engine plane with no co-pilot.  That someone had died two years before doing exactly what they had asked me to do and that they made a policy couldn't do it anymore but I wasn't an employee.  So they could, they could put me up and they could make me a pigeon. So that was, that was the beginning.
Speaker 1: So when you were in Liverpool, can you just kind of tell us a little bit about you know what was happening inside.  I mean did you feel like okay this is what I was born to do?
Speaker 2: I was in my element.  This was it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: -This was it.  You know when I was a kid my dad and I would chase fire hydrants--fire, fire trucks.  You know if there--if ever in the middle of the night a fire truck was going somewhere, we were up.  Let's go, where's it going?  And it took me back to that. It was, was--
Speaker 1: The adrenaline?
Speaker 2: The adrenaline oh my God you know and it was not unlike the adrenaline of a football game. Not unlike the adrenaline of, of taking a test.  You know everything's cranking you know and all you know all synapses are firing. You know I experimented a lot with drugs when I was in college and, and there was something about this you know this was the drug experience without drugs you know this was the most powerful drug there is.  This is adrenaline. It was like oh my God, this is for me. And that, and that was you know--
Speaker 1: The beginning?
Speaker 2: --that was the beginning.
Story_ID: 245319
Speaker 1: So after Liverpool [England] and after you got your job--the job at ABC, how long did you stay in London [England]?
Speaker 2: I left the morning of the royal wedding.
Speaker 1: You left?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I was, I was you know I was working for you know--I--the story of race percolated for another month, six weeks.  And, and there were several more you know there was riots in Manchester [England] and I was in Manchester and there were more riots in Brixton [London, England] and I was--and I'd kind, I'd kind of gotten the point where I could kind of say you know I heard this in, in Brixton you better be here on Saturday night and then it would happen and then they suddenly I mean you have to understand that ABC--the organization at the time wow I mean it was, it was all white.  And here I was and then I could also then sort of say this might happen and I actually you know accurately told them a couple of times when I'd heard based on information I had about living in the community they suddenly thought well he knows what black people think which--and, and again that's a fairly broad brush characterization but, but there was certainly a sense of that.  But then as the royal wedding came up, I watched as the focus shifted and suddenly I watched--you know news--we have news cycles and this is not new and I watched a story that I was on get moved from the front page, it was very disillusioning to me because I thought I don't care about the prince--about Prince Charles.  I don't care about Princess Diana [Spencer Mountbatten-Windsor] but I watched as all the muckety mucks from New York [New York] came to London. Everybody suddenly was in London.  And the executive producer who I had heard as a voice on the phone suddenly he showed up and, and you know there were multitudes descended for this thing and I, I was very anti-royals.  I did not like the royals.  I didn't like what they stood for and so I said you know I said I'm leaving, good bye.  Which surprised ABC, they you know and I left. And I went home and I you know just kind of hung out for a while and I spent a couple of weeks and they found me.  They found me and said where'd you go?  Please come back.  We want to offer you a job.  I said well you know I don't know, we'll see.  And I, I was pretty cocky.  And I was trying out for, for an on camera job for, for public television in New Jersey, for the 'New Jersey Nightly News.'  I thought maybe I will be on I don't know we'll see.  So I tried out for that and, and I also had an offer from ABC and I was weighing.  So ABC offered me what they call an off air reporters job which is you're not a producer, but you're not a reporter, you just, but you know you go out with camera crews, you go out in the field and it's a, it's a thing to sort of test the waters to see if you wanna be a producer it was a good place to jump from. If you want to be a reporter you could do that.  It was, it's a, it's, it's sort of a middle job.  And they offered me $22,000 which was double what I was getting paid as a teacher.  And I called my mentor, I called Penn Kimball and I said, "Penn, they offered me a lot of money."  And he said, "Well don't take it."  I said, "What do you think I should do?"  And he said to me, he said, "Listen if you don't act like Reggie Jackson, they're not gonna treat you like Reggie Jackson."  I said, "You're right."  He said, "So they got to pay you more.  Tell them you got loans and that they gotta pay you more."  I said, "Okay."  So I said no, let's--so I followed instructions.  And they said, "Okay.  We'll give you $24,000."  I said, "Sold."  I took the job right away.  And--
Speaker 1: And that was here in New York?
Speaker 2: That was here in New York.
Story_ID: 245320
Speaker 1: How important was it for you to really bring the black perspective to news coverage during, during those early days and how, how effective were you at doing that?
Speaker 2: I didn't think about it.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: I didn't think about it.  What I thought about was, what is this organization [ABC]?  What are they trying to do, how can I make a mark?  And--
Speaker 1: And how did you think you could make a mark?
Speaker 2: I don't know I had to figure out the organization first.
Speaker 1: But did you feel like that the black perspective was missing like when you looked at the news, did you see the black perspective as a viewer who was watching the news?
Speaker 2: I think the most obvious thing initially was boy every time they do crime story, they show black people in handcuffs. And that was really upsetting and when I walked into the room to the very first time I walked into the room here in New York [New York], there were no black people, there were no black people and I was like whoa and when I went and I sat in someone's seat, they talked to me like you know they came on like who was I and what was I doing in their seat and this was a fairly you know low level researcher and they clearly didn't understand well see I was a guy came from London [England]--
Story_ID: 245321
Speaker 1: So the only black people were sound, sound recordists, occasional cameramen, not many, tape editors and then one or two correspondents.  They actually had to bring George [A.] Strait [Jr.] up from Washington [D.C.] for me to meet a black who's on the what we call the editorial side and, and we had one brother who was assignment editor named Eric Tate [ph.] who worked the overnight and Eric was like the original angry black man at ABC News.  And--
Speaker 2: And can you just explain quickly what an assignment editor does?
Speaker 1: Assignment editor basically keeps track of the news.  Reads the wires, talks to our affiliate stations, our owned and operated stations, and when something happens, they're the first responders you know.  They are the people who, who find a way to get camera crews and reporters and producers on a location in order to in order to make sure that the story is covered. And then they work to figure out a way to transmit, video tape or live picture you know it's all, it's all sort of like editorial and logistics. And, and so early on the issue of diversity we focused on.  And I sort of teamed with George Strait, Ray Nunn who was, who was one of our experienced producers, came from CBS News was in our Washington bureau at the time, [HistoryMaker] Carole Simpson joined us in '82 [1982], Claudia Pryor [Malis] came in '82 [1982], she was a producer.  But I mean soon there became a nucleus of, of both producers and a couple of correspondents that, that started to look at the issue of, of diversity in our newsroom. And, and the organization certainly wanted to take part in that, but I'm not sure they knew how.  Early on I was you know I was that--sort of pulled me into an office and as they noticed that I was having success you know someone literally said to me you know, we just like more people like you.  You know can you help us find more people like you?  And you know that was part of the early struggle.
Speaker 2: And why is it important to have diversity in a newsroom, not necessarily just on air, but behind the scenes as well?
Speaker 1: Well, you know information and the conveyance of information is, is both central to, to democracy itself and its power, images of power, information and the shaping of information is a form of power, in a democracy, in a you know, in a dictatorship.  And what happens when there is a coup in the country?  One of the first things that happens is that the television station is seized and so, so the ability to influence the message is vital.  Part of why this entire thing--why, why, why the intersection of diversity and journalism began in this country was after the riots in the mid-'60s [1960s] when the Kerner Commission [The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders] met to say part of why we're having the problems we're having today is that the media itself only reflects one face of America and this is a problem.  Well by the time I came to ABC it was 1981.  The Kerner Commission I think made its findings in 1968.  And by 1981 that still had not been translated to the major American networks.  There'd been minor progress but not significant progress. And I'll say to ABC's credit when they brought me in, you know senior vice president sat me in an office up here and said listen if you wanna go on camera and be a correspondent, we can make that happen.  We think you would be great.  But if you wanna be a producer let me tell you this, there is great opportunity here.  This is something that very few people are doing black or white but certainly black, we just don't have it.  This is the avenue of power.  This is where the decisions get made.  And in order to do that these are the things you have to do and if you're interested, you know, we've got a place you know to try to make that happen. And so that was an early message and I've gotta tell you I'm all about power.  You know that's why I was captain of the football team.  That's why I was president of the student council because I wanna move things.  That's, that's part of who I, who I always have been.

Speaker 1: During the early years here at ABC, you went on to work as a producer for 'Good Morning America'?
Speaker 2: I was operations producer for our overnight news and the overnight news certainly fed into 'Good Morning America' and I did that early on after working here for nine months I realized that the power was in the tape. Who has the tape and who gets to cut the tape--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and who gets to shape the tape?  And in my early first few months here, they would let me go out and shoot the video tape but when I'd bring it back in the house, I'd have to give it to someone else. And it would go and it would disappear in that edit room and then I couldn't touch it.  And, and part of it is because this is a unionized skill the actual touching the machines, that's a union skill, but also the editorial person who sits with the editor--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --well not all the white people did that you know.  The young aspiring young white producers and that's what ABC was and the best in the business you know.  My colleagues they were great, but that's where it was.  I had to give that tape up and, and I decided I had to go somewhere where I could learn what they were doing in that room and so the only place was that for me to go to the overnight when you know, you know as you might imagine that's that's, that's where it was less desirable shift but it's where I had far more latitude to learn the skills in the industry and that's what I did for two years.
Speaker 1: And did you find that once you handed off the tape and it was edited and you know produced by someone else that the perspective was a little different than yours?
Speaker 2: Not always.
Speaker 1: Not always?
Speaker 2: There were times. There were, there were I mean there would be some occasions, but for the most part I mean it's just that somebody else got to pick the shots you know.  I mean not everything is, is an act of race or revolution.  It might be as simple as oh it wasn't as good a shot as the one that I designed, I designed this bad shot and they didn't use that--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --you know.  So but certainly yes having, having the ability to be in the room to make the decision means that there are critical times when you can influence but you can't do it unless you're in the room.
Story_ID: 245323
Speaker 1: Let's move on a little bit and talk about the emergence of news-magazine format shows, news, magazine format shows like 'PrimeTime Live.'  Can you just kind of give us a little bit of history and background on just how they came about?
Speaker 2: Well let's see, '20/20' was born I think in the late '70s [1970s].  It was something that Roone Arledge created and, and created with--shortly after Barbara Walters was brought over from NBC and did not do well on the evening news.  And of course, this was '60 Minutes' was the original magazine, PrimeTime magazine format and it had--it spent several years floundering really and wasn't until it found its Sunday night slot that it began to hit.  Roone thought that he could take Barbara Walters and, and create a similar thing in prime time called '20/20' and they did and it did very, very well after a while, but not initially.  But I was here in the late 1980s when 'PrimeTime Live' was created.  And at the time I was working in our Miami [Florida] office and it was an opportunity.  You know part of the, part of the progression in television is that you know you learn to do a minute and a half, a minute ten, which what we called buck ten.  You do a buck ten and that's the morning news format.  Then you do a minute thirty; buck forty five, that's evening news.  Maybe you do two forty-five and that's kind of the, the you know the closer look, the, the spotlighted segment in the evening news and then maybe you learn to do four minutes and that's an even more sort of a spotlighted feature and then the next step up is your magazine piece and magazine piece is you know eight to twelve minutes and I was hitting a glass ceiling.  I'd gotten to--I'd done a buck ten, buck thirty, buck forty, two thirty, four minutes but that was always in the evening news format and to break to the next level would mean go to magazine.  'PrimeTime Live' was started I think in 1989 and I desperately wanted to go to magazine.  There were a few blacks at ABC working the magazine, Claudia Pryor [Malis] who was brilliant, a couple others but boy somehow I couldn't get there.  And when 'PrimeTime' started there was a lot rumor they were gonna ask me except the staff was--there were no minorities on that staff and, and a couple of years went by and they did not ask me and I continued to work you know I was working in and out of Latin America.  You know I was in Nicaragua and I was in El Salvador and I was in--did covering the drug war in Colombia and in Panama and I was you know, I was getting significant field experience doing a lot of different things but I, but I couldn't break four minutes.  And finally I confronted the executive producer of the broadcasting, Rick Kaplan, who--and he told me I wasn't experienced enough and I hit the roof.  I was so angry that I went and had meetings with the vice presidents and I said I don't know what you're talking about if I don't have the experience then you gotta tell me who does 'cause these are all the things I've done and I've done what everybody told me I was supposed to do and sure enough after a little bit I got a spot.  And, and these broadcasts tend to be for some reason they you know we are not as diverse in our magazine format.  We're doing a little bit better now.
Speaker 1: Diverse in terms of staff or coverage?
Speaker 2: Staff and coverage. And certainly there have been, there was a time when the people who were running those broadcasts were intentionally skewing those broadcasts towards more mainstream subjects.  That's a fact. And they've been called on it.  They got called on it and we actually had studies done that showed in fact the level of the loyalty of minority audience to network magazine shows and particular at ABC because we are very, very--we draw very strong ratings in major American cities.  Our owned and operated stations in the major markets you know do very, very well and we have a larger minority audience than the other guys.  But it was only after sort of that sort of thing that we're able to break that.  And even now you know it's tough, it's tough.
Story_ID: 245324
Speaker 1: I want to talk about one of the pieces I believe you produced when you were at 'PrimeTime Live,' "Judgment at Midnight," was that 'PrimeTime Live'?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah "Judgment" was a story of, of Angola prison [Louisiana State Penitentiary] in [Angola] Louisiana and the story of, of a death row inmate a man named Antonio James and, and his final week before his scheduled execution.  Antonio had, had been slated to die earlier and at the last minute gotten a stay and in the course of getting a stay, he'd had you know sort of the last day rituals and contact with the warden and both bonded over their Christianity.  They were both born again.  And so this you know inmate and this warden their religion on, and, and the warden introduced us to Antonio and said this is a really interesting story.  And we start following him and sure enough they said we could follow him for this last week as we watched the countdown.  And we got extraordinary access amazing access and got to really probe the issues of life, death, religion, redemption and watched the warden himself confront the death penalty because he had promised his wife in his criminal justice career that he would never take a job where he had to put someone to death and Antonio was his first.  So he broke a promise to his wife and it was with Antonio and ultimately Antonio lost his appeals and, and was put to death.
Speaker 1: What about the piece "Black in White America"?
Speaker 2: That was an experiment really that, that Roone Arledge inspired in I think yeah in the summer of 1989.  And again ABC had been under considerable criticism as had all the networks for, for you know regarding diversity and promotion.  And Roone said okay let's do an hour and we'll have you know and it will be you know let's turn, turn an hour of the television network over to black producers and correspondents and let them tell us their vision of America. And, and that was what we did.  And it was you know I mean the truth is we probably had far too many people working on it and it was a bit of a potpourri but, but we're proud of it, we're proud of the work.
Speaker 1: And do you think that it was successful just in terms of providing a different perspective to the general public to just viewers in general?
Speaker 2: Some.  Maybe.
Speaker 1: But not really though?
Speaker 2: I don't know I mean I, I think that we actually took a fairly, a fairly tough look at, at, at a family that lived in the housing project in, in Chicago [Illinois].  I think that--but I--to me I mean that was I thought that was, that was a tremendous piece.  There were several pieces that I thought were standout pieces in this hour. That was one of them.  It was another piece on the Tuskegee Airmen that was I thought an outstanding piece and there was a piece that started off the broadcast that sort of played off of the, the experiment that, that I think [Dr.] Kenneth Clark originally did with dolls white and black dolls that--so I'm proud of it.  Yeah it was good work.
Story_ID: 245325
Speaker 1: And in 1997 you decided to teach?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At UC Berkeley [University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California]?  What was that like for you?
Speaker 2: It was both a great experience and it was kind of schizophrenic.
Speaker 1: What were, what were students like in 1990?  Were you, were you finding that they were just as you know much as crusaders for the truth and that kind of thing as they were when you were in journalism school [at Columbia University, New York, New York], or had they changed a little?
Speaker 2: Oh I don't know.  You know lot's changed.  Television was changed.  There's much more, I mean you know the world of documentary film has, has really kind of blossomed and digital technology has changed the way we do all of this and, and we were struggling to take that program into the digital age and I think we were successful.  It took a lot of the techniques that we had been beginning to use here and we translated them into that program and built up a program where the students were learning all digital editing techniques and digital photography and, and we were you know min--the miniaturization of the equipment meant that for students there's the breakthrough.  It's a chance to actually really do neat, significant, important reporting for much less money with much smaller technology.  And, and the work they're doing today it's, it's really pretty good it's fascinating.  But I also find that you know students are students which means they are wonderful and optimistic and idealistic and at the same time you know on one hand they want to criticize network television and God knows there's plenty to criticize and at the same time the minute they graduate boy they sure want a job.  And I'm sure I was like that too.
Speaker 1: And did you find that there was some students who wanted a career in journalism for not necessarily the wrong reasons but just because they thought that perhaps it was a very glamorous job that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Less so at Berkeley. You know Berkeley is a wonderful little corner of the universe and, and you know I, I ran the admissions committee for a couple of years while I was there and I have to tell you that the, that the groups that I would see, the resumes and, and the, and the applications that I would read gave me great hope. It made me think you know there's--what a wonderful country.  And even our applicants from outside. You know we had a guy from Bhutan who can to this school and he was a Bhutanese world family somewhat sort of like once removed.  You know amazing.  So there's you know it's, it's inspirational, gave me great hope.
Story_ID: 245326
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But what was bizarre was actually working-continuing to work for ABC News and doing you know magazine, prime time magazine reporting which as with the pressures of, of, of the commercial television environment was becoming softer, more entertainment driven, less hard hitting, much less like "Judgment at Midnight," ['PrimeTime Live'] much less like--I did, I was nominated for an Emmy [Award] for the first magazine piece I ever did which was about industrial pollution along the Rio Grande Valley [Texas] and how it was--had it or had it not created clusters of birth defects in two communities ["The Poison Next Door"].  One on the U.S. side one on the Mexican side.  This was I felt a dynamic piece of reporting.  We were thrilled.  We were really happy with it and it was important.  Could we do that piece today?  Boy that would be a really tough sell 'cause we gotta get ratings. You know the sort of the fragmentation of the audience meant that, that what you put on television in prime time has got to be much, much more commercially viable and so I'm teaching in Berkeley, California [at University of California, Berkeley], one of the most liberal communities in America sort of a fairly high ideal about what we should be doing and then I'm traveling to New York [New York] on the red-eye and working in you know in magazine television that is being increasingly compromised and doing you know interviews with Oprah Winfrey.  God bless Oprah but you know I mean that was a very diff--for me that was a very difficult time.  I felt like I was getting the bends.
Speaker 2: And do you think that news today has just become way too sensationalized?  How much of news is driven by ratings?
Speaker 1: Well there's a commercial imperative on every aspect of what we do.  No question about it.  And so look this is, this is like any business.  You know this is how do you say it, this you know it's, it's it is diversified.  So we know what we bring you on the evening news. And what we bring you in the evening news is straight down the line.  We know we have brought you traditionally at 'Nightline' though the viewers are deserting it.  You know I ran our political coverage this summer.  Everybody says you gotta cover the conventions.  You've gotta be there.  You have to do the conventions.  So I, I pushed hard and said you know what we're doing these conventions and we created a digital channel and we did wall-to-wall coverage in one spectrum and then on, in primetime we did three hours of coverage of the conventions in primetime.  Well you know the ratings, the history of the ratings of the convention is like this (finger going down) so people say you have to do this and then do they show up to watch?  No, they do not.
Speaker 2: How much influence has cable had on whether or not people get their news from the networks these days?
Speaker 1: Well, it's certainly changed our world you know.  I mean half as many people watch the evening news today as they did when I was working with evening news ['World News Tonight'] out of Latin America you know.  Half as many people.  And so you know you have to took at that, that's really important but at the same time the evening news is an important franchise and being the place of record on what happened on the day not just in terms of print but in terms of the visuals and the sound of what happened today this is one of our main missions, it's really, really important.  But to fund that, in order to pay for that, in order to pay for the infrastructure of everything we have, we've got to cover the whole world. In order to pay for that we gotta be commercially liable in other day parts.  There's no question about it.  And so that means the business model is compromised.  The business not compromised but it's challenged.  This is hard because you know I love 'Frontline.'  I think 'Frontline' is an important, important broadcast and, and I, I applaud the ability of 'Frontline' to exist.  But 'Frontline' is not challenged with having bureaus around the world and covering news events around the world. We have that challenge.  And so in order to meet that challenge, we've got broadcasts that they've got to make money.  They got to bring in, they got to bring in some of the biscuits so that we can also then have a bureau in Beijing [China], so that we can keep stringers in Cuba, so that we can you know keep our offices in Southeast Asia you know.  And that is what part of our responsibility is and what is really sort of a collapsing industry.
Story_ID: 245327
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your current position now as senior vice president of news here at ABC.  What do you think that that says about the network in general in terms of--well actually I mean is this where you want to be in terms of power, making decisions, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Today. For today.  For today. I didn't expect this.
Speaker 1: Why didn't you expect this?
Speaker 2: 'Cause part of why I left to go to [University of California] Berkeley [Berkeley, California] was because I, I had decided that, that something like this wasn't gonna happen.  I'd wanted to be an executive producer for most of my career you know.  I, I, I wanted to control content and broadcast.  I did--you know and I didn't think it was gonna happen so I went to Berkeley. And you know they brought me back from Berkeley in order to be the executive producer of the evening news on the weekend.  But for the most part, you know I did not--this is not something that I thought actually was gonna happen and I was very, very surprised when it did.  Now, now that I'm here, this, you know, it's, it's, it's a great challenge, but is this my lifelong ambition?  No, it's really kind of not, but what I realize is that this is a great credential.  So they'll--I have other, I've got other thoughts and other things that I wanna do.  But I'm not turning my nose down at this you know.  I, I get to do, I mean you know I, I ran the--our coverage of the [2004] Democratic [National Convention, Boston, Massachusetts] and Republican national conventions [2004 Republic National Convention, New York, New York], I ran our coverage of all four debates.  The three presidential debates and the vice presidential debate.  I actually picked where was--a group of four people that picked the questions that were asked in the St. Louis [Missouri] debate this year, the town meeting debate. You know, I ran our coverage on election night.  I never thought that, that I would be doing that.  In the middle of the night we had to make a decision about whether we were gonna call Ohio for [President George Walker] Bush and there were 130 some thousand votes that were still uncounted that were still out there, the provisional ballots.  Bush had a lead of about 100 and a fudgable lead maybe 130 maybe 120,000 votes and in, in consultation with David Wes [ph.] and the president of the news division you know, I made the recommendation, we're not calling Ohio.  There's too many votes out there.  We don't know what they are.  We're not gonna check that box off and we're gonna--we'll be comfortable with the fact that we're not gonna call it right now.  To be able to do that to be able to say that, that, that was a kick in the pants that was you know I was very pleased.
Story_ID: 245328
Speaker 1: So the ability to do these kind of things, I mean I am, you know, the executive in charge of, you know, 'Nightline' and 'This Week,' and a couple of weeks ago Kweisi Mfume was on 'This Week.'  Oh, that's because I wanted him to be on there. [HistoryMaker] Tavis Smiley was on our coverage of, of the, of the State of the Union the other night and he was on our election night coverage and a couple of others, that's because I made that happen.  We just found out--I just told you that [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis passed away.  It's because Tavis called my office to say he interviewed Ossie just a couple of days ago and he's--if we wanna use it, you know, it's--and so to be able to have that, that didn't happen twenty-five years ago. That, that represents change.  My mother [Beverly Sinkford Mason] used to say, you know, specifically about the issue of race in America, if people wanna change, if people show a willingness to change, we need to help them.  We need to help them, we need to understand, we need to, you know, let's not forget where they were and what they did, but we need to try to get beyond that, that's part of what our obligation is.  And I believe that.  I believe that really strongly.
Speaker 2: But is change coming fast enough in terms of how African Americans are portrayed and depicted on television today?
Speaker 1: Change never happens fast enough, but look, you know with all respect to, to Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson] and BET, when I turn on BET I'm afraid that some of the images that I see on there, that's not the portrayal that I wanna see.  I object to that.  And I don't mean to call one person out and not call other people out, MTV is as guilty.  I think that that our record companies are, are exploiting, you know, black culture and images of black Americans for profit in ways that I think are very bad for the culture and certainly bad for women.  I've got a daughter.  I'm really concerned about this.  This is bad. And so there's plenty of--what I take from this is that there's plenty of room to do the right thing and opportunity to do the right thing and that's, that's a place for growth. But, so we got a long way to go in network television and if I can help to do that I intend to do that, but part of what's going on in the niche, in niche broadcasting, in cable by black people themselves who are making profit off of it, it's negative.  You look at Vibe magazine I'm sorry, I object to Vibe, but I was pleased to see on the last cover of Vibe that they're now doing an investigation into rap artists and domestic abuse.  I didn't see that last summer.  But Vibe comes to my house and I hide it from my daughter.  But I gotta watch this because I gotta stay on top of it, but this is wrong and we need to call it out.  I think, part of the problem I think within our own culture is we are reluctant to criticize, we're reluctant to turn that investigative eye on ourselves and say oh time out, hold on. And again I think that the messages that we send about sexuality, violence and particularly degrading women this has to stop.
Story_ID: 245329
Speaker 1: When you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: The gifts that my parents [Beverly Sinkford Mason and Theodore Mason] gave me.  And I'm sad because in their lifetime I didn't have a complete understanding of the gifts that they gave me.  But I'm so proud of them and I'm so pleased with you know that at least to this point things are turning out okay. You know it's funny it's an old story from Herodotus where there's a gazillionaire King Croesus who has you know there's a saying more money than Croesus so and so has more money than Croesus.  Croesus was a king and, and he had a huge wealth and the philosopher Solon came to visit and Croesus said Solon who's the wealthiest, who's the luckiest man on earth?  Of course Croesus thought he already knew the answer and Solon said you have to wait until the end.  We don't know right now.  And certainly Croesus came to ruin and Solon was right we don't know, we just won't know. So I'm presented with a challenge every day.  I have been given great gifts you know and I get to stand on the shoulders of giants and I lucked up into some of this stuff I mean frankly I worked hard to get the job that I have but also sometimes opportunity happens to come along in certain ways and here I sit. I think what's interesting is what am I gonna do next?  That's, that's the great challenge.
Story_ID: 245330
Speaker 1: What would you like to do next?  What do you think?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm, I'm developing a show for late night and I hope it gets picked up.  We'll see what happens.  I think it'll be a departure.  It'll be something different if it does get picked up and I think that they'll be a ton of criticism about it but I'll live with that.  I'm working on a film that I've been working on for about seven years which a documentary which you know I've been sidetracked a little bit here and there but I intend to finish it and I have several other ideas that I'd, that I'd like to see you know it's all about production.  I'm a producer. And hard on my producer and so I have more work to do but for now you know I wanna, I wanna try to both influence programming and create opportunities for good, smart, well intentioned people.  I certainly hope that some of those are black and Hispanic and Asian but more than anything else I just think you know let's let smart people of good intention get the opportunity to get a message out and, and, and that's what I'm all about.
Story_ID: 245331
Speaker 1: And I know that you're still very young, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well you know this reminds me of my wife [Evelyn Mason] wanting to go and talk to the insurance agents you know.  Because I always figure she is trying to contemplate my, my you know contemplate my mortality.  I don't know I never really thought about that.  I try to do the right thing.  I worked hard. You know.  I'm, I'm recently far more aware of my own fallibility and everyday I'm, I'm learning and hoping I get it right and many days I don't but I, I'd like to think that I'll keep working at it.
