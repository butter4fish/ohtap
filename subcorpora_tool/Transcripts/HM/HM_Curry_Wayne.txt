Story_ID: 237661
Speaker 1: Now let's begin talking a little bit about your mother.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Starting with her name and where your mother was born and where she grew up as a child, that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Well, her name is Juliette [Harris Curry]; it was Juliette Harris, as a maiden name.  She grew up in Augusta, Georgia, moved around quite a bit and in what was then the southern rural South, in places between Georgia and South Carolina.  And we had family in both in, you know, sort of obscure rural communities, you know, triangle between Augusta, Georgia and Columbia, South Carolina and Greenville, South Carolina in that little triangle.
Speaker 1: And did your mother ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her as a little girl growing up?
Speaker 2: There were, you know, occasional tales of her travels, you know, an, and because she was an only child and my grandmother [Vivian Harris] came to Washington [D.C.], in fact to work and to pursue a career as a very young mom, she was itinerant and stayed with aunts and uncles and sisters in the South and in that, that triangle I described as a little girl from relative to relative so to speak out in the country.  And she does, you know, occasionally talk about she and her girlfriends, you know, from that era and what they did.  You know, through the fields and in the woods and that sort of thing down south.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of the things that she would tell you, some of the stories she would share?
Speaker 2: Not actually, I really don't, you know, I have sort of a checkered recollection of, those tales.  I meet, continually, at family reunions and things, people who were her little girlfriends now who are obviously people old enough to be my mother (laughter).  And so I hear from them on those occasions, you know, and they'll get off in a klatch and you'll hear them giggle and laugh and joke about what they did, but I don't, I don't really remember the stories.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Oh, she's a beautiful woman, very smart, very personable, warm and outgoing, much less guarded, for example than we are in this Washington metropolitan area.  You know, just warm and leads with her heart, and very beautiful and personable, sensitive to people and circumstances.
Story_ID: 237662
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your father, starting with his name and his background, where he grew up.
Speaker 2: My father's name was Eugene Curry, his nickname was, "The Bull," for reasons which became obvious to all of us (laughter) who were his children.  He was a very smart, likewise handsome man with a very grounded upbringing in a rural part of Maryland.  Grew up outside of Baltimore [Maryland] in an area which at the time was rural, which was very suburban now.  His father, my grandfather [Elzy Curry (ph.)], was a very strict disciplinarian and the sort of stalwart, the bulwark of the family in, in that part of the family, in Baltimore.  He was an athlete, a football player principally but also baseball, ex-military man, two fisted beer drinker, you know, the epitome of the macho man and a huge brain.  I mean a very smart guy.  But also very tough and a good, good man who left his imprint and stamp on lots and lots of people, particularly as he left the [U.S.] Army after his stint there and became a teacher and moved the family here to Maryland and began his career as an educator and, but he was a tough one of a kind character we shall say.
Speaker 1: Did he ever share, share any stories with you about growing up in rural Maryland?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sure he has, again, you know, my brothers, it seems, remember a lot more of these tales than I do.  I don't remember many of them I remember traveling to visit, you know, relatives in and around Baltimore.  And, and my father's tales would principally involve stories about,  you know, sports exploits with the guys from his neighborhood or the teams that he played on in the Army and at Hampton Institute then, Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia] now.  And, so he would largely tell stories of that kind then, when we were children.  And, and about the, the hard work obviously and oh how much more difficult it was (laughter) for him than it was for us.  The sort of thing I say to my kids now (laughter), yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No, I really don't.  I do know that they met at Hampton, and if the images in my mind are accurate, they met because my father was a big shot football player and my mother [Juliette Harris Curry] was a vulnerable, impressionable freshman recruit and the upperclassmen were hunting (laughter), and it was somehow through that process that he met my mother.  You know, being big man on campus as a football player.
Speaker 1: And did they ever talk about Hampton at all, their experiences at Hampton?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and ironically, they had lots of friends who also emigrated from Hampton [Virginia] to this area around Washington [D.C.] into--at or about the same time that they did.  There were a lot of teachers being prepared there for what was at the time our segregated community and lifestyle and so a lot of their classmates also emigrated to this area after, you know, very fine preparation as educators at Hampton, and so there are, you know, pictures and vignettes.  My dad, of course, talked a lot about people whose names I don't recall that he opposed as a football player for example, he relished telling, you know, tales of the fights along the line as a football player.  And he enjoyed that sort of thing and the typical exploits of an athlete on a college campus (laughter) you know, those kind of tales.  But, I don't remember explicit ones at all.
Speaker 1: And what kind of work did your mother do?
Speaker 2: She was a homemaker for most of my career--education--when we were kids she was a homemaker, and then a secretary, and then subsequently was a secretary at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] as we were older and in high school and college.
Story_ID: 237663
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestry?  Do you know if you came from free people, slaves?  How far back can you trace your ancestry?
Speaker 2: You know, I really don't know.  One of my brothers I think, has sorta undertaken to try to track some of these lines, but we've never completed a real family tree and I don't know how far he got so I really don't know the answer.  Yeah, I couldn't do it, I don't know.
Speaker 1: And let's talk now a little bit about your grandparents.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you know them well?  Did you spend a lot of time with them?
Speaker 2: Yes, and with my mother's [Juliette Harris Curry] mother in particular because when we were children (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And would you share her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Vivian Harris, and she lived in Washington, D.C. up off Quincy Street, and so, you know, it was a customary ride for us on a regular basis to pack up the urchins and run into Northwest Washington to spend time with her.  She was a very hard working woman, she had a job at one of the federal agencies as a clerical.  And had worked her way up, essentially, as a single mom so to speak in the federal agencies.  Doing the typical things sending money home to take care of my mother and to build her own stake, her own nest egg here in Washington, and had a career that culminated as a clerical at the [United States] Atomic Energy Commission [Washington, D.C.] or one of those places after all those years.  But we used to go visit with her regularly and consequently, you know, make friends with the other kids who lived near her and on that block in D.C. and Northwest Washington.  My father [Eugene Curry] was kind of an old school traditionalist in a lot of ways and he was a hard guy with, you know, with a rigid code (laughter) you know, of conduct and expectations for all of us.  But he hailed from what would have been a sort of rural area of Baltimore [Maryland] and so we used to go up there regularly.  He was a stickler about making sure that, you know, we met and stayed in touch with his parents, my grandparents from Baltimore and my aunts and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And their names?
Speaker 2: --uncles, oh my gracious, Elzy Curry [ph.] was my grandfather, Louise [Curry] [ph.] was my grandmother and, so he used to pack us up fairly regularly, certainly about once a month or so, and on some given Saturday or Sunday off we'd go to Baltimore to make the circuit with, you know, his brothers and sisters, his mother and father, and folks up there in that part of Baltimore, which is an area called Brooklyn [Baltimore, Maryland].  Where it is now, off Ritchie Highway, a very heavily suburbanized, but at the time it was very rural.
Speaker 1: You said your mother was an only child, now; did your father have a lot of siblings?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had a brother and two sisters, yeah, yeah, my Uncle Robert [ph.] and Aunt Grace [ph.], Aunt Irene [ph.].
Speaker 1: And did you spend a lot of time with them as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause he was a--as I say, was pretty insistent about making sure that he kept us stitched together as a family even though we were in different parts of the state and you know, our experience here as children was different from the experiences that my cousins were having in and around Baltimore.  So, he was the glue so to speak that kept us together as children.
Story_ID: 237664
Speaker 1: Tell me, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory is of living in some postwar apartments off of what is now called Fairmount Heights [Maryland] in Chapel Oaks [Maryland] vicinity of Maryland.  And some apartments called the Addison Chapel Apartments [Capitol Heights, Maryland], and all of my little buddies and friends and people, you know, whom I knew before going to elementary school and then for a while in elementary school.
Story_ID: 237665
Speaker 1: Actually let's talk a little bit about daily life.  Can you kinda give us an idea as a small boy what a typical day was like for you?  You'd wake up in the morning and then--
Speaker 2: No, I'd wake up in the morning, I'd go get in trouble, get a beating and then I'd--no (laughter) I'm just teasing of course (laughter) although with a houseful of boys there was the occasional tempest that had to be addressed around the house.  Actually no, I don't really recall.  I know--we, we--I can only remember, you know, occasional episodes from childhood of things we used to do.  I know, at that time I can remember as far back as maybe being three years old and living in the apartments [Addison Chapel Apartments, Capitol Heights, Maryland], and you know, being under the direction of my mother [Juliette Harris Curry] and having all the moms in the cul-de-sac where we were, you know, working pretty hard to keep their kids under control and the clothes cleaned.  And it was in one of those old styled apartments where everybody had a common washroom for washer and dryer and everybody had to go down and use that.  And we'd play in, in these horseshoe cul-de-sacs inside the apartment almost like quadrangles.  And so that all the parents could keep an eye on us from different sides of this horseshoe and so my recollection then is of playing a lot.  Subsequently I vaguely recall being enrolled in some sort of daycare like activity, but they didn't call it daycare then, I don't know they didn't call it pre-K and they didn't call it kindergarten, I don't know what it was, but they'd take us somewhere with a chain link fence and trained people would watch us (laughter), and hopefully educate us a little bit for half a day and then come home, and, I'm trying to remember if I even recall a television at that time in that apartment, I don't know.  But I reme--it was a walk up apartment, small, I remember its configuration an--my brother and I, my older brother [Daryl Curry] and I were a little less than a year apart, you know, were the two pioneers in the apartment before the other children arrived (laughter) and so we wrestled for opportunity together, we did the sibling rivalry stuff.
Story_ID: 237666
Speaker 1: What were holidays like in your house, like Christmas, Thanksgiving, birthdays, were they very special times?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely, and they were frantic and fun because in the end there were five kids and the two adults normally having grown up in close quarters, you know, inconceivably close to me now, you know, that we grew up in these confined areas with all these people, but, yeah, I mean it was a fun time.  It was a time when everybody in the entire family whether close or distant all got in somebody or other's car and managed to go from here to Washington [D.C.], Washington to Baltimore [Maryland] and Baltimore to D.C. area and vice versa.  And there was obviously a lotta cookin' goin' on, you know, occasional consumption of alcoholic libations, you know, and we'd, at which point, you know, all of the attributes of your family come out (laughter) come out, you know how you get to peek around watching the adults and whose doing what when and--but it was--yeah they were always exciting times for us, and it was always frantic, because everybody had a lot of kids for some reason, and so you pour 'em all together in this blend, and cut 'em loose, it was like a chemical experiment, you know, and so I--yeah, our holidays were a lot of fun and, were great occasions for getting together with your cousins and playin' all kinds of games, yeah, so, they were great fun times for us, and, again, my mother and father [Eugene Curry] were, were pretty diligent about, you know, trying to hold this family connection together with our more distant cousins and with each other, frankly, as we got older.
Story_ID: 237667
Speaker 1: Would you please tell us your siblings' names and their birth order--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --including yourself?
Speaker 2: My older brother, the proverbial and actual big brother, is Daryl [Curry], then there was me, then there was Leslie [Curry], then there was Kevin [Curry]; four boys.  And then there was my sister Denice [Curry Taylor].  And this--Daryl's a year older than I am, the others are almost exactly three years apart, a phenomenon that led to no end of jokes at family gatherings (laughter).
Speaker 1: When did the family move to Cheverly [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: I think when I was five, from those apartments [Addison Chapel Apartments, Capitol Heights, Maryland] on Addison Road, down to the fourth ward of Cheverly, which I think was in '55 [1955] or '56 [1956].  Somewhere around that time I believe.
Speaker 1: And can you kinda describe your street, do you remember the name of the street that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, I'm not sure about that, wait, let me think about that.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: What grade was I in?  I'm trying to relate it to what grade I might have been in.  I know by fourth, by '59 [1959] we were down there--I'm not exactly certain but it would have been mid to late '50s [1950s] that they moved from those apartments to Cheverly.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the street you lived on?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, State Street (laughter), oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And, can you kind of describe the community for us a little bit?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was very interesting.  It was at that time, Cheverly, which was one of the municipalities out here in Maryland on the border of Washington D.C. had four wards, and four districts for political purposes, and the fourth ward was the one that we lived in, and the fourth ward was the first of those subdivisions of Cheverly that had actually come under pressure to desegregate and for some reason, more understandable now then at the time, the fourth ward became a place where African Americans actually bought some houses and moved in to Cheverly.  And, the other three wards of Cheverly were largely and I think exclusively segregated for white folks, so that when we moved to the fourth ward there were still white folks who lived in that ward of Cheverly.  So as a small child I actually played with and had neighbors and friends in that fourth ward who were black and white.  And, I remember it as a grand time to be a little fella, there were woods around the community so you could go play in the woods and do, you know, predictable sort of things, you know, with cowboys and Indians [Native Americans] and all of those kinds of games.  And building treehouses and that and yet still have the benefit of a suburban, you know, kind of upbringing and until the exodus of white people became complete, you had an eclectic diverse community, very strange in the sense that because of decisions made by the courts and others applying pressure to the dissolution of segregation, it was a community that was under some stress.  And, because of geography, our ward, the fourth ward was actually and physically separated from the other three wards.  So as this racial integration, and then migration, took place you literally came to be a part of Cheverly that was "the black ward."  And it was literally on the other side of the railroad tracks, and it was literally bounded by a little creek that might as well have been a moat, you know, complete with a couple of bridges that made it accessible from this end to that end, but which served in a way to isolate it and to punctuate its subsequent status as the, "black ward" of Cheverly.  But I had a wonderful childhood, we explored the woods a lot, development hadn't sprawled the way it has now and so there were areas of barren and undeveloped land where we'd go play ball.  And the creek, we didn't know at the time, was dangerously polluted so despite the objections of our parents [Juliette Harris Curry and Eugene Curry], you know, the prohibition, we'd go play in the creek and this and that and so it was a wonderful childhood in that way.
Story_ID: 237668
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up and remind you of your childhood.
Speaker 2: Well for me it's obviously whenever I see small kids in klatches and playgrounds and places where impromptu or pickup games occur that's a reminder of childhood.  When I see kids playing football in the street rather than in these magnificent parks that we've created, in which, in many respects are inaccessible because everybody does everything by car, that reminds me of my childhood, when you had to go out and play football in the street and, you know, your quarterback or the best athlete of the neighborhood says, "Go down to Mr. Cook's [ph.] car and do a button hook, you run down to Mr. Richard's [ph.] house and turn left, you go over to Ely's [ph.], and wait for a pass and--."  So wherever those kinds of impromptu games take place they remind me of childhood.  Whenever I walk in the woods and here the rustling of the leaves and get some time to think and reflect I think about the treehouses that we built or the frogs that we caught or he tadpoles we found or, you know, even on one occasion, you know, incredibly coming home with some field mice in a shoebox and couldn't wait to show my mother [Juliette Harris Curry], who, of course, freaked out (laughter) and I put these field mice in a cardboard box and thought I had them contained (laughter) so, I mean, all those kinds of things remind me of the diversity of my own childhood and how much fun it was.  You know, the usual, you know, admonitions and warnings about, "Be home before the streetlights come on," and "don't let me have to come find you," and, you know, when I see kids actually doing chores, you know.  Because on weekends we'd have our--assigned an impossible list of things to get done, you know, to satisfy "The Bull," my father [Eugene Curry], and, of course, you could never get the list done, but that would simply provide him with, you know, ample excuse to limit how much time you could play (laughter) you know.  So he had--and then when he finally let you play, you know, he was being generous because you hadn't completed your chores.  Didn't matter to him of course, that the list was impossible to complete (laughter), it was like, "We gotcha Dad, we figured you out." You know, yeah (laughter).  So, so, those kinds of things remind me quite a bit of childhood.
Speaker 1: What smells and sounds?
Speaker 2: Sounds would be the creek gurgling, like rustling and gurgling.  The woods, things like that, I subsequently got into camping and enjoyed it, you know, spiritual seclusion, I enjoy sometimes being somewhere where I can think and talk to God without the interferences of all these modern conveniences or people.  Those are important recollections and reminders for me that, there's a base to this adventure, man, and that it's a short one that you are a part of a bigger universe here for a minute.
Speaker 1: And what smells?
Speaker 2: Don't really have much in the way of smells, this is so strange, the foremost of the smells, believe it or not would be unsavory--
Story_ID: 237669
Speaker 1: I worked in a pet shop in junior high school [Bladensburg Junior High School, Bladensburg, Maryland], and I was the youngest guy working in the pet shop, and so as a consequence I was the guy whose chores it came to be to clean the cages.  And at the time the pet shop we were in was much different from pet shops of today, I mean at that time we had many, many wild animals, most of which are on endangered species lists now, lions and baby tigers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At the pet shop?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, baby lions, baby tigers, baby elephant, jaguarondis, coatimundis, jaguars, chimps, you name it we had it, I mean, we had it.  Anacondas, pythons, boas, routine snakes of various varieties, mice, rats, you know, that sort--just a wide variety of really wild animals, raccoons and things like that.  I mean they were really--there was really a great diversity of animals there, and so on the one hand it was fun and adventurous, you know, to be working in that kind of a pet shop, on the other hand, as the youngest, newest and smallest guy in the place you got all of the bad jobs, including cleaning the cages by hand (laughter).  So the smells that I (laughter) recall from childhood are not the roses and the tulips and the redolence of springtime, it's those animals and those cages and the disinfectant and the mop and the--that sort of thing.  And, imagine for a example, this actually happened, being one who is directed to clean up the baby elephant after it had diarrhea (laughter) guess whose job that came to be, "Where's that new guy?  Isn't there a new little guy around here?  Make him do it."  (Laughter)  So it was that sort of thing, on the other hand, it's the kind of childhood job that's easy to romanticize, not many people got to do it, not many people got exposed to those kind of animals.  And the folks who, who cared for them and the guy who owned the shop, all of which people came to be significant players in my life from different standpoints.  I can look back now on those ingredients and see where that helped me in subsequent years and in the balance of my career.  Even the pet shop, I used to make jokes in my subsequent speeches as a politician that I had two great jobs before becoming the county executive here [Prince George's County, Maryland], and people would of course expect me to mention something about law or the preceding background, no, no, no, no, two best jobs I ever had were teaching in a daycare center, because it was an actual blessing and privilege to watch those little heads grow every day, it was like watching time lapse photography to see the kids just expand in their capabilities, their personalities flourish, all that kinda thing.  It was really cool.  And the other, was working in the pet shop, and people would say, "Well why working in the pet shop?"  I said, "Because, cleaning those cages by hand prepared me--over-prepared me for being in elected office (laughter)."  And, some people understood what I was saying (laughter).
Story_ID: 237670
Speaker 1: What other memories do you have of growing up, any particular memories with your brothers, your sister [Denice Curry Taylor]?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I mean at home, of course, and with five kids and, living in what I regard now to be a tiny little closed vessel in that house in Cheverly [Maryland] is pretty astonishing, I mean, I'm surprised that we all made it out and that we like each other (laughter).  But, yeah, I've got plain recollections of playing with and fighting with, you know, my brothers in particular and my sister.  And other recollections that aren't, you know, quite so romanticized because my older brother [Daryl Curry] and I, also because of my father's [Eugene Curry] vision and his determination and toughness, were assigned, essentially, to desegregate the local elementary school.  And so, you know, it's pretty hard to romanticize those--the consequences of that decision.  But those are things that obviously stick pretty dramatically in our heads because it wasn't an easy kind of thing to do and sort of resulted in, I don't know, bicultural existence where we lived in a black community and went to school in a white community at a time when despite the dictates of the American Constitution, people didn't do that.  And so, I have all the fun recollections of being siblings together and playing with and fighting with guys in the neighborhood, you know, the more sobering recollections of being marines in the social experiment to integrate the schools, and then of course, as things changed and we grew older, you know, the tragedies of living in that kind of bicultural situation, and the dramatic changes in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] which have led to this new America.
Story_ID: 235319
Speaker 1: You were talking a little bit about school, but, let's talk about elementary school, do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --remember the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.  I started elementary school at Fairmount Heights Elementary School, which was in Fairmount Heights, Maryland, obviously.  And then, the county had built a new school, which was a few blocks away which was Beaver Heights Elementary School [Capitol Heights, Maryland], which was around Deanwood [Washington, D.C.], Chapel Oaks [Maryland] area of Prince George's County [Maryland], Fairmount Heights all there together.  And then in 1959, as a result of some agitation and activism by my parents [Juliette Harris Curry and Eugene Curry] and neighbors, my brother [Daryl Curry] and I wound up enrolling at Cheverly-Tuxedo Elementary School [Cheverly, Maryland] which was the "white" elementary school closest to our house.  And so we wound up with one other fella from the fourth ward of Cheverly [Maryland] desegregating the Cheverly-Tuxedo Elementary School.  At that time I was in the fourth grade, my older brother was in the fifth grade and so off we went.  And, that it was probably that decision by my parents more than any others which came to define, you know, the memorable parts of my childhood at least that was an interesting, difficult and adventurous period that came to sort of cement our impressions about lots of things in our community and in our country.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what that first day was like?
Speaker 2: I remember it vividly.  You know, I have--having left an all-black elementary school and joining my parents on the first day at Cheverly-Tuxedo and the mass of kids who were called into the gymnasium, you know, and seated along rows and given instructions about when your teacher--a teacher's name will be called and then kids' names will be called, when you hear your name called go line up behind that teacher, and as far as I was concerned it was like Broadway.  I mean my parents had brought me to this school, I had, essentially they had explained to me, you're going to a new school, but I wasn't--these things weren't lining up, I'm looking around at the crowd.  I don't see any of my buddies, where's John Henry [ph.], where's Phil [ph.], where's this, where's that.  So I'm thinking well, we haven't yet gotten to the school where I'm going (laughter).  You know, maybe this--they brought my brother first, you know, so he can, you know--this where you going (laughter).  And so we're looking around at all these white folks--and, what is this?  So it was theatre as far as I was concerned 'til they called my name, then I was, "What is this?"  And I sat there.  And so my father gives me, you know, a subtle elbow, "Get up as you were instructed, go stand behind the lady, get goin'."  I said, "You can't"--you know, essentially, I don't remember the exact words, "you can't be serious (laughter) you're not really gonna leave me here?"  And, so my father, as he was wont to do, took me out into the foyer of the elementary school and explained his instructions in a language which I could understand (laughter).  So I went back in, got in line and began the first day of this new adventure at this essentially all-white elementary school.  So yeah, I remember that part vividly.
Speaker 1: And do you remember, like the rest of the day if you made friends and--
Speaker 2: I don't remember the rest of the day, I do recall with my brother being very relieved to have gotten through it without, you know, any significant encounters, thankfully most of the day was taken up with instructions, with do this, do that, sit here, do that, that's how we do things, you know, and it--so it was largely mechanical and administrative, and so I remember being relieved at the end of the day that none of the anticipated difficulties had occurred.  They did however occur later, and so my brother and I came to depend on each other, you know, to develop a social repertoire that could get you through that environment, and so we tried to cover each other so to speak in doing that, and I think we largely succeeded.
Speaker 1: What grade was the other young man in; it was three of you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was in fourth grade with me.
Speaker 1: Was he in the same class with you?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And so was it comforting to see him at least in the class?
Speaker 2: Well no because he wasn't as aggressive as my brother and I, I mean, he did--he--one of the things that made that experiment successful was my father's determination, I mean, you just--there's no way to describe when you live in a house with a guy like that.  Military man, athlete, two-fisted beer drinker, very smart, "You do as I say do and you let me worry about the rest."  You know, and thankfully his image, the terrifying image of my father, as director (laughter) was much more effective in making sure that we got through this, than anything else could have been, because no matter what was going on at school, and no matter how anguishing this racial experiment and the rebukes and taunting and teasing and name calling and all of that stuff by other students at school or even the subtle assistance of teachers with the racial aspects of it, none of that was even marginally as terrifying as, as disobeying "The Bull" (laughter).  So it worked out just fine.  They never understood, "You're not that scary (laughter)."

Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite subjects in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Music, for one.  I played the violin for a while and so that went--that was one of my favorite subjects, and reading.
Speaker 1: And do you remember if any of your teachers in elementary school had a particular influence on you and if so, who they were?
Speaker 2: No, I don't really recall to be perfectly honest with you, I do remember Miss Ross [ph.] from my days before Cheverly-Tuxedo Elementary School[Cheverly, Maryland], who was very influential in that first to third grade development, and I believe she was my third grade teacher [at Beaver Heights Elementary School, Capitol Heights, Maryland].  And that turns out to have been propitious because it was before the year of the beginning of the experiment and so having her guidance going into that experiment was very useful to me and she was very, very helpful in preparing us without knowing what for.  She had given us a repertoire that helped me a lot once we switched schools and began to experiment in, integration.
Story_ID: 235321
Speaker 1: Was the new school [Cheverly-Tuxedo Elementary School, Cheverly, Maryland], was the environment a little less nurturing than what you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --had been accustomed to?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  It--because it was Cheverly [Maryland], and because Cheverly at the time was the enclave of the educated upwardly mobile middle class elite in Prince George's County [Maryland] at least, college educated, which was not the picture of the profile of white folks generally in Prince George's County, because it was Cheverly there was a usually civilized approach to resistance to integration, and so from that standpoint it wasn't dramatic and confrontational, there weren't cops with guns, there weren't National Guard troops, there were lots of subtle games played to discourage us from being there and to try to deter our parents from leaving us there.  None of which, of course, you know, was tolerated by my dad [Eugene Curry], he didn't care about anything that subtle (laughter) you know, he was--well, but yeah, no it wasn't nurturing, I mean it's very hard, even now reflecting, to realize that at home and at night you're in one social milieu, and all day and at school, another very important aspect of your development as a child, you're in an entirely different and frankly, hostile, these are hostile, you know, social environments.  Both of which are critical, indispensable to your development and so it's strange to go to school here and yet not have school classmates with whom you play, party or fight in the evening.  Birthday parties you're not invited to attend as an elementary school kid, listening to conversations with your classmates about their summers or your spring afternoons at the local pool that you can't attend 'cause it's segregated, and knowing, of course, no pool in your neighborhood, you play in the creek.  Hearing about the baseball team, knowing you play in an area that we used to call the red sea which was simply a graded industrial area complete with rocks and everything else, where we played baseball and trundled off to play.  To know that if there's name calling here at night in this neighborhood it doesn't mean the same thing it does, even if it's the same name, over here in this neighborhood.  Being accused of predictable sorts of infractions at school that you didn't do, but concerning which you don't have a single witness on your behalf saying, "Well, I know didn't do it 'cause he was with me."  You know, and, whereas on the other hand at home when things would go on in the neighborhood there were always competing factions of testifiers, you know, witnesses, saying, "Naw, he didn't do it, Billy did it."  You know and that sort of thing and, and the parents and adults could parse--get to the truth, it wasn't like that for example, my brother [Daryl Curry], who thankfully was my big brother in all respects, I mean he always was big physically.  He was older, so he was the big brother, and his fuse was shorter than mine so he was a wonderful companion (laughter) at school because he was adept, he was proficient let's say with pacifying situations (laughter), and, so--and I was always small and, and my biggest weapon was, and I guess people would say remains, my mouth.  And, so, when there were physical encounters, you know, you could usually count on my brother to resolve them favorably, you know.  And we could get out of a lot of confrontational situations at school that way, but I recall when he was accused of taking somebody's pocketbook out of their desk.  A little desk, a little pocketbook, nothing in it, essentially, but somebody went in the girl's pocketbook and one of the big mouth types, racist, accused him of doing it.  And of course the teachers and everybody else immediately assumed he did it.  Well the guy who actually did it was the guy who accused him of doing it.  And so, you know, we had all this consternation and my parents involved, and this that and the other, and he didn't do it, so it was things of that variety that you'd have to deal with.  On the other hand there were other kind of funnier vignettes, where, for example there'd occasionally be these fights, you know, somebody'd go too far, somebody'd say something, somebody'd be emboldened to handle the two or three of us.   And, for example, we're leaving school one evening and a throng of white kids surrounds us and a couple are badgering, name calling doing all of this, don't appear to be any adults around, you know, you're looking for 'em and thankfully one guy jumps out and he's gonna teach us a lesson.  And so my brother of course, who was the more physical of us and the bigger, is just watchin' him.  He's not saying much, he's just watchin' him, so the guy gets more and more emboldened and concluded that he must be a coward and he's going to resolve this so he steps forward and throws his hands up like (gestures with fists) "Okay, let's roll."  But he steps up and throws his hands up like this (gestures with fists) you know, with about two feet between his fists (laughter) and my brother just looks at him, and of course, steps forward and whacks him right in the head (laughter) and so that fight's over, and, you know, he's now legendary, which helped a lot (laughter) you know.  'Cause it discouraged the other guys from just picking on you.

Speaker 1: What was the reaction back in the neighborhood?  What were your friends saying about you all going to this new white school [Cheverly-Tuxedo Elementary School, Cheverly, Maryland]?  How were you all received from the fellas in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: It depends and it changed over time as we went from elementary to middle to high school [Bladensburg High School, Bladensburg, Maryland] because we wound up going up an entirely different track through that experience than most of the people in the neighborhood.  Initially in elementary school, didn't mean much of anything, we were--it meant a lot where we went to school and with our schoolmates, but it didn't mean much in the neighborhood, you know, a guy just went where they went and we played in the evenings, and did our chores as directed by our parents [Juliette Harris Curry and Eugene Curry] and it didn't mean much.  As we grew older, and, obviously through the age that you become a teenager and in adolescence and other things are going on like girls and this, that, and the other, then it meant something.  And, when the competition in those, you know, realms began it meant something, and as the educational social experience was different--"You talk funny."  Or, "You sound like a white boy--you can't dance."  Or, "You dance like this."  Or "You sound like that."  I mean those kinds of confrontations more in junior and high school began to develop, but they were developing among guys that you'd been childhood friends with and so they sort of resolved themselves, no matter how I sound, I know you and I know how to resolve this, are we getting ready to resolve it?  You know, and you'd be in a comfortable even if confrontational environment that was very much different the other way.  And--but you would, on the other hand, as time progressed, have to deal with different kinds of mockery or criticism particularly about how you sound and what you do.  What music you hear, listen to or like, just lots of things, and in a way you just have to get comfortable with the idea that you've been blessed to have been exposed to an incredible array of environments, people and opportunities.  Once through that period of school it's obvious how beneficial that is, you know.  It's obvious how valuable it is to have all kinds of people with different backgrounds and capabilities and environments and connections to help your life be better, wasn't so apparent then.
Story_ID: 235323
Speaker 1: In elementary school, what type of student were you?
Speaker 2: Good, I've always been a good student, yeah.  And it's something I'm proud of.  I haven't always been a diligent student but I always managed to be, you know, cruising around the respectable top of the class, you know.  And, only in law school [University of Maryland School of Law; University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland] did I really turn on to wanting to do so (laughter) you know, it's just what I was--a comfortable echelon for most of the experience.
Speaker 1: And during that time, during the elementary school years, did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: I'm sure I did; don't remember, to tell you the honest truth Racine [Tucker-Hamilton], what they were.  And a lot of it again had to do with a social repertoire much more than anything else.  It was a--in a way sort of a luxury to dream beyond, okay, now what do I wanna be, and what are the limitations of that--and obstacles that I might confront.  Much more probably in junior high school [Bladensburg Junior High School, Bladensburg, Maryland] those kinds of thoughts began to develop because the guy in the neighborhood in particular would, you know, we'd stroll of sometimes in the evening, sit down on the little bridge across the creek at the entrance to the neighborhood and pretend and fantasize about what we'd be when we grew up and, on those occasions you'd look up and go, boy, what do I wanna be or what can I be and of course there was this huge (laughter) diversity of drama (laughter) with the fellas in the neighborhood about what they and who they were gonna be, you know.  Predictable sort of popular things like, "Oh, I'm gonna be [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson or I'm gonna be."  You know that--some ballplayer or things like that.  But, most of those things didn't emerge with me until later, just--I loved the animals so I, you know, I thought for a while of being a zookeeper and, or a biologist or--just a lot of experimental things.  I was fairly artistic so I enjoyed working with my hands and sculpting and stuff like that, and liked music, played the violin for a while, had to give it up.  You know, it was just, it was very hard.  I played the violin from fourth grade to eight grades, and you just couldn't get on the school bus with that violin case after the eighth grade.  Everybody knew, let's pick on the guy with the violin case (laughter), it's like, no, let's don't (laughter).  And why are you wearing that bulls-eye of a violin case anyway.  So I gave up on the violin--wish I hadn't, but I did and I miss that aspect now.  But, yeah, I couldn't get on the school bus anymore with that violin case (laughter) just asking for it.
Story_ID: 235324
Speaker 1: What was the name of the junior high school you attended?
Speaker 2: Bladensburg Junior High [School, Bladensburg, Maryland].
Speaker 1: And, what were your experiences, like there were--were the schools starting to become a little bit more integrated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think--
Speaker 1: --at that point?
Speaker 2: --not really.  I mean, one of the huge ironies of this whole integration--and frankly the current composite of Prince George's County [Maryland] is that whatever did occur in the way of integration always occurred reluctantly and never pervasively, it was always a fight about whatever was to happen in progressive terms so that people could live together, and so in junior high because we had been in--we had succeeded at living through the elementary school experience [at Cheverly-Tuxedo Elementary School, Cheverly, Maryland], the natural feeder school for us was Bladensburg Junior High.  Ironically, at Bladensburg Junior High, the white students from Cheverly [Maryland] got exposed to economically a different class of white people from Bladensburg [Maryland] and Cottage City [Maryland] and Colmar Manor [Maryland] who were rougher, tougher, more urban, more blue-collar, and so ironically they then became the isolated group too, you know.  And because they weren't necessarily as rough, tough, and experienced as the kids from these other communities, they too were isolated.  We of course having been accustomed to being isolated, actually prevailed, I mean because we--our repertoire was different, you know, they were just learning, you know, to expand their repertoire (laughter) to deal with these strange other kids (laughter).  And of course, we had already been through that and--but no, I think even at the junior high school, may have been twelve African Americans maybe, out of hundreds of students.  And, for us too it was kind of fascinating because the white students from those other places were something we could relate to because of the diversity of our own neighborhoods and working class folks (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this--
Speaker 2: --that the elite could not.
Speaker 1: And this was around mid '60s [1960s] so, height of the Civil Rights Movement--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --right outside of Washington, D.C.--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --what impact did that have on you as a preteen, a young man at this predominately white school?
Speaker 2: A tremendous amount but it was, was largely the result and product of my parents [Juliette Harris Curry and Eugene Curry] and their values.  Through all of this my parents were insistent that we're gonna teach you that the world's a bigger place than you're being told and that you--than you're being exposed to.  And we're gonna invoke a set of rules here that you guys are gonna listen to, and some of 'em are gonna be personal and family and some of 'em are gonna deal with the bigger picture of this world that we live in.  And it's changing and changing fast, so they protected us but they kept us aware of their creed.  Part of what they did, they were activists, they were very progressive, so through this period from elementary school to junior high they met on a regular basis with other sort of intelligent people, black and white, about the changes that were taking place in our country.  The Civil Rights Movement, neighbors from the other side of Cheverly who were sympathizers with what was happening with me and my brother [Daryl Curry].  It was common to have white folks and Latinos and black folks in our house plotting and scheming, you know, as to what they could personally do to change the world that we were living in, and to demonstrate the guts to do so.  So we were accustomed to that part, the Civil Rights Movement became a bigger panorama and stage for some of what we were already doing.  And ironically, I was into and out of high school [Bladensburg High School, Bladensburg, Maryland], out of a white high school in 1968 in Prince George's County before the formal desegregation litigation was ever even filed here to desegregate our schools in '71 [1971].  So we were already in the vanguard of change before any of that activity took place, and because, again of the fortitude of my parents, you know, got through it, not unscathed, but as reasonably healthy as people are gonna be, whether it's that challenge or some other.

Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite subjects in junior high school [Bladensburg Junior High School, Bladensburg, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Art.  Art was clear and foremost my favorite.  The rest of them, as I say, I didn't really pay much attention to the subject matter of my classes because I did what I had and I just did it, you know.  I did what I was supposed to do and wasn't very much turned on by, you know, the educational experience.  I loved art (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What medium, what did you enjoy most?
Speaker 2: Sculpting was my favorite, painting was next, and then I would say, mosaics, you know, enjoyed putting the little pieces of mosaics together see what images could be created.
Speaker 1: And at this point in your life, what were some of your dreams and aspirations?  Were they starting to form then?
Speaker 2: Well that, that was at the time that I went to work at the pet shop, and so, no (laughter).  I really just enjoyed the animals.  I was much more socially oriented, you know, out of this mess and tangle and knot of friends and relations where can you get some buddies, you know.  Will you ever get invited to a school dance, with someone?  If you go to a school dance are you gonna have to fight your way home out of the parking lot?  But, dominated much more by survivalist (laughter) you know, objectives than dazzling gossamer abstract ones.  It was, again, in the school experience my father's [Eugene Curry] protection amounted to these rules of his about performance and this and that and that stuff almost became mechanical so it didn't inspire and invoke any dreaminess in me, I sorta was unimaginative in the sense that I'd dream about girls and things like that (laughter).
Speaker 1: And who were some of your friends in junior high school?
Speaker 2: Oh my gracious, I am--I wouldn't want to mention, wouldn't wanna mention names, I really, really don't.  I don't know what people are doing or whether they care to have their names invoked in connection with a guy who's now a public figure.  A lot of people thankfully have more privacy than I do.
Speaker 1: What were some of the things you enjoyed doing in your spare time in junior high school?  You worked at the pet store (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but what were some of the other things you enjoyed doing?
Speaker 2: Loved playing in the woods.  Loved building treehouses--
Speaker 1: Still, even in junior high school?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, 'cause we, you know, we had these treehouses and places to hang out and most of kids in the neighborhood at that time didn't or never did enjoy the woods so you had sanctuary.  You had a place to go, you had a refuge, where people weren't hanging out and where nobody was bothering you.  Loved to play sports, enjoyed, you know, the Little League kinda sports activity.  Baseball and football in particular were fun to me, as was hangin' out, you know, there were some guys in the neighborhood who were extraordinary athletes, so even the street games were fun.  And, you know, we were really blessed to have a community with conscientious parents, so when you were at people's houses, you were part of the family and, you know, things to do, and ping pong and this and that.  And somebody had a pool table, and it's like, gee, and somebody's got that, so it was fun, I mean, it was an adventure.
Story_ID: 235326
Speaker 1: Who was influencing you at this particular time in your life?  Who were you being most influenced by?
Speaker 2: I would say at the time still my father [Eugene Curry] in particular and my mother [Juliette Harris Curry].  I mean, obviously at that point, you know your buddies are starting to, you know, the peer factors is getting to be pretty influential too.  But in a conservative household, like my father's it--perhaps better described as a controlled environment (laughter) like my father's house, a lot of the things (laughter) that you learned, you learned on the sly (laughter), and on the side from your buddies and so that became a big influence too.  And then of course there was this whole phenomenon of the era that I lived through.  I mean, you're coming of age as a young--as an adolescent and adult in the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s] there's a lot of new stuff breaking all over the place.  There's [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy's assassination, and there's the school integration and there's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Malcolm X.
Speaker 2: --Malcolm X, and there's King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination, and there's riots, and there's the publicity, and there's television coverage of things that didn't used to be covered that way, and the Freedom Rides.  I mean there were a lot of things boiling in this crucible at that time that happened to be the time you were forged.  And so the alloy of that period's different, you know, from the products of other periods including now.  And so those things had huge impact as well.  I can remember the great March on Washington and just listening to a record that my father brought home of Martin Luther King's speech.  And of all the things that I can recall, the two people who to that point in my life, celebrity people, who had influenced me quite unknowingly, unwittingly, they didn't--never met me they were Martin Luther King and Billy Graham, you know.  One of whose revivals my parents had dragged us to as kids, it was just fascinating, you know, to watch the influence of these people on others.  But clearly the most dominant influence was my father and mother.
Speaker 1: Did your parents attend the March on Washington?
Speaker 2: They worked at the church during the march.  And my older brother [Daryl Curry] and I were very upset that they wouldn't let us go and be involved because they weren't sure if something violent would happen.
Speaker 1: And the Billy Graham revival that you all attended, do you remember around what year that was?
Speaker 2: No I don't.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about it?  Just, just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just tens of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --thousands of people in a sports arena coming to listen to a preacher.  And then to watch, you know, as they were all enthralled in the grip of what he was saying and, of course now this'll be gauche but, and the fact that they gave away Bibles (laughter) at the end--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --I was like, wow, that's interesting--
Story_ID: 235327
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about high school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of the high school you attended?
Speaker 2: Bladensburg Senior High School [Bladensburg High School, Bladensburg, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Bladensburg Senior High School, and can you tell us a little bit about your experiences at Bladensburg?
Speaker 2: They were pretty good, I was a pretty good student and so I wound up in a college preparatory track at Bladensburg which was also a vocational technical high school so there were a lot of, what we called the vocats, you know, who went to school there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you one of the only--one of the few blacks--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --in the track?
Speaker 2: --I'd be surprised if my senior class had twenty black folks in it out of a school of two thousand students.  But I was very fortunate, and again, by this time I had an entirely different and eclectic repertoire socially and academically.  So I did well there.  I was the manager of the basketball team for the entire three years that I was at the school.  Manager, scorekeeper, you know, for the basketball team and I was in several of the extracurricular clubs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Like what?  Like what clubs?
Speaker 2: Gosh, I can't even remember.  The Latin club is one that I remember for sure, and at one point I was actually even a cheerleader, but I had to give that up along with the violin (laughter).
Speaker 1: For the same reasons (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had to stop doing that (laughter) it just was too much social baggage to carry into play.  It was like wearing a bulls-eye on your head, people would just--fellas made a little too much of that, you know; I had to give that up.  But, it was a good experience.  My academics were good, I made (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How were you doing socially?
Speaker 2: Socially better than in junior high school [Bladensburg Junior High School, Bladensburg, Maryland].  Met some people who, for other reasons were themselves pretty wide open, and, unencumbered with social baggage, and so made good friends, and it was easier, particularly coming off of the experience as manager of the basketball team because even though the basketball team was largely white, you just bond in a different kind of way with the guys that you're with.  And through that period that you're growing, and I had sort of polished some of my social tactics anyway since I was always small, you know I couldn't rely on physical, you know, dominance to win, so I'd do other things.
Speaker 1: And did you date in high school?
Speaker 2: Occasionally, occasionally, that was a little tougher.   For a lots of reasons, I mean, predictable ones of course, it's a, you know, a largely white environment that's one, but, you know, as an unfortunate victim of the gene lottery I looked like I was about thirteen when I graduated from high school so I was buddies with just about every young lady in the school.  It was like, "Buddies, I don't wanna be your buddy."  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You were the guy who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was--
Speaker 1: --everyone was like, "Oh he's such a great--you're such a great friend".
Speaker 2: Such a--yeah.  You know, what kinda stigma is that to carry (laughter) out of high school (laughter).  Well, but anyway, that was, so that, that was part of it too.  But once again, even, that in ironic ways works out because you develop a different kind of repertoire about you know, becoming friends with folks, you know, you, you, you, you brought on your repertoire.  All of the great Romeos of my high school experience, you know, by the time college had occurred they'd washed out as--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --the player, players (laughter).  They were the unfortunate losers in subsequent contests for the ladies, you know, that was all right.
Story_ID: 235328
Speaker 1: What were some of your dreams and aspirations at this point, what were you thinking that you wanted to do with your life when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Well, coming out of a house with educators, and people, I mean a lot of it centered around the potentials of being a teacher, occasional thoughts, you know, of perhaps being a doctor or the traditional steps up kind of thing.  And so that would roll around in my head still sort of ambiguous and undefined, but it would be around the arena of, maybe I'll be a teacher, or something, something like that.  Ironically, none of it ever concerned business or--there were still these, you know, sort of intellectual barriers to thinking about business and money and economics and things like that.
Speaker 1: And what were some of the things that you enjoyed doing with your time?
Speaker 2: Well, as I say, I loved being involved with the guys on the basketball team, you know, in the school after hours, you're bonding with a bunch of guys who are local celebrities in the institution.  You carry a certain cache for being able to get out of school and go on the road, and all of that kinda thing and, and that was good and the extracurriculars were good, and met a lot of people.  But I still worked, you know, for part of that time at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you still at the pet stop--
Speaker 2: --the pet shop--
Speaker 1: --pet shop?
Speaker 2: --and then subsequently, some buddies and I wound up working at a truck stop loading furniture in the summers, you know, around the end of high school [Bladensburg High School, Bladensburg, Maryland] and beginning of college [Western Maryland College; McDaniel College, Westminster, Maryland].  And summers, you know, do construction or try to get some work, here and there, you know, making some kind of money, you know.
Speaker 1: What about music, were you really into music (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah--
Speaker 1: --did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, loved it--
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite songs, groups?
Speaker 2: Well, I loved it all, which (laughter) which once again became one of those double-edged swords because, you know, you like all the traditional expected sort of stuff you know, so, Four Tops and The Temptations and [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson, The Supremes, and all of that, that's all good.  But interestingly and different from a lot of the other kids in the neighborhood, you know, it's like, well, but you know I also like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, and guys start scratchin' their head goin' "Aw man, who are they and what's wrong with you guys?" and things like, you know, like that.  Rock music, and so, "How can you listen to that stuff?"  Until of course, years later when it was popularized, now it's okay to listen to, you know, you just--there weren't a lot of marines in this social experiment, you know.  And it was one of the blessings of that environment.  That you weren't intimidated by that kind of experimentation.  So I liked it all.
Speaker 1: So you were open minded and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, there's no question about that, open-minded in that, open-minded intellectually, socially, open-minded with the music, you know, clothing was very different, you know.  Mostly guys in the neighborhood thought my brother [Daryl Curry] and I had gone crazy when we started wearing these giant afros and tie-dyed jeans and flower print shirts and they were all, "What has happened to them man?  It finally caught up with them goin' to those other schools (laughter) poor fellas."
Speaker 1: One of the things we didn't talk about that I'd like to is, did your family attend church (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you were growing up and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in fact--
Speaker 1: --what were your experiences like?
Speaker 2: Hard as it is to believe from my friends today I was actually an altar boy as a child.  I was--we attended an Episcopal church, Church of the Atonement [Washington, D.C.], over off East Capital Street, and that's the church I grew up with and, which I attended through my childhood and I was for a time, an altar boy there at the church.  In subsequent years and in making adult decisions, you know, it was, it's a little dry style of spirit for me so I changed and now attend a Baptist church that I love.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And did the whole family go to church?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  As I said, my father [Eugene Curry], you know, some bizarre reason thought he could control everything (laughter).  He'd say, "Yeah, we're going to church."  Oh, okay dad--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --if you say so I guess that means we are--

Speaker 1: When you were in high school [Bladensburg High School, Bladensburg, Maryland] what were some of your thoughts about college, was it a given that you were going to college?
Speaker 2: It was certainly an expectation.  And it, in which case again, with my parents [Juliette Harris Curry and Eugene Curry], means it was a given, I wasn't so sure at the time, I mean there were a lot of other things beginning to boil, you know, having to do with adolescence and young adulthood and rebellion and related sorts of just personal sentiments about where I was.  In the end though, it, even to me, appeared it would, it's really not a choice, you have to do this, the question then became where and how, and who pays for it and how.  And so I was very fortunate, you know, to get a scholarship to Western Maryland College [McDaniel College, Westminster, Maryland] and was really an accumulation of different kinds of scholarships that amounted to, you know, a virtual full-ride to go to this small school outside of Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: And during the high school years what kind of young man were you developing and what kind of young man were you becoming?
Speaker 2: It's hard to say, I mean I sort of regarded myself as capable, you know, certainly again with respect to the primary job of school which is the education, the curriculum, the classes.  I was always proficient enough at that to be able to, you know, cruise around.  And, very friendly, outgoing, I may--I learned, I learned to be outgoing and extroverted.  I--basically the little guy inside of me is pretty shy and protective, but it's like anything else you learn a repertoire, and so I did, and so I was outgoing and pretty much interested in meeting a lot of different kinds of people and did and succeeding with them.  Not hung up about class and status and echelon and all that didn't much of nothing, I crossed those kinds a lines, you know, with pretty relative ease, I mean, a lot of ease in fact.  So, I would think of myself as friendly and, outgoing and capable and self-sufficient, I mean there are a lot of kids in a little house with not a lot of money so you learn to do things and to be self-sufficient, working and doing school stuff and fighting and standing up for yourself, you know.
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968], 1968.
Speaker 1: And so you had made the decision about college and were you at all concerned about leaving home and even though you were just going outside of Baltimore, but you know, being away from your family and what were some of your thoughts there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not really, I mean, I was looking (laughter), I was looking forward to being in college and "going away."
Speaker 1: And being on your own?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean and spend some time, you know, I already was makin' money, and, you know, it was, always, you know, a delicious thought to be able to escape my father's dominion, you know, the guy was a tough guy to satisfy.  And, so that was a good thing, it's like well, good.  You know, you can go away and grow up a little bit here.  No, so that part didn't bother me, it became a question of where to go, and, and the greater concern was where would I go and still--and would I go somewhere where my buddies were and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you still buddies with the guys in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Several, yeah, yeah, several of the guys in the neighborhood were buddies, and some of us, because of the elementary school experiment [integrating Cheverly-Tuxedo Elementary School, Cheverly, Maryland] we "grew up together," and you never lose that part to this day haven't lost that part.  Not as tight with everybody, but I mean there are guys from the neighborhood that we still run into and see each other periodically, and have that feeling about, you know, that irreplaceable feeling about my neighborhood.  So, yeah, had that, and of course we were all taking different roads at that point, doing different things and living different adventures but the old neighborhood means something.
Story_ID: 235330
Speaker 1: Can you kind of describe the campus [of Western Maryland College; McDaniel College, Westminster, Maryland] for--
Speaker 2: Excuse me.
Speaker 1: --us, and what was the atmosphere like in 1968?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things that attracted me to the place was that when I went to visit it, it was small, it was absolutely gorgeous.  The architecture of the dormitories and the classrooms was rustic, so to speak.  It sat in what I'd describe as a sort of bucolic, splendid, you know, little farm enclave outside of Baltimore [Maryland].  On the day that I visited, which was in the summer and so school was closed, there were visiting foreign students and others and summertime there you walk down the sidewalk and everybody would speak and, wow, this is gonna be fine.  And so I signed up, only to discover, yeah, it was fine that day (laughter).  It was fine that day.  It was, a tough and almost unpalatable for me because when finally the fall semester began all the students brought their stuff and everybody got situated I discovered that the preponderance of my classmates were from Baltimore County [Maryland] and Anne Arundel County [Maryland] and Harford County [Maryland] and Cecil County [Maryland] and all these places, and they grew up hunting and they grew up with testosterone games that were different from ours, and most had never had the advantage of dealing with people who weren't just like themselves.  They were condescending and some were more brutish than that, and course I thought I had, you know, escaped most of that with my social repertoire from having already lived through that mess in elementary school [Cheverly-Tuxedo Elementary School, Cheverly, Maryland].  And so it was like a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you feel like it was happening all over again?
Speaker 2: Oh it was horrifying, it was terrible, it was a very bad experience in that way.  And particularly because I had made so many concessions, social concessions thinking, "Oh, well they not so bad, you--you know, you gotta spend a lot of time educating 'em, but they're not so bad."  And, and here's this throng of Neanderthals, social Neanderthals in essence, and so you're right back in it and you're in it at a time when other things are going on including chemicals and hormones and macho games and manhood, you know.  The verge of manhood, and so, yeah, it wasn't an idyllic romantic experience.  It was a tough little experience and by my sophomore year I was ready to leave.  And this is ironic too because in high school [Bladensburg High School, Bladensburg, Maryland] I had been vice president of my senior class in what was an apparently hostile and overwhelmingly white environment, even at Western Maryland where there were only twelve black students out of a school population of 1,200, I was president of my freshmen class there and so I--not having yet learned the consequences of this changing social profile, you know, archetype of Harford County student, you know, initially I was being open [HistoryMaker] Wayne [Curry], just going through, doing my academics, succeeding, trying to be social, pick some friends, but it didn't turn out that way--
Story_ID: 235331
Speaker 1: This at the time, was a school [Western Maryland College; McDaniel College, Westminster, Maryland] where the fraternities hung out the windows and cheered, you know, when [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] got shot.  And, where the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] would come in the dorms at night and post up recruitment flyers on the bulletin boards, and where on one occasion one of the fraternity guys on the artificial impetus of synthetic courage, you know, some booze, took my Volkswagen and rolled it down on the football field.  And so I come out the next day lookin' for my car, and it's not in the parking lot, it's on the football field.  But he didn't bother to roll it on its wheels, he and his football buddies rolled it side over side onto the football field and then when I called the police to report it, of course, you know, the archetype of the Dodge Boy shows up with his stogy and his police car and (gestures with hand) which lead me to, "Never mind, forget it."  The guy starts interrogating me (laughter) instead of looking for who did it.  A dead giveaway, you know, telltale clue, you know, "Better not deal with him."  And so, it was very tough, but again, I think, smartly, my parents [Juliette Harris Curry and Eugene Curry] refused to let me leave.  Notwithstanding the difficulty the anguish the pain of going through it, because they--you know, I had wanted to transfer to [Johns] Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland] and I think they sort of correctly gleaned, well, okay, we hear your arguments about the place, we're not sure that, that you shouldn't learn to deal with it, on the other hand if you go to Hopkins you're gonna be in the big city and you're gonna be with your buddies in the big city, so, no (laughter).
Speaker 2: Were they at all concerned about your safety, or were you concerned about your safety at Western Maryland?
Speaker 1: Occasionally, I mean there were occasions where people would make mistakes in that environment.  For example, as freshman, I did have a set of buddies, white buddies, mostly us nerds (laughter) and we would hang out do things college students do, but I was friends with some of the football players and the nerds, so on late evenings, if you wanted to, and you were hanging out with the football players you get in somebody's car, ride out to the highway truck stop, you know, get a late night submarine and some soda and French fries and come on back to the dorm when you felt like it.  Well, usually that was okay, you know, the truck drivers didn't give you much grief and all of that, but we made the mistake of doing that with the freshmen nerds late one night, same truck stop.  And the moment we walked in the door (sniffing) "Smells like niggers in here."  And, I'm like, "Well, you know what, let's just back up outta this door and find somewhere else to eat."  And of course, all my little intellectual nerd buddies (laughter) are saying, "As a matter of principal, we're not gonna do that, we're gonna stay here and eat."  And, I'm lookin' around going, "No we're not, these are truck drivers and stuff man, and this is Klan country.  What we're gonna do is back up outta this door, get back in the car and find somewhere else to eat.  Now, if you wanna, we can come back with some football players (laughter) but no, we are not gonna do this."  And, so there were those kinds of things that happened and other encounters, as you know, attend the social functions of college, the beer parties and keg parties and the this and that.  So yeah, there were, there were other challenging and anguishing encounters, but I--by in large, you know, the world's got a huge risk element to it everywhere, and even on occasions where you might fear this or that, you gotta figure out how to get around it, how to continue to maneuver.
Story_ID: 235332
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite courses in college [Western Maryland College; McDaniel College, Westminster, Maryland] that you really enjoyed?
Speaker 2: Psychology was where I finally wound up getting turned on.  I really didn't get turned on to school until my junior year in college, you know.  To that point, doing the work of school is sort of mechanical; you just did it 'cause you were supposed to.  But I had a super fine psychology professor, guy named Steve Colyer [Stephen Colyer] who was himself a bit of a nonconformist and a huge brain, I mean he was obviously a very smart guy but a very social guy.  Sort of, for Western Maryland, you know, rare.  Long hair, would have I think been called a hippie.  You know, jeans and casual clothes, you know, his pipe and a spectacular brain.  And, I had a couple of obligatory classes with the guy and then got turned on, I've just always been mesmerized by really smart people with big brains, you know they just--an, and that and the subject matter and frankly through that period the quest to find out what all of these conflicting things in me were from that social background sort of culminated in, "Yeah, I like this stuff, this is interesting stuff to explore." and particularly got turned on with behavioral psychology and experimentation, yeah.
Story_ID: 235333
Speaker 1: And so what were you thinking you wanted to do with your life when you graduated from college [Western Maryland College; McDaniel College, Westminster, Maryland]?  You were pursuing a degree in psychology, what were you thinking you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Well I wanted to one, take some time, and get the experience out of my system, get the toxins from having lived through that part of the social experience out of my system.  To figure out where I fit in what was a really quickly changing world at that point where, you know, anti-war sentiments cruising around, civil rights movements going down, drugs are proliferating everywhere, sexual revolution's, you know, pretty much at its height.  There were a lot of huge things influencing all of us so just take some time, slow down man, see how--figure out where you fit in all of these things, what you believe and what your own personal creed and credo's gonna be.  And, but, from a professional standpoint I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't--I knew I wasn't goin' back home, I hoped that meant I wasn't gonna be homeless (laughter) I continued to work at the truck stop for a while, get, you know, cash income while the bigger decisions about where to work were made.  And just started applying around for different jobs, you know, testing.  For example, I submitted an application to become a daycare center teacher through a federally funded jobs program, and I submitted an application to go to work for G.M. [General Motors Company, Detroit, Michigan] and obviously, radically different kinds of experiences particularly for somebody who at that time didn't own a suit, had an eight inch afro, you know, a beard, wore flower print shirt, jeans and moccasins and for a time was a vegetarian carting around a jug of distilled water everywhere I went, evangelizing about taking care of my body; while I smoked my cigarettes.
Speaker 1: Were you a hippie?
Speaker 2: I was a little bit of everything, I was an eclectic mix and mob of things, but some would have said that and I was a participant in demonstrations about the [Vietnam] War and things of that kind, and very stolid about standing up for myself, you know, even though I was, for the most part, until college, a small guy and then I grew rapidly (snaps finger) my second year in college.  I grew six inches taller and this that and the other, and so life changed, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, what did "The Bull" [Curry's father, Eugene Curry] think about this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He--
Speaker 1: --big afro, flowered shirts--
Speaker 2: Oh, for a time he thought I'd lost my mind (laughter) and he was just, he just couldn't countenance any of this, it was like, "What has happened to you boy, what is wrong with you?  Man, I've invested all this in you?"  He was funny.  In fact, he was so comical that after college, and I did get the job at the daycare center, and I loved it, and I was a teacher and then later a center director at a daycare center, and as I said, it was federally funded so when disagreements arose with the management of the daycare center and it was a Model Cities Program where two-thirds of the people who worked in the center had to be eligible from the area which meant they essentially had to be welfare mothers and people and folks on food stamps and this that and the other and they had to be employed and trained and work in the center.  And then a third of us were college educated et cetera, et cetera, well, I liked that until the point that the government decided it was gonna come in and tell us what to do on every particular.  And those of us who were college bound and, and nonconformists and activists and fans of Gil Scott-Heron and [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni and people like that decided we weren't gonna take that.  And so we quit, of course, pretty stupid decision to quit without knowing (laughter) what you were gonna do next, but we did, as a protest, and so I decided I had a little money saved up I was gonna see the country, see the world.  And so I packed up my Volkswagen with my record collection, my stereo, sleeping bag and a tent and I just told the fellas at the apartment, "Man, I'm gone, I'mma go see what's out here."  And I left.  But I had made provision before I did, with my dad, to hold my money.  And so I gave "The Bull" my money and said, "Now dad, I know you're not necessarily approving of this, but I gotta do this, but look, I'm gonna be traveling I'll keep roughly in touch, I might need some money on the road from time to time so hold my money for me and if I need it call--wire, send the money."  Well the first time I needed to call "The Bull," I was in Wichita, Kansas, one evening sitting outside some bar (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what year was this?
Speaker 2: Oh, '74 [1974] I think.  And was outta money and couldn't find a truck stop to work, you know, the day labor work kinda job and so I called "The Bull," "Dad, please send me a hundred dollars."  "Well, wait a minute now, where are you?"  So I told him.  He said, "Well now you know if you hadn't left town as I discouraged you to do, you wouldn't be callin' me up trying--."  And I mean he begins this lecture, a sermon, a long one (laughter) and I had to remind him, "Dad, I am in a strange town, where I don't know anybody with no money and you have my money (laughter) you know, this is not the time for this sermon on how awful I'm gonna be, send me some money man."  (Laughter) So anyway "The Bull" took the opportunity to rage about what a mess I was.  But he finally did send me some money and I continued my odyssey.
Story_ID: 235334
Speaker 1: You graduated from Western [Maryland College; McDaniel College, Westminster, Maryland] in seventy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Western Maryland in '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: --two.  And you went to work at the daycare center--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in '72 [1972] and you were there until '70--
Speaker 2: Seventy-three [1973]--
Speaker 1: --seventy-three [1973].
Speaker 2: --end of '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the daycare center?
Speaker 2: Child Daycare Center of Prince George's County Inc. [Prince George's County, Maryland].
Speaker 1: And you were a teacher?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and then a center director.
Speaker 1: How long did you travel cross country?
Speaker 2: About eleven months, ten or eleven months.
Speaker 1: And tell us about some of your experiences.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a stunning time to be loose at--essentially, you know, God, I can't even remember--some atlas that had the highways of America on it and the campgrounds, and I'd flip a coin and decide where I was going and I'd just start up and go somewhere so I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What kind of car did you have?
Speaker 2: Volkswagen, Volkswagen Beetle.
Speaker 1: So you were a hippie.
Speaker 2: I was just in the times; I was in the times (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And, so I traveled, went south, and then went across [U.S.] Route 10 out to California, you know, made that odysseyian [ph.] trek and then from California, you know, up to Washington State and then Washington State back across to home with, you know, longer and shorter stops along the trail depending on whether I met somebody or knew somebody and who I could freeload on.  And classmates who graduated and moved or their siblings and stuff (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And did you just kind of pick up odd jobs along the way?
Speaker 2: Yeah, worked truck stops, I mean truck stops were such a wonderful thing.  Having learned it here in high school [Bladensburg High School, Bladensburg, Maryland] and college I knew in every city there's a truck stop where guys pay for day labor.  You go, you work their truck, they pay you cash.
Speaker 1: Like working the truck, is that loading and unloading things (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Loading and unloading, yeah, yeah.  Different commodities, different things around the country but in every city there's a truck stop where a guy needs--these long haul truckers drive, they don't load.  And, so--and I'd already developed the vocabulary to deal with the truckers from having done it at home, you know what I mean, these were interesting guys, many of 'em cowboys so to speak, you know.  And so you learn how--that too, you know, is a repertoire.
Speaker 1: And what do you think you learned from that experience?
Speaker 2: Wow, there're too many lessons to recite, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the biggest lesson you think?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness--
Speaker 1: Did you find yourself?
Speaker 2: You know I think life is a constant quest to re-find yourself and to reinvent yourself.  So I guess for that time, yeah, I mean, it wasn't part of an exploration to see where you fit and all this mess.  But part of that's defined too by how excited is the mess at the time, and you know, and that was a messy time for the whole country.  It's kinda hard to find yourself in the middle of a tornado, is how I liken it, it's the metaphor.  But, it was a good thing to have done and gave me a chance in a lot of different ways to look inside and be introspective about where you fit.  I mean there's something liberating about waking up on the edge of the Grand Canyon [Arizona] with nobody there to bother you, or some lake in Oregon when you open the tent there's a herd of deer between you and the lake edge and nothing else and nobody.  Or, the different feeling you get as I did driving through Mississippi and Alabama late one night and realize I was almost out of gas and wasn't at a campground and it was terrifying.  "Man if you run out of gas on this highway here ain't no tellin' what's gonna happen to you," you know.  And then the relief, you know, that God provided an exit with an open gas station right at the right moment (laughter) so you could just keep right on driving, get outta here, you know, get outta Mississippi.
Story_ID: 235335
Speaker 1: In terms of your travel (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --your journey across country, did you meet some people along the way who were doing the same thing you were?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, I mean it was an interesting time, you know.  I had--I was so sick when I missed Woodstock [Festival; Woodstock Music & Art Fair, White Lake, New York], you know, as a child of the subsequent year.  They did another thing up in Canada called Strawberry Fields [Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada], I didn't miss that one, you know, I made it to that rock festival concert.  And so, by this time, having lived that experience, the neighborhood experience and now being on the road, you met a lot of people who were, "finding themselves," and a lot of us were experiencing the same kinda sentiments about the war [Vietnam War] and about our own experiences professionally and where we fit after college and the things we wanted to do, and it was an era of extraordinary idealism, much different from now with the cynicism that pervades everything and, yeah, you meet a lotta really cool, really fine exploratory people, who are all trying to fit into all of these revolutions that were going on, as I mentioned before, with sex and war and civil rights and you name it, there's all this stuff going on, and, proliferation of drugs had just begun, so you know, it was an awful lot going on.  A lot of people were mobile and trying to quote, "find themselves," yeah you meet a lot really fine people.  Met a few nutcases too.  I mean it, it was an era, believe it or not where people hitchhiked, I used to hitchhike regularly.  I hitchhiked to Florida, I'd hitchhike to Connecticut, I'd hitchhike on the road and you just--it was just a different kinda time, you know, I wouldn't hitchhike now if, you know, you couldn't make me hitchhike around the corner.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: You know I just--you know, you can't do it.
Story_ID: 235336
Speaker 1: And so when you came back in 1975, what were you thinking you were gonna do?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time I really wasn't sure, I had the degree, I had the daycare center experience [at Child Daycare Center of Prince George's County Inc., Prince George's County, Maryland] I had some friends who had stayed and whose professional careers had taken off, and they were in different jobs and environments, and so I contacted--I owed people money, 'cause I'd borrowed money while I traveled, you know, and people wired me money here, wired me money there and I needed a job and I got lucky.  A couple of my friends from high school [Bladensburg High School, Bladensburg, Maryland] had supported the victorious county executive here at home.  And they were in the process of hiring their up their staff and administration.  And so they pointed me through a labyrinth of personnel stuff that ultimately wound up with me being hired under a federal jobs program in the [Prince George's County, Maryland] county executive's office in 1974 or five [1975], maybe late '74 [1974].  And the county executive at that time was Winfield [M.] Kelly, Jr. and so I wound up in this sponsored job, you know, sort of the next iteration of the Model Cities Program, which was called CETA; it was the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act and it was a way to, you know, jog--stimulate the economy, you know, that the feds had proposed and they were passing this money out to localities and they had some.  So I got hired on a CETA job working for the county executive.
Speaker 1: And at that time, in 1974, '75 [1975], did you ever think that you would be sitting in that same seat as Winfield Kelly?
Speaker 2: No, and in fact I only took the job, I wasn't political, I was actually anti-establishment, I didn't like the government, I didn't like what had happened in Vietnam.  I didn't like the racism that was pervading almost everything everywhere.  And, so no, I took the job 'cause I had (laughter) to have a job and I had some guys who were there.  And it worked out, you know, but once I got there, and the lights went on, it was like, oh, this is not at all what I expected or ever learned.  And I'd sit--I was essentially a grunt who wrote constituent reply mail to people that complained.  And, I'd st--you know there was a corral where those of us who were seated employees sat and did that kind of meaningful work.  And so I'd sit in the corral and write my letters and--but I'd watch what was going on.  I'd see all these sharply dressed people in expensive shoes and with big briefcases, "What are they doing, who are they?"  "Well those are the lawyers."  "Well what are they doing?"  "Well, they're going in to see the county executive."  I said, "Well, this ain't the courthouse, what are the lawyers doing here?"  I was told, "Hold on, not those kinda lawyers, these are business lawyers and zoning lawyers and development lawyers and bond lawyers."  "Oh, well they must do well; they all look to be doing quite well."  "Oh, no, they make a lot of money."  Said, "Well, what's that gotta do with politics?"  "Oh, no, no, no, this--." I thought this was like a little manager job here.  Oh yeah, it is a little manager, a little manager over, as was the case when I finally became county executive, two billion of direct dollars and two billion of indirect dollars, oh.  And my buddies, who had arranged this employment, were themselves, working days for the county executive and going to law school at night.  And so I said, "Looks like a good trail."  And I began to do the same thing, particularly after I met some of the people who were doing that kinda work and those lawyers who were trooping in and out.  It was like, my gracious, I've met these guys, if they can do it I can do it.  And so I worked days for the county executive and then nights enrolled in law school at the University of Maryland, and graduated from University of Maryland Law School [University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland] in 1980.  But I was very fortunate once I had begun, one--from that seated job I got another job in the county executive's office, then another job in the county executive's office then another and another.  And I wound up in the end being one of the county executive's top five political appointees in his government under Winnie Kelly and it was at that time, in working to promote his re-election, which failed, that I learned more about politics.
Story_ID: 235337
Speaker 1: I had become involved [in politics] once, in 1966 at the urging of these couple of buddies of mine, and I lasted two weeks, I mean, I'm not gonna be involved in this kinda mess, you know, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What were you doing in 1966, what were you involved in?
Speaker 1: I think we were promoting, I can't remember the guy's name, but he [Spiro Agnew] was opposing some racist who was running here on the theme of, "Your Home is Your Castle, [Protect It]."  George P.--
Speaker 2: --so it was a local--
Speaker 1: --Mahoney.  That's who; George P. Mahoney was running for governor under the theme, "Your Home is Your Castle."  And, I can't remember the gentleman who was opposing him but they dragged me into some campaign activity and subsequently they talked me into one more campaign with Joe Tydings [Joseph D. Tydings] who was running for U.S. Senate, and who did succeed at becoming a senator.  But I really wasn't interested, didn't last long, you know, wasn't a good volunteer.  But I've always been loyal and contentious so when I went to work for Winnie Kelly [Winfield M. Kelly, Jr.] and he was running for election and I was one of his guys, then I did what your guys do, you support the throne and you go down with the ship.  And so that's when I became more interested in politics.  At that time I had a girlfriend who was--who had also been a CETA [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act] employee and she worked in the [Prince George's County, Maryland] county executive's office and in the same election that Winnie lost, she was victorious and became the first black woman elected to our county council.  So, you know, I was still covered (laughter) and we had done, you know, a good and fun job of maneuvering to get her in that position and she was a brilliant woman too, a lady by the name of Debbie Marshall [Deborah Marshall].  And, so Debbie won and then that's when it really began, in earnest, I spent a lot of time helping over the years, other people become politicians.  And, learned a lot more about the synergy, the relationship between government and business, much more than I ever knew, much more than most citizens know.
Story_ID: 235338
Speaker 1: And when you were in law school [University of Maryland School of Law; University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland], what were some of your favorite law classes?
Speaker 2: Well, my--I enjoyed state and local government, for one, 'cause it was almost a gimmie.  At the time I was working in local government at a pretty high level, you know, for--in a significant local government so that was one.  And it was interesting to synthesize the reality of what we did everyday with the sort of glamorous or romanticized presentation of the cases, you know, in the books.  And so that was exciting to me, the rest of it that was exciting, were the clinical classes, the ones that--where you actually learned techniques of doing various things and that was exciting.  Ironically the best classes--and real estate I did enjoy, somewhat, thankfully, 'cause for part of my--the last part of my law school experience, [Winfield M.] Kelly [Jr.], having lost the election, I went to work for a local commercial and industrial real estate company so I heavied up on real estate classes in law school as sort of a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You worked for them as an attorney?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't an attorney yet--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was still in school, so, so but I promised to heavy up on real estate classes and I did and emphasized that.  And those were pretty decent because once again, I could incorporate what I was getting out of school with what was really going on at the real estate company.  And make sense of both, even though, again, the books don't really capture how it is, but that's just life, you know.  So that was good and there weren't any black people doing it in Prince George's County [Maryland] at that time, you know, so it was, I was sort of, again, the first at this, the first at that and so it was consistent and comfortable to me to be in that role and I did that.  And I enjoyed the law school experience, you know, I graduated with honors from Maryland's law school and, after working all day and going to school at night and, so that, that was good.  Ironically the classes (laughter) that I did the best in weren't the (laughter) ones that I concentrated on the most.  I mean, it's almost always sorta been like that for me, I did very well in commercial law, which called the uniform commercial code which is, for most students, is, sheer drudgery, I don't know why, I just did, banking and arcane rules of commerce, you know, did well in that, did well in administrative law which is agency operations, did well in that too.  All of this served me very well when I came out and got involved as an attorney with the real estate company [NAI Michael, Lanham, Maryland].
Story_ID: 235339
Speaker 1: And so, when you graduated from law school [University of Maryland School of Law; University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland] in 1980, what was next for you?
Speaker 2: Well I was already working at the real estate company [NAI Michael, Lanham, Maryland] so I became a vice president and general counsel with a gentleman by the name of Kenneth H. Michael, who's a big name around here still, and so I was Ken's vice president and general counsel for a couple of years, two and a half, three years.
Speaker 1: And I heard a story once about when you first went to work for Mr. Michael, you still had the big afro (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, motorcycle, afro, shoulder bag--
Speaker 1: --and, the distilled water--
Speaker 2: --yeah, distilled water--
Speaker 1: --tell us a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Well, well, Ken and I were always an odd couple.  He--I had seen from afar and experienced once or twice when I worked for the county executive and knew him to be an influential member of the Prince George's County [Maryland] community.  And you gotta remember, it's hard for folks to understand, Prince George's County, 'til very recently, for three hundred plus years was overwhelmingly white and a little rednecky to say the least, with, you know, a sorta checkered reputation for race relations and police community relations and all of that.  And here I was, you know once again, having been a marine, first this, first that, first in the executive's office at such a position for somebody black and all those things, and one of the guys I meet is Ken Michael who's very successful real estate broker and agent from Winchester, Virginia, complete with the twang and the country boy demeanor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And kinda crusty (laughter).
Speaker 2: --and all of that stuff.  So long story short, I, you know, [Winfield M.] Kelly [Jr.] lost the election, I needed work, I worked downtown for a gentleman by the name of Larry Williams [ph.] for a while as a law clerk and then decided to accelerate the law school experience, finish it and get out.  And I was running around looking for somewhere to land so that I could go to school full-time, and Senator Tommie Broadwater [Jr.] who was my buddy and had been my babysitter as a child called me to a meeting with this guy Ken Michael.  So that--I walk into Tommie's bar and lounge, and he and Ken are talking so then I join them and they start talking and they're trading this and all this kinda, "De-de-de-de-de", and of course, I'm impatient, like, "Man I'm waiting to talk to Tommie."  He was--"Look man, I gotta borrow money and finish school."  So long story short, Tommie doesn't offer up any money and Michael says, "Hey man, why don't you come by the office one day, we'll talk about what you gonna do when you get out of law school?"  "Yeah, sure, sure," and all I can think is, "Look Tommie, can I please end this conversation and talk about this money I need?"  Long story short, I leave, I'm frustrated and angry, right, 'cause I feel like I been misdirected, Tommie's trying to avoid the inevitable conversation about, "Look man, you got to lend me some money."  So long story short, unknown to me part of my naivete, Tommie was already thinking about hooking me up, acquainting me with somebody, you know, who fit, whose needs fit what I was doing.  So, I went back and saw Tommie a couple weeks later.  He said, "Well, have you called Michael?"  I said, "No."  He said, "Well man, call the man, the man's been calling me every couple of days just 'cause you haven't called him."  I said, "What do you want me to call him for?"  He said, "Man sat right here and told you to call him about a job."  I said, "Oh, he was serious?  I thought that was just some beer talk."  (Laughter) So long story short I called Ken, we chatted, he hired me.  My principal responsibility was to go to school and heavy up on real estate that last year.  I did it.  Graduated with honors, went to work for his real estate company and learned an awful lot, learned an awful lot, 'bout how things work.
Speaker 1: And I read somewhere else, too, that Mr. Michael would say that you would always use these (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, these big words--
Speaker 1: --big words, he didn't even know what--
Speaker 2: --he says that today, yeah----
Speaker 1: --they meant but he was just--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, he's funny.
Speaker 1: --always impressed by it.
Speaker 2: Well Ken's also one of the most cunning people you'll ever meet.  I mean he is really savvy; he maximizes the juice out of that old country boy thing--demeanor that he uses.  He mutilates the language on purpose to sort of disarm people and make 'em think, "That ole country boy, nice guy don't know too much," tsk, hardly, he knows it all.  And can do it all and it was--he's got a great sense of humor, and so I'm convinced that part of the reason he hired me, notwithstanding the reactions of his redneck friends, was that he thought it would be a stitch, in addition to, in his mind, he's getting a good deal.
Story_ID: 235340
Speaker 1: And he's [Kenneth H. Michael] a very forthright guy; he wasn't intimidated by all of that even though no one had ever done it.  He still isn't very much by that sort of thing.  I asked him one time--well, when we were talking and negotiating, I said, "Okay, so, if you help me through this last year of school [University of Maryland School of Law; University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland] what is it I owe you?"  And he said, "I don't know what you mean?"  I said, "Well is it like the [U.S.] Army or something, you help me through school, I give you a couple of years of my life?"  He said, "Eh," he got frustrated, you know, he was a little bit angry with me, he said, "[HistoryMaker] Wayne [Curry], look, let me explain to you how I am," he said, "I want you to do the best you can in the real estate classes and learn as much as you can about real estate 'cause that's what I do.  But I'm fundamentally making a bet here, man, I bet you're gonna be good, so you don't owe me anything.  If you do it, and I'm betting right, you'll be good at it, and I'll get a good lawyer and I'll have somebody that can help my firm [NAI Michael, Lanham, Maryland] grow.  And if I'm right it's no point in me telling you, you owe me this or that because if you're as good as I think you're gonna be, and you wanna breach it, you'll just breach it and win anyway, so what's the point?  No, if it doesn't work in the end I'll say I helped a young guy along and we'll shake and that'll be the end of it."  And I mean, this is from a guy that people still lovingly, laughingly refer to as a red neck from Winchester [Virginia].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--but he's very savvy and he's still very savvy and in front of the game, and it's unexpected.  And we used to go to meetings for example (laughter) and Ken would crack up, you know, the two of us would scheme about, you know, our approach to a negotiation or something, and we'd get there and he'd (snaps fingers) change right in the middle of it and do something contrary and it's like cards, you gotta follow 'em and you gotta figure out--and we did that, we were very compatible in that way.  There were occasions of course we said, "Well, me and my lawyer will be there."  And we'd arrive somewhere, some coterie of, you know, influential white folks and Ken would walk into the room and I'd approach the door and guy say, "Well, what are you doin'?"  I'd say, "Well, I'm the lawyer."  "Oh, ah," you know, it was stunning, course Ken always thought that was comical, you know, he'd love that.  So, it was a grand relationship--
Story_ID: 235341
Speaker 1: Left him [Kenneth H. Michael], joined Russ Shipley's [Russell W. Shipley] law firm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When did you leave the Michael Companies [NAI Michael, Lanham, Maryland]?
Speaker 1: Gosh, when--'83 [1983], I think, somewhere around '82 [1982], '83 [1983].
Speaker 2: And where did you go after that?
Speaker 1: I joined Russell Shipley, a local development lawyer, as a partner with Russ.  And a wonderful guy, I come to know Russ too, who had been the most influential zoning lawyer in this county [Prince George's County, Maryland] and, and who helped me immeasurably, taught me a lot taught me the ropes a lot on zoning and stuff.  And then Russ and I merged with Bill Meyers [William Meyers], Lance Billingsley to create a new law firm, Meyers, Billingsley, Shipley, Curry [Rodbell & Rosenbaum, Silver Spring, Maryland] and then the other iterations until I ran for public office.
Speaker 2: But when did you work for Dimensions Healthcare [System, Cheverly, Maryland]?
Speaker 1: I think I picked Dimensions up as a client in '85 [1985] or '86 [1986].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Somewhere around then.
Speaker 2: And can you just tell us a little bit about your experiences with Dimension Healthcare and what it was like representing them?
Speaker 1: You know I have been fortunate to have had some very interesting representations as a lawyer, of which one is of course the hospital corporation.  It's a big commercial activity, a big corporate client, and an exciting one in the sense that you learn a lot about the law and rules of medicine, but a lot about the law and rules of corporations and finance, and other things and that's how it was.  For me, it was also satisfying because I am a homeboy and I've lived the transformation of my hometown [Cheverly, Maryland] and I've done so in influential ways and being a big corporate attorney at a relatively young age in this dynamic changing community was good for me.  And I think I was good for them, the combination of having had political experience as well as legal experience and real estate and commercial transactions and all of that was good.  The fact that it was happening in my hometown that was under extraordinary changes and dynamic pressures racially and economically and otherwise was even more satisfying to be at the helm of a big change like that.  But I've been blessed to have had some real diversity in my practice.  People always refer to me as a, a, real estate or development lawyer and I snicker because everybody looks for an easy label, I don't fit one either politically or professionally.  I also represented Len Bias' parents before Lenny, I mean after Lenny died, but before that unfortunate case (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was that basketball?
Speaker 1: --yeah, basketball player that died the eve of his arrival at the NBA [National Basketball Association].  And, you know, while at the hospital, sort of supervised the handling of the case of a woman who was alleged to be a mass murdereress, a killer nurse who was alleged to have been dispatching people at her will, which, at the time, was among the first such cases ever to be discovered and publicized.  So these have been precedents in my own career that would--have been pretty much consistent with this whole arena of being among the firsts in different ways.  Likewise politically, you know, with--all the way back to Kelly [Winfield M. Kelly, Jr.] and Debbie Marshall [Deborah Marshall] and then subsequent elected, and [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson, you know, we were among the insurgents who left the Dem--classic Democratic Party to support Jesse while they laughed at us in '84 [1984].  Of course, Jesse swept every elected seat and the party fathers had to appoint themselves to go to their own convention after, you know, laughing at us and rejecting us.  Likewise again in '88 [1988], you know, we took every seat in between, we ran Alex Williams [Alexander Williams, Jr.] for prosecutor here, Alex won--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: In Prince George's County [Maryland]?
Speaker 1: In Prince George's County, beat a twenty-four-year incumbent while they laughed at us.  So, they have a bad habit of snickering while losing.  And likewise with my own subsequent election to the county executive's post, there were many who thought that was laughable when it began.  Because I wasn't the choice of the Democratic fathers, you know, the party boys, the powers that be.  Many of the black elected officials were intimidated to support me; of fifty-seven incumbents I had the support of two.  Of sixteen public unions I had the support of four.  But I had something different and more valuable, you know, the support of the people, who lived here.
Story_ID: 235342
Speaker 1: Let's talk about how you kind of made the transition somewhat from corporate law to politics.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: When did you start thinking, "Okay, I wanna be on the other side of this whole political equation"?
Speaker 2: That's a very (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did that--
Speaker 2: --tough call because it wasn't that clearly targeted, bracketed.  What happened wa--I actually had always thought that Alex Williams [Alexander Williams, Jr.], who had been the first countywide black elected to office, as our state's attorney, our prosecutor, would wind up being the first black county executive.  But once Alex became prosecutor, he decided to become a lawyer's lawyer and rather than to resume political or expand political influence decided to become a judge.  Well for those of us who were dedicated political gladiators, it's like, "Well man we don't do that sort of thing to make judges.  I mean that's not what we do."  So we--here we are at this critical election in '94 [1994] without the expected horse.  It's like the Kentucky Derby's a few weeks away, and you don't have a horse.  And so it was in that context, anticipating that Alex was not gonna do it, that somebody had to do it.  And, by that time I had already developed some adverse impressions of what [Parris N.] Glendening was actually doing as opposed to what he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Parris Glendening--
Speaker 2: who was, at that time--
Speaker 1: --who was the then--
Speaker 2: --county executive--
Speaker 1: --county executive--
Speaker 2: --as opposed to what he said he was doing and, you know, so long story short, those of us who had been the insurgents with [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L. Jackson] and had evolved, said, "We can't go into an election without a horse."  And we're all talking about who we're gonna saddle and they said, "No, we're saddling you."  I was like, "No we're not."  "Yes we are," so anyway we had this discussion among friends, thankfully devoted, loyal friends and that's when--that's how the decision was born.  And it was made three years before the election, and was methodically, assiduously and energetically pursued.
Speaker 1: And can we talk a little bit about how the county was starting to change?  It wasn't the county economically that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: It was starting to change and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was way different--
Speaker 1: --the face of the county--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --was changing, the economic base was changing?
Speaker 2: Well in actuality, and this is another thing that's very hard to describe to newcomers, you know, as a child here the place was maybe 150,000 people, it was 98 percent white, the whites who were here were largely pickup truck driving, shotgun rack, you know, wearing tight pants, cowboy boot accessorized folks.  And, by the '70s [1970s], that's when the change was occurring.  That's when the heated sort of crucible of integration beset the schools and when those big and significant movements began to land here, and when the 1954 Brown vs. Topeka, Kansas [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] decision was finally honored in Prince George's County [Maryland] because of litigation in 1971 and when the decade of the '70s [1970s] became the decade of the greatest immigration of black folks, it wasn't as people think now, you know, in the decade when they arrived, it was actually the '70s [1970s] where at the time and through that decade the place became about 25 percent African American, and the stresses on the political network began to occur as black people demanded more participatory roles in the determination of their own futures through politics.
Speaker 1: Because these were African Americans who were educated--
Speaker 2: Educated, largely middle class.
Speaker 1: --financially, right.
Speaker 2: Who defied and rebutted the images of frightened white folks that the black folks were gonna make it bad for us, we can't have all these Negroes running rampant all over Prince George's County.  And when white flight became the vernacular to handle the demographic shifting that was going on, and it was the '70s [1970s].  In the '80s [1980s], it was in the 30s or 40 percents, by the '90s [1990s] it was majority.  But the systems here politically and otherwise weren't responding to that because black folks were doing then as they do now, voting insufficiently compared to their numbers.  So guys were still holding on to a disproportionate share of the power, and still do, because of our disinclination to participate.  And so it was only in the decade of the '90s [1990s] later confirmed with the 2000 census that we were the declared majority.  Well, I knew we were the actual majority before that just 'cause of the involvements with politics and so that encouraged me in these other--and it was clear where the pendulum was swinging in demographic terms.
Story_ID: 235343
Speaker 1: Providing the stability and leadership, the sincerity and integrity though, to say, this is not a bad thing that's happening here [Prince George's County, Maryland], this is a good thing if we manage it and know what to do, encouraged me that with the background, with the political experience, with the real estate experience, which is a big deal in local government zoning and permits and stuff, development, big (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And which you learned in the county executive's office.
Speaker 1: That I already knew.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Commercial experience at the hospital, the social experiences of childhood forward with this shifting and change that was going on.  The sort of bicultural orientation in both worlds and accepted in both.  The world of the Ken Michaels [Kenneth H. Michael] and the world of my buddies from childhood was it--and the political experience running the insurgencies with [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L. Jackson] and then subsequently Alex [Alexander Williams, Jr.], and those things it was almost irresponsible to do anything but saddle up.  And I had a sense that we were being plundered and we were, and more importantly, that people didn't--the leaders didn't believe in themselves.  They didn't believe in the shifting demographics and that it could possibly be good.  And so they were pretending to be providing the sincerity that you expect out of an elected official while they were really preparing to pack up.  They were like these hurricane victims, you know, "Well, they sent a warning and we packed up we're gonna see if we actually have to load the truck and leave but we already got our stuff in boxes."  And so they were providing false leadership and it wasn't for the fact they didn't believe it themselves.  But what ironically has happened here has happened nowhere else in America.  This is the only sub-division of its kind to have gone from being small, all-white, rural and throwback as a child, to being huge, majority African American, cosmopolitan and wherein, in that demographic shift to majority black status education and income have gone up and not down.  That has not happened anywhere else in this country, nowhere.  And so what we are is an evolving organism, and people who are at the helm of these changes are pioneers, because you don't have the luxury of resorting, you know, to an encyclopedia or textbook or history tome to tell you what to do.  You've got to weigh and synthesize all these dynamic changes that have never occurred anywhere before and make good decisions about where you take people.
Story_ID: 237671
Speaker 1: So 1994 you're elected as county executive?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Prince George's County, Maryland.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The first African American county executive?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I just--I'm curious, what were your thoughts after you had gone to work as a constituent mail reply (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As, as a grunt (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --yes.
Speaker 1: --in the '70s [1970s] for the county executive [Winfield M. Kelly, Jr.], here you were not only in the county executive's office, but making history as well?
Speaker 2: My feelings are actually indescribable, they were on the night of the election and they remain so.  I can at least translate it a little bit into words now because it gave me an opportunity to do something that was unprecedented.  At the time there were only two black elected county executives in the entire country of which there's three thousand plus counties.  It was in my hometown [Cheverly, Maryland] with its checkered history of race relations and the personal sacrifices and battles which had been made from childhood forward through a lot of painful and anguishing stuff and through the election itself, which became rollicking because the traditional party fathers, when I decided to run, laughed and ignored this campaign until the first financial filing when they observed that I had a half a million dollars in the bank and at which point they decided then to destroy me, in essence, in political terms.  And they invented opponents to run against me and things like that to split the black vote in predictable sorts of ways to influence the calculus, the metrics of the election, and it didn't work.  And that--my father [Eugene Curry] had died in the year just before the election year and, you know, there were a lot of swirling sentiments and emotions going on all the way back to that decision he made about elementary school and the fulfillment.  And as you observed, you know having worked up from the grunt level to this very eminent achievement in my hometown was overwhelming.  And in a lot of ways, looking back at it, poetic in a sense, that I now believe that not my hand, but God's hand was at work in all of this and prominently, because in addition to all the things I thought about the campaign, and all the reasons that I postulated for doing it, once we had won and discovered that the jurisdiction was in far different shape than we had been told, that we were broke, that we confronted a structural deficit, that my predecessor [Parris N. Glendening] who had harvested 98 percent of the black vote had taken that vote, and used it and its future to mortgage his own and fuel his ascension to the governor's seat, all of those things then took on a different perspective in my own mind and had a different sort of prominence in my thinking.  It's very rare, I think, to be granted an opportunity to be so influential in one's hometown.  To actually stamp the future with the imprimatur of your service, to tattoo the future with the changes that you invoke as the leader of the jurisdiction and in a jurisdiction like this, highly political, highly publicized, on the threshold of Rome, the new Washington [D.C.] with the boys and a lifetime of political involvements here around this area.  I'd be different if I was from Topeka [Kansas], I grew up around Washington and even the simple culture and climate of the community's different around here, and remains so.  So the emotions are indescribable in a sense, I was very proud of the opportunity to elevate my hometown to make a difference.  Everybody says it but not everybody does it nor does everybody get a chance to do it, and for innumerable reasons I got a chance to do it, we changed it, we completely reversed the direction of the place in economic terms.  We changed its image, we contradicted expectation, we defied, obliterated stereotype.  There were no big scandals; there were no economic and financial upheavals.  There were no big mistakes in those terms.  We ended a thirty-year-old bussing case that nobody else would touch.  We demonstrated the courage to change the laws that had bankrupted us despite the opposition of unions who then totally and completely abandoned me as a Democratic leader.  And over the objections of over the incumbent governor [William Donald Schaefer] and the Democratic Party that essentially abandoned me because I wasn't a good boy, but I was a right boy in the sense that we made this community better, and we've made it unprecedented and we've defied stereotype, we contradicted every adverse image that could be painted of a majority black political subdivision in ways that have never been replicated anywhere in this country including in those ascendant communities outside of Atlanta [Georgia].  So we're special, I had a significant role in that, the good Lord blessed me with opportunities I never dreamed of, we, the Washington Redskins play in Prince George's County because of the deal that we cut--
Story_ID: 237672
Speaker 1: I was really blessed to have the preparation I had and the opportunities as [county] executive [of Prince George's County, Maryland], even the things that looked awful, including the deficit when I first took over, and the indifference of the incumbent career politicians, in the end turned out to be good things so the good Lord was lookin' out for me in a way and in ways that I didn't expect.  The deficit that was so horrifying also became a great screen.  Anything I wanted to do I could blame on the deficit.  "Yeah, I really hate to do this, but we have this huge deficit we gotta fix it so I have to do the following."  And people gave me the benefit of the doubt in undertaking these hugely draconian measures to fix it.  Without that deficit some of the things I did I would've never gotten away with as a politician.  I'd have become so unpopular people would've chopped my head off.  I'm serious, it was just that bad and our situation was that bad, and little things like the Washington Redskins and the stadium [Jack Kent Cooke Stadium; FedExField, Landover, Maryland] deal that we cut and what it represented.  Here I am in my first term, just coming off of the discovery of this huge financial problem, and I'm still sorta reeling and whirling from what that means.  I think I'm gonna have a term that looks like "A" and my term's gonna look like "X" because I'm broke, and in the words of my grandmamma, "You can't help nobody when you broke."  And in the midst of all these thoughts and--so, well in the midst of it here comes Jack Kent Cooke, the owner of the Washington Redskins, and he introduces me to this dream he has of building this stadium in Prince George's County [Maryland] and he's been rejected around the region as, you know, by other jurisdictions to be home for the Redskins.  And course, Cooke in his way, is an eighty-something year old billionaire, is telling me what I'm gonna do.  And of course, in the most polite terms that I can muster I'm saying, "Well now, Mr. Cooke, it's not gonna go like that.  I'm not gonna give you tens of millions of dollars, you know, to house your stadium.  I'd love to have it; frankly, I think it belongs in [Washington] D.C. but if you insist on putting it in Prince George's County, I'll cooperate in reasonable ways."  Well, what's reasonable to him was, "You put up eighty million and I'll put up eighty million, state put up eighty million."  Can't do that.  Maybe you didn't read the newspaper, we're broke.  And our governor [Parris N. Glendening], who's one of the parties concerning whom you say eighty million will be pledged, will pay it all.  "Oh, he'd never do that, that's impolitic."  I said well, "I know him in ways you don't, he'll do it."  "No, it'd be impolitic, you've gotta do it."  "Well, Mr. Cooke, I don't wanna be rude, but lemme tell you where I am on this thing.  It's a three-way-deal, you know, me and you can get together and we can, I'll use a polite word, maneuver the state into being responsible for these expenses for your stadium, or the two governments can get together and maneuver you around, pay all the expenses of the stadium."  Course I left out the third and obvious option which was the two of them could get together (laughter) and twist me around, and try to build the stadium and, which is of course the option they selected. Gonna teach the new young boy, black executive that you don't negotiate with a man like me.  So, once again my experience, you know, was very beneficial and to make a long story short we wound up paying exactly zero Prince George's County tax dollars into that stadium.  We've got the stadium, it is the number one--the franchise, the Redskins are the number one most profitable team in football, notwithstanding the things that we got, and the things we didn't pay for, and we got sports management scholarships outta the Redskins, and we got a world-class pre-Olympic center [Prince George's County Sports and Learning Complex, Landover, Maryland] in a black community in Prince George's County that no one ever thought we could.  And we got seats in the stadium for Prince George's County residents who were thirty years out on the waiting list and we got improvements in that community which at the time I took office, people said was going downhill and down the tubes.  And we've got ascended communities and a new shopping center and just fantastic achievements that nobody envisioned.  Now they were all the spoils of war and Cooke and I fought like a couple of pit bulls to get there, but we got there.  And it's been very good, unprecedented, in fact, for this community and I'm very proud of those kinds of things and the fortitude, the courage, the experience, the professional preparation to go in the room with a guy like Cooke to come out alive, in figurative terms, and to win and count the spoils of the war.  And so we were able to do that on behalf of this community to add luster to this dream we had of representing well, you know, this first that I represented as a black administration in this changed community and we did that.  And I'm very proud of it.  Poor Mr. Cooke, I loved him, now he was a character, he was hard to handle, he'd say incredible things, we fought like dogs.  There were moments where the deal was quite literally hanging in the balance and sometimes just over little things like his mouth.  You know, eighty-something year old billionaires are accustomed to doing what they want, saying what they want, treating you as they want.  And I, of course, was unaccustomed to any of that, and to the extent it happened to me before--life there had to be, you know, there had to be fights about that sort of thing, so there were plenty of times that thing wasn't working out but he--I, am appreciative of that opportunity.  He never understood that I knew that if I could make a good deal out of this with him across the table that I essentially would have instant credibility to do the rest of my job.  And if he rolled me that I'd be doomed.

Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your relationship with your predecessor who then went on to become governor of the State of Maryland, Parris [N.] Glendening.  Some have said that if the relationship was better perhaps Prince George's County [Maryland] would have benefited a little bit more from allocations from the state and that kind of thing, what--how do you respond to that.
Speaker 2: I think a lot of naive and fretful people, a lotta chumps, sorta had that outlook.  Politics is, is a game of leverage, and as Frederick Douglass and many others have observed for centuries, power can seize nothing without a demand, and you can be the nicest, fastest in the field and still don't get nothing, you know, in the end.  And in the case of Parris in particular, I had a unique perspective, I'd known him the whole time he's been a politician in Prince George's County, he sat beside the woman [Deborah Marshall] who was then my girlfriend back in the '70s [1970s] on the county council, I knew Parris from many different perspectives and vantage points and I observed the obvious which most people didn't in their emotional sycophancy instead of taking care of our business, they lining up in lines just because the line existed as opposed to because that's where you go pick up things politically.  One of the things I observed, that, you know, Glendening served two years on the county--two terms rather, eight years on the county council, twelve years as the county executive and in his twelve years as county executive in this exploding jurisdiction that's become Prince George's County under the umbrella of a twenty-plus year old school desegregation case the man built two new schools.
Speaker 1: Compared to neighboring Montgomery County [Maryland] which I think at the time they  (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh my God, twenty something--
Speaker 1: --built like almost--
Speaker 2: --or something--
Speaker 1: --right, right--
Speaker 2: --some outrageous number.
Speaker 1: More than--yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so you know, it's--we weren't being rewarded or accorded or regarded in the way that we should have for what we were putting into the hopper politically.  And I knew that, and I also knew, beneficially again, I didn't owe him anything.  He wasn't one of the two people that endorsed me--two incumbents that endorsed me before I won.  So the real question was, whether or not it was prudent to "aggravate," irritate or anger the county executive.  That's what the others were reacting to and the media was reacting to, of course, they were doing it in the context of two important suppositions that they were wrong about.  One was, that I couldn't count, that I didn't really know I had a deficit because the governor was saying, "I left him with fifty million in cash."  And I'm running around saying, "The man not only didn't leave fifty million in cash, the hole is 140."  Bad supposition that we were in a different financial position.  Two was that I wouldn't fight, an atrocious mistake (laughter) because you're the incumbent Democratic governor.  But that doesn't mean I'm going take your whipping.  I don't operate that way, and so I wasn't intimidated by the necessity to go get these schools.  This community could not have thrived and survived without building schools, and without getting out of that bussing case which had become a laughable fiction of a vehicle for equal opportunity, 'cause nobody built the schools.  And, I didn't expect that the governor wouldn't be upset with me if I demanded the schools.  And quite the contrary, when people would come to me and say, "Well, man the governor's mad at you."  I'd say, "Well of course the governor's angry with me, I am demanding that the governor give us the wherewithal to build our schools, now let me recite his record for you, let's don't talk about the parties and the chicken wings, let's talk about what we could've had that we don't.  So you think suddenly while I'm dramatically changing the game and exposing these financial inadequacies that he's gonna be happy?  Of course he's gonna be upset."  And he was, and they were scared that he'd retaliate against them.
Story_ID: 237674
Speaker 1: But there were times when you and Governor [Parris N.] Glendening had very public disagreements--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Or at least they appeared that way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh no, they were very public disagreements.
Speaker 1: --in the media, do you ever wish that perhaps they wouldn't have been so public?
Speaker 2: No.  Once I had discovered what he had done it was essential that they be publicized, because our responsibility as elected officials is to represent others and not ourselves.  And to the extent that his service represented one kinda picture while he was telling folks it represented another, I had to speak.  And I had to speak in order to fix it.  If I had encouraged or allowed an impression that was different from the truth I would never have been able to fix it, 'cause people would say to you, "Well why should we do this, make this difficult decision if everything's hunky dory?"  So you have to tell 'em, it's not hunky dory, but he said, well, he lied and I'm telling you the truth, as difficult as that is for you to hear, in the cacophony of career elected politicians telling you I'm wrong, or I'm lying or I'm stupid or incapable, I'm telling you the truth.  I've done it an entire career, I've hit the beach first through all of these changes and you just got scammed, now, the question then becomes how do we get out of this mess we're in, and that takes vision and courage and fortitude.  Now, I didn't prefer to be regarded as a chump, a punk or a coward.  Not the kind of imagery you want to wear into this kinda locker room and so--and nor can you win with that attitude in a contact sport, which is what politics amounts to.  So, I took my chances on telling the truth, as unpopular and difficult as incredible as it was, that the governor who had served five terms here as counselor and executive, and the brand new inexperienced green callow [HistoryMaker] Wayne [Curry] with his provocative style big mouth and history, which one are you gonna believe?  Well in the end, guess what, they chose not to believe me; they thought I was mistaken about where we were financially, so they had the state audit my very first budget.  And on a budget of over $1.3 billion, the state auditors of the legislative services branch came within three hundred thousand dollars of every presumption I had set forth.  The combination of that and our success with the [Washington] Redskins stadium [Jack Kent Cooke Stadium; FedExField, Landover, Maryland] gave me instant credibility in many quarters which I would not have had.  And it emboldened me to do what I knew was right even when it was impolitic.  Furthermore, recognizing that because I won they were gonna me and get even with me, and because I had what they regarded to be a big mouth and because I wasn't scratching when I didn't itch, laughing when nothing was funny and doing what they told me to do taking orders, for all of these reasons, you know, I was gonna have to pay a price.  I elected to take the punch.  I even promoted a pro-tax referendum in--midterm of my first term.  Which is what they had desired because they knew that the public wasn't in favor of paying taxes, "Wayne," and people would ask me while I was out promoting this change in our tax ceiling, "Wayne, are you--you wasn't--through all that talk are you telling me you expect me to vote to increase my taxes?"  And I'd say, "Yep."  "And you're a proponent of that? "Yep," and of course, it didn't work.  People didn't vote (laughter) to pay more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: We're talking about the TRIM [Tax Reform Initiative by Marylanders] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) TRIM--
Speaker 1: --legislation?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They didn't vote to raise their taxes but here an incredible thing happened, a very valuable thing.  To all of the career politicians who were scared to death to do the things I was suggesting we do to save ourselves because it would anger someone else, when I had to support a pro-tax referendum and my public popularity changed by one half of one percent, after I did so, it obliterated this idea they had that the tax limiter was the third rail of local politics, and that the other guys were always right, that the white man's ice water's colder.  Obliterated those things because I was popular before I promoted it and I was popular after I promoted it, change was one half of one percent.  And so when I'd later go promote initiatives, they couldn't come to me with all that cowardly, you know, anxiety about doing something unprec--"Ah, we don't do it like that, we never done it before."  I know that, that's why we gonna do it, 'cause it's never been done before.  And we changed the housing policy, and we stood firm on the Redskins deal and we built a major Olympic center [Prince George's County Sports and Learning Complex, Landover, Maryland] as a result of a neighborhood of people who said it was tubing and we bought the biggest commercial deal in the history of the state to the shores of the Potomac [River] at the foot of the [Woodrow] Wilson Bridge.  And we changed our image and we fought for new housing, as a consequence of which we now have the hottest housing market in the history of this place with McMansions owned by black people going up everywhere.  When I changed those policies people--career politicians ran like roaches in a spotlight.  Saying, "Wayne, are you crazy?"  Builders came to me and said, "We're leaving."  In the words of my grandfather, "Don't let the door hit you, don't let the screen door hit you."  Now, the same guys, you know, who scolded me, we'll say politely, and said, "We're leaving," are dying to get in.  You have to believe in yourself and you have to have courage to make a difference.  And it does take some experience, and some dedication to the subject matter.
Story_ID: 237675
Speaker 1: You served for two terms--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and as a result of term limits in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --the county [Prince George's County, Maryland] were not--
Speaker 2: --Couldn't, couldn't run any more.
Speaker 1: --able to run again--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --if the term limit legislation wasn't in place do you think you would have run again?
Speaker 2: I don't know and it's a hard, hard thing to answer being in those kinds of executive jobs as mayor or county executive takes a tremendous toll on you in lots of different and unanticipated ways and particularly me, you know, I started late with a family, I've got kids, you know who are being forged, you know, through the period that I'm a public figure and taking the pro and the con, the good and the bad of that, you know, in terms of public reaction to them, there's a certain exhausting aspect of it too intellectually and physically that you go through when you're it every day and there's a line of people, you know, outside your day waiting to pound you, one way or the other.  So I really don't know what I would have done.  I would disfavor term limits though for reasons that are personal, 'cause I never was a career politician, so my first sentiments about those kind of things don't concern or impact on me personally.  What concerns me the most about term limits was that it's a guarantee that every election and certainly every two, Prince George's County [Maryland] will be fielding a franchise club.  The other jurisdictions who have not limited themselves that way will have experienced players around the board politically.  And since the politics of this is competitive, with some of the richest most powerful jurisdictions in America, in Montgomery [County, Maryland] in Fairfax [County, Virginia] in Howard [County, Maryland] in Loudoun [County, Virginia] in Prince William [County, Virginia] in Fauquier [County, Virginia], you can't sit around scratching your head with a new franchise expansion club every election, 'cause your guys get eaten alive.  And what we have done guarantees that minimally every two elections we will enter a cycle with a franchise expansion club.  We're always gonna be the new kids, this is a competitive business, it's a contact sport, it's not charity.  You gotta field people who can go represent you in aggressive terms and term limits hurt us and we don't have the luxury of being what they call on the basketball court a self-check, nobody even has to check you 'cause you can't make a layup.  We don't have to devote defensive effort on you, you can't score if I leave you alone.
Speaker 1: Any other political aspirations to maybe run for a national office?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Or state office?
Speaker 2: I've been, been fortunate to--I've enjoyed a job that gives you the epitome of personal satisfaction, close enough to people and power to actually get things done and eminent enough to satisfy your political ego and let me make a difference at home and that's been great.  There--I watch--I love politics, I've done it for a while.  I didn't expect to be an elected official when I began working in politics and elections.  I have been--so I don't know, it--couple of good jobs left to pursue, maybe governor, maybe U.S. senator, but right now, as I say fondly, I'm working on restoration projects, "Say what?"  Restoration projects, such as my personal checkbook (laughter).
Speaker 1: There--the rumor mill has (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --been running rampant that there's a possibility you may be changing parties that you may be switching over to the Republican Party, is there any truth to that?
Speaker 2: Well, one never knows what the future holds, I will say this, Republican Party luminaries have gone through great efforts to lure me to the Republican Party, and I've never been disadvantaged yet by a Republican, I mean, it's too bad we're on tape, I'd say it the way I say it when I'm talking.  Everybody who ever laid a glove on me has been a Democrat and the people to whom I've devoted my political life and effort for more than thirty years have been Democrats and so there's no secret that the Republicans would love to have a high profile convert, so to speak and I appreciate them and am flattered by their interest, whether I could do it I don't know.  I don't buy all the partisan dogma that is recited at black folks about why they have to be Democrats and I certainly don't understand how the metrics of our partisanship's supposed to be good for us when somebody can get 98 percent of your vote by giving you exactly nothing but pabulum and rhetorical porridge, compared to what they give others for fractional loyalty at that level, it's very hard to see how you're supposed to leverage when you have nothing to leverage against.  Where, if black folks were in both parties, everybody'd have to offer you something to get you.  When you're free, when you're free in politics, you're not valued, and I don't mean free like liberated, we want to be liberated, but we don't wanna be free, not in politics.
Story_ID: 237676
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'll tell you in the words that I used when interviewed one time on a TV show, at the height of an impasse with Jack Kent Cooke on the stadium [Jack Kent Cooke Stadium; FedExField, Landover, Maryland] deal, and I had dug in my heels against the pressure of the governor [Parris N. Glendening] and the president of the [Maryland] Senate [Thomas V. Mike Miller, Jr.] and the speaker [Casper R. Taylor, Jr.] of the [Maryland] House [of Delegates] and the entire cadre of elected politicians all of whom were saying, "[HistoryMaker] Wayne [Curry], you're gonna blow this deal."  And I prayed and thought about it and said, "I'm the only one at this table who's ever made a deal, I was a commercial transactions lawyer and I gotta believe in myself," and I went on television and a guy looked at me and he said, "Mr. Curry, don't you fear that you'll be remembered as the guy who blew this deal?"  And I said, "No, I think I'll be remembered as the guy who stood up."
Story_ID: 237677
Speaker 1: What do you think your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: Don't know that (laughter), don't know, I really don't know that.  One--of one thing I'm certain, there can never be another first African American county executive so that one's clear.  I'm it whether people like it or not and it's been an incredible culmination of thirty years of devoted, lonely and courageous effort in a place [Prince George's County, Maryland] that was at one time a redneck county that's now this cosmopolitan icon in the world, that'll be one.  But I always said it made more sense--I mean it was more satisfying to me to make sense than to make history, so when I think about it privately, where I left this community, inheriting a huge deficit and left it with a huge surplus, left it with a one of a kind pre-Olympic center [Prince George's County Sports and Learning Complex, Landover, Maryland] and the Washington Redskins, left it with the biggest and best deals commercially in the history of the state, left it with a desegregation case that was over and a new school--unprecedented school program, that's what I want to be remembered for.

Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-four [1994].
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Pardon me.  That's a picture of my dad and some of his [U.S.] Army buddies, gosh, it would have been late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s] I bet you.
Speaker 1: Which one is your dad?
Speaker 2: My dad's the leftmost, standing.
Speaker 1: Right here?
Speaker 2: No, the other way.
Speaker 1: Right here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's my dad, "The Bull."
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's me, at my old alma mater which was at the time, Western Maryland College, now McDaniel College [Westminster, Maryland], looks like it would have been about 1997 or 1998 holding my daughter Taylor and palming the head of my son Julian [Curry] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: That's me and Julian at the hospital with Taylor when she was born and so what year would that have been?  She's eight now.
Speaker 1: Ninety-three [1993]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was '93 [1993].  Looks like I'm gonna find out exactly when it was momentarily, no, '91 [1991], '93 [1993], might have been '95 [1995] 'cause, no it must have been '95 [1995].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Ninety-six [1996], okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: The siblings, my brothers and my sister, gosh I'm thinking '96 [1996], '97 [1997] maybe.  I don't know, maybe before, well, maybe that range.
Speaker 1: And could you tell us everyone's name right to left?
Speaker 2: From my left, the big bald headed guy's my brother Daryl, behind him is me, beside me is my brother Leslie [Curry], beside him in the white and gray sweater is my brother Kevin [Curry] and seated is my sister Denice, D-E-N-I-C-E.

Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Next.
Speaker 2: That's my mother Juliette [Harris Curry], our favorite dog Duke and my brother Daryl, circa 1953, maybe '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: Whoa, hang on a second.  Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: That is my Grandfather Elzy Curry [ph.] standing at the sink whose shoulder you can see (laughter), my grandmother, Louise [ph.], who my brother Daryl is kissing in the middle of the picture.  My little brother Leslie in front of him and the fellow holding the gun to the right is me.
Speaker 1: About what year?
Speaker 2: Oh my gracious, what do I look like, four years old there, three or four, '54 [1954], or '55 [1955]?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: The first woman from the right is my mother at a college chapter meeting of the local NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] which would probably make it '49 [1949], I guess, something like that 1949 maybe (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, great yeah.
Speaker 2: --or '50 [1950].
Speaker 1: That one says 1950 on it.
Speaker 2: That makes it easier (laughter).
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Except I can't see, that's my grandfather Elzy to the right, my mother in the middle and my father in the robe and mortar board in 1950.
Speaker 1: And could you tell us your mother and father's names again.
Speaker 2: Father's name is Eugene G. Curry and my mother's Juliette H. Curry.
Speaker 1: Next.  That's you.
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter) once again a forehead only a mother could love (laughter).  Looks like maybe 1951 or '52 [1952].  Wayne.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's my mother, me, and my brother Daryl, I'm in the front and it's probably 1951 or '52 [1952].

Speaker 1: That's a picture of my father, Eugene, my mother Juliette at Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] in 19 what--'49 [1949] did it say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Forty-nine [1949].
Speaker 1: --yeah, that's big man on campus there, big football player and all that.
Speaker 2: Now, the one thing is that we only have one like really current picture of you and I want--
Speaker 1: Any time you're ready.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me at a speech in probably 19, oh '96 [1996] or '97 [1997} I would bet.
Speaker 1: Okay, great, okay.
Speaker 2: Great-great-grandmother, fondly known as Big Mamma.
Speaker 1: Do you have an idea of when it was taken?
Speaker 2: Oh my gosh, no.
Speaker 1: What would be your best guess?
Speaker 2: Sometime in the 1800s.
