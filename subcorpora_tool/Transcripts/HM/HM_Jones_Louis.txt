Speaker 1: Now, we wanna explore your, your family background. Can you give us your mother's full name?
Speaker 2: Alberta Jones.
Speaker 1: And when was she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually it was Alberta Moore [Alberta Moore Jones].
Speaker 1: Okay. And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Huntsville, Alabama.
Speaker 1: And do you know the year she was born?
Speaker 2: It's about 1924.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her background and her--that part of your family?
Speaker 2: Well she was born to a, a large family and her parents were sharecroppers and she pretty much worked the farm with my grandfather and grandmother and her ten siblings.
Speaker 1: Do you recall the names of her siblings?
Speaker 2: Well there's James Edward [James Moore (ph.)], there was Sylvester [Sylvester Moore], Earline [Earline Moore], Mattie [Mattie Moore], Odessa [Odessa Moore], Ravinia [sic. Rovina Moore McCalley], Elise [Elise Moore Birdwell (ph.)], Louise [Louise Moore], and I, I think I got them all, yeah I think I got them all. She, she had eight sisters. May--I might be missing one.
Speaker 1: Okay. How would you describe your mother's personality?
Speaker 2: Well my mother was a very, very spiritual, very religious woman. She was very calm and extremely hard working, and very, very family oriented. And she had a great sense of humor.
Speaker 1: Did she tell you stories about her upbringing and what things were around when she was growing up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah she did, she did. She, she even talked about some of her aunts who were in their hundred or in their ninetieth year and were just out of or used to be slaves. And she talked about my grandfather's experiences and behavior prior to him--I guess--and this I guess came from word of mouth, before he married my grandmother, and then when he came back from World War I [WWI], they used to call it shell shocked then but she told me stories about his delayed str- stress syndrome needs. And the two sons would have to take him out at night so he could fire the shotgun or the .22 [.22 caliber rifle] out the back door once in a while and then he was okay. But he had to get up and shoot maybe a couple of times a month. And she used to talk about that. And she'd talk about the whole thing, about the cotton and the, the ability to try to keep from being cheated when they, they did the whole sharecropping financial routine. And she talked about the extended family and who, who cooked well and that sort of thing. We had aunts who always competed in terms of who was the best cook. And the preachers and the teachers usually came to my grandparents' home to, to eat and spend the night because they got the best food and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Do you rec- what the--grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: Grandparents were Ruby [Ruby Moore] and Sylvester Moore [Sylvester Moore].
Story_ID: 619535
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your father, his name and where he was from?
Speaker 2: Father is Arthur Jones. And again he was born in Huntsville, Alabama. And he used to say that you have to be very careful not to marry a cousin if you lived in Madison County. And if you wanted to be certain you weren't marrying a distant le- relative, you, you might wanna go outside of Madison County, Alabama (laughter). And so I have a number of double first cousins because cousins and brothers married into the same group of sisters. You know, my father and some of his first cousins and some of his brothers married my mother's [Alberta Moore Jones] and, and her sisters. He, he grew up, you know, in the, in the same area and his family they were farmers and his father [James Jones] was more of a--sort of a craftsman. He, he did brick laying. He built sheds for people and he dug wells, and he, he rebuilt fireplaces where some people would build a fireplace and it wouldn't draft properly, smoke come back in the house and they'd call him and he'd correct it. And then they find--he--they'd find out about him and they'd have him build their fireplace in the first place. And my father, he came to Chicago [Illinois] when I was about four. And typical thing, the father came ahead of the family, find work, work for several months, live with relatives and then sent for my mother and I.
Speaker 1: So he's really a kind of a skilled craftsman?
Speaker 2: Well he, he was--he came along when you did--they did some of everything, you know. They, they did farming, they went out and helped people build their houses because his father was, was, was pretty skilled at a number of things and spent most of his time doing the brick laying, building of the fireplaces and the chimneys, and digging wells. And in fact, that's how his father met his early death, it, it was a well digging accident. And in the meantime, the rest of his family pretty much farmed, you know, they all had their own--they, they, they picked the cotton for the sharecropper situation. And then they raised their own food, their own--they had their own cows for milk, they had their own hogs and they did all that whole routine. They grew their own vegetables and they all lived in a rural, rural settings until, you know, some of them started to migrate north.
Speaker 1: Did they own their own land?
Speaker 2: They owned their own land. My father had a very big beef about that that he always talked about because there was somewhere in the neighborhood of eighty acres in Madison County and around Huntsville that's now rather nice subdivisions that was actually owned by, by his father, some of his extended family. We visited that area and there were, there was land--Huntsville, as you well know, has a NASA facility [Marshall Space Flight Center], several colleges and it was a--part of the military industrial complex. A lot of people would, would say, "Well, what are you doing for a living now?" And he would say, "I'm working on the arsenal." And it was the Redstone Arsenal [Madison County, Alabama] which, which, which made munitions for the [U.S.] Army. And at one point they actually built a ballistic missile there, the Redstone missile or something like that. So a lot of people got skilled because they, they worked on different military facilities when they were constructed. They laid brick and stuff. My father actually laid brick there. And then they--when it was done they were laid off. But in that process, the U.S. government actually, almost by some form of eminent domain took people's land to create this military reservation. And the white people got something for their land, the black people got nothing. And there were people who actually forged deeds and did things. There was some man, a white man named Spragin [ph.] that they always talk about who kind of gipped people out of their, their land and was in cahoots with the banks and everything and recreated the deeds, and then got something from the government for the land, the other people got nothing. And my father actually visited this area that's not too far from the church where a lot of my relatives are buried in the backyard. Pine, Pine Grove church in Madison County, Alabama [Pine Grove Missionary Baptist Church, Harvest, Alabama]. And so that land is gone because of that.
Story_ID: 619536
Speaker 1: And did your father [Arthur Jones] have any siblings?
Speaker 2: My father had--he's the last, he's eighty- he'll be eighty-five in a few weeks. And he had two sisters, Aunt Mary [Mary Jones], Aunt Jimmie [ph.], and a brother, Uncle Johnny [Johnny Jones]; brother, Uncle James; brother, Uncle Tommy [Tommy Jones]; and let's see a sister, Ophelia [Ophelia Jones Sibley], and they're all gone. I really loved my Uncle James, he was the oldest and he came, he migrated to Michigan before anyone else did. He was very good at car repairs. And in the '50s [1950s] they had this thing called the fender skirt, which covered up the back of the car. Well, he was the guy that they came from five or six different states, white and black, came to him to make their fender skirts. And he would go to all of the car dealers and get all the free brochures. And I would--when we visited him I would go to his garage where he had all the sheet metal working stuff and all the sheet metal, and he had this wall and this table where he actually drew the fender skirt designs on the pictures of the cars. And he had all these little patterns and he created a way you could clip these with some kind of special metal bars that he, he created, to the car. And I'd be there when these guys would come from Ohio to Michigan, they want--they wanted James Jones' fender skirts for their Packard or for their Mercury. And he'd stand there and he's--he was one of the biggest guys in the family, he was like 275 [pounds], 6'2". He said, "Well, it's gonna take me about three, four weeks to make them skirts, 'cause, you know, there's a lot of people in line ahead of you." He knew he was gonna make them in a few days and he'd tell them to come back. They'd put a deposit and he made money like that. He had a store, which was like one of these little, you know, corner grocery store type things, but it was right, it's part of his house. And it was a joy for me, 'cause when we visited I got the run to the store, I could eat ice cream bars, drink chocolate pop and that sort of thing, and goof around in his shop as long as I didn't hurt myself. And my father loved to take me there because he was like an example, you know, in the family because he was one of the few people--on--only person in the North that had his own business. But all those brothers and sisters are--they're all passed away now.
Story_ID: 619537
Speaker 1: What do you know about your grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: On the father's side, Mary Elisa Jones [Mary Burwell Jones], she--I think she had tuberculosis or something. She passed away when she was probably about, I'd say around fifty something, fifty, sixty. And of course James [James Jones] was forty-five or fifty, my father's father, when a bucket hit him from, and he was in the well, in the head. He lived for a couple days and, and he didn't survive the accident. But they, they were pretty entrepreneurial. They, they, they made things and sold them. They made--they canned food, they sold them. They, they did all kinds of things outside of just sharecropping. And because of his, his craftsmanship ability, he even figured out how to--they used to do the wells when you go way back in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], the wells always had a built up wooden deck on them. He figured out how to pour a reinforced concrete deck on the well, and, and there was actually--my father [Arthur Jones] said there was actually an article in the paper about it, because that was the first time anybody figured out how to do that and get that kind of stability and that sort of thing. But he and his children, my father and his brothers, they all had their own cars. The girls were crazy about them because they had money. They, they, they just worked and they did all of these other things and they were able to, to have two, three cars in their family when it was almost unheard of in, in the South at that time. So my father was very proud--very proud of him and that whole family situation.
Speaker 1: Do you know how your grandfather learned brick laying?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I would imagine it was just something that he figured out by observation and getting involved and doing it among the black people and then it expanded. Because my father used to joke and say that there was some white boys in the county [Madison County, Alabama] that would do a fireplace and then somebody would start using it and smoke come back in the house, and they'd call Jim to fix it. Then they found out, "Okay, well let's have Jim build the next one in the first place," you know. So, so he had a really good reputation for doing that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Did your grandfather ever tell you stories about his parents, your great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: I never, I never had the pleasure of meeting my grandfather because of that accident. He was gone probably sometime before I was born.
Speaker 1: Do you know what kind of work your grandmother did?
Speaker 2: Well she was, she was at the home, you know. Pretty much the farmer's wife kind of thing, you know. That was the case with both, both grand- grandmothers.
Story_ID: 619538
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned, when I was asking about your mother [Alberta Moore Jones], that she had some memory of slavery or was told some stories about slavery from her mother [Ruby Moore] or grandmother?
Speaker 2: There was an aunt that they said was a former slave and I used to hear her--you know, just--and I never got anything definitive or clear on that. But they just said there was an aunt who was a former slave that talked about working in the house and talked about some incidents with the white people and their pets and talking parrots and that sort of thing. But, you know, it was nothing--I never got anything really definitive, you know, about that.
Speaker 1: Was this still in Alabama?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Was this still in Alabama?
Speaker 2: This was still in Alabama, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 619539
Speaker 1: How would you describe your father's personality?
Speaker 2: Again, he was and still is a, a relatively calm man. Some people would say he is stoic, but I, I, I know that he has some deep, deep emotions because of, you know, the things that he said. He had these goals that were pretty much related to what he could do as a black man at the time. He told his parents [Mary Burwell Jones and James Jones] that when he migrated to the North that he was going to, you know, raise a family, work hard for fifty years and, and, and never have it said that he was late or that he, he was absent from, from work. And he, he, he did it for forty-five years, and, and then something happened and he was late. And so he always had a reputation for being extremely hardworking but, you know, he, he just got through eighth grade so he--his jobs were mainly labor jobs, union labor jobs. He worked--after he came from the South he took the factory jobs with the A and P [The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company], where they had these huge manufacturing bakeries and ultimately he was in the ABC union, the American Bakers and Confectionary Workers Union [sic. American Bakery and Confectionery Workers' International Union; Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union]. And so he worked in these plants where the oven was a block long. And you know, you, you made the dough and you put it in the oven and it went, you know, went slowly through and when it came out the other end it was a loaf of bread. And he got me jobs there in the summer. And you know, they, they walk up to me and say, "Okay, this here is Art Jones' [Arthur Jones] son, and you know Art Jones is the hardest working guy in this place. Now Louis [HistoryMaker Louis Jones], all you got to do is F up" (laughter). And then they just turn me loose, you know. So I had, I had his rep [reputation] to live up to, and so I had to be there on time and do whatever they told me. And you know, I worked in--and I did everything there, summer--it was summers. And you know, you come in at two o'clock in the morning and you work for eight hours and then they call you and say, "Okay, now do you wanna go over here and help this guy make cookies?" Now I've been peeling potatoes all night through this machine and smelling that horrible smell from rotten potato peels that you put in the drums when they're all done and it's like a gas. And they come back there and they pull me out and they have me help, help the guy make icing for the sandwich cookies. And so I get a couple hours overtime. By the time I get home I'm exhausted. So I go to sleep, I wake up, go back to work. So I made $1,500 in the summer and the only money that came out of it was bus fare, you know, 'cause I took a bag for lunch so I saved all that money. So that's how I worked my way through college is--the first three, four years is I worked there summers and relieving everybody who had a vacation or, or what have you. And my father spent that time there and he used to sit and tell me, he says, "I don't want you to, you know, have to live like this. I don't want you to grow up like that, I want you to get an education." You know that was the mantra back then. "I want you to get your education. I want you to be able to do better than I--then I'm doing. I want you to, you know, not have to, you know, break your back for a living and that sort of thing." Then he'd wake me up at four o'clock in the morning to go fishing (laughter). So you know, I have fishing fever and you know, it go--it comes and goes, you know. And when, you know, and it gets to a point where my buddies and I used to carry our fishing rods in the back of our car. Fish in the morning before we went to work.
Story_ID: 619540
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned that your, your father [Arthur Jones] did a lot with your grandfather [James Jones]. Did he tell you stories about his growing up, what the neighborhood was like and where he grew up?
Speaker 2: Yeah 'cause they were, you know, pretty much Madison County [Alabama]. They, they did the whole thing with the, the cotton and that sort of thing, and they had to be careful because of the Jim Crow laws. But within Madison County, everybody knew everybody, white and black. So there wasn't--there was not--the only time there was some tension was because of--for example, he used to say that--his father said--I, I wish I could remember this quote, but it was something like I can, you know, basically, "I can add and I can subtract and I have my ruler and my level and they don't lie." And so nobody could trick him out of his money. Nobody could tell him that something was, was, was crooked and he knew it was straight because he knew how to use all the tools of, of the crafts. So everybody in the county sort of knew him and respected him. And so my father didn't have any, you know, any problems with the, you know, the so called Jim Crow race type thing as long as they didn't violate those lines. And so they had friends that they played with that were black and white and that sort of thing. So the environment, although it was certainly typical of the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s], was not necessarily, you know, you know, as oppressive as you might think because they, they pretty much stayed within their, their area and they spent a lot of their time among the extended families of black people.
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned your mother [Alberta Moore Jones] kind of stayed at home--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and kind of raised the children. Do you know how much education she had?
Speaker 2: I don't think my mother finished eighth grade. I think my father did. And if, if my mother did I, I don't remember them saying that she, she got past six.
Story_ID: 619541
Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory is the smoking and the steam and noise of getting off the train and my father [Arthur Jones] meeting us at the station--the train station in Roosevelt [Road], the Polk Street Station [Dearborn Station, Chicago, Illinois]. There's--whatever station that is where people came into the city.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Let's see I was four, it's probably 1950.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what--where did you live when you first came to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: We lived with cousins somewhere in the vicinity of 47th [Street] and Cottage Grove [Avenue], and I don't remember the street. And then we got a room at 47th and Champlain [Avenue], and it's one of these rooming houses where, you know, there's stores and things on the ground floor and then there's two, three stories of apartments and you walk up. And it's actually an apartment where there's a living room, two bedrooms, a dining room and a kitchen and one bathroom. But they rented out, so our room, our place of residence was the living room. So our bed and all our furniture was in there. And there was a single man in the, the other bedroom over here and at one point, my first cousin and her family were, were in the other bedroom, and we all shared the same kitchen and dining room. So that was right off 47th and St. Lawrence [Avenue] or Champlain, St. Lawrence I think, 47th and St. Lawrence.
Speaker 1: Do you have any memories of Huntsville [Alabama], as, as you were a child?
Speaker 2: No. No, we, we went back every five years or better and spent a week or two, and that was, that was about it. I didn't have any, any memory of childhood memories, just stories, you know, almost getting stepped on by the mules, you know, crawling around in the yard as a baby and somebody running and getting me before the mule stepped on me. I have a scar in my--I think it's right eye, when, when I'm examined they find it. And I was sitting on my mother's [Alberta Moore Jones] lap in the South and the children were playing and they were throwing these twigs and one of them just stuck in my eye like an arrow, and they said the blood was like, you know, just had everybody crazy. But it was just, you know, a bunch of blood vessels busted. And so I get those stories and I get stories of--I used to have this nickname, Slick, which sounds like a negative, and it was just that my Uncle Tommy [Jones' paternal uncle, Tommy Jones] when I was a baby came along and smoothed the hair down on my head on my mother's lap and said, "Oh that's--he's slick." And the next thing you know all my cousins and first cousins and everybody that played around at the time called me Slick. And when I was five, ten, you know, we go back every five, ten years, they'd say, "Okay where is Slick?" You know, when I show up. And then by the time I was about fifteen it wore off, and they started calling me Louis [HistoryMaker Louis Jones].
Speaker 1: Now when you got your eye hurt, do you remember whether or not you were able to go to a hospital or was it some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Some kind of midwife thing. You know, I was delivered by a midwife and you know, they call that person.
Story_ID: 619542
Speaker 1: Now, you're in Chicago [Illinois] now and you're living on 47th [Street] near Champlain [Avenue], how many people were living in this apartment at this time?
Speaker 2: Well my, my father [Arthur Jones] and my mother [Alberta Moore Jones] and I were in the living room. And Obie [ph.], the gentleman who was next door, and then my first cousin Ella May [ph.] and my Uncle Bubba, John Birdwell [ph.], and my Aunt Ella, Elise Birdwell [Elise Moore Birdwell (ph.)], they lived in the other room. And so there was like, you know, seven people in this apartment.
Speaker 1: And where was your father working at this time, he was still at the bakery?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, he worked at the A and P bakery [The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company] for about twenty-six years.
Speaker 1: Do you remember an- any like holidays or special events as you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well I loved Christmas of course, you know, that was about the only time I got a present. You know, any, any other time like a birthday or something then my mother would bake a cake. But holidays I'd try to sneak around and try to find the present they were gonna give me for Christmas and play with it ahead of time. And once in a while when finally my, my cousin, Ella May, and her family the Birdwells had their own apartment we would go to their house for Christmas. And we'd actually be in a full blown apartment for Christmas.
Speaker 1: How long did you live at--in that apartment?
Speaker 2: Let's see, it wasn't that long. It was, let's see, I was in kindergarten, first grade, second grade. Yeah I think just prior to that we were at 51st and State [Street], and then we were there, so we were there maybe two and a half, three years and then we moved to an apartment in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Do you remember what street that was on?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Do you remember what street that was on?
Speaker 2: 5339 Woodlawn [Avenue], well no, no that--that was later. We moved, let's see 5401 South Lake Park [Avenue]. In Hyde Park they--before they did this urban renewal, Lake Park actually had houses or apartment buildings, police stations, fire stations right along the IC tracks [Illinois Central Railroad] on the west side of the IC in that--in that area from about 51st Street south to 55th [Street]. And over the years, they, they re- redid the community and they tore down that--all those tenements and moved the street over. But we actually lived in two of those, we lived at 5401, then we moved south to right next door to the fire station, and then after that we moved into Hyde Park at 1514 East 54th Place, and then we moved to 5339 Woodlawn. So we lived in four different locations, all in Hyde Park until I finished high school [Tilden Technical High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]. I think I might've been a freshman in college [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] before we moved again.
Story_ID: 619543
Speaker 1: Now we were talking about places that you lived when your family first moved up here [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Something I wanna go back to, do you have any siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you give us their names in birth order?
Speaker 2: Okay. Denise Joyce White--Jones White [Denise Jones White], she's a younger sister but she's the next oldest from me, she is eight, eight years younger than me. Then there is Grayling Jones, my brother. And then there's Rolanda Jones [Rolanda Jones Golden], that's my youngest sister. And let's see if you subtract, I--I put their ages on the form, I don't remember them, I never remember them, but that's, that's--you know.
Speaker 1: And where do you fall in that?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: You're the oldest, okay. Do you know wh- what are they doing now and where do they live?
Speaker 2: Well Denise lives in Dolton, Illinois and she has been with I, I guess the county and the state for over thirty years. I think she's about to retire. She's an administrator in the public aid offices, you know, where they go--you go for public assistance and that sort of thing. She used to run the office on--down there 22nd Street and then she ran the office out on Stony Island [Avenue], and now she's in an office in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] on 63rd [Street], and I don't think she runs that office, I think she's just one of the senior administrators in there. But it's kind of a different thing. My, my wife [Barbara M. Jones] has a degree in social work and a master's in it, and Denise was looking at what she was doing when she first got out of school and got into it and just never left it. And so that's what--that's what she does, and she has a degree in fine arts from Mundelein [Mundelein College, Chicago, Illinois]. So you go figure (laughter).
Speaker 1: And your other siblings?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Grayling, he went to college for a couple of years, didn't finish. He's a document control clerk. In the industry, in construction, you know when you have the bigger projects, the documentation is horrendous. You know, the plans, all the specifications and all of the changes and all of the financial data, and so there's a number of people on these projects that do that, so he did it for me [at Louis Jones Enterprises, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], he worked for me for about eight years. And I had him here when we were on the McCormick Place South project [McCormick Place South Building, Chicago, Illinois], so he worked there for five years. And then he moved to Midway [Chicago Midway International Airport, Chicago, Illinois] where we were part of the team that did Midway and he was the document control guy there. And now he's with another firm and he's one of two, three document control people for the whole O'Hare modernization plan [O'Hare Modernization Program]. So I figure maybe he'll retire doing that. And Rolanda is a senior paralegal with Attorney Registration [Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission] which is the regulatory group for attorneys in the state.
Story_ID: 619544
Speaker 1: The neighborhoods that you lived in, can you give us some like the sights and sounds and kind of smells that you remember growing up?
Speaker 2: Well on 47th and Champlain [Avenue] was--it was a tough neighborhood. That was back when you came out of the door, you had some Middle Eastern folks who had a grocery store on the corner and I would go there with a note to get my mother's cigarettes. And that was going west. If you went east only about three or four doors, they were selling live chickens and you could smell all that feed and all that bird crap, you know. And the guys would drive up in the truck with the, the wooden cages with all of the chickens just stacked up and they'd be clucking and you know, cock a doodle do. And then there were the lounges along 47th Street, the clubs and, and you know, there was, you know, the occasional murder or shooting. And I was a night owl all my life. And, and so I was up one night looking out the window and this guy in one of these Panama hats was just rapping to this woman and all of a sudden she stabbed him right in the chest. And she stood there and you, you know, he lied there bleeding and you know, and it's like, it was like only them on the street. And then all of a sudden one guy comes up and starts looking at him, and then another guy appears, and another one. So pretty soon there's a crowd and she goes in her purse and gives somebody a dime or something to call the police and she waits for them and they take her away. And the next day, the story in the papers is--was, you know, she was his sweetheart and he was cheating on her and she got fed up. But I saw the whole thing, right outside the window. And wasn't long after that my parents [Alberta Moore Jones and Arthur Jones] want out of there, you know, so we, we moved to, moved to Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois]. But those--that was the way it was on, on 47th Street. You had--and, and there was a great hardware store across the street and the guy had all this stuff in the window that you just looked at and all the boys would come by and look at the screwdrivers and the flashlights and the, you know, this stuff. And you know, it was--there was never, never any--a dull moment out there.
Speaker 1: Then you moved to Hyde Park, how old were you then?
Speaker 2: Let's see I was about, I'd say about eight. 'Cause I was in the second half of third grade. You know, they had this 3A, 3B business. And I moved to Hyde Park--because of where I was I had to go acro- under the IC tracks [Illinois Central Railroad] to Bret Harte Elementary [Bret Harte Elementary School; Bret Harte Math and Science Magnet Cluster School, Chicago, Illinois] at 56th Street and Stony Island [Avenue]. So the day I walked in the class this little white girl on the second seat from the front by the window looked up and saw me and said, "Oh no, not another one." And just clamped her head down on her desk and covered her face. And the teacher introduced me and everybody else said hi, and I sat there. And I would say there might've been four black kids at the school. And the other three were in a special sight saving room, so I was the only regular student that was black at the school until I was in seventh grade and then the school completely integrated because of, you know, overcrowding in other locations.
Speaker 1: Do you have any particular sights and sounds and smells from your--when you moved to Hyde Park?
Speaker 2: Well Hyde Park was, you know, kind of a unique place. It was an oasis in the city because it was a more integrated community than any other place in Chicago [Illinois] because the University of Chicago influences and there was a la- a large Jewish population in the area. And so on one street you had, for example, if I played outside some Chinese kids would go by, some Hispanic kids would go by and some white kids would go by. And a lot of times we would end up in these softball games where everybody was represented. Then everybody would go back to their little enclave, which was maybe a couple buildings around the corner where the white kids lived and up around fifty--53rd [Street] or 52nd [Street] the Hispanic kids and the Chinese kids went up around 51st Street or something. And Hyde Park was, you know, they had everything, you know. There's a chop suey place, they had the Hobby House [Chicago, Illinois] where the teens and the college kids hung out and the barbeque, you know, place where you smell the barbeque when you went by. And you had the occasional Mexican guy who sold the tamales from the cart, and I love those, you know, with the hot sauce on them. Whenever I had a extra nickel or fifteen cents I'd get one of those. But Hyde Park was, was kind of a, a neat place to be back then because you could go quite a distance as a preteen and a teen without getting into any racial trouble.

Speaker 1: Now you said you went to elementary school at Bret Harte [Bret Harte Elementary School; Bret Harte Math and Science Magnet Cluster School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you have--did you have any teachers there that or kind of influenced you or became your favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Well there were a couple that--there was a Miss Bodien [ph.] and there was the assistant principal, I can't think of her name, big white haired woman and she was, she was kind of like Irish, but she took care of me against all the racism in the school and then with my parents [Alberta Moore Jones and Arthur Jones] and everything. And she did not bite her tongue. She would just basically say, "Leave Louie alone, okay." And because of her, I could do, you know, like I was captain of the safety patrol, you know, I was on the teams, you know, I did what everybody else did and nobody, you know, nobody was, was gonna hold me back because she was gonna say, "Be fair to Louis [HistoryMaker Louis Jones]" (laughter). And I don't--and she had a heart attack right there in the school, oh gosh that name. Miss Bodien was a very kind teacher. She was about fifth grade and then there was Miss Carroll [ph.] who was a sixth grade teacher, who's a very, very nice lady. But Hyde- Bret Harte was a very--gave me a very good education. They had a professor named Mr. Crofts [ph.] who took a cut in pay. He was a college professor at one of the universities and he just wanted to teach younger kids. And so he became a principal of that school. And they, they did a lot of fairly advanced kinds of things with science and they were very good at teaching you how to speak and write English. They had us diagraming sentences and doing things with language that I think even--I wish that kids were doing it now because I have people who have been employed here [Louis Jones Enterprises, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] that had college degrees, and you know, I'm correcting English on letters that they write, you know. And contracts that we're dealing with, and it's like I don't understand why they can't, they have such a lousy command of, of our language.
Speaker 1: Were there any black teachers there at that time?
Speaker 2: No. There weren't any.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you? What kind of student were you or did you think you were?
Speaker 2: I was probably an average student when I was there. I was not an honor stu- you know, they don't have honors in elementary, but I was just an average student. I got my work done satisfactorily.
Speaker 1: Were you in--you said you were captain of the safety patrol, were you in any other activities at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, a little volunteer stuff and then what--you know, the, the--they had this--you know, back in the '50s [1950s] they had this thing where, you know, they had fallout shelters and they had air raid wardens and they had fire marshals, and I was the fire marshal, the captain of the safety patrol and the air raid warden (laughter). So I had to lead and tell everybody where to go and, and I'd line up the whole safety patrol which was about eight or ten kids, and make them straighten out their belts and all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Now do you start having dreams and aspirations as to what you might wanna be when you grow up at that time?
Speaker 2: Well I was very good at art. When I was--they were building University Apartments [Chicago, Illinois]. When you--when you're in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] and you go down 55th Street, the street splits and there're these two buildings. Well when I was in elementary school that's when they built them. And so they had this contest, so I drew University Apartments as it was under construction and you know with the workers, you could see workers in my little, you know, and that got--won, won some kind of contest. And it was jus- displayed in the local businesses, you know, window. And for that, they entered me in something else and I got some free art lessons at the Art Institute [Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]. So at one point I thought I wanted to be an artist and so I started carrying around a sketchbook and that sort of thing. And so that's kind of what I thought about. But I really liked the other stuff like science and crafts and making things. But at that time I really didn't even know anything about architecture per se. And so I, I didn't at that time think about it.

Speaker 1: Did your family attend a church when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my family always attended Greater Harvest Baptist Church [Greater Harvest Missionary Baptist Church] at 51st [Street] and State [Street] from the time that my father [Arthur Jones] came to Chicago [Illinois], and he still, he's a deacon there. He's been a deacon there fifty years.
Speaker 1: Do you have any particular memories or--of your experience in church or things that might've happened to you when you--during that time period?
Speaker 2: Well you know, the usual stuff, you know, when you're younger you misbehave in church you get a spanking. You know, I always remembered that my father was, you know, a, a relatively unemotional--outwardly emotional man, so when other people would get happy and shout, you'd just see tears running down his eyes, but he'd be sitting there. And my mother [Alberta Moore Jones] would get up and shout and he'd help hold her down. And I remember not understanding any of the sermons, you know, what any of that was about. Sunday school was great, you know, I got to see all the nice looking girls and, and that was in a separate little chapel. And then they'd make you stand up and read passages of scripture and that would be embarrassing, you know, because some of the stuff, you know, you'd feel like, okay are they, they saying that I did this, I don- did my--did I sin, you know. But I kind of got through that. Didn't--when I got to be about twelve, fourteen years old, I, I didn't attend church as much and my mother didn't push it even though she was a very religious woman. She didn't want it to be a thing where it was forced on me. So I kind of got away from it and then got back later in life 'cause my father always said, you know, practice your religion.
Speaker 1: Did you--was there a children's choir, did you sing in it?
Speaker 2: No, didn't sing in the choir or, or any of that sort of thing then. Just, you know, came to church with the parents, went to Sunday school and I loved going to the kitchen for lunch, you know, 'cause they give you all that home cooking at Greater Harvest and you got everything for little to nothing as far as money.
Speaker 1: Now how many of your siblings were around at this time?
Speaker 2: My sister, Denise, was at Greater Harvest with us. And later on after I got older and was, was not attending they started attending and my two sisters [Denise Jones White and Rolanda Jones Golden] actually sang in the choir.
Story_ID: 619547
Speaker 1: Where did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to Bret Harte [Bret Harte Elementary School; Bret Harte Math and Science Magnet Cluster School, Chicago, Illinois] from first grade through eighth grade, so it was--there was not a junior high.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you remember any particular friends you had at Bret Harte?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, at Bret Harte it's kind of, you know, one of those things where you're the only black kid and so my best friend was a, a kid named John Lamb [ph.], and his father, you know, there was a large contingent of Jewish kids and a large contingent of Irish Catholic kids. And the Jewish kids had to go to Hebrew [Hebrew school] right after school and the Irish kids went to catechism. And John's father was a psychiatrist and so he had the wherewithal to have these really nice parties. And so he and I were patrol boys together right in front of the building and he would invite me to his birthday party every year. And every year it was something I couldn't do. One year it was a swimming party, I couldn't swim. Next year it was ice skating, couldn't skate, so I went around and fell the whole time. And the next year it was roller skating and I went around and you know, tried to learn how to skate, you know. One was at the Y [Hyde Park YMCA, Chicago, Illinois], one was at Michael Kirby's skating rink [Michael Kirby Ice Skating School] on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois], and that sort of thing. And I used to go by his house and visit with them. They had a--an apartment in the--on the far east side of Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois]. But he was kind of like a best friend and he, he had, you know, a lot of intellect. So when we talked, you know, like he'd look at something and he'd say you know--I draw this sofa just like you were looking at it and, and, and 'cause he'd say, "Draw me a sofa." And he's sitting there, he said, "I can't draw it perspectively like you can." Now this is a kid in grammar school saying he can't draw perspectively like I can. And like so like I got all these vocabulary from these guys. And there were kids there, I can't think of the guy, I can see his face, whose parents imported chocolate for Hershey's [The Hershey Company, Hershey, Pennsylvania]. Then there were kids who were really sort of, you know, like trashy, came to school in a motorcycle jacket and, and when they got in a fight they pulled their belt out and hit you--beat you with the buckle. And so you had the whole range of, of kids. And then it was invaded by the black kids around seventh grade. And I was a novelty for all the black girls, 'cause here's this, you know, funny looking black dude wearing a, a hat, a houndstooth check hat, a dumb looking hat, and when he talking to the black people he talk like a black person, when he's talking to the white people he talk like a white person, and they didn't know what I was. And so I, I caught a lot, a lot of hell for that. And then I became really good friends with two of my best friends, Terry Brown [ph.] and Marcus Newsome [ph.] who came with that crew. And I've known them--Marcus is still alive somewhere in Los Angeles [California] and Terry passed away about five years ago. But Terry and I were roommates, he was in grad school at University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and I was still finishing architecture. So I met two lifelong friends, and John Lamb sort of got away, went separate paths and then I ran into him once when I was at University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and then he was gone again.
Story_ID: 619548
Speaker 1: Did you go to the Hyde Park Y [Hyde Park YMCA, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Almost drowned there. You know, I, I use that as a speech. You know, when I was at Tilden [Tilden Technical High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] you had to give--if, if you, if you had decent grades you did not have to take Ms. Ewing [ph.], thank god, for senior English. Because she, you know. So I, I was able to take public speaking. And I--and, and, and when I went to the Y with the patrol boys, they'd give the patrol boys a free outing every year, that was your reward for volunteering. And we went there and they normally don't allow rafts, you know like these--what do you call them, air mattresses in the pool. So they let these guys have the air mattress. So they're playing, you know, that this is a ship and we were over the deep end of the water and I told everybody--you know, "Hey Louie [HistoryMaker Louis Jones] you're such a good athlete, we know you're gonna swim and don't drown anybody in there rough housing," you know, 'cause I got a lot of friends who swim 'cause we're near the lake [Lake Michigan]. But I said, "I don't swim, I'm gonna stay in the shallow water." "Oh you're kidding us, you're jiving us Louie." So we get in the water and I'm floating with these guys on the raft and they start yelling and screaming saying, "There's too many guys on the boat, Louie you get off." And Louie was holding on for life. So Louie went down to the bottom and I tried to figure out how to get out of there. I said okay calm down, let your feet touch the bottom and kick. I kicked, I turned a somersault, opened my mouth, water came in. So pretty soon I started--in my mind as I was down there drowning--thinking they were saying, "Louie's dead, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone." And they're all standing around watching me do acrobatics in the water because Louie's such a great athlete, you know, he's the only black kid so that's what he does. He's, he's just embarrassing us, right. So finally the coach figures out something's wrong, okay. And he goes down there and I'm out. So the next thing I know the fattest guy in the world from the Y is sitting on me pushing water out of me. I mean this was--why didn't the coach do it. It was some fat guy who knew CPR or something and I was in the hospital for a week. And everybody was coming in there apologizing and begging and griping and they gave my parents [Alberta Moore Jones and Arthur Jones] an insurance settlement, and they this and they that. And so it was, that was--it was a horrendous experience. But when I tell the sto- when I told the story as a speech and a--in a, at Tilden everybody was just falling out laughing 'cause they could see themselves in that situation (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 619549
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school, Tilden?
Speaker 2: Tilden Tech [Tilden Technical High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was that located?
Speaker 2: 4747 South Union [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Describe your experiences there?
Speaker 2: Well Tilden was all boys. You had to take an exam to get accepted and I went there because of just some word of mouth that it was a technical school and it was college prep instead of going to Hyde Park [Hyde Park High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], which is where I would've gone. And I kind of didn't like when I--they came to Bre- Bret Harte [Bret Harte Elementary School; Bret Harte Math and Science Magnet Cluster School, Chicago, Illinois] to talk and they talked about where they gonna pu- what track they're gonna put you in and they're gonna do this and do that. And I kind of didn't like that. And so I tried to get in Tilden, I got in Tilden and I really enjoyed it. We were respected because it was considered like a school of champions. The, the school had trophies lining the halls that went back, you know, fifty, sixty years, and city champs at anything from chess to wrestling to football to tiddlywinks. And when I was there the primary team that was city champs in wrestling for thirty-three years in a row was they're--was the wrestling team. Swimming team always won. Football wasn't all that great. The frosh/soph [freshman/sophomore] team was pretty decent, I was on that team and you know, we were probably a .500 club or something like that. And the, the education I thought was great because they taught you vocational skills, but they insisted on college prep as well. So you could option certain things. If you took too much ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] and shop, you kind of missed out on the foreign language and it wasn't a, a requirement, but they--you, you could study Spanish and German there. And so I didn't get any foreign language. I didn't get any band because I wanted the ROTC and the athletics. But I got a lot of shop, wood, auto, machine, auto electric, and so all of that, plus it was pretty rigorous in terms of the math, the science. I thought I got a very good college prep education there. And that's when I found out from just the counselors that architecture combined art and technology, and that's, that's what made me decide when I was about fifteen that I wanted to be an architect.
Speaker 1: Did--ha- did you know any architects at that time or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You hadn't been influenced by any?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't. And there was a--this thing where I--you know how you draw--I don't know if you've heard this thing going way back where you draw the woman, this art, you know. Okay so you--I drew the woman, the guy shows up at the house, 'cause hey you won, but we won fifteen dollars a month for the lessons and the books and everything. And my mother [Alberta Moore Jones] says to the guy, "My son's gonna be an architect." And he says, "Your son's not gonna be an architect. If you can't afford fifteen dollars a month for these lessons, one book could cost you fifteen or twenty dollars to study architecture, he's gonna be a laborer." And my mother said, "Get out of my house." And you know, she wasn't a very educated woman, she said, "I don't discourage him like that, get out." She put this man out. And they didn't have the fifteen bucks, but I knew I wanted to be an architect and she knew it, and so they just supported it.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers there?
Speaker 2: Favorite?
Speaker 1: Favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Well I liked Mr. Burmeister [ph.], he was the public speaking teacher. And there was, I'll think of his name, there was an English teacher, Randy [ph.] something. And then there was a teacher, Mr.--Mr. Harris [ph.], I wanna say, and Mr. Harwell. There was an African American teacher, Mr. John Harwell, he taught economics, but he taught it so you could understand how the world fit together and what it really meant. And he had us, at one point, where we could actually read the stock quotes, you know, in the thing, the symbols going by and we knew what it all meant. And he would tell us what all the big firms were and what the Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith [Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated] and what they meant and how they made money and all that. And I, I really loved him. And then there was a, a white teacher that everybody nicknamed Spanky because he was a huge guy, but he just looked--he looked just like Spanky [George "Spanky" McFarland] in 'Our Gang,' and he taught geometry. And he would say, "Do you know why those guys won the World Series?" So--, "We know why they won the World Series." He says, "No you don't. They know their geometry." And then he'd explain the arc of the ball and you know, the trajectories and all that kind of stuff (laughter), you know. But he just--he just made it so interesting and some of the brighter guys like my friend Art Duncan [Arthur Duncan], who's an architect, he'd have them up at the board, you know, doing the problems. You know, if you were bright enough, you know, you were the kid they called up to do that stuff. But those were my favorites. And then I liked the coach, Krasnowski [Frank Krasnowski], he coasted the frosh/soph football team.
Speaker 1: So you, you played football, what position did you play?
Speaker 2: I played end, and I played cornerback.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any other sports?
Speaker 2: Not at Tilden, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 619550
Speaker 1: And what other kind of extracurricular activities were you involved in [at Tilden Technical High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well I was on the drill team, you know, we had a--I was in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] so, then there was a separate drill team that did all this fancy close order drill for the--at halftime of the basketball. And so we practiced that. And that was pretty much it, 'cause I, I had a part time job, you know, right after school. And during football season I still went there but I was late, you know.
Speaker 1: What kind of job was this?
Speaker 2: I was an usher at the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois]. I got seventy-five cents an hour. But that was back when a dollar eighty cents would get you the Motown revue ['Motortown Revue']. Flip Wilson would be the emcee, Flip Wilson live giving the monologue. He was the emcee. Then you had The Miracles, The Marvelettes, The Olympics, maybe Doris Troy, and somebody else. And then there're another show for a buck eighty you might get Chuck Jackson, Gene Chandler, all, all the big time Motown [Motown Records] singers would come and give a--a revue. And [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson would come out and we would be having an ushers' meeting about what to do about the thugs in the neighborhood who were sneaking in the side doors and we were gonna have to get some off duty policeman to help us and all that kind of stuff. And Smokey Bill Robinson, a young guy, comes walking out after the show and stops and chats with us. It was wonderful. We used to just--and they'd pay us extra to paint the floors. You know, they, they painted the floors with this red epoxy paint. So we'd paint the floors in the dressing rooms and the chorus rooms and stuff, and pick up some extra money like that. But you, you wore a monkey suit with a cardboard dickey that stopped right here, you know, you know, and I looked like the Philip Morris boy, and you carried a flashlight. And everything happened in there, everything. Boosey [ph.] and his boys would come. There was a midget on 47th Street called Boosey and he had a little gang of thugs and they were all twice his height. And one of them would pay to get in, and then he would open the door, the emergency door and they didn't al- you know, back then they didn't have alarms on their doors. So he'd open the side door and let the others sneak in, in the middle, you know, like when Smokey would say, "Everybody," you know, you know, "get happy and get comfortable," or Chuck Jackson would tell the girls they could come on the stage and we'd be trying to keep them from killing him. And then Boosey's guys would open the door and they'd stream in and take a seat. And so we, we didn't wanna deal with them, so we had the off duty cops go around and we'd say, "It's him," you know, and they would put them out. And then they'd wait for us when we got off work and chase us to the--to the "L" station [elevated train]. And it wasn't until we got a usher who had a very bad reputation, this guy, his nickname was Brownie [ph.], and when he started ushering there, they left us alone 'cause they knew he would probably kill them. He was that crazy, he had a bad reputation. So they cau- they stopped us at the "L" and Brownie stepped between us and said, "What's the problem, you all--?" And they said, "Oh ain't no problem," and they just left 'cause they knew who he was. And so they--after that we stopped. But som- it was, it was a great time. Ray Charles would come, Roy Hamilton, Percy Mayfield, [HistoryMaker] B. B. King. And people would pay $1.80 and get a movie, a B movie and see the show. So I worked there and get home at ten o'clock, do my homework and still be at school at eight the next day.
Story_ID: 619551
Speaker 1: We were talking a little bit about your experience as an usher at the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois] and you mentioned that you had talked with, or [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson had come by and talked some of the ushers. Did you have any contact with any other of the entertainers that came through there?
Speaker 2: No, Smokey, for some reason, he would come out. The, the show would be over. We'd go around and pick up and then they--we'd have a little meeting at the back of the auditorium. And we'd look up and Smokey would come down and come--and walk all the way out and just stop and chat. The others didn't do anything like that. They were, they went some other way and, and they were gone.
Speaker 1: You mentioned an experience with having to go to the dentist for somebody?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Now they, they came and got me 'cause I just was handy and they said Chuck Jackson's caps on his teeth were loose. This is a very popular singer and so they sent me to the dentist who was over, you know, he was on a second floor across--I guess somewhere on the northeast corner of 47th [Street] and King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive]. And I went there and explained the situation and they asked if the dentist could squeeze him in. I went back and told them and after that I don't know what happened. I presumed that the guy glued him--glued him back together.
Speaker 1: Did you have any other jobs in high school [Tilden Technical High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, when I first got in high school I had a paper route. And then the only other job I had was the usher, usher at the Regal, and then I kind of, when I got into my junior and senior year, I didn't--I didn't work anywhere.
Speaker 1: Were you in any clubs or anything?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't in any of the clubs. I was, I was on the frosh/soph [freshman/sophomore] football team and I got my ankle broken in one of these power plays where, you know, everybody goes around one end and I was the cornerback, and so they steamrolled me and I thought everything was cool, but by the time I got home my leg was this big. And my father [Arthur Jones] said, "I did not send you to school to get bro- broken up. I'm gonna get this fixed and I don't want you on that team anymore," I mean and back then you knew--there was no discussion, you know. So that was the end of the sports. And I stayed involved with the drill team and ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps]. We--I was on the team that--back then they had shooting teams where you, you did .22 [.22 caliber rifle] target shooting and you competed against other schools and I was on that, and that was it.
Story_ID: 619552
Speaker 1: When did you decide that you were going to go to college?
Speaker 2: Well, I always figured from elementary school [Bret Harte Elementary School; Bret Harte Math and Science Magnet Cluster School, Chicago, Illinois]--from, from eighth grade that I wa- would have to go to college to do what I wanted to do, and I was thinking art. And then because of the experience with the Art Institute [Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], where I had won the contest and won some free lessons down there when I was in elementary school. Then when I got into high school [Tilden Technical High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], they had the career counsels and he, he, he looked at everything and he says, "You know, you're very good at art, you're taking the drafting classes, you're getting," whatever it was, Es or A's, you know, E for excellent was the same as an A, "and so it looks like you like the shops, so the combination of those two is architecture." "What's that?" Okay, so then I started reading the books about what architects do and everything and I knew I had to go to college.
Speaker 1: At what schools did you apply to?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know if I even applied to anything but University of Illinois. I don't recall applying to more than one school. I may have, but I don't recall doing that. I just went to the state school because that's where I was gonna spend the least amount of money and I went to Navy Pier [Chicago Undergraduate Division, Chicago, Illinois] first because they had not built the Circle Campus [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], as we used to call it.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: What was your first experience like at--in college?
Speaker 2: First experience, what was it like?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was--it was different because y- you went to a class, they presented the material and for example, Spanish, and you come back and they go around and say, "You don't know this? What do you mean you don't know?" You know, it's like hey get it on here or you, you're not gonna make it. And the concepts like what is--like in the rhetoric class, which is basically like English. The concepts were, you know, what is satire, what is irony, and they expected a guy coming out of a, a, you know, and some of these kids that came out of these inner city schools didn't even have a clue. They, they thought--I had a, a friend who came from another high school and she wrote an analysis of an essay by James Thurber, which was really satire. And she wrote it because he was poking fun at what he called mom- momism in America, and, and she just got a complete, she was crying she got a complete failure on it. So I, I just--I fig- I felt like I had to really gear up because they expected you to, to get ahold of concepts and stuff that in some cases I was exposed to because of the grammar school I went to, that a lot of inner city kids just weren't. And, but other than that, it was--I just relish the whole experience 'cause I just thought, you know, I was determined to complete it because it was--it was gonna improve my future.

Speaker 1: Let me take one step back, was Tilden [Tilden Technical High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] integrated at the time you were there?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah. Tilden was completely integrated.
Speaker 1: So you came out of high school in '64 [1964], started college [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]. This was, you know about a year after the March on Washington and some of those events, did, did that affect you at all or was your family affected by that or did your parents [Alberta Moore Jones and Arthur Jones] talk about it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, they talked about it a little bit. They, they, they loved what Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was doing. They were a little afraid of, you know, the upshot of it. But because we were living in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], there wasn't a lot of, you know, the kind of backlash you might get if you were on the edge of Marquette Park [Chicago, Illinois] or something. And I remember when Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was assassinated, my high school platoon was in a parking lot north of 47th Street practicing with Elmer W. Stringfellow who was like the, he was, he was a Vietnam veteran [Vietnam War], early Vietnam and they sometimes they come back and they get these ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] assignments. Maybe, I don't know, he was retired or something, but he, he had been a captain. And all of a sudden he, he stopped and we were marching. And somebody at a car, rolled their window down and he talked to them for a minute and he came out and stopped everybody, had us stand in attention and he said the president's been shot. And then later on we found out he was killed. And I, you know, it was sort of devastating to me because I thought, you know, the whole combination of Kennedy, the Civil Rights Movement and stuff was gonna be great for everybody, and it was like everybody was just getting, you know, knocked down. But my parents were not, you know, on the activists type order, they just believed in, you know, what should be right and they had had these experiences in the South. So they were happy that somebody was trying to get something done but they were always afraid for me and afraid for them.
Story_ID: 619554
Speaker 1: When you started at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --were there any ot- you were in the architectural program at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were there any other blacks in that--in that field at time--in that field?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was kind of an interesting thing. The--Eric Johnson and Arthur Duncan graduated from Tilden Tech [Tilden Technical High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] with me the same year, and we all ended up in--in architecture at the University of Illinois. And then Duncan sort of went on, but, but we were all there. And then there was Ed Hale [Edward Hale], Charlie Smith [Charles Smith], John Williams, and there was a Nigerian woman named Alpha [ph.], I can't, I can't think of her last name, and I believe there might have been--there's Vernon Williams--we were all there around the same time. Charlie and--Charlie was a little bit ahead of us, and right behind us came Phil Johns- not Phil Johnson [Phillip Johnson], but his partner, Chris Lee [Christopher Lee]. So it was to me an unusual thing that we had about six or seven blacks at--you know, African Americans studying architecture at UIC at the same time.
Speaker 1: Did you know any black architects when you started there?
Speaker 2: No. Met them while I was there, but I didn't know any.
Speaker 1: What kind of--who were some of your influences in college in terms of your professors that kind of guided you through this. 'Cause I know architecture must've been kind of foreign to--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well there were, there were a couple. One was not an architect but he had a tremendous influence on all of us, and that was late, late in later years, and he was African American, his name was Ray Dalton [Raymond Dalton]. He's supposed to be coming back in town and we're gonna have a luncheon or a dinner or something for him. But he was--he's an artist, but he became one of the associate deans or something of the College of Architecture and Art [College of Architecture, Design and the Arts], and he helped a lot of the black students through those later years and senior years, and stuff. Before that, there was Ed Deam [Edward Deam], he became one of the deans and he was my thesis critic. You know, every--in the traditional program, a five year program an architect has to do a thesis project in his fifth year. And you get assigned to somebody who is senior in the department and that's your thesis critic. And then they sort a guide you through and you come up with a, a apprentice or a concept and you develop it, and you report to that person. And then you write it and that person reads it and edit, tells you what you gotta do about it. And then it--then there's a big, what they call jury or critics and the nicknames for those were like crits, but you, you--the most influential person for me was Ed Deam, 'cause he was very philosophical about architecture and he was a really professorial type, so he was--he was a real what I thought a true architecture educator and he knew, you know, all the good history about the great architects, like you know, the contemporaries like Paul Rudolph and Felix Candela who was, actually Candela taught at Circle for a while. And then he knew all the, the great, good history about Mies van der Rohe [Ludwig Mies van der Rohe], Frank Lloyd Wright and that. But he was, he was flexible enough and he would--it was so funny because, you know, me and Eric Johnson are sitting in front of him with these big fros [Afros] and he would say, he called me Eric Jones and him Louis Johnson. And we'd say, "My name is [HistoryMaker] Louis Jones and his name is Eric Johnson. Why can't you white people get this stuff right," and you know there's these two brothers standing there with these fros, you know. And he'd say, "I don't care about that, but I'm gonna tell you one thing, you're gonna have to be every bit as good as the white person that's sitting right next to you in this class and don't you guys forget that," you know. And so we al- we always loved him because he was straight and he said, "You know, it's rigor, you gotta do it, we ain't giving you no, no pass because it's the civil rights era and you got a fro. We not doing that and I care about you." And he was a white guy that didn't live like us and had no background like us whatsoever, but he had that kind of compassion, so he was very influential for me. And the rest of them, you know, just respected them, you know, there were--we had a whole bunch of different visiting professors and stuff.
Story_ID: 619555
Speaker 1: Andy Heard [Andrew Heard] was there for a while. And he, he came in way down the road and was part of my thesis jury along with guys I invited, because I was working part time at an architectural firm, Skidmore, Owings and Merrill [Skidmore, Owings and Merrill LLP, Chicago, Illinois]. So I invited Will Reeder [ph.] and Bob Hutchins [Robert Hutchins] to my thesis, final thesis presentation and then Deam [Edward Deam] and Heard were there and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Wha- what was Heard's kind of claim to fame, I mean?
Speaker 1: Well Andy Heard was one of the established black architects. I think he graduated from U- University of Illinois in Champaign [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]. And he had is--he had a ongoing practice and I can't remember at the time some of the projects he did. I know since then he's, he's designed some of the Cook County jail facilities [Cook County Department of Corrections] and some other things, and I don't know if he's retired yet or not. But at the time, he was like an adjunct professor of architecture and he used to come around and say, "You know, I'm here to, to kick you black guys in the butt, you know, to make sure you, you know, you know." And, and so we used to have some issues with him, but he would--he would come around, you know. And so he came to the work with, I think there was a Swiss team there, Graham Moreland [ph.], Peter Gygax and Jacques Boomer [ph.]. They went through these periods where they, you know, like they have the--the Mexican innovator Felix Candela came after I was gone. And then they had this era where Stanley Tigerman, who was a very famous white architect from the Chicago [Illinois] area that went to Harvard [sic. Yale School of Art and Architecture; Yale School of Architecture, New Haven, Connecticut] and created all these things and then he taught. He taught when I was at Navy Pier [Chicago Undergraduate Division, Chicago, Illinois], and then he continued to teach at UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] for a while. And then they went through the Swiss German school and that's when Andy Herd was there, and he, he taught alongside of the Swiss and the German guys.
Story_ID: 619556
Speaker 1: At that point, say your, your freshman or sophomore year [at the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], had you thought about a style of architecture that you wanted to be involved in?
Speaker 2: No, I got really interested in schools. My thesis was, was what a new Marshall High School [John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois] should be. But I was more interested in the reflection of the needs to educate our community in the way the building was put together and the facilities, then it was in how the building looked. So I had a lot of, of programming and, and verbiage and diagrams about how to get it done, and less drawing. And Deam [Edward Deam] was un- you know, he was understanding of that. But that was--kind of my approach was how does, how does your goal and your function--you know, and they always say that form follows function business from, you know, that era but I was more interested in what society needed in a school and then how do you construct that school and what facilities do you put in it and how does it work for the people that needs to use it. So, and I used to read on it. Like they would say that the physical environment is about 25 percent of the deal, you know there's 75 percent all the other factors and learning. But, but the physical environment is--at the time--they decided was worth a quarter of what was going on. So I figure I wanna make that quarter of what was going on right. I don't want it to be leaking, I didn't want it to be cold or too hot or anything like that, I wanted it to have the right, you know, space. So that was--if, if I had an approach, that was, that was it.
Story_ID: 619557
Speaker 1: As you looked around at architecture in the Chicago [Illinois] area, what buildings or types of architecture influenced you the most or did you--?
Speaker 2: Well, you see I'm, I'm more of a guy who's--who builds things than a guy who designs things. You know, most of my career has been as a construction manager. You know, I--I've designed two jobs that are very practical. There's an expansion of a dentist's office and there's a twenty thousand square foot business incubator going up in--out in Kankakee County [Illinois]. And those I designed but they were very practical designs. So I don't, I enjoy buildings like the Trump Tower [Trump International Hotel and Tower Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], the Xerox building [Xerox Center; 55 West Monroe, Chicago, Illinois] that Helmut Jahn did, I like that better than the State of Illinois Center [James R. Thompson Center, Chicago, Illinois] or even, which I do like a little bit, but it, it doesn't, it doesn't wear well over the years, the United Terminal [United Airlines Terminal 1] at O'Hare [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois] which Helmut did. And I had a lot to do with building that, but if you look at it now it looks kind of dirty and then there's, there's some, you know, awful stains going on the outside of the facade and the skylights and everything. And you know, I don't know whether it's a maintenance issue, but I don't think that some of these guys think about what's gonna happen in ten years when they design a building. But the Xerox building is a very nicely done high rise with white sheet metal cladding and all of it looks pretty much the same as it did when it was first built and I thought it was--I thought--I enjoyed that building.
Speaker 1: Where is that located?
Speaker 2: That's at the corner of, I wanna say Clark or De- Dearborn [Street] and it's right next door to--its right across from First National--the old First National Plaza [Exelon Plaza, Chicago, Illinois]. It's the southwest corner of Dearborn and Monroe [Street].
Story_ID: 619558
Speaker 1: Now when you were at the--in college [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], you said you had a part time job with the architecture firm?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yeah that was--that was at Skidmore, Owings and Merrill [Skidmore, Owings and Merrill LLP, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: How, how was that experience?
Speaker 2: Well that was a good experience. I enjoyed that. I, I worked there, sometimes I just worked for three hours in the afternoon and sometimes I'd be there because somebody was trying to make a deadline and they'd say, "Hey, you wanna make some hours, the Mid-Wisconsin Bank [Nicolet National Bank] job is going on upstairs, they need another draftsman." So I'd go upstairs and I'd be there all night. And I'd just go to school from there in the morning. And I worked under Richard Linky [ph.], Tom Pado, and there was a partner there who was responsible for a lot of the firm's revenue, his name was Bruce Graham. And Bruce--Bruce's crew, I was part of the overall, they, they, they didn't have what they call studios, but now they call it studios. So I would've been in Bruce's studio. And in that studio and adjacent to it there were, I think, three black architects, Charlie Duster [Charles E. Duster] who's passed away, Lee Hillary who's still around, and Bob Wesley [Robert Wesley] who--who's still around and retired. And Bob Wesley was kind of like a mentor to me, you know, he was the job captain and I spent a lot of time on a project that didn't get built because it didn't get funded. But it was completely designed and Bob Wesley was the leader of that--the production team that actually, you know, like Walter Netsch was a partner who designed the first Circle Campus and the first expansion of the Circle Campus. And Walter was the designer for this University of Iowa hospital project [Bowen Science Building, Iowa City, Iowa]. And--but Bob was the guy who actually had to create the drawings that actually made it get constructed. And so I worked under Bob for a few years, part time. And I learned how to work with, you know, what, what it means when you're an architect and you draw a line, you know, like, you know, I did something and for example Tom Pado comes over and says, "You know, do you know how much money you've added to the cost of this building by raising the parapet, you know, one foot when we don't need to." And I said, "I don't have any idea." He says, "Well let's just look at it. You know, so many thousand lineal feet around this, you know, this thing and you know you add two more courses of brick. And if we lower it," you know. So then I found out, hey every line you draw means something. And once--that was back when they didn't have AutoCAD where, you know, everything's digital now. So you produce the documents in the computer, you can email a whole set of documents. Back then we had to literally, physically draw them, and they were drawn on mylar and then I was the coolie who had to gather it all together and ship it. So I was shipping this stuff to Texas. There was a project in Texas, I shipped to the wrong place. I shipped it with the originals and they were pulling their hair out until they got those originals back. 'Cause those originals represented thousands of man hours and there was no--you know, and I was just waiting for the, you know, shoe to drop, I was gone. And got them back. And that was back when they didn't have FedEx [Federal Express; FedEx], they had an outfit called Wings and Wheels [ph.]. And you call Wings and Wheels and the guy would come running up and you'd go downstairs and give them the drawing, the package, and he'd jump and take it to the plane and overnight it to wherever it was going. So I learned a lot there about how architects have to work with the engineering department, or the outside engineers, and when you draw something you don't just decide that it's convenient to make certain adjustments, you really make sure that you have to do it because it's gonna make a difference when they try to build it.
Speaker 1: Now, you said there are three black architects at Skidmore. That must've been--they must've been kind of a progressive firm at that time?
Speaker 2: Right. Here in Ch- there was an article in Ebony magazine I think, and I was telling you about it earlier that did a study of where the black architects were. And they said in this article that, I think, at the time there were four. It said there were four black architects who were reaching the executive level in corporate architecture and all four of them are at Skidmore, Owings and Merrill in Chicago [Illinois]. There was Dave Sharpe [David C. Sharpe], Charlie Duster, Lee Hillary, and I'm missing somebody, did I name somebody earlier, Bob Wesley. Bob Wesley became a general partner, it's unheard of. Dave Sharp and Charlie Duster became associate partners, and I don't know if Lee Hillary got, got to that level. But during the era, that was just, that just, that just didn't happen, and they did it.
Story_ID: 619559
Speaker 1: Now what year did you graduate from Circle [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I actually went to the spring of '73's [1973] commencement. I was class of '69 [1969]. In other words I graduated from high school [Tilden Technical High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] in '64 [1964] and I was in their traditional five year program. So if I had taken five years to do it, I would've graduated in June of '69 [1969]. That wasn't happening because just the sheer hours and I had to work part time, and so it stretched out. And I finished all of the degree requirements with, with the help of Ray Dalton [Raymond Dalton] in, in the fall of 1972. And then I, I told my family that I wanted them to see me walk down the aisle and get a degree from a university because I would've been, I think, I was the first one, you know, in my blood line to get a degree from a major university. So I wanted my family to see that. So I said, "No, don't give me the piece of paper yet, I'm coming to the commencement." And the commencement back then, because Circle Campus wasn't fully expanded was at the Chicago Stadium [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: So what happened during those, were you still in school?
Speaker 2: I just worked.
Speaker 1: You just worked?
Speaker 2: No I was done. You know, I worked at--this is 1969, '70 [1970], '73 [1973]. In late '73 [1973]--let's see I got married in '72 [1972], we couldn't afford a real honeymoon so we went to New York [New York] for three or four days, and then--'73 [1973]. I was still at Skidmore [Skidmore, Owings and Merrill LLP, Chicago, Illinois] and then I switched to a construction management firm called McKee Berger Mansueto [McKee Berger Mansueto, Inc.], and so I was working and then I came back for commencement.
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned you had to do a dissertation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's--the--it's not like the traditional Ph.D. dissertation, but they call it a thesis. And in terms of rigor and level of effort and the amount of harassment you go through is very similar.
Speaker 1: What did you do yours on?
Speaker 2: Well mine was--my, my thesis project was Marshall community high school [Marshall High School; John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois]. You know, how, how do you, you know, wha- what should be the elements and what should it look like and what should be in it to meet the needs of that community.
Speaker 1: And did you get a grade or how, how was it judged (laughter)?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't remember whether I got an A or B, I passed. They raked me over the coals pretty good. Ed Deam [Edward Deam] had me redo a lot of stuff over, you know, a number of times and, and my wife [Barbara M. Jones] sat there 'cause she typed the thing, and did the white knuckle bit, you know, listening to all this heavy criticism that she really, you know, didn't like people, you know, doing. And Ed Deam was trying to save the day 'cause they were killing me, and Ed Deam says, "I salute you, I salute you." And the other guy was saying, "I'm gonna kill you," you know, like that. You know, "This is horrible. You should've done this, you should've done that," and it's like, "Hey, you know, this is what I meant to do." You know, I remained calm through the whole thing and they passed it. As far as I know, as long as they passed it. But I think Ray Dalton saved me because he got me in some art electives and my average was catching hell that--the later years and I got A's. And he said you should take this, you should take that, you should do this, you should do that. And so it worked out.
Story_ID: 619560
Speaker 1: We're gonna go back to Circle [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] for just a second.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What other activities were you involved in at Circle?
Speaker 2: At Circle? Well, you know, it was the civil rights era and this wasn't really a sanctioned university club, but I joined SNCC, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. And every once in a while we'd do something. You know, we invite the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party]. They'd come to the school and raise a whole lot of hell and say a lot of rhetoric and we'd be behind that. We'd reserve a room for it and everything, everybody would really know what it was for and then they would come. And then we got really pissed when they were hosing the people down in Selma [Alabama]. So we all got out on Halstead Street and held hands and blocked traffic. And we, we were able to last about half an hour. By, by then it was a full blown riot squad out there and they had a cop behind each one of us with his night stick. And I could just hear this guy just seething, and puffing and blowing, he was just waiting for the word to crack heads. And the president of the club was a guy who's a doctor now, his name is Lance Arnell [ph.]. And he was, he was just--his timing was perfect. He said, "All right, we made our point." And everybody just broke and went back and they didn't get a chance to hit us or anything. But that was my--I loved that extracurricular activity. The other one I really loved was the fencing team. There was a coach named Leon Pickens and you--you'd never believe he was a fencer because he was about 6'6", and that's not the normal build for a fencer. But he was into it and he, he taught it as a phys ed class [physical education]. And he said, "Hey, you know, you--you're pretty athletic, you got good form, you know, I'm putting together a varsity fencing team." And I said, "A varsity fencing team? I'm just doing this 'cause I wanna know how to sword fight, this is fun," you know, I just took it because it's a totally different class. And he says, "Yeah, but here's what happens, you get to compete against schools like Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana], University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee], Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana]. And we, we drive to these schools on the weekend." Well, I wanted to see all of those campuses. "Okay so that's one thing," he said, "the next thing is you get an allowance, six dollars for dinner." I can eat steak! "And you get two or three dollars for breakfast, and if you stay overnight at a motel, we pay for it." "I'm in, okay." So I was on the fencing team for like two seasons, and really enjoyed that. Fence- they'll pay, and just I thought that was the greatest thing since sliced bread, it was unbelievable. And there were a few blacks in there. The NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] champ in saber was a brother named Marvin Bell [ph.]. And Eugene Doremus [ph.] who is a Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] grad, M.B.A., was on the team with me at UIC, became a vice president at a Harris Bank [Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank]. I don't know where he is now. And we had an invitational we went to down at Urbana [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] and University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] sent their team, Vanderbilt sent a team, and I can't remember, and then there was us. And so we watched Eugene pick apart this really scrappy white guy from University of Iowa and the guy was just, it was horrible, I thought he was gonna hurt him, you know, 'cause he was pl- he was fencing so unsafely. You know, there's a certain way you do this. And he just picked him apart. He would come in with one of these off the wall moves and Eugene would parry him out and touch, and he'd just wipe the guy out. And we're standing back and we said, "Gene, you just whooped the NCAA champion in epee." It was some white guy named Woody Herman [ph.] or something. And so we just had a wonderful time doing that. And we ate well. So that was my--that was my main extracurricular thing, you know.
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned Marvin Bell being the NCAA champion. What school was he from?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I think he was either down at Champaign or one of the midwestern schools, but he was NCAA champ. And I just, you know, couldn't believe that, you know, there were brothers in that sport. But there were more than I expected because I came across a guy at, at Wayne State [Wayne State University] in Detroit [Michigan] who, who, you know, whooped me up real bad, you know. And he had something that they, you know, they use a lot of European terms. He had something they called a coup--coupe attack, and he would fake you out and flip his point over your forearm after he got you going in some other direction. And the blade would, would just flex enough and they scored it electronically. Now the saber was scored with, with four people, two guys behind each fencer and as they went back and forth, 'cause the saber is a cutting and counter cutting weapon. So there was no electronic tip. So everybody would raise their hand if somebody was struck legally. And so these guys, you know, so it's, and it's an Olympic sport, if you ever watch the Olympics you see them. So we had a lot of fun doing that and we whooped the hell out of Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado]. Their, their foil team was unbeatable. They had Olympic, Olympic quality but, but I was on the epee team, I was first stringer, we beat our guys and we beat them in saber. And they, they just thought they was gonna just swoop up this inner city school, you know. So that was fun. And we got to compete against schools at, at that time UIC did not have teams competing against these Big Ten [Big Ten Conference] and these big private schools like Notre Dame, so it's a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 619561
Speaker 1: Now after you finished at Circle [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], you're still working for Skidmore [Skidmore, Owings and Merrill LLP, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, I worked for Skidmore until 1973, fall, and that's when I went to work for MBM [McKee Berger Mansueto, Inc.] and then I came--not '73 [1973], I'm sorry, '72 [1972]. And then I went to work for MBM, which was a construction management firm.
Speaker 1: What kind of work and assignments did you get at Skidmore?
Speaker 2: At Skidmore when I first came in, you know, as a student and I just did drafting. They were still designing the Sears Tower, which is now Willis [Willis Tower, Chicago, Illinois]. And so I drew a lot of the reflective ceiling plans--it's, it's a portion of, you know, the design drawings. So I drew those under another architect and then I worked on, there was a, a Sears prototype store system where they created a standard for Sears stores [Sears, Roebuck and Co.]. And you might have a different exterior cladding, but the store design was similar all over the country. And they created this manual--standard for that. I worked on that. There was a bank up in Wisconsin, Mid-Wisconsin Bank [Nicolet National Bank] and there's a couple a--several high rises that were built by this developer called Gerald D. Hines, Interests [Hines Interests Limited Partnership] in Houston [Texas]. And I did drawings on that. And then when the "L" [elevated train] up the middle on the and on the Dan Ryan "L" where tho- the white trains--I mean, you see some of the--it's really rusty and kind of needs a lot of maintenance now. But when they originally were built, everything was all white metal and everything that was designed by Skidmore. And all of the presentation drawings and stuff I, I had to draw that stuff. That--I was like the draftsman for a good portion of that. And the other stuff was kind of miscellaneous, you know. Somebody needed to--some fill in work. And then that--that hospital that didn't get built.
Speaker 1: During that period, what did you think was the best thing you got the chance to work on and most memorable?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I guess I'll say it was fun at Sears Tower 'cause it was gonna be the tallest building in the world.

Speaker 2: I met Barbara [Barbara M. Jones] at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] in--sometime around 1969. And we used to speak to each other because back then there were maybe fifteen, twenty thousand students on the campus, but there were only two hundred blacks. So everybody knew each other by sight. So she'd walk and I'd speak, and sometimes she'd speak first. One day--I was a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity and we had an urban chapter where people went to different schools. But we would give these fundraiser dances and we gave one at one of the church's gym or something on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], I can't remember whether it was St. Ant- St. Anthems [sic. St. Anselm's Catholic Church, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Well, we gave a dance there and Barb came with her brother and we recognized each other. And I danced with her and I just, I just took her away to an after party and, and she said, "Well, can my brother come? We came down--." I said, "No" (laughter). And you know, we just--we dated from there and we married three years later.
Speaker 1: What was she studying?
Speaker 2: She was studying at the Jane Addams School of Social Work [Jane Addams College of Social Work, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Did she get a M.S.W. or?
Speaker 2: She's an M.S.W., LCSW. She went on to University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and got her a master's in social service administration.

Speaker 1: Okay, you left Skidmore [Skidmore, Owings and Merrill LLP, Chicago, Illinois] and where did you say you went from there?
Speaker 2: It's a firm called McKee Berger Mansueto [McKee Berger Mansueto, Inc.], it doesn't exist anymore, but they were the first construction manager in America. In other words, there're--there are firms out there that do construction management now that are also general contractors, and there are firms that were created that are architects and engineers who will do construction management. McKee Berger Mansueto was--they're engineers and everything, but they, they came together just to do construction management and they were based in New York [New York] and they had a Chicago [Illinois] office. And they had somehow became the program managers of the Chi- the first Chicago school rehab program. And back then they had almost like quota type edicts where they said, "You gotta hire 25 percent blacks as part of your staff," and they needed a staff of nearly 100 people to run the program. And my friend, Ernest Brown, who I went to school with was working for them and he said, "Hey, you know, I know you wanna get married and you got a college loan to pay off, you could probably make more money here then you're making at Skidmore." 'Cause back then, architecture was a pretty low paying business until you really got further along. And so I, I interviewed there and that's, that's how I--because Ernest recommended it.
Speaker 1: At that point did you, did you--I mean this is kind of a new part of architecture being construction manager. Did you know what it was about at that point?
Speaker 2: Just basic. I thought it was something like project management but it's a little bit more than that depending on the type of construction management you, you do. But I was as much interested in getting my salary bumped by a--by a few thousand dollars as anything at the time. And you know, I went in and met with this guy, Sam Shaheen [ph.], and I, I think Skidmore had offered me another, I--it was, it was a small amount of money after I had gotten my degree. And, and I said, "Is that the best you can do for me?" And says, "All right," you know, you know, and it went from--they offered me two hundred bucks [dollars] a week and then they said, "All right, 210." And you know, you can imagine that's what--I don't know, six, seven, eight thousand dollars a year, right. So Ernest told me to ask Sam for thirteen thousand dollars a year, and I said, "You out of your mind? He's gonna throw me outta the office." So I went in and he agreed to I think 10.5, and so I went and told Ernest and Ernest said, "Are you outta your mind, go back in there and tell them that you got, you know, expenses, you got this, tell him you got to get thirteen thousand dollars." I said, "Ernest I need this job." And he said, "Take your ass back." So I went back and the guy turned blood red and agreed to it (laughter), you know. So, I, I don't know what happened, but he agreed to it. And--so I always owed Ernest, you know. So years later when Ernest needed to come back to Chicago from Washington [D.C.], I convinced the company I worked for [Schal Associates, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] to relocate him to work with me on McCormick Place South [McCormick Place South Building, Chicago, Illinois]. But somehow, you know, that was, that was the ticket I needed so I could pay the college loan down, get married [to Barbara M. Jones], move, the whole bit.
Story_ID: 619564
Speaker 1: Give us kind of a flavor of what a construction manager does?
Speaker 2: A construction manager gives--there's, there's two types, but basically it's, it's a professional relationship between the client who wants to build something and the construction manager who can build it like a general contractor but on a professional basis, so that the client is getting an open book project. If a client hires a general contractor it's a lump sum deal, guaranteed price, but if anything changes at all different from what I agreed to that's on the drawings, I want more money. Well the construction manager, he works with the owner during the design process. The owner is able to make certain decisions financially as the project goes along and he sees everything, where all the money is going. And he has a professional relationship, and the construction manager is almost like his lawyer between him and the industry, and yet the construction manager has the same skills as a general contractor. He has superintendents, he has project managers, he has estimators. So that's, that's the purest form of it, you know. And then there's, there's all kinds of variations. There's agency CM where the construction manager is pure professional. Then there's at risk CM where the construction manager gets the owner to a certain point and then guarantees the price. And--well a lot of the more sophisticated clients prefer that because they see everything. They, they--because if I'm, if I'm the general contractor and I give you a price, I'm gonna build this building for $30 million and then it turns out that I can save myself a hundred thousand dollars on the electrical, that's going in my pocket in addition to whatever contingency or profit I put in. In a construction management agency relationship or a CM at risk, the clients sees all of that. And if he's got budget issues or concerns, then he can say well in the upfront deal I'm either gonna split that hundred with you or I'm taking that whole hundred and I'm gonna apply it to something else. Does not have any ability to do that in a general contract situation. So a lot of the clients use that, you know, school district uses it. Developers like to use it sometimes. We built the Colin Powell Middle School [Matteson, Illinois] on that basis.
Speaker 1: Now does the construction manager hire all the subcontractors or choose all the subcontractors?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's done two ways. If it's a public agency, the construction manager helps the client put together all the packages and they put it out to public bid and then they follow whatever purchasing laws they have, and the construction manager supervises everybody. If it's more of a private job, the construction manager does all of the buying for the client, but the client sees the open book, because our fee is part of the process. Our fee and our direct costs are part of the process. And then the client is able to see what he is paying for electrical, site work, plumbing, everything.
Story_ID: 619565
Speaker 1: And after you had that job, what was your next position?
Speaker 2: After I worked at McKee Berger Mansueto [McKee Berger Mansueto, Inc.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: Well I had several positions there and when I left there I joined another construction management firm called Schal Associates [Schal Associates, Inc., Chicago, Illinois]. And I joined them as a project manager and I became a--an associate, it's a little bit different ranking, sort of like maybe a junior vice president or something if it were--if it were not a partnership.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any particular projects that you worked on when you were there?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was with McKee Berger Mansueto, I was the--I, I worked my way up from a field coordinator to an area manager in the Chicago school rehab program, and I had Area B, which is the middle of the city. And all of the schools, there were 105 schools in that area. So I had five field coordinators and a secretary and I was, I was assigned an office in the district. And those people all reported to me. And each one of them had a portfolio of schools that they had to monitor for construction. And all of the contractors had to submit their pay requests to us. They all came into my office and I administered those pay requests, made sure they were all complete and signed off on them. And I informed all of the community in the school districts, for example, it was a long hour type job. I worked during the day and supervised the field coordinators and in the evenings I would usually meet with a PTA [Parent Teacher Association] and a principal at a school and tell them where they fit into the program and what the program was gonna do for their school. So I did that. And then a guy had a--an illness in San Francisco [California] and they were looking around the country for who was gonna take over his position. And they evaluated what I was doing here and for a number of other circumstances, they offered me to go to San Francisco to manage the earthquake program there.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-four [1974], late '74 [1974]. They had a program called the Field Act reconstruction program. There was a law passed in California that said that all public buildings had to comply with a certain earthquake structural standard. It had to survive a Richter 3 earthquake with no damage. If there was a Richter 4 to 6, the people had to be able to evacuate the building within a certain number of minutes. If it was a Richter 7, the building was gonna fall, et cetera like that. And so there was certain structural things that had to be done. So San Francisco had fifty-six schools. We evaluated those schools and sixteen of those schools it was prohibitive to re- to remodel them to comply with the standard. So those schools were torn down and replaced. The rest of the schools were renovated to comply with earthquake safety standards. I was the program manager for that. I had a staff of nineteen people, plus I had a full time earthquake, licensed earthquake inspector stationed at every school site. And the gentleman who was running the pro- project was an older gentleman, he had a heart attack and the client was extremely difficult. The associate superintendent of schools and the director of facilities, and they wanted what they wanted. And it took me six months of fourteen hour days to make them believers in me. But once I did, you know, everything went well. And so I ran that program for about three years and I came back to Chicago [Illinois] to work for Schal in 1978. And during that time, I went down to Pasadena [California] and supervised the redevelopment program that the firm in New York [New York] that I worked for, contract they had won. And we did some consulting to the school district in Phoenix, Arizona.
Speaker 1: Just for our knowledge, what's a field coordinator do?
Speaker 2: Well a field coordinator at the time was really more like a field inspector type of person where they actually went to the school and they determined if the contractors, who were renovating the school, were doing everything in accordance with their contract. And that they had made a certain amount of progress in, in terms of--like if they were 50 percent done or what have you. And they did a daily report. And so the field coordinators, which I started out as one, had to--you might have ten schools, one of them might be in design and you're just checking with the architect when he's gonna have it ready to put out to bid. And another one would be finishing and everything in between. And I had the pleasure of dealing with my alma mater, Tilden Tech [Tilden Technical High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] was, was being renovated. And Clayborn Jones, who is African American was the superintendent for Ruby Construction [Ruby Construction Company, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] that was renovating it. So I got to watch a black field superintendent working on my school, and that was a lot of fun to see happen. And, and he started his own construction company later on. He was--he and I were on the BCU [Black Contractors United] board and everything together.
Story_ID: 619566
Speaker 1: So your next job was at Schal [Schal Associates, Inc., Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: My next job was at Schal.
Speaker 1: Okay. You were still a construction engineer?
Speaker 2: Construction manager.
Speaker 1: Manager, okay. What kind of projects did you work on there?
Speaker 2: Well Schal, Schal brought me from--from San Francisco [California] because they had a public job and I was oriented to these public jobs. They were building high rises for private developers in Chicago [Illinois]. But somehow they got the Skokie Courthouse [Second Municipal District Skokie Courthouse] in Skokie [Illinois], the second district circuit court facility in Skokie. And I was to do that and it was in design. And so I came in and started doing budgeting on that, but it was slow. So Dick Halpern [Richard C. Halpern] called me in my office and he had this big green file, 'cause everything that meant money they had--they had a green folder. And he threw this thing up in the air and it lands on the conference room table like that (claps hands), and he says, "I know you're not an estimator, but pick that up go get with Tony Napoli [ph.] and you'll do the work and he'll be the brains, and I want the 200 South Wacker [200 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois] job estimate completely redone." It was a $35 million high rise that Harry Weese designed that is right across from the Sears Tower [Willis Tower, Chicago, Illinois]. So I got stuck doing that while I was waiting for the courthouse to kick in. So I worked on that for several months and redid it, helped them get permits and everything, and then went on to the Skokie courthouse when that geared up. I did that job, and then Schal teamed up with another team, I think it was Darin and Armstrong [Darin and Armstrong, Inc.; Walbridge Aldinger Company, Detroit, Michigan], and we won the Tribune [Chicago Tribune] plant, they called it Freedom Center [Chicago, Illinois]. And me and my assistant project manager, we managed that project. And there was another job, but those were, those were the main ones. I was there about six or seven years.
Story_ID: 619567
Speaker 1: And from Schal [Schal Associates, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], where did you go? And what year was this?
Speaker 2: Well Schal, I came to work for Schal in, in June of 1978 from, from San Francisco [California], and worked on 200 South Wacker [200 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois], Tribune plant [Freedom Center, Chicago, Illinois]. Then Schal joint ventured with McHugh [James McHugh Construction Company, Chicago, Illinois] and I was the project director for the North Hall of McCormick Place [McCormick Place North Building, Chicago, Illinois]. And that went through a couple iterations where it went way over budget and they, they started trying to pull it back and work on it. And at that time, a friend of mine, Eric Johnson, who I went to school with [at the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], we had a side business that was Johnson and Jones Architects [ph.]. So in the evening I would leave Schal, go around the corner and I had the license, I had gotten my architect's license. So I would look at the drawings that were being done, seal them, sign them, go home. So Schal kind of got wind of it. And this was in the era when there was big affirmative action pushes and Harold Washington, you know, was, was, was getting, getting in--in line to be mayor, you know, it was like in eighty--'82 [1982], '83 [1983] or something like that. So we started talking and they became a mentor company and they wanted to ow- hold a third of the deal and we were going to create Louis Jones Enterprises [Louis Jones Enterprises, Inc., Chicago, Illinois]. So I said okay, I don't wanna be accused of fronting for a big white company, so I gotta get somebody to look at this. So Sam Hurley [Samuel Hurley] was first deputy director, he's African American engineer, he's first deputy director of public works for the City of Chicago [Illinois]. And he was also on the city's affirmative action committee. Now they call it affirmative action. So I had Sam look at it. And he said, "Well, I know you Lou [HistoryMaker Louis Jones], I know you from Schal and all that, you know what you're doing, you're for real and all that kind of stuff. So why don't you, you know, move forward with it and see what." So then I turned it over to [HistoryMaker] Earl Neal who gave it to Anne Fredd [Anne L. Fredd] in his office to evaluate.
Speaker 1: Earl Neal was a black attorney?
Speaker 2: Yeah. And then they kind of got Ja- [HistoryMaker] James Lowry involved. And so Lowry help promulgate it as a good mentor protege thing. So I went with it. And so--and the 29th of February it was incorporated as Louis Jones Enterprises. I was living in Oak Park, Illinois and so they had my home address for a while, and then I had a small office at 440 North Wells [Street]. And so that's how I started a company. And we had a five year buyout deal and all that. In about three years, I bought them out because we were, you know, just something we wanted to do. So we started out working on McCormick Place North to bring it back, because they had sort of mothballed the job because the legislature had not funded it. And then the O'Hare Development Program came about. And by the fall of that year, in 1984, when I opened the company, by the fall of that year I had ten employees and they were all working at O'Hare field [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois]. And I had been spending quite a bit of time in the prior year as an employee of Schal and then later on as a consultant helping the team that was doing all the budgeting for the O'Hare Development Program. What is the United terminal [United Airlines Terminal 1] gonna cost. What's the inner outer taxi way relocation and widening gonna be, the second taxi way bridge. Did a lot of analysis and studies and stuff on that. And so Dick Unsulman [ph.] was the executive director of the O'Hare Development Program and he sent out a--like an ultimatum, "Either Lou Jones is full time working with me on the O'Hare program," because he was involved with McCormick Place somehow, "or he's working on McCormick Place, which is it." Well my business and my employees were all at O'Hare, so I moved to the O'Hare thing and let the McCormick Place thing go. And I became deputy director of construction management for the O'Hare Development Program. So all of the facilities stuff, they had a deputy director for facilities and a deputy director for infrastructure. So this guy, Dan Kaiser [ph.], was over all the civil stuff like runways and roads, and stuff like that. And I was over all the buildings, like the terminal buildings, the crash fire rescue stations, that kind of stuff. And within a couple years I had twenty-five or thirty employees out there and me spending full time there when I started to pick up other work was getting to be a strain, so I brought in Joe Doddy [ph.] who's still working out there for somebody else, who's a classmate of mine, to be the deputy director for facilities.
Story_ID: 619568
Speaker 1: Before we took the break we were talking about your work on the O'Hare project [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now what was your, your--you have your own firm [Louis Jones Enterprises, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] at this, at this point (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Was this the biggest project you had at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah. That, that was paying all the bills, that was a great job, because it was, it was construction program management, they called the whole team the supervising consultant and it went through a couple iterations but ultimately it was called O'Hare Associates. And the contract was theoretically, or technically, the contract was for nine years. And so we were able to build on that and do other things. And so as, as time went on like, you know, those type of consulting jobs, we would hire people. We would get paid a multiplier of what they made as, you know, an hourly rate. And as the firm developed and had other things to do besides O'Hare, as, as I was saying before, I had to bring somebody else in to do the work that I was doing personally out there so that I could spend more time administering the, the company. So we got involved with the school projects and some, some general contracting and some other construction management while we were doing the O'Hare Development Program, but that was a project that we were involved in for, I think it was supposed to be five years and we were involved in it for about nine.
Speaker 1: Now you were up to about, what, twenty-five employees at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were at about twenty-five employees by about 1986, '87 [1987] we were up over twenty-five because we had people working on a few other things at the time.
Speaker 1: How many architects did you have?
Speaker 2: Well, the degrees ran like this, we were more--there were always more engineers than architects. We had brought John Williams into the firm. John, John has his own firm now, but John was an architect that I went to school with [at the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]. We went through some iterations where Eric Johnson was a partner and then we, we got to a year where we started to need to reorganize and we brought in Shilu Agrawal who is East Indian as a partner because we needed to--well we really had to bring in some more revenue and work, and he had the engineering contacts. And Eric had already--always been talking about, "Why don't you diversify instead of just only doing construction management? Why don't you take advantage of these minority programs and be a sub to these engineering firms?" And he knew a couple of them, but we needed to expand and get involved with a lot of them. And so in the '80s [1980s] and '90s [1990s], we started, we got prequalified with the Illinois Department of Transportation to do inspection. And they called it phase III engineering, but basically you're, you're inspecting and doing quality control of road work for the most part. And you have to have people with certain qualifications for that. But those people are all--in which the overhead is good because those people are always out house. You don't need a big office to have those people around, they're out on a, on a site all the time. And you administer their, their personnel needs and that sort of thing. Going into it you have to prepare the proposal and develop the right kind of process or you just have to have the prequalification as a firm. There's certain things that your firm has to have in house, cer- certificates, and then you can, in effect, some people call it bidding, you can submit proposals for that work. And then with the programs that they have with IDOT, where they have a minimum of 10 percent on transportation for small business or minorities, and then there's some projects like in the city's department of transportation [Chicago Department of Transportation] where maybe the city has a goal that's higher like 20, 25 percent. We would submit our credentials to all of these firms, they were competing to be the prime, and we were picking up subcontracting or subconsulting work with all of those companies. So at one point we got to where we had a construction management job going on in one place, we had some of the O'Hare project going on, we, we had a direct contract with the City of Chicago [Illinois] to manage the re- reconstruction of sewer work. Like the city had this big program all around town where they were replacing the sewer. Like they replaced the sewer in the street from Stony Island [Avenue] to Cottage Grove [Avenue] on 63rd Street. We were the--we were the inspectors for that, and we had a direct contract with the city for that. And there might have been ten of those things that we did. And we--there's one or two people, there's a person out at O'Hare field now that was one of those field engineers that was a resident engineer on the sewer jobs for us in the '90s [1990s], and he still works for us. So we had a lot of people out like that, so that's how we kind of grew the, the number of employees beyond those that were assigned to the O'Hare Development Program.
Story_ID: 619569
Speaker 1: And then we got an opportunity to compete to be the construction manager for Provident Hospital [Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois]. And the county had bought the hospital for a few bucks from the federal government because it had closed. And for whatever reason, the hospital had been built with a design from a firm who designed hospitals pretty much in the Sun Belt. So there were things going on with the building that needed to be corrected and the county thought that they were gonna spend $17 million to get it done. And when I got involved and we did all the estimating and the figuring, we said, "No, you're gonna need $37 million, and you're gonna need maybe another 20 to replace the equipment, the medical equipment that is out of date or damaged." And then the county decided that they needed to build a whole parking structure, which was another $7 or 8 million, or $10 million something like that. So it ended up be- becoming like a $50 plus million project for us. And it took me a while, I want--I wanted an African American project manager for the job, 'cause Provident Hospital is in the community and it took me awhile and I went through two project managers, but for the first six months I was the project manager, full time on site. And I was just making phone calls to the office [Louis Jones Enterprises, Inc., Chicago, Illinois]. And I had six people out there for about three years. And I ended up going through a couple of African American project managers and we finished the job. There were about twenty-six contractors that we supervised on that and we worked with three different architectural firms and engineering firms, all county departments from the hospital division too.
Speaker 2: So at this point, you're more of a construction management firm then an architectural firm?
Speaker 1: Right. At that point, I would say there were times when we weren't doing any architecture and then there were times when maybe 10 percent of what we were doing was architecture. There was a, a couple iterations of the Near South Health Clinic [Near South Health Clinic of Cook County; Near South Health Center, Chicago, Illinois] at 31st [sic.] and Indiana [Avenue], and we were the architects for that for the county. There was some remodeling of some--a couple of apartment buildings and we did the architecture for that. And there were a few other projects, but that represented only about 10 percent of what we were doing.
Story_ID: 619570
Speaker 1: What was the next big project that your, your firm [Louis Jones Enterprises, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] had? You had Provident [Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois], you had O'Hare [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: The Harold Washington Library [Harold Washington Library Center, Chicago, Illinois] came up and McCormick Place South [McCormick Place South Building, Chicago, Illinois] in the '90s [1990s]. Both were, were done--they had international design competition design build--they wanted design build. And we teamed with a group that call themselves the SEBUS Group, it was Schal [Schal Associates, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], Epstein [A. Epstein and Sons International, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], U.S. Equities [U.S. Equities Realty LLC; CBRE Group, Inc.] and I forget what the B in there was [Hammond, Beeby and Babka, Inc.; Hammond, Beeby, Rupert, Ainge, Inc., Chicago, Illinois]. But we did something like 10, 15 percent of the deal. We had the union crew that--a construction manager operates sort a like general contractor, they have what they call temporary facilities and controls or general conditions. We had a crew of about fifteen laborers, carpenters and one operator, and Barb [Jones' wife, Barbara M. Jones] went through a lot of people because we insisted on hiring African Americans, and we had some issues with that, and we had to really go to--we actually had to do some stuff. 'Cause I wrote a very ugly letter that everybody asked me to burn or shred because if it got to the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times] or something--'cause I was threatening them that they were mani- manipulating me into laying off black folks and hiring Mexicans and white people unfairly. Because I would put a black carpenter out there and--or a black laborer and, and the, the other firms that were involved wou- would complain that they were, they were too slow, they didn't know what they was doing or something. And I said, you know, you're trying to tell me that a journeyman carpenter doesn't know what he's doing, you know, give me a break, you know. So finally--when you start a construction job there's ebbs and flows. At the beginning there is some site work. They're, they're doing the foundations and stuff and you need some laborers around there to do cleanup. You might have a little bit of safety with a carpenter or whatnot, and maybe those guys will get three weeks work or a couple months work, then they get laid off because there's a lull. And then when that thing starts to come out of the ground and it's a project that's big as Harold Washington Library, then you need a full time cleanup crew and you need a couple of people there to do backup safety where the subcontractors don't do the barriers where people might fall, you know. And if you're the general or you're the construction manager you better see that they're done. And even if it's somebody else's duty and then you just back charge them for it. So we had those kind of people. And so that came to nearly fifteen people, and I think we had one white person and one Hispanic, everybody else was black. And there was always some issue. So finally I wrote a letter and I said, "Look, you know, you've manipulated me into laying off my whole crew and then you call and said you wanted these people back and you recommended its people that wasn't black." "We don't want--we don't want that written down, where are the rest of those letters." And so then the edict came down, leave Lou [HistoryMaker Louis Jones] alone, let him hire the people that, you know, he sees fit, as long as they're doing the job.
Story_ID: 619571
Speaker 1: And so then we [Louis Jones Enterprises, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] had this crew there for nearly, nearly two years or, or it took about three or four years to do that job. And the main foreman was a, a, a black gentleman that, that we brought in, the sub foreman was my first cousin, and there was, there was one union steward that was not black and there was an operator, and Barb [Jones' wife, Barbara M. Jones] called the, the unions every other day trying to get a black operator, but she couldn't get one to operate the hoist. Then we had some people that were African American and non-African American that were project managers. The--one of the superintendents for the mechanical was Dick Jones [ph.] who has come back to work for us, is working out on Metra station for us now. But he was the superintendent for the electrical mechanical. And there's another gentleman that still works for us who is non-African American that was a superintendent for the super structure and the masonry. Then we had another gentleman who retired, but he was a mechanical engineer and he was a mechanical project manager for the job. So, within the roles of the team that we had to run the job, we had all those people. So it was Harold Washington Library [Harold Washington Library Center, Chicago, Illinois], and then we had at one point when we were part of Mc3D that built the South Hall at McCormick Place [McCormick Place South Building, Chicago, Illinois], we had twenty--about twenty-five people. Some union people, we had Mike Scott [HistoryMaker Michael Scott, Sr.], Cu- Curtis Thompson [ph.], there was a project accountant that was Ken [ph.] who came off of Provident [Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois], there were two secretaries, and there was another superintendent. Everybody except one of those people was black. And then we had Hispanic carpenters and laborers on, on the site because everybody had to hire from a community database of people. And so whichever person was up and if it was up for me to hire somebody I had to at least give that person an opportunity. So the person that came up for me at that time was Hispanic, wasn't black, but you know, we brought him in. But whenever it was me direct hiring, I would always go, you know, or Barb who was in charge of hiring people and screening them and all that would, would, would go for African Americans. And I spent a fair amount of time on that job as part of the joint venture control board where we met every month and we reviewed everything. And the first thing we was asked, "Did we hurt anybody?" "What's the safety situation?" Okay, next thing was, "Where are we with the schedule?" Then, "Where are we with the money?" And so we sat there with, at one point, the president of George Hyman Construction Company, which is now Clark [Clark Construction Group, LLC], it was Pete Forester [Peter C. Forester], senior vice president of Huber, Hunt and Nichols [Huber, Hunt and Nichols, Inc.; Hunt Construction Group, Inc.], one or both of the Walsh brothers, Matt [Matthew Walsh] and Dan [Daniel Walsh], Alex Munoz who was the Hispanic partner on the team, and myself. And there was a gentleman from Morse Diesel [sic. Morse Diesel, Inc.], I can't remember his name. But I kind of--it was a real education for me. You know, what do the senior construction executives on a really big project, how do they manage the project, how do they manage the money, what are the most important things to them. And how do they manage the whole client relationship, you know, I was able to see that kind of thing.

Speaker 1: Just talk a little bit about now in te- particularly in terms of the Chicago [Illinois] market--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --is there an organization of black architects and construction managers?
Speaker 2: Well you got Black Contractors United and you have mostly contractors and a lot of subcontractors and some generals, you know. I've been a member of that for, maybe going on twenty-five years or more. And then you have National Organization of Minority Architects.
Speaker 1: That's NOMA?
Speaker 2: NOMA. Then you got some cross things going on. Once in a while, you know, some of the black architects will join BCU as either an associate or something. It's not--I don't think much of that is going on lately. But BCU has been, you know, you know, up and down with its level of advocacy and influence in the marketplace, but it's still always been a influence for black contractors and you know, big advocate for opportunities. And BCU works with the other associations, you know, HACIA, the Hispanic American Construction Industry Association, and the Federation of Women Contractors. And at one point, I don't see them that much, but there was a gr- group called the Asian Construction industry something [Asian Construction Enterprises], it was called ACE. And there's a consortium that kind of meets every once in a while to talk about opportunities and situations in the industry. And BCU will help us, you know, get involved in negotiating deals if a contractor is in trouble for some reason, sometimes we send Florence Cox or some of the board members to talk to people or try to get people to be reasonable to help people out. Over the years, you know, BCU has been, you know, pretty influential and back in the '80s [1980s] and early '90s [1990s], that was back when Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] was negotiating these covenants with national industries and stuff, and when I got involved with BCU, Glenn Harston [sic. Glenn M. Harston] and [HistoryMaker] Larry Huggins were really the prime movers. And one day Glenn got, was busy--had a conflict and they said, "Lou [HistoryMaker Louis Jones], can you go with Reverend Riddick [George Riddick] to Detroit [Michigan]." "So what's that for?" So I'm getting in with Reverend Riddick who's, you know, like a prominent PUSH personality and we're going to Detroit to work with--it was somebody else, I can't remember who all was on that trip to negotiate a covenant with Diamond Star Motors. And it was the funniest thing, we're sitting there in the evening in Detroit with this Japanese guy who's, who's the United States rep [representative] for Mitsubishi [Mitsubishi Motors Corporation] and this white guy who's the, the rep for Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC], 'cause Chrysler-Mitsubishi came together and created Diamond Star Motors and started making a couple of cars. And this woman, I can't rem- she was with, she was connected with BCU and PUSH and she was a lawyer. And she was going through all of the detail and we were all, you know, really, you know, and Reverend Riddick was talking and everything, and the Japanese guy was falling asleep (laughter). And everybody was getting upset with him, 'cause, you know, he was sleeping, this was so important but it was like late in the day and it was seven or eight o'clock. But I just thought--I was so thrilled to be involved with a couple of those kind of things. Like there was--because they would just ask BCU to be a part of it. They had another thing where the black dealers--car dealers, all met at a hotel, I can't remember whether this was, I don't think it was Chicago [Illinois], I think it was outside of the airport in Detroit [Detroit Metropolitan Airport, Romulus, Michigan], and they wanted some kind of concession with the, the, the manufacturers--there was something going on. And PUSH was involved in that. And for some reason I got in--I was in the room and they were all negotiating and I--I couldn't believe there was that many black car dealers, you know, but they came from all over the country, it was fantastic.
Speaker 1: So that was fairly successful?
Speaker 2: Well the Diamond Star Motor deal, they were gonna build a Mitsubishi plant somewhere--it, it's there--I see--it's the one that makes--what's the car--I forget the little car, but there's a Belvedere plant [Plymouth Belvedere] and there was one that was going in Dixon [Illinois]. And I think Charlie Moore [Charles Moore] was supposed to get a piece and some of the other prominent black contractors that were big enough to do a little something. So that was all part of the deal with PUSH. If you gonna come in Illinois and do this and do that, you know, here's the guys and here's, you know, and here's what they--how they wanna do it. So that, as I understand it, Charlie Moore got some of that and some of the other guys. I didn't get involved in it, but you know, I was just glad to be around to help with the negotiation. I was practically taking notes. But--and I don't, I don't know how the car dealer thing went, I was just there. And, and they just wanted BCU there for whatever reason.
Story_ID: 619573
Speaker 1: Now, let me go--at this point do you have children?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How many and when were they born, and what are their names?
Speaker 2: Well, Camiria [Camiria Jones] was born in 1975, she'll be thirty-five on June the 14th. And we lost one baby, that was Louis Arthur [ph.] in crib death and he was born when Camiria was about three. And then when we came back from San Francisco [California] in 1978, it kind of took us a while to get over it, it took about five years to get over that. Lynnea [Lynnea Jones] came along in, I wanna say Lynnea is thirty, so what am I talking, she was born, what '80 [1980] or '81 [1981], I mean '79 [1979] or something. I wrote it on the form. And then Langston [Langston Jones] came along in '81 [1981]. So that's kind of the children.
Speaker 1: There's three of them?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what are they doing now?
Speaker 2: Well Camiria is a, is a psychologist. She just passed her licensing exam last week and she's totally ecstatic about that. But she's been in school psychology for some time. She's a, she's a Ph.D. She taught at The Chicago spo- School of Professional Psychology [The Chicago School of Professional Psychology, Chicago, Illinois] for a while and then she got back out of that, and now she's the--one of the psychologists for the Noble Street system [Noble Network of Charter Schools, Chicago, Illinois], it's a system of charter schools. Lynnea is an interior designer, she's in and out for freelancing. And Langston, he went to Miami of Ohio [Miami University, Oxford, Ohio] for a year and was unhappy. He, he studied architecture and was an A student. And so then he came back and went to Columbia [Columbia College Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and got a degree in film and animation. So he's more or less a commercial artist. So he's a struggling commercial artist. And he's done a couple of animated commercials for the, the--for Sutton Ford [Sutton Ford Lincoln, Matteson, Illinois] and he's illustrated some children's books for some author and he's done a couple other animated jobs. And so he, he sort of is in and out with that, with that sort of thing, you know. So he'll work part time to supplement what he's doing. You know, so that's, that's what they're up to. They're all out of the house, which is cool.
Story_ID: 619574
Speaker 1: All right now, we're just talking about your involvement with the, with Operation PUSH's [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] initiative. What's going on with your firm [Louis Jones Enterprises, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] at this, at this point?
Speaker 2: At this point we--
Speaker 1: What year is this?
Speaker 2: This is our twenty-sixth year.
Speaker 1: No, what year is this in terms of when you were doing the thing for O- O- Operation PUSH?
Speaker 2: Oh with Operation PUSH, oh that had to be--that had to be somewhere between '87 [1987] and '88 [1988]. And we were still with the O'Hare Development Program. We're probably, not yet, we might've been being considered for Provident Hospital [Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois], designing the renovation of Near South Health Clinic [Near South Health Clinic of Cook County; Near South Health Center, Chicago, Illinois]. At that point, we probably had somewhere around thirty people, you know, twenty-nine or thirty people. We had people working under several major engineering firms in Chicago [Illinois] providing the bridge inspection and the quality control for the road work on--when the Kennedy [John F. Kennedy Expressway] was rebuilt and the Edens [William G. Edens Expressway], and then there was some widening of the toll way. And then we actually had an IDOT [Illinois Department of Transportation] job under Baker engineers [Baker Engineering] when they, they did the Stevenson connection [Stevenson Expressway]. You know, you didn't always drive all the way through Stevenson to Lake Shore Drive. Well that connection, the surveying and stuff for that, for Baker was done by us. The lighting and all the electrical- electrification to lighting was done by an electrical engineer we actually had in our office at the time. And from, from that point early in the days of the South Hall and McCormick Place [McCormick Place South Building, Chicago, Illinois], we had, we had two survey crews, professional land surveyors. Ultimately, we had to unionize them to do layout on construction sites, whereas before we were doing it for engineers professionally on some of their work. But to do it for McCormick Place around other contractors, believe it or not the plumber's union has a division called the technical engineers, and so you have to be in that union, Local 130 Tech Engineers Division [Technical Engineering Division of Local 130, U.A., Chicago, Illinois]. So we unionized those, those people and then we did quite a bit of layout around--all over Chicago [Illinois] for different contractors and we did--one of our duties on McCormick Place besides having all these other superintendents and project managers was to control all of the line and grade for that project as it went up. 'Cause a general contractor usually has his own independent guy checking everybody else's layout.
Speaker 1: How do you get clients? I mean, do you do RFPs [request for proposal] or just how do you solicit business?
Speaker 2: We answer RFPs, because we have worked as a sub consultant to so many firms over the years, a lot of word of mouth business comes. Alfred Benesch [Alfred Benesch and Company], for example, is a national engineering firm. We submit a proposal with him and the job doesn't get funded. And then two years later they call me up and say, "You remember that job, you know, the Skyway bridge job [Chicago Skyway]?" "No I don't remember that." "Well, we submitted a proposal two years ago and now they want us to do it. I want a field engineer from you at two and a half times time card and I want him out there for two years." So that was Dick Jones [ph.] as it turned out, you know, put him out there. So word of mouth stuff comes like that. And then we're still certified as a minority business. So when they have these minority requirements we'll see some kind of initiative going on and--for a either it's a hospital job or if it's for IDOT and we'll contact all the, you know, I have a list of people and I'll call them. And I'll say I'd like to be on your team. Or have you met your minority requirements yet. So we do that. And then we have situations where somebody calls us, for example, when we did Colin Powell [Colin Powell Middle School, Matteson, Illinois], we just went after it straight up as a construction manager. And because we had so much school experience from various--well personally and from various other endeavors, we won the job and we beat out some much larger firms to get that project. So it's a combination of word of mouth, reputation, going with the same team we went with before, and just outright cold bidding or proposals. This St. Bernard Hospital job [St. Bernard Hospital and Health Care Center, Chicago, Illinois] that we just got a part of was a relationship thing, because we had a prior relationship with the bigger people on the team.
Story_ID: 619575
Speaker 1: What goes through some of the projects that you worked on? You did Provident Hospital [Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois], how did you get that?
Speaker 2: Well we submitted a proposal to the county and I think a lot of it had to do with--that Dick Phelan [Richard Phelan] was the one term president of the county board. He, he wanted to make a statement and it was Provident and it was in the black community. And he was looking around for what he thought was a really qualified black construction manager. And so I think we, we had the qualifications to do it. And so they accepted our proposal.
Speaker 1: That was 1990, about then?
Speaker 2: Somewhere in there, yeah. It was the early '90s [1990s], yeah.
Speaker 1: Then you also got the Hyatt hotel at McCormick Place [Hyatt Regency McCormick Place, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, now we were part of Mc3D. We had a little piece of that joint venture, but it was such a big, you know, like the South Hall [McCormick Place South Building, Chicago, Illinois] was $675 million. So our little piece was great for us. They wanted Marriott [Marriott International, Inc.] to do the hotel and Marriott didn't wanna do it. And then it got to be a delay and okay, now how we gonna get it done in time. So they just gave it to our team. So they actually gave Mc3D $100 million project, it was a $108 million project because they were stuck. They had to get started and they were so satisfied with the team. So we were part of that. Same--some of the same people that worked on South Hall worked on the hotel.
Speaker 1: And you did something with the Muntu Dance Theatre [Muntu Dance Theatre of Chicago]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, now that project didn't get built or anything. What happened there was we were selected and we, we had a joint venture with another black company called II In One [II In One Contractors, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], which is Oliver Fifer [Oliver B. Fifer] and Bobby McGee [Robert J. McGee, Jr.] own that. And they were general contractors and concrete contractors. And we started the job as far as preconstruction doing the estimating and doing what we call the preconstruction analysis. And then they had funding issues. And they were asking us to do things that got to a point where we had to say look, you know, this is as far as we can go. We love and respect your organization, but we think you need to, we think you need to do something different. So they put it out and I think they ended up bidding it out. Leo--Leopardo [Leopardo Companies, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] was a white general contractor, got it and did a little piece of it, you know, which is still sitting there 'cause, you know, it's barricaded. You know where it is on 47th [Street] and Ellis [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know where Little Black Pearl [Chicago, Illinois] is--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and you know that site that's, that's, that's been sitting there on the other side for years, that's where it was gonna go. And when we got the plans, they hir- hired a New York firm and I don't know whether it was a white or black firm, they had a number of black people working for them 'cause we had meetings with them. But the New York firm was a firm that could design, you know, had a reputation for design and that sort of thing. So that firm, we worked with them, we did estimating and everything, and we figured out that hey, they thought it was a $7 million job, and we said this is a $10 million job. That's--you got 10 million plus on these drawings right now. They just didn't have the money.
Story_ID: 619576
Speaker 1: Where's your firm [Louis Jones Enterprises, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] at this point, I mean, you still up to twenty-five to thirty people?
Speaker 2: No, no, because of the economy and everything else, we're down to twelve people going on fourteen when we got--well it's gonna be more than that, but we got two assignments that haven't started. One is, you know, they're gonna reconstruct the rest of Wacker Drive, the north south portion. And we're part of an engineering group that's led by Infrastructure Engineering [Infrastructure Engineering, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], which is Mike Sutton's [Michael Sutton] group, and that's an African American firm. And there's an older white firm called Harry O. Hefter [Harry O. Hefter Associates, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] and we have a little piece of that. That's gonna start in July. And then we're just getting--I just got the joint venture agreement for St. Bernard Hospital [St. Bernard Hospital and Health Care Center, Chicago, Illinois], and we'll add about three people for that project. And that project probably run two, three years. And we're pursuing the--IDOT [Illinois Department of Transportation] puts out a professional service bulletin, sometimes twice a year, and we're currently pursing four or five items on that. And we're working for Chicago Public Schools through Tishman Construction [Tishman Construction Corporation], which we've been doing for something like sixteen, seventeen years. That's where most of our revenue comes from. And then we're part of the O'Hare Runway Designers [O'Hare Runway Designers LLC, Chicago, Illinois], which is a joint venture, we own 10 percent of. And you remember last year they opened the new runway at O'Hare [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois], the north runway. That team designed that runway, and they were so satisfied with that, that the mirror image of that runway on the south side of the airfield, we're designing now. And we have engineers that work on site and at Epstein's [A. Epstein and Sons International, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] office for that. And we're part of a general contracting group called Airport Contracting Group, and we, we beat out some other firms about three years ago and we won what they call a job order contract. It's kind of like an indefinite quantity contract where they wanna get something done fast at O'Hare, for example they had to put in about a thousand feet of new sewer and manholes and that sort of thing in front of their headquarters building on Zemke Road. And we did it in three weeks. You know, we hired the right subcontractor, we put our safety people, our superintendents and that, that team. And then there is a pumping station in a yellow brick building that most of it is underground in the central parking lot at O'Hare. You know if you--there's a parking structure in front of the hotel, and then out back of that there's a flat lot. In that lot, there's two funny looking little buildings, okay. You go in there and you go down underground there are three very large pumps there. Those pumps are triple backup like, you know, one of them will do the job, two of them are electric and one is diesel. And if you have a fire at O'Hare and the sprinklers come on, that's what's pumping the water. And there is a reservoir underground, a tank that we actually hired scuba divers to go in and inspect, that's full of water and, and that--and, and so that you're not just pumping water from the fire hydrant because if you have a problem and the water ain't there, you got this reservoir. So the president of the United States will not fly into O'Hare if one of those pumps--if those pumps aren't working. So our team and our subcontractors are replacing all those pumps and renovating that facility underground and re-waterproofing the reservoir and all that stuff. And then there's a building next door to the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] office or, or an office in the security offices of the airport, and it's, it's called the Office of Emergency Management and something, OEMC [Office of Emergency Management and Communications]. And it's kind of like the 911 center for O'Hare. And a big portion of it is being gutted and redone, and all the, you know, maybe as much three or four hundred thousand dollars of work, we're doing that. And then, they're making an energy--an energy saving gesture at Midway [Chicago Midway International Airport, Chicago, Illinois]. They're going to mount twenty-four wind turbines on the parapet wall of the south face of the Economy Garage at Midway, we're doing that, and we just started that last Wednesday. So the electricians are out there putting the wires up. They haven't put any turbines up, but the wind turbines are sitting in a warehouse. We're involved in something else, but I'm not thinking of it right now. But that's--other than that, we're just chasing work, you know.
Story_ID: 619577
Speaker 1: We talked about schools and things--something that you do a lot of, have you developed a niche in terms of the type of work that you do?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say the only thing you can say about us is in terms of a niche is, if you just looked at us as a firm [Louis Jones Enterprises, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], and there're still four or five individuals around that have that corporate memory, we have supervised, built as, as a construction manager on a prime basis or had something to do with somewhere in the neighborhood of four, four hundred schools. For example, Steve Pulma [ph.] has four or five schools that he's responsible for seeing that they're renovated or a new addition is built on to. Ahmad Hindi has twenty in Chicago [Illinois] and Scott Mooney [ph.] has got maybe ten, Victor Simpkins has another ten, twelve schools, and we've been working in this school program, supervising renovations or what have you for about eighteen years. So we understand that environment. And then the Colin Powell Middle School [Matteson, Illinois], we opened that in September of 2006. That's a state of the art middle school for a thousand kids. Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell] flew in because it was the first institution named after him, and signed autographs and stuff. They wouldn't let me come, you know, the, the big shots were there, the board members and all that. And we were the prime construction manager for that. We had people involved in that for about four years and the first year was during the design phase, and then it took just under three years to build it. About thirty, about thirty months to build it. So I would say, you know, we have a lot of school experience. And the second niche is, is we have a lot of experience just being the sub and sometimes the prime for infrastructure phase III engineering, which is the inspection and the quality control once the stu- stuffs under construction. Let's see last--year before last, we had seven people up in Winnebago County [Illinois] and we were the prime for that. The, the tollway system [Illinois Tollway] expanded from, from four lanes to six lanes, and there's a smaller contract where they do the--it's an add lane project, but you have to prep it. You have to go in and rebuild the shoulder so trucks can drive on it. You have to do retaining wall stuff, you have to do cutover stuff and all that. And somebody has to design it and then somebody has to supervise the construction of it. So that's what we did, we did the phase III engineering for that with all our own people.
Speaker 1: Now your work on schools, is that an offshoot of what you did your dissertation on?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I love schools. And then, you know, I went from there to San Francisco [California] and Chicago working on renovation and earthquake safety in schools, so.
Story_ID: 619578
Speaker 1: Tell us about your involvement with ACE--
Speaker 2: ACE Tech [ACE Technical Charter High School, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Technical--yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, [HistoryMaker] Earl Neal has passed away--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but going on six years ago he just called me on the phone, and he said, "You're gonna get a call, you know, in, in a couple weeks about getting involved in some--an educational project and they don't have any black contractors involved in it." I said, "Well what is it?" He said, "Well, you know, you--you'll make that judgment when they call you," click (laughter), you know. So I forgot about it and about three weeks later a woman who was the mayor's deputy for education at the time, this African American lady named Angela Ball, she called me up and she said, "The mayor has been pushing the unions to create a charter high school in Chicago [Illinois]. And we were looking at the whole thing and there's just no African American involvement in it," you know. And I said, "Oh I'd love to check it out, but I--I'm, I'm a board member of BCU [Black Contractors United], but I'm not the chairman or anything." She said, "Oh that doesn't matter." So I started going to discussions about it. And the unions then voted not to do it because there was some issue with how they were gonna fund it and they were concerned with some other things going on with the mayor [Richard M. Daley]. And the mayor's office said, "Well we, we still wanna do it." So I sat in the office, and it was on the mayor's conference room with his deputy and a couple other people. And gosh, I'm not--I'm drawing a blank on her name, but there was a, a Hispanic gentleman there that's since left the program. But I suggested that we get the whole industry involved, architects, engineers, as well as the contractors and the unions. And so the next thing I knew I was chairing like a forty plus person working group, and it go too big for my office. So I used to have an office downstairs but I added a decent size conference room. And then we got Bill Bonaparte [HistoryMaker William Bonaparte, Jr.] involved.
Speaker 1: Who is he?
Speaker 2: Bill Bonaparte owns the Bonaparte Connection [Bonaparte Connection, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] and he created it, now his son's [William Bonaparte III] running it, okay. And so Bill offered his space down on South Michigan [Avenue], and so I would sat there and try to keep everybody calm and reasonable. And the union guys were, "It should only be construction people involved, there should be no community people involved in this." And the, the city people were saying, "Well, you know, in order to get a charter for charter school, you gonna have to have various types of talent on the board," blah, blah, blah, you know. So, I got guys from Parsons [Parsons School of Design, New York, New York], Skidmore [Skidmore, Owings and Merrill LLP, Chicago, Illinois], developer people, some--everybody sitting at the table. And the mayor supported the whole thing. And so ultimately they gave us a place holder in the fall, and to make a long story short, we got the charter. And the unions who had withdrawn, except for the carpenters--except for the electricians and the tile setters, they started to drift back into the deal. So when we finally got started I had a seven member board and I had consulted with Mike Milkie [Michael Milkie], who founded the Noble Street charter schools [Noble Network of Charter Schools, Chicago, Illinois], a very highly respected group of charter schools, has a high rate of college admissions and stuff, and we kind of used him as a consultant and we modeled some of the things we were doing in the beginning with them. And ultimately, the board of directors included officials from the electricians, the carpenters, the plumbers and we brought in people, you know, from architecture and whatnot, education and all that. So, and we're about to have our third graduation June the 3rd or 4th.
Story_ID: 619579
Speaker 1: Now you also did some work at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah. We met Berglund [Berglund Construction, Chicago, Illinois] because of this thing I was telling you about with the Muntu--not Muntu--the eta project [eta Creative Arts Foundation, Chicago, Illinois] where we won the construction management for a project they were not able to get funded yet and they wanted us to team with Berglund. So, Berglund had a lot of work at the University of Chicago. So, we went there because the university wanted to see diversity on every construction team. And so we went after a small assignment with Berglund and they liked the way that his project manager had planned the job so well, that they asked us to be the construction managers for the renovation of the law school library [D'Angelo Law Library, Chicago, Illinois], which was--turned out to be a $14 million project. And then they redid some things at Rockefeller Chapel [Rockefeller Memorial Chapel, Chicago, Illinois], and Berglund used us to meet the minority goals on that.
Story_ID: 619580
Speaker 1: What kind of civic organizations are you involved in or charitable organizations?
Speaker 2: Well, I used to be on Advocate Hospital's charitable foundation [Advocate Charitable Foundation], but I've found that I just didn't have--I was on their board for a couple of years, but I just--I found that I had to withdraw because I didn't have the time. And you know, I'm involved with my church [Greater Harvest Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois]. And I'm still a board member of BCU [Black Contractors United], that's a more trade organization. And I guess I've paid my membership dues with AIA, American Institute of Architects, that sort of thing. And I've served on some state boards, I'm still a member of the Employment Security Advisory Board. The statute requires that there be public and business and labor members that advise on, you know, the unemployment fund and job creation and training and that sort of thing. And I was appointed to that board by, by Edgar [Jim Edgar] and I've been reappointed. That's a quarterly type of thing. And I've spent some time on the Illinois Capital Development Board, but that goes back a ways, that was from '99 [1999] to 2002.

Speaker 1: Since 9/11 [September 11, 2001], security concerns have been a big priority, particularly in public buildings. How's that affected architecture and some of the things that you do?
Speaker 2: Well in many cases, you know, they, they--they're more security oriented, you know, like the renovation that we're doing at O'Hare [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois], they're much stickier about the background checks of people who are badged to go on the air side. If you work at O'Hare field, you, you, you get a security badge that allows you to go, you know, and work beyond the security checkpoints. And if I remember years ago when I was involved with the O'Hare Development Program, it wasn't as rigorous a background check as it is now. You know, you're fingerprinted and everything, it takes longer for them to, to approve you. In the buildings it's primarily just that, you know, they're looking at security systems. Also we proposed three times with, with a team that we led and didn't win because, I guess, they were really looking for people who were low balling it, because it was like a price proposal. And this we proposed as an architect engineer. The county [Cook County, Illinois] wants to harden all of their facilities so they wanna put these kind of of, these bollards to keep people from driving into the building. They wanna adjust and add cameras. They wanted to do something with the, the security systems at the checkpoints and the entrance. And in order to bid the thing or submit proposals, you have to visit all of these county facilities, make a write up and do all that stuff. And we went after that two or three times, but the county wants to spend several million dollars doing that. And that's a project that probably wouldn't be there if it weren't for 9/11.

Speaker 1: Can you briefly tell us, say you got a project to build a hospital, what, what does that involve in terms of your planning and processing, and you know?
Speaker 2: Well, with a hospital what happens is, you know, once they get their certificate of need and all that kind of stuff, then you go into a big programming phase. And usually if they decided they want a hospital, they pretty much gettin- gotten a sense of how many beds they need and that sort of thing. But once that happens from the construction management and the architecture side, you work with the, the--all the various departments, you know, emergency medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, surgery, and then you deal with all of the ancillary services and you meet with all of those people, and you have focus groups for all those people and you plan the design of it. Now if the construction manager is on board early, the construction manager is involved in that. Just like we were involved with all the focus groups when Colin Powell [Colin Powell Middle School, Matteson, Illinois] was built. They had a focus group that included the educators and the department people and everything. And so once that programming is, is done, you, you start to develop a little bit of information and, and, and review empirical data about what these things have cost in the past and you look at the market, and you try to give them some sense of what the projection or the cost model is gonna be. And then, they start to do schematics and then you begin to see the size of the thing, and they you start to say okay, it's a $200 a square foot or it's a 250 or it's a 210, or it's a $175 a square foot facility. And you tell the client, this is what you're looking at. Now, right now for this type of building there's an analysis done as to whether it should be a steel frame or a concrete frame. And that analysis is done on two bases, just pure outright cost and schedule. Because you can raise--if you get the timing right, the steel is gonna go up faster than concrete but it may cost less, it depends on a number of factors. And so all of that analysis is done on the front end and often times they say in the industry that the most successful projects are the projects that have the most rigorous, thorough planning before you put a shovel in the ground. And then you know there's gonna be something different from the plan, but you anticipated a lot more and you have a very thorough understanding of what you're going to do. Because once you start to construct it, you don't wanna change your mind in midstream because it start to cost you money, starts to cost you time, and the combination of both is--all means money, and also it means something to when you gonna have use of the facility. So that process is, is, is how, how it develops. And if it's in the minority community or there is diversity goals, once the planning and the programming is far enough downstream and you're getting close, 'cause you don't wanna stir up the community and then have a year before yo- they see any jobs. But then you have to start to deal with okay what's out there in the community in terms of diversity and minority jobs, and you have to focus how you buy the project on that, if you're sincere about really en- enhancing minority participation. And you know, from that point it's, it's really just supervising the construction.
Speaker 1: At some point you gotta bring in all the trade people and engineers and all that kind of stuff, how do you go about choosing those type of people?
Speaker 2: Well the--depending on if it's a hospital or a school or what have you in, in this current market, you know, there's--people are very competitive, where you might have six bids, now you've got ten, fifteen, twenty on, on some trades. So you want to, in some cases, depending on the type of job, if it's a private job, you can prequalify. And on that basis you go out and you have people, contractors and businesses, submit their credentials or they fill out a form, you know, this is--you know, this is where--what we do, this is some examples of what we do and that sort of thing. And then you evaluate that. And then you come back and you invite people to bid. If it's a public job that requires that you set the complete documents for people and you advertise, then sometimes you can put in there that you don't want a bid from somebody who doesn't have five years' experience putting in medical gas systems. And you can do that. But for the most part then you gonna get whatever the market comes and gets you and, and that's how you choose. If it's private, you prequalify and you select, and then you price and negotiate.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you have to negotiate with all the subcontractors at this point?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 619583
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we haven't talked about that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: You talked about a lot. I just appreciate, you know, the project, the program that you're doing. I think that a lot of this kind of thing is helpful to young people, as well as other African American people who are getting into their career to kind of get a sense that okay this is a person, this is how they did it, they did it in spite of some things, and they did it because of some other things. And I think the--this type of information and history is gonna be very useful for, for folks, and particularly people of color, you know, coming along. I think that it's extremely important for us to train our young people in two areas, one, what every career or skill they, they wanna develop, okay. But really ahead of that is to have a sense of, of integrity and work ethic that I think is, is lacking out there in some respects. And the other thing is, which for some reason seems to be getting a little bit worse is the ability to communicate clearly both spoken and written. It--you know, it's almost like a cliche, but it seems like our people--young folks are having a lot of trouble with that.
Story_ID: 619584
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as a person with, with, with integrity who always tried to do what he said he was gonna do, you know, and who helped other people, and particularly young people and give them an opportunity and give them some, some mentoring as to what it means to be somebody like me or somebody in my realm of, of, of a career in the industry. I would like to be remembered for having tried to do that.
Story_ID: 619585
Speaker 1: Something similar, what would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well two things. One is I would like for people to know that a guy like me did the things that I did, and two, that I tried to convey that to some young people who, who look like me. It's probably the same thing, said in another way.
Speaker 1: Okay. We'll we're gonna wrap up with, with that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much for your time.
Speaker 2: Thank you, it was a pleasure.
Story_ID: 619586
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a golf outing where a lot of the contractors were invited by Chicago Public Schools to support a worthy cause. But I, I like this one because I'm there with the gentleman on far left is Michael Scott [HistoryMaker Michael Scott, Sr.] at the time he was a vice president here at the company [Louis Jones Enterprises, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], he's got a master's [degree] from Tulane [Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana] in architecture. The gentleman next to him is Michael Jones [Michael C. Jones] who is a vice president here at, at one point and then he left to go to bigger things. And Mike Jones was a, a, has a degree in engineering from one of the eastern schools [Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]. And one of my best friend, Ernest Brown, is on my left and that's why I wanted--that was the one I told you helped me get that job when I needed to get married and pay off college, and he's a contractor and an architect and we went to school together.
Speaker 2: That's me at Hartigan Elementary School [Edward Hartigan Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]. I'm doing a principal for a day.
Speaker 1: Is it named after Neil F. Hartigan or?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: He ran for governor.
Speaker 2: Probably, probably is, it's on State Street. I'm not sure if that school is even still open.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's me standing in front of parliament in Pretoria, South Africa. I went there in 1996 on business with a friend of mine.
Speaker 1: That's me and--the three gentlemen that are of color there are all South African engineers, the white gentleman is French Canadian. And we're standing on the ground in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa and these gentlemen were planning an airport called the--you know, named after one of the Zulu kings [King Shaka International Airport]. That was in '96 [1996].
Speaker 2: Same trip, me and (unclear), he's an official with the African National Congress [ANC], who was--we were consulting with about getting the, getting--to take part in the airport in KwaZulu Natal.
Speaker 1: The gentleman in Flossmoor [Illinois] that I knew said that I set the standard for giving the wife a fiftieth birthday party, and that's what this picture is.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Tell us your wife's name.
Speaker 2: Oh Barbara [Barbara M. Jones] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, that's Barbara and I, we had a party for our, our employees at our twentieth anniversary of being in business.
Speaker 2: That's Barbara and I with most of our employees at the time, at our twentieth business anniversary.
Speaker 1: Oh that's just me cavorting with my two daughters [Camiria Jones and Lynnea Jones] at home. Probably a Mother's Day or something like that.
Speaker 2: Okay this since a Christmas with me and part of my extended family. That's my father [Arthur Jones] on the far left, my sister next to him, my wife's mother, my daughter, my wife's sister and her, her daughter, my niece, that's my wife, Barbara, there in the red and my son in the white color and I'm on the far right with the husbands of a couple of the sisters. That's, that's Christmas about, say seven years ago, seven, eight years ago.
Speaker 1: Barbara and I attended the inauguration of Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] and that's a picture from that.
Speaker 2: We held a fundraiser at our house for [HistoryMaker] Bobby Rush, it was his second term in office. I was on his finance committee. And that's me and Barb and one of his campaign people, and my son and my two daughters.
Speaker 1: That's the whole family at Dunn's River Falls in Jamaica. Langston [Jones' son, Langston Jones] looks like he's about eight, ten years old, so that had to be nineteen years ago, something like that.
Speaker 2: That's a very old picture. Tom Pado was a, an associate at Skidmore, Owings and Merrill [Skidmore, Owings and Merrill LLP, Chicago, Illinois], and he sailed on Lake Michigan and he used to take the crew that worked on the drawings and stuff, I was telling you guys about, out once a year sailing. That's us.
Speaker 1: That's me standing outside of the Chicago Stadium [Chicago, Illinois] at the commencement in 1973 when I graduated from UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: That's me and Barb and my two daughters, Camiria in the robe there has just received her, her Ph.D. in psychology at University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] and that's about, say that's about eight years ago.
Speaker 1: And this is when Barb and I got married in 1972.
Speaker 2: We had a few days to go to New York [New York] and so that's us in the Rockefeller Center area in New York or--I think or the UN [United Nations Headquarters, New York, New York] I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: We were interviewed by the Oak Leaves newspaper as a new family in Oak Park [Illinois]. And that was about 1979, something like that.
Speaker 2: That's me and my survey party chief. He's explaining to me something about the elevation of the structural steel at McCormick Place South [McCormick Place South Building, Chicago, Illinois]. That's about '91 [1991], '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: That's Barb and I on vacation in Jamaica, taking a boat ride. Oh gosh that, that's probably somewhere around '95 [1995], '98 [1998] somewhere in there.
Speaker 2: And that's another picture of us at the fundraiser we held for Bobby Rush at our home, his second term in office.
Speaker 1: That's me and my son at his graduation party when he got his bachelor's [degree] from Columbia College [Columbia College Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: That's me (laughter) at Paradise Lake in Michigan, bass fishing, which is something I really like to do when I get a chance. About, about three or four years ago, my son's driving the boat.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's me and [HistoryMaker] Eugene Sawyer when he was, you know, campaigning. Might have been a BCU [Black Contractors United] dinner or it might have been one of his campaign fundraisers, I don't remember exactly.
Speaker 1: About 1991, I guess or '90 [1990]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's at the same affair with [HistoryMaker] Larry Huggins and I, we were talking after that.
Speaker 2: That's me when I was about four. This was a picture that a lot of families took in--on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], there was a photographer on King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive]. So that--that picture is fifty-nine years old.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's me in various stages. The one on the lower left is a high school picture. The one on the upper left is me with my father and the rest of my family at the ballpark in Comiskey Park [Chicago, Illinois] when I was about eight. And the lower right, I'm standing in the park across from the United Nations when Barb and I went to New York for our honeymoon. And that's just a self portrait of me from when I was in college.
