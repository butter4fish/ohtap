Speaker 1: All right, now, you're John Lassiter, Jr., right?
Speaker 2: I'm John Lassiter, Jr. or the third (laughter). That's because my granddaddy was John Lassiter, he died before I was born.  So, my dad took over the word senior, and I became the junior.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my mama [Ethel Lassiter] put down the third on my school records (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you're known basically just now as John Lassiter, right?
Speaker 2: John Lassiter, right.

Story_ID: 191515
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions we always ask--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, they just require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: May favorite food?  My favorite food is chocolate anything (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm a chocoholic (laughter).
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I love the spring--the summertime in Chicago [Illinois].  I'm a sailor.  I have a sailboat and I wanna be on the Lake Michigan during the summertime.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Blue is my favorite color, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes. Caribbean.  Just got back Sunday night; go there every week if I could.  It's awesome.  Particularly in the wintertime when you go sailing, we went on a tall ship, went on small ships, it's just incredible.  So inexpensive, gone for three weeks--two weeks, two weeks this time, two weeks this time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I certainly do have a favorite phrase and saying.  It's one that my good friend, [HM Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson has co-opted from me, and taken and made it into a whole PUSH Excel program [PUSH for Excellence, Inc.].  And, he took it from me when we were together down in Puerto Rico back in 1973 when I was sent down there by the board because I was a trusted colleague.  But, I'm not gonna talk a whole bunch of political stuff with him at the time.  And my phrase is, you can achieve anything you want to that you can conceive of.  You can achieve anything that you want to, if you can conceive of it and earnestly work toward it.
Story_ID: 191516
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask you about your family history--
Speaker 2: Yes, please do.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family.  And, we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Ethel A. Walker.  Ethel Alma Walker.  W-A-L-K-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was May 23, 1916.
Speaker 1: Alright.  And, where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Cheryl, Arkansas [sic]--Merrill, Arkansas, Merrill, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Merrill.
Speaker 2: Right outside of Pine Bluff [Arkansas].
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: M-E-R-R-I-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right outside of Pine Bluff, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, what do you know about her side of the family.  I mean, in terms of lineage, how far back can you trace them first of all?
Speaker 2: Very little.  She literally escaped Arkansas and never went back.  When she left in 1930, she never--1931, she never went back to Arkansas.  Don't even wanna bring the word up of Arkansas, never even could get her to talk about it.  She died this past March and without ever revealing to us what it was that was so traumatic about Arkansas that kept her from ever thinking about going back to it.  She has half-brothers and sister, who periodically have gone back, but they say very little too.  It's been a real mystery about what happened in her life before she came to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: So, you don't have a really a clue of what--
Speaker 2: Not a clue.
Speaker 1: Or why?
Speaker 2: The only thing we know is that Aunt Eth--she was named after her Aunt Ethel, who was a school teacher.  And who lived on a hill in a lovely, lovely home, that the land was stolen by some folks.  And, when she came to Chicago some things they remember, that they remember.  Yeah, that's as far back it goes.  It's a mystery.
Speaker 1: That might be enough to make you wanna move if your land is stolen by someone.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, that might be-
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah. 'Cause right after she moved up here, then she got her sister to come up here.  And then her half-brothers came up here after that.  So, they all left there and came up here then, a year after--of course, that's during the heart of the [Great] Depression too.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  Well, so she had some half-brothers and sisters.
Speaker 2: One sister and one half, and about three or four half-brothers.
Speaker 1: Was she able to go to school in Arkansas when she was there?
Speaker 2: No.  She had to come here to go to school.  She went to, she went to school at nighttime here at Wendell Phillips [Academy] High School [Chicago, Illinois].  Then, she went to business college at nighttime.  She was the first black women to be a secretary at the Department of Public Aid [later, the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services].  Can you believe that (laughter)?  They had no black people working at the Department of Public Aid, you know.  She was the first secretary of the rehab.  She was a secretary for thirty-five years at the rehabilitation and welfare, rehabilitation department of the Public Aid, Cook County Department of Public Aid.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she arrived in Chicago when she was about fifteen, I guess?
Speaker 2: About fifteen, yeah.
Speaker 1: Fifteen years old.  And, then she went through Phillips.  So, she had some grade school training before--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  She had grade school there in Arkansas.
Speaker 1: And, her aunt was a teacher, you said?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: That's significant.  Okay.  Well, so on that side of the family, you really don't have much--
Speaker 2: Not very much of anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 191517
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now, that side I have a whole lot.
Speaker 1: Can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  John Lassiter, Sr., and he's still alive; eighty-eight years old now.  And, he was born and raised in Tuskegee, Arkansas [sic.].  And, over the last--
Speaker 1: Tuskegee, Arkan--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Tuskegee, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  Tuskegee, Alabama.  And, he was taught through the sixth grade there and then he came to Chicago [Illinois] to go to the rest of the schooling.  And, after he got up here, his daddy died.  Shortly after that, he had to go back to Arkansas.  I mean, back to Alabama where he was the head guy in the family.  And, as a result he was responsible for plowing the land and making sure that he fed his younger sisters and brothers until they got old enough to get back to Chicago.  About twelve years--the head of the family, at twelve years old.  Can you imagine that?  Can you imagine being responsible for feeding your brother--for making sure that your brothers and sisters get enough food to eat by plowing the land and by picking the cotton.  And, then after he got them old enough to get on up here, then he came back up here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm asking--
Speaker 2: Can you imagine, can you imagine being head of the family at twelve years old?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Does he talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Often, often.
Speaker 1: I mean, what that was--what does he say about that?  How did he feel? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He said that his father, his father put him in charge.  His father--his older brother, Bill Lassiter was already grown and married.  And, he didn't want his older brother to have--he had his own family.  He didn't want--he told my daddy, my daddy's dad told my daddy that if anything happened to him, he would have to be in charge because he was young enough to still be able to work and take care of the family.  And take care of his mother and make sure that the young, young siblings could get through the--through their life--through the early years, and that was his job, and he took--and he accepted it.
Speaker 1: Now, did they have property in Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: At the--that's interesting, last--while we were gone to Antigua, my brother went to bury my cousin who was in the last house that we had down there in Tuskegee.  She just died while I was gone.  He went down to officiate the funeral; he's a minister--officiate the funeral.  And yeah, he just--so, it was one house left there in Tuskegee.  But, my dad also spent a lot of time of our youth and adulthood explaining to us about what it was to respect people.  Because he had--he was taught a lesson early on in his life by George Washington Carver.  Who was a very close friend of his school teacher, who was a one room school teacher, you know, she taught all grades.  And, he came--and George Washington Carver came to the schoolroom one day.  And, they--and the kids snickered when he came in the door 'cause he had baggy pants, and holey shoes on.  And, so he started talking, he started talking, of course they were mesmerized.  And, the entire day they were just up like this here, mesmerized by his incredible skill at communicating.  And, after he left of course, the teacher just said kinda, the teacher just kinda read them the riot act and blessed them out.  And, from that point on, daddy say, never, ever, ever look at somebody and make a judgment on how they--who they were, how they looked.  And, that he learned his lesson the hard way, by being a fool, by laughing at George Washington Carver.  And, so he taught us those basic principles of how to deal with people.
Speaker 1: Now, you father was born in 1915, right?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifteen, right.  Right.
Speaker 1: He was born the year that Booker T. Washington died.
Speaker 2: That right, that's right.  And, when we would go back to Tuskegee, of course, that was ritual, we would go to Booker T. Washington's--they had a, like a library, like a home, where he would study and stuff, his books and stuff.
Speaker 1: Right.  Yes.
Speaker 2: And, we went back there.  We would go to George Washington Carver's lab.  We would--we grew up knowing those two guys as our heroes, you know.  It wasn't 'til recent years that I knew that there was any controversy about Booker T. Washington in terms of his attitude about, you know, working in trades and stuff, you know.  And, but as far as I was concerned, when I was growing up, those were two of my sure enough close up heroes, was Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver.  Very stimulating people to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Knew everything about them.
Story_ID: 191518
Speaker 1: Do you have any information about or did you hear any stories from your family about life during Reconstruction--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Or the Civil War or slavery?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father [John Lassiter Sr.], my father's father [John Lassiter] had eleven--my father's father's father--that would be my great-grandfather, had eleven brothers, eleven brothers.  And they were all from the North Carolina area.  And, every time I see a Lassiter now that I meet, any place in this country, I ask them, "Do you have heritage in North Carolina (laughter)?  And most of them--almost all of them do, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, let me interject this, when I was doing research for this interview, the only John Lassiter that kept popping up on the internet was a white politician from Charlotte [North Carolina] named John Lassiter.
Speaker 2: Is that--you gotta be kidding me, man (laughter).
Speaker 1: No.  I'll show you.
Speaker 2: Oh, my God.  Oh, that's incredible.  Well, anyway North Carolina is where--and we, we got confirmation of that from a lady at the PUSH [People United to Save Humanity], no it wasn't PUSH Conven--it was the, it was the, the Black--Congressional Black Caucus in Washington.  This lady was a Lassiter who was from North Carolina and who had done research herself, and archives and everything.  And, had attested to his particular location, I think was Williamson--Williamsburg or something like that, North Carolina, near the coast of course.  And, it's (unclear) that's where we all came from, by way of the ship of Sierra Leone is where we came from.  Sierra Leone to Williamsburg, to North Carolina and that's down in Florida, Arkansas, and up to New Jersey.  A lot of Lassiters in New Jersey.  A lot of cousins in New Jersey.  As a matter of fact, it was one cousin, we've adopted each other about forty years ago, and he's a Jimmy Lassiter, former president of the National Dental Association, good friend of mine.  He's flying, and every time we see the Lassiter that he knows about, "Hey that's your cousin brother, that's your cousin brother" (laughter), you know.  So yes, we have a lot of connections with a historical past.  We think it was Sierra Leone.
Speaker 1: That's something.  Is any of your history written anywhere?  Any of your relatives--
Speaker 2: No.  My brother [Herbert Lassiter] has an assignment, as we speak, to--not only is he writing an oral history of my daddy's life, he's also helping a person over at Montgomery Place do a written history.  Because they are doing a history of all the people who are residences of Montgomery Place.  Montgomery Place is a senior citizen continuing care retirement community right near the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] over there at 55th, 5550 South South Shore Drive.  And, this guy Lang [ph.] is doing a written history of what's happening.  So, my brother was doing an oral history and written history.  Hopefully, we'll be getting more information on the Lassiters because of my brother's effort.  He's a writer also in addition to being a preacher--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's a writer.  He's trying to get, get to the bottom of this.  The lady we met in--we lost contact with the lady we met at the Congressional Black Caucus who had done some research that we haven't been able to hook up with yet.  But, maybe he got something he gonna tell me about when he--'cause he just came back from Tuskegee [Alabama] burying Aunt Edith.  So, I gotta find out what he got when he was down there.  I haven't talked with him yet.  My wife [Rosielyn Lassiter] talked to him yesterday.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 191519
Speaker 1: Now, were there any stories from the Civil War or Reconstruction that they told at all?  Any that's passed down?
Speaker 2: Only one that I vividly remember is the one that cousin Ed talked about when--I don't--I can't--I don't know the period of time.  I think it was before, it was right after Plessy-Ferguson [Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896] what's that decision when they, when they said that Jim Crow was okay?
Speaker 1: In 1890s, yeah.
Speaker 2: Eighteen--yeah.  It was right after that that cousin Ed said the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] came into the neighborhood.  And, they were surprised because they had the Utleys [ph.] and the Lassiters, and others had gotten their shotguns together and they had blown the caps off of all the Ku Klux Klan guys that came through there that day.  And they never came back, never came back.  But, they said they did it from underneath the porches and the bushes and everything.  They never came back.  So, he proudly talks about how he got the Ku Klux Klan to never come back to the neighborhood ever again.  And, so that's something I know specifically.  Cousin Ed, when he told me that, he was around ninety-some years old and he was, he was very, very clear about what had happened.  I mean, it was many years before that of course.
Speaker 1: I guess there were many years that people couldn't talk about that happening.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Even though it did happen.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  No question about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, right--
Story_ID: 191520
Speaker 1: In terms of your father's [John Lassiter Sr.] story--now, when did he come back to Chicago [Illinois] after he had had all that responsibility?
Speaker 2: He was--right.  After he got all the kids up and gone, he was back here.  Well a year before he met my mama [Ethel Walker Lassiter], so that had to be, he was about eighteen I guess, nineteen, about nineteen years old when he came back to Chicago.  So, '34 [1934], in '34 [1934], yeah, he came back in '34 [1934] and--
Speaker 1: It's like seven years after he started--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was nineteen when came back.  And, he'd gotten everybody else in school up here, you know, and then he was able to come back.  It was the funniest things, Aunt Nettie, whose house he stayed in with us and grandmama, she said that Sonny would never make a good cotton picker.  You got this barrel--he had, you know, he had so much land that he had to pick.  And, he had--and he'd sell the cotton with (unclear) and you get so much money for it.  And, he took care of his responsibilities with the money he got for it.  She said, "Now that you got this extra money, you buy yourself a suit and use it on the train to go to Chicago (laughter).  'Cause you'll never make a living down here."  'Cause she could still out-pick my daddy.  She was--she had her own family to raise, plus she was raising my daddy's siblings, you know.  So, anyway, so yeah, he often speaks about that.
Speaker 1: So (laughter), so, he came up at age nineteen and what did he do when he got here?
Speaker 2: Incredible.  Labor, labor.  Then he got--then he started making breaks happen for him and a long history, but I could make it kinda short.  He went from labor to the president of the labor union at the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen, Local 100, and chairman of the pension committee.  And, the--and he got three pensions when he retired, plus the one I sold to him.  So, it was four pensions altogether when he retired.  He's living now at Montgomery Place [Chicago, Illinois] which was built for retired professors at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], whose incomes were in the top five percent.  His income is in the top one percent of senior citizens at eighty years old.  He has over $60,000 a year coming in, of income, just for him every year because of his pensions that he had.  Back when he was a kid, when he was a young struggling labor union leader, he fought to get pensions rather than another penny increase in salary.  His vision and foresight was just beyond his years and it's just incredible.  He retired at age seventy and just has been an absolute dignity since then and before then too.  You know, just incredible, incredible self-made man.
Speaker 1: Since eighteen years ago, he's been--he retired--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.  Exactly, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.
Speaker 2: Phenomenal, phenomenal ability to have.  And, all the years that he--what he'd do--that's what he did professionally, but what he'd, what he'd really do at Monumental Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois], he was chairman of the deacon board.  He was chairman of the trustee board.  He was a Boy Scout [Boy Scouts of America] leader.  He was a Cub Scout leader.  He sang in the choir for sixty years.
Story_ID: 191521
Speaker 1: And, he [Lassiter's father, John Lassiter Sr.] introduced my brother [Herbert Lassiter] and I to all sorts of movers and shakers in America, who became our mentors and our force for--that's why I'm in the insurance business.  I was ten years old when I met the president of Supreme Life Insurance Company who sang in our choir, W. Ellis Stewart.  And, W. Ellis Stewart was a deacon who chose my daddy to be the treas--president, the head of the deacon board.  He's a learned man with graduate degrees; chose my daddy to be the president of the deacon board, I mean, you know, just--William H. Robinson was a state legislator.  He's the one who gave my brother a scholarship to go to the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois] for four years, because he was able to go on scholarship.  I was able--they had to pay for me (laughter) to go down there and graduate too.  But, they had to pay for me, 'cause I didn't get a scholarship.  But, I mean, what my daddy introduced us to at Monumental [Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] was just phenomenal.  That's what is missing in the communities today, we don't have the whole community in one location.  'Cause segregation kept us all in one location, you know, one neighborhood.  Today, we got low-income folks out there, upper class over there, and moderate class over here, and the poor class all together right there and it's just--
Speaker 2: It hard to meet somebody--
Speaker 1: Hard to meet somebody from a different class--
Speaker 2: From a different class than lives in your neighborhood.
Speaker 1: To strive you, to cause you to grow, to grow higher and taller.  But, my dad just insists that we well have, a hobby, an activity--thought we were rich.  We were poor as a church mouse.  We thought we were rich.  We would go--every time Marian Anderson come to town, we were at Civic [Opera] House, first ones at the Civic Opera House.  Paul Robeson come to sing, we was at--we saw Paul Robeson sing.  [HM Reverend] Gardner Taylor preaching, we saw Gardner Taylor preaching at the [Chicago] Sunday Evening Club, at Orchestra Hall.  I mean, there's nothing we didn't, we did not experience that was culturally rich--enrichment--enriching.  He always sang the 'Messiah' himself and he was a lover of great classical and good music, you know.  Hardly knew what doo wop was, 'cause he always had us learning about what'd Marian Anderson sing, what'd Paul Robeson sing, you know, what Nat King Cole was singing.  It was never, never learned the little hippy do stuff, you know.  'Cause my daddy was guiding us to what we should be thinking about in terms of our preferences for life.  He also made sure that we had Sunday, Sunday morning dinner--Sunday dinner, dinner at church--at home.  Our teenage years, dating some girl, if she didn't show up with us on Sunday after church, she didn't exist.  'Cause you have to bring 'em home after church on Sunday.  She going out with you, we gotta meet, 'cause the whole issue is that if you make a mistake and you get--you gotta date only those girls who you're gonna marry.  Don't just date anybody.  You gotta date somebody who fits.  So, the girl--if you didn't bring somebody home and you're tipping off with her, you better be expecting a strapping because you--that was dangerous, you know.  But, he was very clear about certain things and we kind of toed the line, for the most part (laughter).
Story_ID: 191522
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your early years.  What's your first memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Listening to, listening to the--Joe Louis on a Philco radio on the corner of 6041 Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  I was four years old listening to him knock out, well he knocked out Max Schmeling or somebody.  And, watch the whole neighborhood just jump up and down and shouting about him being the world champion.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Very much so.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.  Joe Louis was a big deal--(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Oh, man.  Big time.  Plus he live, plus he lived in Chicago, you know, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what.  Now, how many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: Just my brother [Herbert Lassiter].
Speaker 1: Just your brother?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, your brother is older than you, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Eighteen months--seventeen months older.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you're right together pretty much?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Or, real close.
Speaker 2: Um-hm--
Story_ID: 191523
Speaker 1: Tell me about the neighborhood you grew up in and your experiences.  What were the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, we learned that the--that regardless of what we did in school, we had to do something on Saturdays.  Which means we had to go to Hall Branch Library [Chicago, Illinois].  And, if daddy [John Lassiter, Sr.] couldn't take us, mother [Ethel Walker Lassiter] couldn't take us, then cousin Edith took us who just died.  My brother [Herbert Lassiter] just went down and buried her.  Or, cousin Helen took us, or cousin Jay took us down to the Hall Branch Library at 49th and Michigan [Avenue].  We lived at 6041 Michigan.  And, Hall Branch Library is where they had black history being taught.  As a matter of fact, that collection is now out at 95th [Street] and Halsted [Avenue].  But, Hall Branch Library is where you go for enlightenment because you didn't get black history taught at the schools.  So, to learn black history, you had to go to Hall Branch Library.
Speaker 1: Now, was Vivian Harsh at that Library then?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Right.
Speaker 1: And, do you remember anything about her?
Speaker 2: We sat there and we had stories on Saturday mornings.  We had--some kids would go to the movies and see the--Amo Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] and look at movies and film clips and we had to go to the library because that's where we get the real stories of what's happening in black America--what happened in black America, what happened in our history.  And so, we would just--that's what we did on Saturday mornings.  We didn't go to the theater on Saturday morning, like other kids did.  We just didn't do that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, most kids, they--a lot of young people today, you know, watch cartoons on Saturday mornings.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right, I know.  That's what they did.  In our day, they took--they did at the Amo Theatre.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They didn't have nothing at home, so they do--go to the Amo Theatre, there on 61st Street.  We couldn't do that, we went to the library.  That's our ritual.  Automatic.  And then we also would go, after that we'd go to play--go to learn our lessons.  We had--we were taken Hawaiian guitar lessons by a brother by the name of Vale Burntson [ph.] at 49th, right down the street from Hall Branch, right there at King Drive, 49th [Street] and King Drive.  He us Hawaiian guitar.  We played--we played for fashion shows and tea (laughter), Hawaiian music and stuff, you know.  'Cause my daddy wanted us to always do something that was different and unexpected as opposed to the things that every other kid did, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, Hawaiian guitar was a sound that--
Speaker 2: That amplified, with an amplifier (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, it had a, had a particular sound with the pick--
Speaker 2: The pick.  We had to isolate it with this, with this little bar and then we'd pick it with our fingers.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  And, a lot of the blues musician were trying to play the blues guitar like, to make it sound like the Hawaiian guitar.  [HM] B.B. King, when he was here, he was saying that he was trying to achieve that sound on the, on his guitar.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my brother went on after we got through with playing Hawaiian guitar, he wanted us to learn the Spanish guitar, the regular guitar.  He played with Eddie (unclear) Harris.  Eddie "Exodus" Harris for a while before they started getting famous and everything.
Speaker 1: That's something.  So, can you still play the guitar?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  We gave our, we gave our guitars--when I started playing football, I dropped the guitar--football in high school, I dropped the guitar and gave it to our barber's son, who now is a professor of music at Blue Island High School [later Dwight D. Eisenhower High School, Blue Island, Illinois].  And, he has a Ph.D. in music and he has--he started with our Hawaiian guitar.  We just passed it on to him, and now his kid has it, has the same Hawaiian guitar.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was passed on to somebody who could use it.
Story_ID: 191524
Speaker 1: Now what kind of kid were you, when you were growing up [in Chicago, Illinois]?  What kind of young man were you?  What were you thinking about, and what was your personality like?  Did you have a lot of friends, or not, I mean?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I was kinda popular in school.  I was captain of the patrol boys, and I was a school--very active as a spokesperson and different things in elementary school.  High school I was a campus leader; played football, on the National Honor Society [NHS].  In high school, I was a--played Hawaiian guitar for the carnivals of course, and played track and field, ran the 440 [440-yard dash].  And, running back and defensive halfback in football, and 440 and 220 [220-yard dash] in--on the track team.  And, we belonged to a group called the Villains.  And, the Villains were an athletic gang (laughter).  All of us were athletes in football, high school, I mean, football--college, I mean, football, cross country, track and field, baseball, and basketball at Parker High School [later Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois].  It was not many of us at Parker at the time.  Parker became Roberson as years went by.  But, very active, had a lot of friends.  Dated, dated very seriously early on.  Trying to get every little girl I could that would be okay to take home to my mamma [Ethel Walker Lassiter] and daddy [John Lassiter Sr.] on Sunday afternoon, you know.  And, was lucky, very lucky, never got--never impregnated anybody, thank God.  And, got to college and was taught early on, if the girl is not college bound, then you don't go out with her, you know, so.  That's the way it was.

Speaker 1: Where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: Betsy Ross [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's right down the street from where--you're right where you lived; Betsy Ross.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In that neighborhood, I know you've got, like, St. Anselm's Catholic Church [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Next door.  I was right next door to St. Anselm's.  We lived at 6041 Michigan [Avenue].  St. Anselm's rectory was right next door to us.  And, St. Edmund [Episcopal Church, Chicago, Illinois] on the corner--
Speaker 1: Right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: On 61st [Street] and--yeah, right.
Speaker 1: So, a lot of black power brokers in and out of St. Edmunds and St. Anselm's, so.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  Big time.  Big time.  Serious, serious, powerful organization there.  Still is, as a matter of fact, Reverend Tolliver [HM Father Richard L. Tolliver] is doing an awesome job of revitalizing that community, called Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] now.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  But, did--you went to church at Monumental [Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois]?  Right?
Speaker 2: Monumental.  Yes.  We took--
Speaker 1: Baptist, right?
Speaker 2: We took, we call those, you know, car, we took, it was a jitney in those days.  We took a jitney to church in those days.  Occasionally, we'd get a bus, but primarily we'd get in a jitney.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, at Betsy Ross, who were the teachers that influenced you the most at Betsy Ross, if there were any--if any?
Speaker 2: One's whose funeral I went to just about, less than two months ago.  Her name was Miss Murray [ph.].  Miss Murray was the most awesome teacher that you ever wanna think about having.  She taught us music, officially.  But, she closed that door and taught us black pride, self-respect.  She taught us black history.  She taught us to enjoy the Hall Branch Library.  She taught us to say, "Yes, ma'am, no, ma'am."  And, taught us to take our hats off, and open the door for ladies.  And, she had an impact that was so powerful that when she died, there were--she retired twenty years ago, thirty years ago.  She had the biggest retirement party any teacher's ever had.  We all got together at 85th--87th [Street] and Dante [Avenue] or whereever the place was over there, and had a big retirement party for her.  I mean, Ed--I mean, Burrell, Burrell Advertising [sic, Burrell Communications Group], he was a couple of years behind me at Betsy Ross, and he was one of the leaders for getting us the big retirement party for Miss Murray.
Speaker 1: Tom Burrell [HM Thomas J. Burrell]?
Speaker 2: Tom Burrell, yeah.  And, a whole bunch of others.  Just incredible person for us.
Story_ID: 191526
Speaker 1: --Talking about when we were in elementary school [Betsy Ross Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], my brother [Herbert Lassiter] and I, our mission was to get enough money to buy a house.  Because my daddy [John Lassiter Sr.] had this goal that we wanna buy a house.  And so, we had a piggy bank at home and we would take our monies home after we worked every day and put the money in the piggy jar.  And, so my brother and I sold, every Friday, it was a weekly, it wasn't a weekday, it was a weekly at that time.  Every Friday we'd get our supply of [Chicago] Defenders from the Defender store up there on 61st Street.  We go up to 63rd and King Drive and sell the guys who were going to the steel mills.  It was a bus would take us straight to the steel--a nonstop bus by 63rd and King Drive.  It was a little thing there.  And, we would go there and sell those Defenders out in the morning and come back after school and sell 'em again to the guys who were coming home from the steel mills.  Made enough money to put in our little piggy jar to contribute to the buying of our first home.  And, daddy and mother [Ethel Walker Lassiter] told us it was very substantial at that time.  Now, I don't know how much it really was (laughter).  But, we felt we were definitely apart of this--
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: Going--a part of this buying of our first home at 68th and Anthony [Avenue].  And so, for about five years we did that.  We were from eight to twelve years old, I guess, eight to thirteen years old.
Speaker 2: How much did Defenders go for then?
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know, a nickel.  Probably a nickel, two cents.  Probably a nickel, I don't remember.  Probably a nickel, probably.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so.
Speaker 1: But, we--they would give us tips, man.  These guys would tip us in the evening after they come home from the steel mills.  It was payday!  You see, don't forget, Fridays was payday.  And, these guys would come home and give us--they'd give us twice as much money as the paper cost.  'Cause we kept our papers clean and fresh, you know, some guys would, trying to compete with us, they would have their papers just looking any old kinda way.  And, we'd have, we'd have nice back and keep 'em fresh and clean, regardless of what the weather was and we would always sell out our papers, man.  It was an absolute must.  Well, I also had a little job at the Freddie Store there on the corner of 61st and King Drive--and Michigan [Avenue] to help them stock the shelves there.  This is child labor laws, you know, they didn't exist then (laughter).  I mean, I guess they did exist but nobody really cared, you know.  So, we would go in there and stock the shelves and--at the store there on Saturdays and Sun--I mean, on Sundays, for Mondays and stuff.  So, we had a little money to put in the piggy jar to save for our home.
Story_ID: 191527
Speaker 1: Now, what was your favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Math.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why my daddy [John Lassiter Sr.] wanted me to meet the president of Supreme Life Insurance Company [Chicago, Illinois], because, you know, the actuarial science.  I met an actuary.  I wanted to be an actuary when I first started talking about what I wanted to be in life.  I wanted to be an actuary.  Like I said, I wanna be a math teacher.  I wanna be teaching on this.  Be a principal, I wanna be a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Not a cowboy, or?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Spaceman or anything (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: No.  It was a lawyer.  Be a lawyer, doctor, schoolteacher, social worker.  I wanted to be an actuary.  'Cause I'd met an actuary.  I'd been with an actuary.  Like I said, the president of an insurance company was an actuary.  I loved math.  And so, it fitted, you know.  And so, my undergraduate degree was statistical economics.  Because that would lead me to become an actuary.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well tell me about high school.  Now, you went to--
Speaker 2: Parker High School [later Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Parker.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, unfortunately, I was not allowed to go to Englewood [Technical Prep Academy, Chicago, Illinois] with the rest of my classmates; Englewood or [Wendell] Phillips [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  My classmates went to Englewood or DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois] 'cause both way--we were divided up there.  But, when we moved to, we moved to Park Manor [Chicago, Illinois], my school switched to Parker.  So, I'm at Parker.
Speaker 1: Now, where was Parker?
Speaker 2: Sixty-eighth and Stewart [Avenue].  Right next to where Kennedy-King [College, Chicago, Illinois] is now.  As a matter of fact, the building still stands.  It's an administration building for a different--
Speaker 1: Right.  It's a huge smokestack on it or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Something like that.  But, I was a campus leader, very active.  I was a tutorer [sic]; Math tutorer [sic] for other kids.  I was a--my mother [Ethel Walker Lassiter] made sure I had the right curriculum.  When I first got to Parker, they put all black kids in shop classes.  My mama came to school the next day and had a sit-in at Thompson's.  The assistant principal name was Thompson [ph.].  Shine [ph.] was the principal.  The assistant principal was Thompson, had a sit-in in his office until she--until he saw her.  I sat there, right there with her.  She said, "My son is going University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois], and he's gonna take a prep--a college preparatory course here."  And she said, "He ain't gonna take no shop classes.  He's gonna take four years of math, four years of English, four years of social studies, four years of science, and he's gonna go to the University of Illinois."  And the language was, y'all make sure that happens.  And she's not leaving until they change my coursework.  I was so pride of my mama, I said, "Go mama, go mama," (laughter), you know.  But, she was just clear on that.  And, that's what happened.  That's exactly what happened.
Story_ID: 191528
Speaker 1: Well, at Parker [High School, later Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois], now you said you got involved in athletics before.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You played football--
Speaker 2: And, track--ran track and field.
Speaker 1: And, ran track.  Right.  You must have been pretty fast if you were--
Speaker 2: I was.  I was.  I was the starting running back in--on the varsity football.  And, I was 440 [440-yard dash] and 220 [220-yard dash] on the--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Two twenty that's a, you know.  Four forty--
Speaker 2: With 220 relay team.  It was up for--actually it was 880 [880-yard dash] relay; 220 apiece, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, 440 was the hardest race of all.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Never won anything with the 440.  I never got in that good of shape.  I should have gotten in better shape for 440.  I could still see that, that--I was at state [track and field championship] and, I could see that wind hit me as I made that last turn, I was in front.  And, by the time I got to the finished line, I was last (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's where they say the elephant jumps on your back, man, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, my God.  Boy!  You're telling me.  What a race, what a race.  But the 440, the 220, 880 relay team, we did real good.  We placed in the city.  We was number two or three in the city, I think.  We lettered in all those.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's something.  Okay.  So, how did Parker's team do for the most part?
Speaker 2: Very poor.  We were--they changed the division my last year, whereby the division--first year we competed against Fenger [Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and CVS [Chicago Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], and all the other big schools.  But, as we got--as a--try a bit more civilized, the small school competed against other small schools in the later years.  So, we had--we won a couple of games our last year.  We won against Englewood and Harper, 'cause we were small schools like they were.  But, it was just a great activity.  When I went to Champaign [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois], I told the coach, I said, "I think I should go out for the team."  He said, "Son, you're a little bit--you're too small."  He said, "Don't even think about it, you're too small."  (Laughter) I was 150 pounds, six feet, you know.  Just too small.  Don't think about it (laughter).  And, after I saw those guys over there on his team, I said, "I'm too small," (laughter).  I majored in volleyball, dawg (laughter) in Champaign [Illinois], you know.  But, we had a lot of fun with our social activities and very active with our academics.
Story_ID: 191529
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you're in National Honor Society--
Speaker 2: Yes.  National Honor Society, all four years.  And, getting in Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois] at that time, all you had to be was in the, be in the top quarter of your class, I think it was, to qualify you to go to the University of Illinois.  And, I was in the top quarter the whole time, so.
Speaker 1: Now, who were some of the teachers, or personalities at Harper that influenced you?
Speaker 2: At Parker [High School, later Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Parker rather.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: None.  None.  I don't think any of them had any significant factor on me.  I think what happened at Parker was that we grew to learn the value of each other.  It was a small cadre of black students who are still very close friends to this day.  TeeSee Hooks [HM Theresa Fambro Hooks], as a matter of fact, she writes for the Defender.  She was a couple years in front of me.  Velma and Thelma Brown, Selma Brown, Jerry Bell [ph.] was my mentor.  He was a senior and I was a freshman.  He went to Illinois.  I went to Illinois.  I mean, after that, we stayed good friends.  As a matter of fact, we--
Speaker 1: Now, Velma and Selma are educators, right?
Speaker 2: Velma and Selma?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Velma, and Selma, and Thelma; Thelma was a--Thelma and I were math tutors together at Parker.  But, the student--but, our students--we had such a cohesive group of black students that we are still, 'til this very day, are close friends.  And, that continued through college too.  I mean, we were--in college we stayed friends, even though we went to different colleges.  Many of us went to Illinois and CTC and stuff.  But, that support group was just very instrumental in my life.  I don't remember a teacher doing anything; other than Miss Odell [ph.], I'm sorry, Miss Odell.  Miss Odell, our English teacher, she had--she was from England, she had her own green sheet.  She didn't use the textbook.  She used her own green sheets.  I forgot about her--how could I forget about Miss Odell.  She was fantastic.  She made it so I could proficient, I could proficient English when I got to Illinois because she was so good.  I could proficient rhetoric rather when I got to Illinois 'cause she was so--
Speaker 1: So, she was from England--
Speaker 2: England, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, teaching English.
Speaker 2: Teaching English at Parker High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Anyone who went to Parker could tell you about Miss Odell.  She was just awesome.  And, she had a strong influence on our English, on the King's English, of course, my mom [Ethel Walker Lassiter] and dad [John Lassiter Sr.] did too when they--you didn't use slang at our house.  Not allowed to use slang.  If you use slang, you just (hitting himself in the mouth), that's right.  And, so she--they just loved Miss Odell.  And, we loved her dearly too, 'cause they loved Miss Odell.  And, I loved Miss Odell.  And, she taught us how to get to Illinois and not have to take the rhetoric--so many high school students from Chicago had the Rhetoric 100 for just a remedial course.  We proficiency 100 and 101.  I went to Rhetoric 102 in my freshman year because of Miss Odell.  Yeah.  She was awesome.  She was wonderful.  Yeah.  I forgot about her.  But, the rest of them were just ordinary teachers, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, they didn't take any particular interest in--
Speaker 2: No.  We had no personal relationships.  Other than the coaches, Coach O'Farrell, Coach Tobin, that's about it--
Story_ID: 191530
Speaker 1: Did you really feel that the black students were welcomed there [at Parker High School, later Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois]?  Or, did you--
Speaker 2: The racism that existed were more with the community than it was with the faculty and the students.  The community was so, was so strange at that time that you didn't do too much in the community.  You left to get the hell away from there.  After school, you'd go straight east, you know, the other side of the viaduct.  And, you didn't, you didn't hang around there.  My first semester, we had a race riot, at Parker.  And, race riot was not even gonna be--the police weren't even gonna come.  They were gonna attack the black students, but they weren't even gonna come until somebody had to go out there and call some of my friends from DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois], Dunbar [Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois], and [Wendell] Phillips [Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] traveled out there.  And, once they got there on the campus, all of a sudden policemen showed up, you know.
Speaker 1: So, you're saying that while the white students were attaching the black students--
Speaker 2: They were trying too.  They were going to--
Speaker 1: In the minority, there's no police were called.  But, when the tables turned, then the police showed.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  And, that was the first and last riot that existed there.  But, because they knew we had relationship with our communities back in the old neighborhoods.  And, that was enough to put the fear of God of those people, and they never came back to the campus.
Speaker 1: Where was the western border of the black community then?  In relationship to where--
Speaker 2: About State Street.
Speaker 1: Parker.  Okay.
Speaker 2: State Street.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you're a good--
Speaker 2: Between State--
Speaker 1: Like five or six blocks deep into--
Speaker 2: Between State and Prin--between State and the school, they may have been a sprinkle of black folks between State and Ashla [Ashland Avenue]--and the tracks there.  There may have been a sprinkle of black folks.  But, the community was not very welcoming.  The only people--only place in the community that you would go to, would be the little stores right there on the campus where Wilson Junior College [later Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] was and where Chicago Teachers College [later Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, there was a college environment around--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Parker.
Speaker 2: That was a safety net that we had also.
Speaker 1: Was the Wilson, Wilson becomes Kennedy-King College later.  And, then Chicago Teachers College becomes Chicago State University.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, they were all right there.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there anything remarkable about your senior year in high school that you could tell us?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, as a student advisor, not student advisor, as a tutorer [sic], as a math tutorer [sic], we were able to get some extra points and be heralded and be recognized as a campus leader.  In the yearbook they showed a handful of us as campus leader for doing the different things that we did.  So, it was the recognition that we received the last year.  The last three years, actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Of high school.  The--there are some white friends who beca--well not friends then but, because we're in the same industry, they became friends as time has gone by.  And, one of my former high school football, a guy--a matter of fact a guy who blocked for me, and I are in a study group together the last sixteen years.  We met at high school.  But, because of the segregation and racism at the time, we didn't have no relationship with no white folks.  I mean, they went that way, you went your way at the end of the day.  But, we're friends now and have been in the same study group.  We meet every quarter for the last sixteen years.  Yeah.  Tremendous kid.  Tremendous guy.  And, we never knew each other back in the neigh--we never go to know each other back when we were playing ball together, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in terms of your social life, your social life you--there wasn't, I take it there wasn't--did you go to the par--proms and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We did--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We did our thing.  Yeah.  We had a, we had a larger number of black women than there were black men.  So, we had a pickings (laughter).  Yeah, sure did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, everybody went to the same prom--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Sure.
Speaker 1: You didn't have a separate one for black (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: There was no separate.  No separate.
Speaker 1: None of that kinda thing?  Okay.  Well, I've heard stories where they've had (simultaneously)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I know.  I've heard about that.  Not at Parker though.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, our senior prom was at the same place where [Mayor] Harold Washington lived before he died.  That was the Sherry Hotel [Hotel Sherry].  On the top floor was a Sherry--the Sherry Hotel, was a ballroom up there.  5300 South Shore--South Hyde Park Boulevard; right east of Hyde Park Boulevard.  And, my girlfriend's name at the time was Sherry, so I took Sherry to the Sherry (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 191531
Speaker 1: Now when you graduated [from Parker High School, later Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois], did you get any special recognition?
Speaker 2: Well, being accepted in University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois] was enough.  But, I did get the National Honor Society recognition.  I got the caps leader recognition.  And, at graduation, I received some kind of, some kind of prize.  I forgot what it was, because of my athletic activity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, you knew you were going to the University of Illinois?  And,--
Speaker 2: From day one.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  From--okay.
Speaker 2: Since I was ten years old.
Speaker 1: And, now what year did you graduate?  It was--
Speaker 2: In '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954].  Okay.  And, okay now, what was the University of Illinois like?  When you--
Speaker 2: You know a lady's writing a book about the '50s [1950s] black Illini right now.  I got to refer her to you one day.  Her name was Sabrina Miller.  She's writing a book about what my parent went through back in the '50s [1950s].  It was so interesting, because to me it was a time when you--when I recognized two things down there.  Professors could not discriminate against you because they teach you the same thing they taught the white folks, you know.  So we, we never felt discriminated against by the professors, for the most part.  There were a couple of incidents that were kind of sad and pitiful.  But, for the most part it was no--we didn't feel it.  My advisor, Professor Neiswonger [ph.], a statistical economist, was gung ho for a handful of us who selected that curriculum.  It was seven of us in the entire business school selected that curriculum.  So, we were with him for like the whole--the last three years together.  And, so we were able to get guided pretty close to--we took the same classes.  We did--we went through a wonderful four years, four and half years for me.  The shock came when you graduated.
Speaker 1: You mean with, in terms of--
Speaker 2: Employers would come--
Speaker 1: What kind of job you could--
Speaker 2: Employers could come to Champaign [Illinois].  Because I selected such an incredible curriculum, selected numbers and gotten A's in that stuff.  I knew I was gonna be hired--be one of those exceptions hired in corporate America because I'm [HM] John Lassiter.  And, fifty-seven companies told me, no.  They said, "We don't hire color."
Speaker 1: As simple as that?
Speaker 2: That, that--to your face!  They come to Champaign to recruit students.  Yet, they tell you, we don't hire color.  They couldn't tell by my name that I was white or black until they saw me, and then they say, "We don't hire color."  My brother [Herbert Lassiter] who was a Phi Beta Kappa. My brother who was a straight A student, they told him, "No."  My brother who was president of Student Center, I was his campaign manager getting him into the Student Center.  President of Student Center could not get a job.  In 1957 he graduated.  Until the president of the University, David Dodds Henry, was so embarrassed, he called the president of IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] and said, "Hey, buddy, we just gave you a big award, right?  You know, you're my guy, right?"  IBM said, "Yes."  And, my brother said, I mean my--the president said, "You get Herb Lassiter a job.  You get Herb Lassiter with IBM."  He directed him to do that.  Herb was the first black hired by IBM in systems in 1957, because David Dodds Henry made it happen.  He was so embarrassed his number one student could not get a job.  So, I figure well shoot, I mean, that's fine for him but I'm a statis-econ [statistical economics] major.  Should I--my colleagues, seven of us who got, who got undergraduate degrees in statis-econ got from ten to fifteen job offers apiece.  From Nielsen [Company] ratings, you know, from all the big research companies.  And I got zero.  And, I was pissed.  My jaws were tight.
Story_ID: 191532
Speaker 1: Then, I went to my godfather and he calmed me down, cooled me out.  My, William H. Robinson, who had gotten me--who had got my brother [Herbert Lassiter] scholarships and gotten--who was my Sunday school teacher at Monumental Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Now, he was a state representative, right?
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  And, he was a Republican too, by the way in an all Democratic, Dawson's [William L. Dawson] district for six straight terms, he won in Dawson's district.  And, we helped him pass out leaflets and stuff in Ida B. Wells [Homes, Chicago, Illinois] back in those days.  Incredible guy.  He says, "[HM] John [Lassiter], I'll take care of you."  So, he contact the Research Statistics Division, [Illinois] Department of Labor.  And, told Ms. Slocken [ph.], "I got somebody you're gonna have to take care of."  And, he got me hired as the first black employee, professional employee of the research department of the department of Illinois--of the State of Illinois, Department of Public Aid--Department of Labor (laughter).  There's no blacks ever in that either.  I mean, that's incredible.  And so, almost two years I worked as a statistician.  Then, I went to work as a--then, I went to research analyst, did some predictions of unemployment.  And, then I went to work for the Department of HEW [Health, Education, and Welfare] as a statistician.
Speaker 2: Now, this is about 1962?
Speaker 1: Sixty-one [1961]. I left, I left--I went to the state government from '59 [1959] to '61 [1961].  Then federal government '61 [1961], '63 [1963].

Speaker 1: Then in '63 [1963], Benny Ross, who was the, who was my hero, my lifelong hero, calls down to the Kappa [Alpha Psi Fraternity] house, to the frat house and said, "Hey man, I got the word.  Get your resumes together to me.  I wanna look--do something for you."  So, we all did.  Within two week, we had our resumes to him.  Benny Ross was--had got his masters in personnel administration back then.  They call it HR [human resources] today.  Benny Ross said to nineteen of us, he says, "I got your resumes, I got your assignments.  Get ready to change your careers."  Came down that Monday night and he had already programmed us for our livelihoods.  Nobody questioned what he told us to do.  We just did it.  He said, "Oscar Bunch, you're gonna go to IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  Wyman Hancock, you're gonna over to Illinois--International Harvester [Company].  Don Richards, you're going over to Leo Burnett [Company Inc.].  John Lassiter, you're going over to Prudential [Insurance Company]."  And, we all did what he told us to do.  We didn't even question it.  'Cause he had been working with these corporations, getting jobs for dropouts for years.  And, because he knew the personnel managers, when Jack Candice [ph.] says, "Hey, the business roundtable has met with, I met with the business roundtable and we're gonna pass the civil rights bill [Civil Rights Act of 1964].  So, y'all hiring folks now so it won't look like we made you hire folks.  We're gonna pass this bill, you won't be forced to hire people if you hire some now."
Speaker 2: So, he tried to give 'em a heads up on that?  (Simultaneously).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And, so he did it.  And, so the word went out in '63 [1963], two years before the bill was passed.  Hire black folks.  And, Benny had our relationships already with all these different personnel directors and all these major companies.
Speaker 2: Now, what was Benny's position?
Speaker 1: He was, he was working for the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  Getting jobs for dropouts.  That was his--it was--grant, he's got some grant that he was doing.  But, because of that, he knew the personnel administrators of all these different companies.  And, he was, he was fitting us to those different companies.  So, they asked him, "Do you wanna go in sales and make so and so money, or you wanna go in actuarial sciences?"  I said, "Sales."  (Laughter)  So, the whole, the whole idea of an actuarial sciences career just went down the-- (laughter).  But, I heard about the sales; what could happen in sales, and so, I took the sales route.  But, Benny was--he was right on, man.  This guy was unbelievable.  I mean, all of us retired from our companies that he put us in.
Speaker 2: Benny Ross.
Speaker 1: Benny Ross.  Benny Ross, may his soul rest in peace.  He died about six years ago.  Benny was a genius.
Speaker 2: Now, what did--
Speaker 1: Nineteen of us were undergraduates at--I got a lot of friends who are underemployed.  A lot of fraternity brothers who are underemployed, and he got us (unclear), the whole math department of Parker High School [later Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois] for example, left that year, to go into IBM [International Business Machines Company] and to AT&T [Inc.], and stuff.  And, everybody retired from those position.  I mean, that's how well he had designated, he identified what we were told to do.  None of us argued with him.  Nobody even debated or even said to him for a moment that we are--got other ideas we wanna do with our lives.  No, no, no.  Benny say, you go there; we go there (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now did he retired from YMCA?
Speaker 1: No.  He left YMCA and started a consulting company--and went with some big consulting company himself.  As a matter of fact, he took advantage of that period too and got hired with some major corporation out east.  Went out east and many, many years he was with major, major company.  And, then he retired from that and started his own consulting firm, and then he had multiple sclerosis and he died of cancer some six years ago.  But, every year we'll get together at [HM James D.] Montgomery's house.  Every January 1st, all of us get together in the whole country to start a new year together, 'cause major chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi was our--was our anchor in Champaign [Illinois].  It was an anchor and, Doc, Sam Greenlee's [HM Samuel Greenlee] mama, Sam Greenlee wrote the book 'The Spook Who Sat by the Door.'
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Sam Greenlee's mama started that thing, and then she died.  Then Montgomery took it over.  So, every January 1st, we still get together.  To this day, we get together.  Forty-seven years, we've been doing this now.  Every January 1st at James Montgomery's house, we get together.  And, we thank God for being still around, and play some poker, and some pool, and some--look at the football games and just eat some food, and just relax together.  People come from all over the country to do that every year.  And, Benny came until six years ago when he died.  But, Benny was our, was our hero, man.
Speaker 2: That's a remarkable story.
Speaker 1: Well, my whole life was based upon these great people who showed us (unclear), you know, who--I sat on their shoulders.  I mean, William H. Robinson, W. Ellis Stewart, my daddy [John Lassiter Sr.], Benny Ross.  And, I think about all the people who have helped me so much, there's no way in the world I could--I could've messed up.  Unless, I'm just a fool (laughter), you know.  So, I don't take no credit for all things that have happened to me.  I mean, these people just guided me and they just ushered me, you know.  I'm just very blessed to have arrived at this time, and where these people took a hand with me, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It speaks to the importance of a good family and a--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Strong community.
Speaker 1: Community and church, man, absolutely.  No question about it.
Story_ID: 191534
Speaker 1: You were active in civil rights.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I didn't--I don't want to diverge too--I'm getting back to the business side of this.  But, in the late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s], there's a lot of--
Speaker 2: Turmoil.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: A lot of stuff is stirring up with the Montgomery [Alabama] Bus Boycott in '56 [1956], '57 [1957] [sic. 1955-1956] and you got the sit-in movement starts around 1960.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So, were you watching all this and, I guess you, I know you were--
Speaker 2: Well, we had very strong--
Speaker 1: But, how did you feel about it?
Speaker 2: We had a very strong NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Chapter in Champaign [Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At the Wesley--at the Methodist church there, Wesley Methodist Church, right there on the campus there.  And, [HM James D.] Montgomery was a very active guy, still is, you know, just a tremendous talent.
Speaker 1: That's James Montgomery, the attorney?
Speaker 2: Oh, Yeah.  A tremendous talent.  And, he and Barbara Spencer and other folks, we just got involved in whatever was going on at the time.  After we graduated, we stayed involved, you know.  My involvement--too many highlights, one is obviously taking the money to get the tents to sit in Freedom Village to get people a place to sleep in the winter rather than put up on the land.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that, 'cause we didn't get that on tape, and we need that, we need that.
Speaker 2: Well, when we were, when we were--[P.] Sterling Stuckey, we were active in CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] after graduation.  And, Sterling decided that we should do something very specific because these people were getting put off their land 'cause they tried to vote.  And so, we contacted the AP [Associated Press] and UPI [United Press International] to tell the story; they wouldn't tell it.  UPI and AP said, "No, we ain't gonna touch this."  So, we couldn't get anybody to cover the story.  So, we had to cov--do it ourselves.  So, we got the Defender of course, to cover the story.  We would go to (unclear) up there on 63rd and King Drive and collect money and show pictures of what was happening down there and get money to buy the tents.  So, we bought the tents so they could live in the tents.  Then, we got--then--the churches to provide food, and we sent van loads of food down there from different churches.  And, churches that were so interesting, we had some incredible responses from some of the churches.  You would never think we'll get this response like, Bodley's [ph.] church, Reverend Bodley over there on King--I mean, on State Street was--he filled up the van in one day.  From the poorest neighborhood in the city [Chicago, Illinois].  He filled the van in one day.  Send it down to--but, when we finally got on the air, guess whose, guess who, guess where they filmed us?  At Park Manor Congregation on 70th [Street] and King Drive.  That was his first truckload that he had ever done, [William J.] Faulkner had done.  But, because he was Faulkner, because he was (unclear) to Christ and big time super do, he was on the first cover of Ebony magazine.  And, he was, you know, learned, a learned Ph.D. and everything, they wanna give him the credit for doing something.  When the fact of the matter is that for years, we had, for months and months we had gotten all the food and clothing from the poorest churches, poorest neighborhoods, from AP [apostolic] churches, from Bodley's church, and First Church of Deliverance [Chicago, Illinois].  They are the ones who helped us get the food and clothing down there.  Then, finally when we got on Huntley-Brinkley's show ['The Huntley-Brinkley Report'].  All of a sudden, Orville Freeman, [U.S.] Department of Agriculture secretary, "Oh, we got excess food down here, and supplies.  We just--the food for Christ ended because they passed out the excess food that was in supply down there, you know, plenty."  He didn't know that was going on, of course, you know, you know.  So, that was a great--second great victory we had was when the Freedom Riders did--got bombed--got burned in Anniston, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Right.  They burned a bus.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Completely to a crisp, right?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes.  And, the Freedom Riders had--were in jail.  And so, our goal was to get the money to get 'em out of jail.  So, to do that we first got the CORE to help us get some money to get professors, two white professors from Michigan State University [East Lansing, Michigan], and two--and three sisters from; one's from Brooklyn [New York], one's from Mississippi, and one's from Detroit [Michigan], to come to Chicago and stay at our home.  And, we took them around different churches, suburban churches primarily to tell the story of what in Anniston.  We raised enough money to get everybody out of jail, everybody out of jail, with the money we raised for bond to get 'em out of jail.  And, it was a period that the people--we worked with people like who had been--whose lives were on the line.  I mean, who were just out there on the battlefield.  And, you get to realizing that there was as many white folks involved as there were black folks.  You know, I mean, and they had, they had no fear.  And, they were treated worse than the black folks were.  This retired professor from Michigan State; they were, they were stormed.  They were stoned, because they were white nigger lovers, you know.  They caught, they caught hell.  But, we told their story at the churches.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, got the money to get the rest of 'em out of jail.
Story_ID: 190800
Speaker 1: Now, you were a member of CORE [Congress on Racial Equality], Urban League, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in college [at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois], and later on, Operation PUSH [People United to Save Humanity].
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Right.
Speaker 1: So, some people would only be a member of one or the other.
Speaker 2: No. No, we felt the movement needed every interest--whatever could happen, needed to happen, and everybody would do something.  I gave a speech one time in Toastmasters [International], when I first got in college.  We had a Toastmasters club in Washington Park Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association] on 51st--50th and Indiana [Avenue].  One of the best Toastmasters clubs in the entire world.  It was three thousand clubs in the world at that time.  And, our Club 341 was world renowned.  Because we had--every year there'd be one speaker, or it would be the top five speakers selected internationally out of three thousand clubs.  In my--I was in that club for four years and three of those four years we had somebody in the top five; internationally speaking.  One year was [HM] Manford Byrd [Jr.].  One year it was Bob Johnson [Robert E. Johnson], head of Jet magazine, the late Bob Johnson.  One year it was Ted Swain [Theodore M. Swain], a white guy who was a federal, became a judge, a federal judge.  He was a lawyer at that time.  And, we were just outstanding, known throughout the world as--Club 341 Chicago was just outstanding.  Well, I gave one speech in that four year period that got me the pencil that night.  You get an award for being the best speaker that night.  Five speakers per night, okay.  Toastmasters--the first hour you do tabletop, 'cause everybody speaks, guest and members alike.  The second hour, we have five prepared speakers, and you have five critiques, and then chief evaluators, and then you have a vote.  They voted me the top speaker one night.  Guess what my topic was.
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: "Do something."  Do something.  Don't let this period pass you by and not contribute to this movement.  If you can't march, then write letters.  If you can't picket then get on the telephone, man the telephone bank.  "Do something."  Do something.  And, I gave a whole bunch of examples of what they could do.  My cousin Ed, who fought the people down in Ku Klux Klan [KKK], I gave all kind of examples.  And, I got the award that night for the first time, the only time I got the award.  And, that "Do something" consciousness kinda guided me in what I was doing professionally and civically.  And so, you need to always do something.
Story_ID: 190801
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna try to go back to Prudential [Insurance Company]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The beginning at--
Speaker 2: Sure.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Prudential.  You started Prudential in what year?
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 2: October of '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: All right.  October.  Now, this is right after the March on Washington, did you go?
Speaker 2: It was right after the--no I didn't go to the March on Washington.  It was right after the March on Washington.  It was right after the--
Speaker 1: The bombing of that church [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: The bombing of the church.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Right.  In Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So, this is a, I don't know (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: No, I was in training.  I was in training during that period and I was scared to stop any training to do anything, 'cause I was the first black hired in Chicago [Illinois], at Prudential.  And, I was gonna be the best they ever had.  And, I was gathering up the forces to help me be the best.  And, started October 13th in that year, I led my office in sales.  In '63 [1963], I led my office in sales.  I'd just been there for one and a half months, or two in a half months.  Actually, you don't count the business that you write in December; doesn't really count.  'Cause it won't get issued until, until 2000 or until the next year.  So, in one and a half months, I did more business than anybody else in the office did, in the whole year.  And, won a trip, and won the trip to Montreal [Canada] to the Regional Convention.  And, guess what they had to do.  It supposed to been in White Sulphur Springs [West Virginia]; White Sulphur Springs, down south.  And, they had to change the convention, 'cause they didn't let black folks down south.  So, they had been told for a year, that the world convention is gonna be in White Sulphur Springs.  Was it Carolina or someplace, or Virginia someplace?  And, after I won, they had to change the title convention to Montreal, Quebec.
Speaker 1: They had to take it out of United States to--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Is that something?  Is that crazy?  White folks crazy that way.  They rather lose some money, lose a deposit.  They rather lose some business in White Sulphur Springs, then let this one little black agent come down to White Sulphur Springs.  Ain't that something?  Crazy, man.  They were crazy!
Speaker 1: Those were the times, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's insane.  That's insane.  But, I enjoyed Montreal, we had a great time in Montreal.
Speaker 1: Now, did you find that--was it harder for you or did you have a niche in the black community that had never been exploited when you started selling, that or what was it?
Speaker 2: What made me so successful so quickly?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I ran scared.  After my first week in the business, my wife [Rosielyn Lassiter] loved what I was doing so well, she announced to me that she gonna retire from nursing.  She was a registered nurse, had a great job as a reg--as a head nurse at the Illinois State Psychiatric Institute [Chicago, Illinois].  And said, "Baby, January 1st, I'm through.  I don't need--you don't need my income no mo'."  She kept me running, didn't she?  (Laughter.) But, I just, I did what Benny Ross told me to do, I followed the process.  The process is get referred leads.  And, don't forget, prior to being a Prudential agent in 1963, I worked at the Social Security Administration where my job was to approve claimants' applications for benefits resulting from death, disability, or old age.  And, many a benefit--many a person would come to us and tell us, "This is not enough money to live on.  Social Security won't do it for me.  I can't maintain this house or this household on Social Security."  For years I had heard, I can't live off this pension.  This not enough money from the pension.  I made more money than this when I was working.  The Social Security pension is not enough for me.  I'd heard that.  I'd heard--I'd seen the tears in the eyes, people telling me how, about--when I tell 'em how much--how little they gonna get.  So, I knew what life insurance could do to supplement that.  Nobody could tell me that what I was providing wasn't the best thing that--since apple pie was made.  So, I was supplementing those benefits to make sure they would have enough to maintain their standard of living, if they die prematurely, live to old age, or became disabled.  And, I never sold policies.  I always sold benefits.  And, I communicated that, just that way, to people.  And, after about two months or so of being in the business, I started recruiting other people.  In less than a year, I had me a whole staff of people I recruited.  So, they made me a manager in '66 [1966], January of '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Now, so I take it, you brought in other black folks that--
Speaker 2: Three hundred and twenty-three.
Speaker 1: Three hundred and twenty-three.
Speaker 2: Blew the company--everybody in the whole country called me up on the phone.  "[HM John] Lassiter, I got a guy I want you to talk to about."  I said, "You gotta give me a recruiting bonus for talking to this guy (laughter) 'cause I'm not just doing this for free, this is crazy.  But, I became so well known as a great recruiter and trainer of man, that they wanted me to do it everywhere.  I was constantly being taken on trips to go teach other people how to recruit and train.  Yeah.  That's my passion.  Until one day it came to my mind, came to my senses and realized that, as I'm recruiting and training these guys and they're getting promoted elsewhere all over the country.  I get a free meal if I go to California, Boston [Massachusetts], where ever, but I'm losing my production (laughter).  I'm losing my revenue.  The new guys take time to train them, to replace the guys that I'm losing.  I said, "Wait a minute.  There's something wrong with this picture," you know.  That's when they offered me to take--to send me to--I became a manager and then--they were gonna send me to--I became a sales manager, division manager, sales manager, district manager, division manager, agency manager.  That's when they were gonna send me to Michigan to take over the whole State of Michigan.  Then they would own me then, wouldn't they?  Prudential would say, "You do just what we tell you to do."  I said, "No, I don't want that."  I start--
Speaker 1: About what year is this?
Speaker 2: Six--'85 [1985], '83 [1983], '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I started Financial Designs [Group] in '85 [1985]--
Story_ID: 190802
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968] was one of the landmark years for you [at Prudential Insurance Company]. We didn't talk about--
Speaker 2: Well yeah, we led the entire company that year.  Three thousand staffs, we're number one in the country that year.
Speaker 1: You won the award (simultaneously)--
Speaker 2: Won the--number one sales, number one--they measure sales by sales.  That's one thing about justice they give us an even playing field for us, that's all we need.  And, we sold more than anybody else, so.  And, again in '72 [1972].  But, in '72 [1972] the guy--they done that for fifty-one weeks.  But, in '72 [1972] my man from Decatur, Georgia got slick on me and we had, instead of having just eight guys, we must have had forty-two guys on the staff that time.  And, we came in number two in the country that year except number one.  You know why?  'Cause they ganged up on me.  All the white agencies in that whole county decided to pour their business into one shop; on individual kids who were, who would automatically be issued in December with no medical on their writing.  Kids who were like from five years old down to zero.  And, they put about 2,000 policies on the books that, in that last week of the year.  And we made number two.  I should have anticipated that though.  Racism is very much alive, and I could have just anticipated that.  It was my fault, I don't take--I don't, I mean, they won and I was--came in number two, you know.
Speaker 1: That's something.  So, well--
Speaker 2: Well, we came in--we were always in the top 10 percent though.  I was in top 10 percent the whole year I was in management, all the years I was in management--
Story_ID: 190803
Speaker 1: Well, tell me how you were involved with Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] visit to Chicago [Illinois] in '66 [1966]?  And, where did you first meet Dr. King?  'Cause you do have a relationship with him.
Speaker 2: At Liberty Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois].  That's where we had done the Freedom Riders.  'Cause we've done a Freedom Ride from there.  That's where we had trained Freedom Riders.  That's where we got the money together to get the Freedom Riders out of jail.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, these--
Speaker 2: In '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: The Freedom Riders then would gather at Liberty Baptist and they--the buses would leave from--
Speaker 2: Naw, naw, we were training people on how to become Freedom Riders.
Speaker 1: How to become.  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were training people and we were trying to, trying to teach passive resistance.  Trying to teach non-violent behavior.  That's what we were trying to teach them.  A lot of people didn't qualify for that.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--
Speaker 2: Lot of washouts.
Speaker 1: Were you ever in a--
Speaker 2: I'm a teacher.
Speaker 1: A situation where you--
Speaker 2: I didn't have to do it.  The only time we did it was in Fayette County, Tennessee, that time we took the money down there for the food and clothing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, for the tents.  I didn't go back.  One time down there was enough for me.  I was driving my Volkswagen car down there with Ed Reddick and my wife [Rosielyn Lassiter].  And, I saw that sign that said, "White Only."  I wanted to get something to drink, some water.  I said, "Man, we can't stop here.  Man we're gonna run out of gas, you crazy.  Stop here and get some gas." (laughter), you know.  But, I couldn't take it.  I was not, I could--I was not built for that.
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of black folks--
Speaker 2: I went down there one time.  I went down there one time, got those tents, stayed at John McFerrin's house and had a group down there in Brownsville [Tennessee], and never went back.  I couldn't take it.  I didn't have--I was able to help as support.  I saw my role as logistics and support, to be in Chicago [Illinois] to be a support platoon for the groups down there, were doing--
Speaker 1: And, I've heard of--
Speaker 2: Direct action.
Speaker 1: You know, in those days you'd hear people, black men of the North say that a lot, that they just couldn't, they couldn't see themselves doing that.  They simplify-- (simultaneously)
Speaker 2: I couldn't do it.  I went down there.  I couldn't do it.  Highlander Folk School [Monteagle, Tennessee]; they tried to say that we had alcohol in there.  We didn't have no alcohol in there.  I mean, just crazy, man.  And, then I got in the [U.S.] National Guard, okay, which limited what I could do.  'Cause I was an officer in the National Guard.
Speaker 1: Now, when were you an officer in the National Guard?
Speaker 2: From 1961 to 1965.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Went in '59, yeah.  To (unclear) '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, limited in what I could do.  So, as a National Guard officer, as a second lieutenant, I was limited to what I could do outside of my--'cause they would call us back to duty, you know.  They could put guns in our hands and shit.  Thank God it didn't happen, but it could've.  So, I did little things as a support system as opposed to direct action.
Story_ID: 190804
Speaker 1: Now, so you met [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] at Liberty Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: And, you were getting ready to talk about how that happened.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think more important than meeting Martin was meeting [HM Reverend] Jesse [L. Jackson], you know.  And, getting involved with Operation PUSH [People United to Save Humanity] because Jesse saw what we had done in Fayette County [Tennessee] and got me involved in forming Operation PUSH from the very beginning.  Meeting Martin was a watershed moment but it didn't have the kind of impact that meeting Jesse was.  Martin was still distant.  I mean, he was, he made you feel like you could go through the wall.  But, he didn't have no direct relationship with me in terms of, hey brother come on, let's go do this together.  Whereas Jesse said, "Man, we could use your stuff in this, in this research we're gonna do in identifying what companies we're gonna target."  My passion was researching--don't forget, I'm just gonna throw this economy shit (unclear).  My past was researching and I wanted to get involved in that so, Ed Reddick being a friend already, back in the days of CORE [Congress on Racial Equality].  So, he was head of research at PUSH.  And so, for years we worked together with Jesse to--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you informed the activities--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Of Operation PUSH?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Very much so.  And, Lester was a CPA [certified public accountant] for Operation PUSH.
Speaker 1: [HM] Lester McKeever?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, we had a chance to help get to keep the books straight.  So, it was just a wonderful period.  I still work, I still work PUSH at least once a month on Saturday morning.  But, I don't go to the broadcast, I go to the trade bureau before the broadcast web--eight o'clock meeting, eight to nine--eight to ten actually, and help them out there.  Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Operation PUSH started around 1969 or '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: It started the day Martin died.
Speaker 1: Oh, '68 [1968].  Okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, it started before Martin died.  Operation PUSH started before Martin died.  Jesse gave, Jesse gave--.
Speaker 1: As Operation Breadbasket, right?
Speaker 2: Breadbasket.  Jesse gave, Jesse gave that as a mission for, I mean, Martin gave that to Jesse as a mission, as to get the economic thing off the ground.  It started on a (unclear) march actually, in '66 [1966], I guess it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  A lot of people see Dr. King as someone who wanted to see black people and white kids hold hands and that sort of thing.  But, he got involved in the economic disparity in the country.
Speaker 2: Exactly, I think that's what came--last night, for the first time on 'Citizen King' last night they talked about how it was more palatable to talk about him as a dreamer and that kinda thing.  They was ready--the American dreamer to be--they couldn't talk about uncashed check, you know, the intercept check that's been given black folks.  That was not being--that was the theme of his speech.  But, that was not carried forward because they were not--they couldn't deal, they couldn't handle that, that subject at the time, which is very profound and very true, I think.  Operation Breadbasket was a very difficult thing to get off the ground.  We had a very difficult thing.  When we started the first Rainbow PUSH, started the Rain--PUSH Expo where we would have black companies and white companies at the International Harvest-- International Amphitheatre [Chicago, Illinois] exhibit their wares.  And, have school kids come in all day long and the public come in all day long.  And, at nighttime we'll have the events given by Motown where they could--entertainment at night.  That was revolutionary.  Today it's commonplace that we have the (unclear) economic development corporation, the Minority Person Council, they do that throughout the whole country now.  It's no big thing.  But, in that time it was revolutionary.  'Cause all month we'd have a breakfast morning where all the white corporate leaders would come and along with the black corporate leaders.  And, we'd get together and have breakfast together every year at this thing.  It was a very major, major change.  This was during the days of, I think, [Richard J.] Daley too.  We didn't want him to do anything with us, you know.  But, it was very, very trying times.  But, it was very difficult.  But, we had some very strong black leaders at that time.  We had [HM] John [H.] Johnson, [HM] George Johnson, Al Johnson [HM Albert W. Johnson], I mean, we had some incredible guys, man.  They was putting the bucks there to help us.  And, we had WVON radio stations.  We had tremendous support from the community to help us do this, put this on.  We have --I was head of the Commercial Division of Sales for PUSH.  Then, Jesse had the idea of let's have a feast.  Let's get together at McCormick Place [Chicago, Illinois].  You know one year we had a--we called it what, Family Affair.  We would have a dinner.  Guess what the menu would be.  We had beans and rice, and cornbread; charged them a hundred dollars apiece for that.  Bring in [HM] Nancy Wilson to do some singing for us or something, you know.  And, I was the co-chairperson of that along with Val Fishmill [ph.] from Supreme Life, and Lawry [ph.] from Lawry--he was a beer distributor.  Lawry, Fishmill, myself and a lady from, who had the restaurant, the H and H Restaurant, Holly Mabel [ph.].  Four of us were the--
Speaker 1: So, H and H would--
Speaker 2: Four of us.
Speaker 1: Prepare--
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: The meal?
Speaker 2: We had 10,000 people come, man.
Speaker 1: They supposedly have the best biscuits in town.  I don't know--
Speaker 2: We had 10,000 people coming to the McCormick Place eating red beans and rice.  To me it was an incredible period.  It was just an awesome period.  I was right in the heart of it.  You know, just right in the middle of it, you know, making it happen, making it happen.  And, I was--at that time, I was an officer in the military.  I was also a Prudential agent or manager, whatever.  But, above all I was active in the movement, you know.  Because to me that was more important than the economic part.  The economic part was so easy.  It wasn't easy, easy, easy, but it was automatic because I was well known, you know.
Story_ID: 190805
Speaker 1: How did things change from the late '60s [1960s] through the mid-'80s [1980s] when you started your company [Lassiter Enterprises]?  How did, you know.
Speaker 2: The biggest thing that happened, I think, as the transition occurred, is as the different companies, for example, Independence Bank [Chicago, Illinois] was born in that period.  They sold out to white folks.  John, John--[HM] George Johnson started an Afro--not Afro Sheen, it was called--
Speaker 1: Johnson Products [Company].
Speaker 2: Johnson Products.  He sold out to white folks.  So that other folks--so, I said, well, you know, it's not--and they, by the way, and they've done very well.  I mean, the revenue they got from those sales is very profound.  Because the purpose of any business is to grow it and then sell it.  I mean, that's the purpose of a business.  Sell it or pass it to the next generation.  But, above all capitalize on it and get the money out of it.  Which is happening more and more every day.  I said, "Well, now that makes sense to me.  Let me do some of that too."  So, I started partnering with white firms downtown.  Work on the national scene.  I would never have thought about that back in the '60s [1960s]; would never have crossed my mind.  But, when I need a backroom to do what I'm not gonna build up a staff to do, for example, African Healthcare got 25,000 employees.  They got 4,000 physicians.  And, they got over $3 billion of revenue coming in, and I have access to them.  So, I need somebody to help see those people for me.  I'm not gonna hire no 200 people to go see those people for me.  I'll hire me an enrollment company.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The people that you're insuring so they could get their physical--
Speaker 2: Naw, naw, just a minute, just a minute.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay.
Speaker 2: To insure each part of those persons individually is my goal.  I'm not gonna see them myself.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: I'm gonna hire an enrollment company to see them for me.  And, there are no black enrollment companies.  It's only white enrollment companies.  So, I'll hire me a white enrollment company to see them for me, and split the business with them.  That's what you call worksite marketing.  So, I got involved with that.  Similarly, that's what happened in the '80s [1980s].  Similarly in the '90s [1990s], I hired a company called Clark Consulting, which is Clark--formerly Clark Bardes.  And, they now do consulting for the--they have been doing consulting for only the top tier companies in the world, the major companies.  And, now I got half a dozen cases pending right now, with them doing the backroom work for me, for the executive of these major companies.  And, anyone of these cases that pop, would be more money than, than all the years I've worked in this business.  You get Dow Chemical to pop, for example, you got 300 executives at Dow Chemical buying $10 million apiece of insurance, that's a lifetime of work.  Well, these guys, because I belong to Boule [Sigma Pi Phi] now.  Boule has a whole bunch of black people who are running these companies.  A guy in charge of American Express [Company].  A guy in charge of Merrill Lynch [Wealth Management].  A guy in charge of TIAA-CREF, I mean, these are black (unclear).  These are my fraternity brothers who love to see me get some business that I've earned the right to, by bringing the right possible solution for their problems.  And, so they need deferred compensation, they need executive benefits, they need things done for them.  And so, I got my boys working for me to help this happen on a joint venture basis, so.  But, I could take full advantage of the whole marketplace as opposed to the neighborhood, as opposed to the kitchen table, as opposed to the Chatham Park Village [Cooperative Apartments, Chicago, Illinois], as opposed to (unclear)--and, things are happening, things have happened and are happening.  I can probably say this officially now because it is pretty much to bed now.  We got R.R. Donnelley and Sons.  And, they've, for example, just bought a company in Canada to almost double their size.  And, they have factories in China.  So, the execs all over the world now, sixty different countries will be our clients.  And, other companies like that, we're working on.
Speaker 1: That's big.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  That's huge.  That's huge.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: When I think of my friend [HM James D.] Montgomery who spent forty years of his life working as one of the best lawyers in the world; who hooked up with Johnnie Cochran and a whole bunch of other guys in the national firms.  And, now they're doing in one year what he did in forty years.  I understand what that means, you see (laughter).  Our motivations similar, okay, you see.
Story_ID: 190806
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, am I still active in business?  Yes, I'm very active in my business [Lassiter Enterprises].  Yes, I will stay active in my business as long as my breath will hold out.  'Cause I got some of the smartest young people working with me you ever wanna see.  Clark [ph.] and Sullivan [ph.], these guys, T.C. Cochran [ph.] and the adis--Adistar Group [ph.] are just unbelievable.  They're the premier.  What I've learn through my consulting, through my--I got--I have a coach by the way, a strategic coach named Dan Sullivan.  It's called a Strategic Coach Program, which I'm part of.  And, one thing we've learned is the biggest check is yet to be.  The biggest check is yet to be.  And, you partner with those people that got the skills that you need in order to get your job done.  Now, if I could meet all the execs in the world at the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi] annual meeting or the regional meetings or the chapter meetings here in Chicago [Illinois] and, talk to them all day long about what [HM] John Lassiter can do.  I cannot provide them the backroom support that I need to get executive benefits done for them, without hiring 200 people down in Dallas, Texas where my backroom is, for example.  And, they know that.  That's why I partner with these guys, upfront.  We are partners.  Lassiter and Clark Consulting coming to help you solve your economic problems you have as a corporate executive.  That's where we are today.  So, things have transitioned a whole lot.
Speaker 2: That wasn't possible years ago?
Speaker 1: Naw.  Naw.  We didn't have no black, we didn't have no black C.E.O.s.  We didn't have no black--we have a whole bunch of black HR [human resources] directors now.  We didn't have 'em back then.  Benny was probably the first one ever hired as an HR guy.  Back in--
Speaker 2: That's Benny Ross you're talking--?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Back in the '60s [1960s], you know.
Speaker 2: That's something.
Story_ID: 190807
Speaker 1: If you had it to do over again, what would you focus--what area of this business would you focus on?
Speaker 2: I would foc--I would've gotten involved in executive benefits earlier.  I would've stopped training agents earlier (laughter).   I would stop being pimped by the Prudential [Insurance Company] earlier, you know.  I would've started Financial Designs earlier and sooner.  And, that's the only thing that I would've done, just a little--turn the clock back a little bit.  I had seventeen years as a manager at Prudential, and I had some great relationships, great fun, great people.  But, Prudential had a Prudential way of doing things.  And, they had certain markets they were shooting for.  They wanted the giant lunch bucket market.  They wanted the middle-income market.  I learned to appreciate and love the top tier market.  And, the companies that I used for that are the companies that (unclear) for the top ten market.  So, I rarely use Prudential anymore.  I use companies like ING Security Alliance.  I use companies like Northwestern Mutual [Life Insurance Company].  I use companies like Pacific Life [Insurance Company].  I use companies that are targeting their entire portfolio for these top tier markets.  And, that's where my head is.  That's where my heart is.  That's where my passion is.  I've developed a strong relationship with people who are rich.  I love being around rich people.  They love being around me.  I enjoy that relationship and the fellowship we have.  And, that's my, that's my skill that God gave me, and I wanna just use it, over and over again.  And, rather than trying to convert people to thinking positive about economic development, and wealth accumulation.  I'm doing people who are just--that's normal every day activity for them.  It's just a conversation we have all the time.  I belong to the Mid-America Club on top of the Aon Center [Chicago, Illinois] for example, and I have lunch with two or three, three, four times a week there with corporate executives.  People who are--whose whole lives have been about wealth accumulation and it's just nothing unusual about that and, we're in the sa--we're talking the same talk and it's much more, more comfortable for me.  I enjoy living in our condominium building.  We have a condominium building, 1440 North Lake Shore Drive and the income--the value of my property has gone up 310 percent in just eleven years.  You know, without me doing a thing.  I put some new bathrooms in, you know, new floors and stuff, but I mean, it's just incredible.  The value of living on the Gold Coast [Chicago, Illinois] and what's that done for my net worth.  And, it's just been helpful.  I just have a passion for people who like those kinds of things, you know.  I just got off a boat.  Went--my wife [Rosielyn Lassiter] and I went sailing on the Sea Cloud.  Six hours on the boat E.F. Hutton [Edward Francis Hutton] bought for his wife.  The lady from Post family [Marjorie Merriweather Post] back in 1931.  And, the boat is so rich and so fabulous that it's still that today.  It's a cruising vessel now.  And, we spent the whole week on that boat with other people who love sailing from the Museum of--[The] Mariners' Museum [Newport News, Virginia] in Virginia and the Mystic Museum [Mystic Seaport, Mystic, Connecticut] in Connecticut; sailboat sailing museums.  People who just love sailing, love the high--the life of--it was a fantastic week.  We had a ball.  We had a blast, you know.  Then, spent the other week in Antigua just enjoying cooling out there on the beach.  But, I enjoy that stuff.  I enjoy it very much.  I also enjoy going to PUSH [People United to Save Humanity] on Saturday mornings hearing them talking about the Wall Street project and how we're gonna get more economic growth and development.  But, [HM Reverend] Jesse [L. Jackson] opened the doors up, nobody's there to open the--to make it happen, unless you're there with an attitude of wealth accumulation consciousness.  John Rogers's [HM John Rogers Jr.] done exceedingly well since Jesse's been part of his life.  John Rogers of Ariel Capital [Management] is one of the most brilliant money managers in the whole.  In the world!  He should be--he should have ten percent of the mutual fund business in this world.  Ariel made seven trillion dollars.  I mean, a seven trillion dollar industry, he should have at least seven hundred billion of it.  And, that's how good he is, you know.  And, we're celebrating 15 billion.  Now, that's, that's good but it ain't like it can be.  He don't get--he may get his first trillion dollar company.  That boy is unbelievable.  But, his mind is that way.  His mind is--we're very good friends and we--he's very receptive to this kind of consciousness and thinking.  And, I'm on his coattails, where ever he goes, I go (laughter).  "Where you going John, I'm going with 'cha, bro," (laughter) you know.  It's been wonderful.  I mean, I love what I've been doing.  I just would've done it sooner, that's all.
Story_ID: 191535
Speaker 1: Oh, and to answer the question about the people who have contributed so much to my vision, to my growth in the business.  I wanna certainly give credit to those who helped me with the transition as a manager at the Prudential [Insurance Company].  We were got--we had gotten to the point where we were stagnating in '79 [1979] and that's when I made the decision to bring in a psychiatrist and we spent the entire day brainstorming.  And, what we did, we took the top seven people that I had in my organization at the time, with the shrink and we allowed them to discuss and to testify about the other six people in the room.  A person put me in a barrel.  I can't say nothing in support or defense of myself.  You're to tell me--everybody, all those six people in the room gotta tell me what it is that I'm good at.  How do they see me?  What can they witness for me?  What are my strengths?  Don't tell me about your weaknesses.  I don't wanna hear that shit.  I wanna hear about the strengths.  I wanna hear about the power that I am, and let that be communicated to me.  When they get through telling it to me, make sure that it's all recorded and written down for posterity's sake.  And, use it for the rest of your life.  We did that to seven people in that room, that day.  We transformed seven lives.  Included in that group, that day, was [HM] Bobby Rush.  He was one of my agents at the time.  We saw him as a politician.  He went from being an agent for me to being an alderman, to being a congressman now.  In that room was [HM] Ann Smith, who was one of my sales managers.  She went from being a sales manager to a president of a company that did their own insurance to the chan--assistant chancellor at the University of Illinois [at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  And now, she's president of the Gamaliel Foundation.
Speaker 2: That's the--
Speaker 1: Ann, Dr. Ann Smith.
Speaker 2: The writer?  She's a writer, and--is that the one?
Speaker 1: Well, Ann, Ann has been writing too, but she's also a lecturer, she's a speaker, she's more famous for speaking, speaking black literature and stuff.  But she, she took that high road.  Third person in the room that day was Tom McCleary [HM Thomas L. McCleary].  Tom McCleary, who's one of my best students I've ever had in life.  You gotta, you gotta, if you haven't interviewed him, you should interview him.  Just enormous strength, enormous talent, enormous talent.  And, that day he transformed his career and stuck to what he was best at.  And he developed a pension business that developed--that went into--then he went into the leadership of the Minority Business Person--Minority Business Purchasing Council [sic, National Minority Business Development Council].  He is now on the national board of that organization.  He's also the former chair of the Chicago Purchasing Council.  He's been head of the [Chicago] Business Opportunity Fair, and he's hobnobbed with the corporate leaders of the world because of that.  And, because of that, he is writing these kind of policies on these big corporations.  For example, last year he did [The] J.C. Penney [Company].  He did Sprint [Corporation].  He did, he did Backs-not, I mean, Abbott Labs [Abbott Laboratories].  And, those are completed.  Those are done deals.  And, this resulted from that Saturday that we spent in that office that day, and others similarly.  But, that's what transformed me that day.  That's what got me to leave the south side of Chicago [Illinois], on 53rd and Harper [Avenue]; that day we had that, that transformation experience.  To go downtown and to embrace the top tier business community of the world, that's when I first started making the transition.
Speaker 2: Now, whose idea was that, to bring in this psychiatrist?
Speaker 1: I think it was Lillian's idea.  Lillian was one of our very bright deputies we had working for us as an agent.
Speaker 2: That's Lillian?
Speaker 1: Lillian Hill [ph.], she lives in--
Speaker 2: Lillian Hill.
Speaker 1: She lives in [Las] Vegas [Nevada] now.  I think it was her idea.  May not have been.  May have been somebody else.  But, I think it was Lillian's idea.  But, we all agreed that's what we should do because we had reached the crossroads and we needed to expand from beyond that.  And, we had just an awesome day that day; awesome day, just incredible.
Speaker 2: And, this is in 19-- what?
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  That's when we left the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], went downtown, and joined up with McKinnis [Consulting Services] operation and got freed from the Prudential and got--and became part of a more holistic--not holistic but a broader, a broader service organization.  We could actually service the top tier companies.  We were not restricted to just Prudential.  We could do other companies that were needed to work with the top tier businesses.
Speaker 2: And, the seven of you were, were you--did you have a name, or did you have a--?
Speaker 1: No.  We were just, we were just the top people in the organization who we had a lot of regard for each other.  And, couldn't have all forty of us in the room that day.  We had seven seats (laughter) so we had to, we had to--it was the comfortablest conference room.  We could probably had been eight--seat about eight people in there, you know, but the top seven people and that's what we did.  It transformed us.  By having a shrink come in to do--industrial shrink to come in to do that, to guide us through that day was just profitable and very beneficial.
Speaker 2: Who was the industrial shrink?
Speaker 1: I don't even remember the guy's name now.
Speaker 2: You don't (laughter).
Speaker 1: I think the guy's name was Williams, I think but, you know.  Williams, I think his name was Williams.  But, he was very, very bright.  Very good for us.
Speaker 2: Was he black?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Everybody in this group is--?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was a transformational experience.  And, because of that, I mean, we've all just soared in our different disciplines, you know.  Some took--stayed in insurance, others took other routes, you know, but, what was good for you; the person.  Forget about what Prudential, what the Prudential wants.  Forget about what, what you know, what you signed up for.  This is what--this is the day to find out what you need for yourself.  What you're good at.  What you're best at.
Story_ID: 191536
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: My--when I looked at Martin, at Martin, Citizen Martin [sic, 'Citizen King'] last night, when I look at--listen to what happens at our PUSH [People United to Serve Humanity] functions on Saturday mornings.  I go to the [Chicago] Urban League.  I see Jim's [HM James W. Compton] operation over there.  I go to the Reynolds Club [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] with [HM] John Rogers [Jr.] recently.  And, I saw the--all these young entrepreneurs who are trying to make headway about this economic plan that we're working on.  And, I think of the sermons I've heard over the years.  And, I think of, the difficulty that we have as a people that we have to overcome.  And, my--what would help us overcome this particular difficulty; if you see yourself as a midget, you're gonna be a midget.  If you see yourself as a grasshopper, you're gonna be a grasshopper.  If you see yourself as mosquito, you're gonna be a mosquito.  And, so I talk about being an eagle rather than a mosquito; eagle, mosquito.  And so, I've had to give a lot of lectures on that over the years, you know, to groups of all kind of groups.  They ask me to give a speech, I'll give that as part of my speech.  So, it's self-perception.  We need to get a better self-perception.  We need to embrace excellence.  Excellence as a way of life.  Not just a way of living, but a way of life.  When I think in terms of excellences, I think in terms of a speech I gave when I--most--one of the highlights of my life was when I gave the commencement address at the University of Illinois Business School [UIUC College of Business, Champaign, Illinois] four years ago, when I was president of the alumni association of the commerce--of the Business Alumni Association.  The title of my speech was, "Four Things You Need To Do in Order to Master the World That We Live In."  To be referred to other people.  To be appreciated, and to master it.  And, it's four simple things you gotta do.  I got this from my strategic coach [Dan Sullivan].  I've been using it ever since he gave it to me many years ago.  And, I know it's true, 'cause the faculty and the parents afterwards just swamped me with--wanted to get copies of my speech and stuff when I got through.  The four things I talked about were these.  It took me twenty minutes to talk about it because I amplified them.  But, I'll just give you the four, four quick ones.  One, show up on time.  Show up on time.  Two, do what you say.  Three, complete what you start.  And four, say please and thank you (laughter).  Of course, I Lassiterized those (laughter), you know, to the point where they, to the point where the president of the university heard about that, that commencement address.  'Cause every seat, every college has their own commencement and then they go to the big, the big graduation that every--all the colleges get together in the auditorium.  And, Hillary Clinton was speaking for that, for that particular (laughter), for the real graduation, you know, how (laughter)--and so anyway, the president heard about that.  And, after he heard about that, he called me aside about maybe two years later and said, "[HM] John [Lassiter], I want you to give us that same speech to the high school kids that we have selected to come to Illinois, who are all National Merit scholars throughout the whole state of Illinois.  We got these thousand kids, we want you to speak to them at the Chicago Hilton Hotel [Chicago, Illinois] on this particular day.  And, I want you to give that speech to them."  I said, "I'd be delighted to."  (Unclear) I'd be delighted to.  Because it resonated so well with people with what the kind of things I was emphasizing in that speech.  And, I would say that really needs to fit very vividly with our community because we need that badly.  We need that badly.  We need to lift up excellence any way we can.  And, this whole thing of anti-excellence is just insane.  It's insane!  We want excellence in performing arts.  We want excellence in performing sports.  We want excellence in those kind of things.  Why can't we have excellence in everything else?  Why can't we embrace excellence as a way of being, you know?  And so, that's what--if I could say anything to our community, that's what I would say.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said earlier if you had something to do differently, it would be to start earlier.
Speaker 2: That's all.  Very pleased with where I am right today.  I'm very pleased with where I'm going; wish I had more energy (laughter) to--if I got started earlier, I would have more energy, I guess, if I was younger.  But, I'm very pleased with what's happening with me right now.  Very, very pleased.
Story_ID: 191537
Speaker 1: When you look back at the things you've done at this point, what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, some people (unclear) and some people who became producers in this business because of me.  Some people could say it was because of the claims that I've paid.  I would say it's because of the way I've lived I think that the--my sons who are, who are not in my business, but are in business are benefitting greatly from what my grand--what my daddy [John Lassiter Sr.] did and what my granddaddy [John Lassiter] did.  While I didn't tell you about him--but, what my granddaddy did and what I'm doing, and my brother's [Herbert Lassiter] doing.  I think that my nephews are benefitting greatly from what we're experiencing.  My nephews are doing very, very well too.  My brother's two sons.  And, I think that we are leaving a legacy to them worthwhile--that's worthwhile, that's worthy of the Lassiter.  A tradition in name.  And, I think that George Washington Carver would be proud of what daddy learned from his experience of being down there in this classroom back then 'cause he's passed it on, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you ever reflect on how kinda unusual it is today for someone to have that kind of lineage where you can trace--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's so sad.  It's so sad because, because we just don't, we don't take time to say thank you, you know.  I go to church right now every Sunday.  And I go see Pastor Jeremiah Wright [HM Reverend Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr.] at Trinity United [Church] of Christ [Chicago, Illinois], who got me involved in all sorts of things there to help pass this legacy on to younger generations.  I teach class on pre-marital counseling, on finance, and teach every other month.  I'm teaching a class of thirty and forty couples getting married.  It's awesome.  Hell of a responsibility.  I'm providing a book that I made up from my own computer.  An eightysome page book on must do's about money that you gotta do to stay married, 'cause most marriage dissolve because of money problems and I taught them how to avoid that.  So, I mean, I just have an awesome rich life working with these ideas and with things which have helped me and helped others.  And, I'm just very grateful, and very blessed, you know.
Speaker 1: And, how is your father's reaction been through all this success?  I mean, he's gotta--
Speaker 2: Man, dad--it's a given.  You're Lassiter, ain't you?  (Laughter)  I mean, it's not even an issue.  It's not even an issue.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, he helps my brother preach out there.  My brother is one of the pastors at Christ Universal Temple [Chicago, Illinois], at Johnnie Colemon's [Reverend Dr. Johnnie Colemon] church and they go out there.  And, I take him out there whenever Herb's preaching and I take him out there, you know.  And, he's--you know, he's connected.  He got the word, he's clear.  Daddy expects this.  He's expects it.  It's nothing that he doesn't expect.  He's very comfortable with it, you know.  'Cause he know they could even be better.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he knew what he was doing (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh, he knew what he was doing.  He's amazing, amazing man.  I wish I could've met my grandfather who died when he was eleven years old.  'Cause my grandfather--my dad talks about his grandfather the way I talk about my dad.  I mean, granddaddy would've had to be awesome.  He had four jobs, raising eleven kids.  His wife never worked.  He raised them all very well.  He had four full-time careers going at the same time in Alabama.  All self-employed kind of things.  Self-reliance.  Awesome!  I mean, just think about it.  Awesome!

Speaker 1: Last question is similar to legacy but different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: You know, the other day I was at a friend's funeral and I think about what [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther King Jr.] said on how'd he would like to be remembered and my friend said how she'd like to be remembered.  She gave us a whole list of things that she wanted to be remembered for, and I just don't--have not done that yet.  I have not, have not dealt with that.  I'm reading a book right now called, called the--I just got it, what's the name of that book?  It's called the, 'How We Die.'  'How We Die.'  And, I just haven't dealt with that yet.  I think that I would be remembered most right now if I were looking--if I was in that same room again in '79 [1979] with these six people looking the barrel of me.  I think what they told me then was that, if I spend my time being mission-oriented as opposed to commission-oriented, I would be much better off.  And, maintain my attitude about the benefits that I provide, rather than money that I make.  And, from time to time that gets confused, you know.  And, to think about this enormous money I'm making on this case and as opposed to the benefits that I'm provided for this particular firm or this particular family.  And so, I would like to be, in the future, become much more mission minded.  Since the money's coming, I don't have to worry about that, think about that; just to become more mission, more benefit minded in my every activity.

It's called a Prudential President's Citation.  And, every year from 1969 to 1979, we had a celebration because we always landed in the top 10 percent of the company during those years.  And, I would speak at the podium, thanking everybody for what they were doing; what they had done.

Speaker 1: This picture was taken with the valedictorian of the December '99 [1999] class of University of Illinois Business School [Champaign, Illinois] and the dean of the business school, and yours truly.  It was taken because I had just com--given the commencement address at the University of Illinois Business School commencement exercise in June--December of 1999.  I was selected because I was the president of the alumni association at that time and that's tradition that I was able to carry forward.  The speech was taught--was also printed in this article that's with my picture.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: This picture was taken by the Prudential [Insurance Company] when I retired as a thank you for having spent thirty-seven, thirty-three years with them.

Speaker 2: There we go.  Okay.
Speaker 1: This picture is my hero, W. Ellis Stewart, who died in 1955 and it's his program from his funeral services.  He was a person that graduated from the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois] and was very active in my church.  And, motivated me to go into the insurance business when I was in elementary school, and high school, and college.  And, I graduated from the same university he graduated from, did the same thing that he did.  In my life, became a president of an insurance company as he had become exec vice president of his insurance company.  And, it was just a thrill to, to see his picture once more and to be part of his life, 'cause he made mine possible.
