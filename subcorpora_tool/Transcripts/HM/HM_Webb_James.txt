Speaker 1: My name is Sasha Daltonn, and I'm your interviewer, and Scott [Scott Stearns] is your videographer.  And Julieanna Richardson, the president of HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] is observing today.  We'd like to get started by first saying--asking you to spell your name, including your middle name and your last name.

Speaker 1: What does that O stand for?
Speaker 2: (Gesture).
Speaker 1: Oh (laughter), Okay.  And your date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, O-K-R-U-M, if that's (laughter)--it's, it's a family name.  It's interesting.  At one time it was O-A-K-R-U-M, and I took out the A.  And I have no idea of the oak and rum.  I guess it had something to do with--but, in any event, that's it.
Speaker 1: And that's (simultaneous)--

Story_ID: 572105
Speaker 1: Well, now the first thing I'd like to do is just ask you five People magazine-ish type questions--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --okay.  The first question is, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Ah, geez, that's--I, I'd have to say fried chicken and bacon, probably my two most favorite foods.
Speaker 1: And your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Christmas.
Speaker 1: Favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: The beach.  I love Hawaii.  I go there fairly often.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, first thing I'd like to do--
Speaker 2: (JULIEANNA RICHARDSON):  Phrase or saying.
Speaker 1: Pardon me?
Speaker 2: (JULIEANNA RICHARDSON):  Phrase or saying.
Speaker 1: Oh, your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, there is something that I carried with me in my wallet that I discovered oh, I think back in Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I carried it for years.  "I always listen to advice.  It's needless to rece- to refuse it.  Besides the giver thinks me nice, and I don't have to use it."
Story_ID: 572106
Speaker 1: I'd like for you to tell me something about your mother, starting with her name.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was Bessie Ruth; Eubanks [Bessie Eubanks Webb] was her maiden name.  And she was truly the sweetest, most gentle woman that I think I've ever known.  She was very religious.  In the period that I grew up, she was the perfect mother.  Her, she--I can't, I can't picture her, except in church, without an apron.  She--that was the first thing that she, she put on.  Every day after she got dressed she would put on the apron.  And she would spend most of her time in the kitchen cooking and, and cleaning, as women did in those days.
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in, I think it was called Whitesville, Georgia; pretty large family.  I think there were seven sisters and one brother.
Speaker 1: And did she share any stories with you about her growing up?  And if so, tell us about them.
Speaker 2: Well, just a few, not a lot.  I, I had a, I have a sister [Etta Webb Young], and I think she spent more time with my sister.  I was in the street a lot as a boy.  But, she did share a few about she was a teacher and some of her experiences as a teacher in a segregated society, because all of her bosses were, were white, of course, you know. And she would tell stories of the difficulty that she had in, in getting the necessary tools and equipment and books and things like that--
Speaker 1: And about what year was--
Speaker 2: --for her kids.
Speaker 1: What year are we talking?
Speaker 2: Well, she, she got her degree I think in the, around 1920 or so.  So we're talking about mid-'20s [1920s], 1920s when she was teaching.  I know that she eventually became a principal of a very small school.  I don't know if they were one room schools at the time, but clearly very small.  But, that's, that's the most of I--most that I know about--
Speaker 1: Do you know where she went to college?
Speaker 2: She, she graduated from Spelman, but her degree says Spelman Seminary [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  At the time it was in--I'm not so sure what, what that connection is.  But there was--I've, I've known I've--since, I've met a number of people that, that were there at the same time she was, surprisingly enough.
Speaker 1: Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 572107
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your father and what was his name?
Speaker 2: I'm a junior.  My dad's name was James O. Webb, Sr.  And I know that he, he attended North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Mechanical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].  I don't think he finished, but I think he attended there at least a couple of years; very hardworking man; very successful in his early years.  He was born in, actually, he was born in Bramwell County, West Virginia [sic. Bramwell, West Virginia], but apparently he moved to Virginia and spent quite a bit of time in Virginia around Roanoke.  But then he ended up going to Columbus, Ohio, some way and did very well.  It's--he tells a story, and I've heard it from others, that he got in the coal and feed business and was very successful, successful to the extent that he actually had a boxcar that would hold his, his coal or his feed, and had a railroad spur that they would park the boxcar on.  And then he would load his trucks from that boxcar.  Apparently, he used his, his profits to purchase apartment buildings and would rent them out.  This was in the '20s [1920s].  And so when the Depression [Great Depression] came, people could not afford to pay him; he could not afford to pay for the coal and feed, and he essentially went bankrupt and ended up just walking away from everything in Columbus and going to New York and started sweeping floors in the, it was either the Hippodrome [Hippodrome Theatre, New York, New York] or Palace Theatre in, in New York City [New York, New York] to start all over again.
Speaker 1: You said he was successful in his early years.  What did he do?
Speaker 2: Well, that was it.  He was an entrepreneur (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, that was it, okay.
Speaker 2: He was an entrepreneur and, and apparently did very, very well financially.
Speaker 1: What do you know about your father's background, his family?  Do you know anything, your grandparents?
Speaker 2: He didn't talk about his background much.  I--his--I, I saw his mother a couple of times.  Her name was Sarah Brown, and she was still living in Roanoke, Virginia.  As a matter of fact, I recall visiting them once when, when I was a very small child.  His father, he was born out of, out of wedlock.  His father, I understand, was a, a white fellow that she worked for.  She did laundry and things of that nature for various families in the area, and apparently one of those families resulted in, in his birth.  And of course, when I was a child that was something that people did not talk about, and so he really didn't share very much at all about, about his childhood.
Speaker 1: Now, did your father have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: He, to my knowledge, he had a half-sister who lived in New Jersey.  And he did stay in touch with her periodically, I know.  But he, again, he, he just didn't talk very much about any of his past.  He had no sisters--I mean no brothers.  The only one that I'm familiar with is the, the half-sister, whom I never met by the way.
Speaker 1: Did your father share any stories with you about his growing up or--
Speaker 2: Not, not his childhood.  About the only thing that he shared was related to his, his entrepreneurial activities in Columbus, Ohio.
Story_ID: 572108
Speaker 1: Can you talk a little bit more about that, his [Webb's father, James O. Webb, Sr.] boxcar business [in Columbus, Ohio] and--
Speaker 2: Well, I guess he, he, he felt that it was--he, he always wanted, I guess, to, to own his own business.  And he would sell to, not to businesses, but to consumers.  In those days, you know, chicken feed or, or livestock feed was, was something that was very important for the--in the economy, even, even in cities.  And of course, coal was the source of fuel for, for heating as well as a number of other things, and so it's something that everyone needed.  And so he decided that that's what he would do, would be to provide those two products.  And as people needed them, he would have his trucks to go to the boxcars and load up, and he would make his deliveries to the various homes and those that he had regular customers apparently.  And, but I think it was, it was the fact that he put all of his profits into purchasing apartment buildings, where he really got his wealth.  And I understand he was a millionaire, which was fairly significant in those days.  And he also did something at the, at the county courthouse, or the state building I guess it was.  He, he related to the, to the auditor's office.  And I'm not sure exactly what that was, but he referred to that on a couple of occasions.  But that's about the extent of what I know about it, other than the fact that he did lose it all during the Depression [Great Depression].
Speaker 1: Do you know if he was responsible for or involved in other businesses besides that and real estate?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of, no, not that I know of, because he, once he lost it all, then he had to start all over again, as I said, in, in New York [New York], sweeping floors.  And then from there he moved to Cleveland, Ohio.  Actually, my, my sister [Etta Webb Young] was born in, in New York.  And, and so he had the young child, and, and they moved to, moved to Cleveland, Ohio.  And he, he got a job at what was then called Fisher Foods [Fisher Foods, Inc.], which was a fairly large chain of grocery stores and fairly quickly was promoted to the manager of a store.  He was the first black manager that Fisher Foods ever had.  And he was very successful at that.  In those days they had contests between stories, and a number of things in our house were prizes, you know, radios.  We had radios early on and things of that nature, beautiful lamps and things like that he would win as a result of these, these contests.  Interesting, at, at one point he was promoted to, I think it was a district supervisor was the title, which meant that he was over some fifteen or so store managers, whom of course were all white.  Well, they got their heads together and decided that they weren't interested in having a, a black boss.  And so the--they didn't demote him.  They put him back in the store, but they kept his compensation the same as though he were a district supervisor, but he could not function as a district supervisor.  So they put him back in the store, and that's where he spent the rest of his career, was as a manager of a store.
Story_ID: 572109
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your family tree?
Speaker 2: Some of my relatives have, have, have gone fairly far back.  But I've attempted to do some of that, particularly with my father [James O. Webb, Sr.], since so little was known.  Since I live in Durham, North Carolina, now, it's not too far from Roanoke [Virginia].  And a couple of years ago I did go to Roanoke and ended up at the library where they have a genealogy section.  And Webbs are very prolific in that area, which is, was very interesting to me.  But I, I couldn't satisfy the curiosity because I, I just couldn't get to the bottom of, of, of why Webbs were so prolific, other than the fact that there was a book there that was published by a person by the name of James O. Webb.  And, well, let me take that back.  I'm not so sure that the O was there, but James Webb.  And as a matter of fact, the title of the book was 'The James Webbs in Virginia' [ph.] or something like that.  So, apparently there were enough of them that it motivated this person to, this particular James Webb, to, to, to write a book on it.  And of course, I, I couldn't take the book out, and that's something that they kept in their archives.  And so I didn't get very but then other than to discover that, that he was born in Bramwell County [sic. Bramwell], which is in, in West Virginia, which was right across the Virginia line.  And so that's my next stop.  I intend to go to Bramwell County and see what I can find there because there was no record of him in the, in the Roanoke area.  I did find his mother [Sarah Brown] in the 1920 census.  And she was living with the, the half-sister that I mentioned in Virginia.  So it's been interesting sort of digging into it, but I really can't say that I've gotten very far.  And on my mother's [Bessie Eubanks Webb] side, there is a family of Hutchinsons [ph.], and there's another name that I don't recall right now that apparently--and Eubanks, but there's also another name.  But apparently they, somewhere or another, they are interrelated; those families, those three families are interrelated.  My grandmother was, and my mother and my grandmother was a Eubanks [Fannie Eubanks].  But that's--I haven't been able to go much further than that.  That group I discovered just only about oh, five or six years ago has a reunion every other year at different locations where there's a concentration of, of family.  And it just so happens that each year I've not been able to go the last two or three reunions, but I do hope to get there sometime soon.  I think that the next one will be--I don't think it's coming up this year, but maybe next year.
Speaker 1: Have you had any contact with your mother's--with your father's half-sister?
Speaker 2: No.  I'm, I'm sure she's passed now 'cause my dad was, was born in 1890, and my mother was born in 1900, so, you know, all of her siblings are, are gone at this point.
Story_ID: 572110
Speaker 1: --Like to talk about your early years.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: You were born in--
Speaker 2: Cleveland, Ohio. Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Cleveland, Ohio.  What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Interesting question.  Well, my earliest memory was really as a very small child.  You know, in those days, the big thing was making mud pies and things of that nature.  And I remember--this will really date me.  I remember the, the ragman coming around with his little pull cart.  He's saying, "Rags for sale," or something like that and (laughter) scared the life out of me.  And all I remember is my sister [Etta Webb Young] grabbing me and, and dragging me into the house, up some steps and into the house.  That's, that, that's my earliest memory, my sister saving my life I guess.
Story_ID: 572111
Speaker 1: Can you please describe what your family life was like?
Speaker 2: Very enjoyable.  It, it--obviously because of my dad's [James O. Webb, Sr.] circumstances, we had, the family had very little money.  We lived in, what in those days was called the projects, public housing.  It was very nice public housing, as, as I recall it.  They were garden apartments, and we had a little courtyard in the middle of, of these garden apartments where, large enough for us to play baseball, you know, for small kids' baseball.  And I recall my good friends living there.  You had a lot of wonderful days of just playing together.  And we lived in the projects until I was about, I think I was nine years old when we moved out.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the--
Speaker 2: Of the projects?
Speaker 1: --of the project?
Speaker 2: You know I really don't, but my school was Case-Woodland [Case-Woodland School], and it was in that area of Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: What was that area called?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I just don't recall.  I just don't recall.  I'm, I'm not even sure that it had a name.  It may have, but I just don't recall.  And then from there, we, we moved into a very interesting area that had been primarily a Jewish area.  But Jewish families were beginning to, to move out, and a couple of black families had moved in.  But I think my dad moved out there because see, the schools were very, very good.  And he was really big on education and wanted to see to it that I got the very best education that he could possibly provide for me.  And, and so I ended up going to Miles Stan- Standish Elementary School [Miles Standish Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio], starting off in the fourth grade.  I was on the young side because I had skipped a part of the third grade.  I do remember being invited into the principal's office and having to read a page or two from 'Tom Sawyer' ['The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,' Mark Twain].  And as a result of that, they skipped me for a grade.  And so I, I, when I moved, I went straight into the fourth grade.
Story_ID: 572112
Speaker 1: Was your mother [Bessie Eubanks Webb] teaching school at this time?
Speaker 2: No, my mother never taught while I was, you know, a child after she had had us.  She--I'm not so sure that she ever taught outside of the South, after she had moved, after she got married [to Webb's father, James O. Webb, Sr.].  You know, I'm not so sure she ever taught then.  Most of her teaching stories and experiences that I recall were while she was still in the South.  But it was, that was a very good experience too; a different set of friends, of course.  And I enjoyed school.  I was one of those few people I guess that--I enjoyed it; I enjoyed science and math and things like that.  And, and they provided us an opportunity to study the, the starred chapters, which allowed us to get a little bit ahead.  So, by the time I finished high school [Glenville High School, Cleveland, Ohio], I went to college [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I was, I was--I probably had gone through most of the freshman courses that I had, that I took in college.
Story_ID: 572113
Speaker 1: Some interesting things happened though as I progressed, as, as more black families moved into the community.  A number of my playmates obviously were, were white, girls and boys.  And I, I, I recall that everything was fine from the fourth grade through the ninth grade [at Miles Standish Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio], and in those days you started high school in the tenth grade.  And they stopped playing with me.  They stopped coming around, the girls in particular, nothing to do with me.  And, and even my close--one of my boyfriends, you know, stopped having much to do with me.  We had been close for years.  And he finally told me that his parents did not want me coming over to the house anymore and things of that nature.  And so, you know, that, that was a rude awakening that--and I didn't understand it because I, I had never really been exposed that much to segregation or feelings along those lines.  But I accepted it.  I, I had black friends too, since they were moving into the community.  And so it--I remember it, but I don't think it had--and it had an impression on me at the time, but I don't think it did any real damage.  In high school, however, when I was thinking about college and things to do, just one of those experiences that you don't forget, I had a high school counselor that was advising, you know, like they do even today.  And I had taken an exam, which in order--as everyone had--in order to identify what their strengths were and what their weaknesses were and so forth.  And I was strong in artistic, scientific.  And I had wanted to be a physician since I was five years old.  Our, our family physician had given me all of his medical books.  It was just a given that I was gonna be a, a surgeon.  And, and so I, I put down on my form that I wanted to be a, a physician, surgeon.  And in my interview with him, he told me that it was his conclusion--it was based upon my examinations that I should be a presser and that I should press clothes.  Meanwhile, I had a good friend whose dad--white fellow whose, whose dad was a plumber.  And he wanted to follow in his dad's footsteps and be a plumber.  And he told him he should be a surgeon.  So (laughter), so, that was sort of my first real exposure to how unrealistic and unfair people can be.  So, again, because of the strength of my family, my dad [James O. Webb, Sr.] in particular, but also my mother [Bessie Eubanks Webb], it, it really didn't faze me very much, although my dad, I understand he didn't tell me about it-I understand later that he had gone up to the school and had a discussion with the, with the fellow that did this.
Story_ID: 572114
Speaker 1: What were holidays like in your life, in your childhood?
Speaker 2: Well, holidays for me were, those were times to just get out in the street and play more, more ball.  You know, we played street ball and things of that nature.  And, and that's about what--you know.
Speaker 1: Any special events or--
Speaker 2: Well, sometimes there would be family get togethers, where we would get together with my, my parents' [Bessie Eubanks Webb and James O. Webb, Sr.] friends, and, and we would picnic.  You know, picnics were a big thing in those days too.  But again, that just mean playing more ball, you know, eating and then playing ball.
Story_ID: 572115
Speaker 1: Okay, Mr. Webb [HistoryMaker James O. Webb], we were talking about your activities when you were younger and things that you remember.  I would just like to just go back a little bit further and talk about your neighborhood.  You mentioned the projects.  Tell us a little bit about that, a little bit more.  Do you remember any sights, and sounds, and smells of that area?
Speaker 2: Not much, but, but I, I, I do have the sense that we were sort of protected, because I know going outside of the area it was hustle and bustle.  But within our little courtyard and in our environment, now maybe we were deep into the projects.  I don't know, because the years that I was there, you know, it was so few, and I was so young.
Speaker 1: And how old were you then?
Speaker 2: As I said, I left when I was nine, and I think we--it's the only place that I truly remember, so we may have moved there when I was maybe five years old or so, because I know I went to grade school--I started kindergarten there as well [at Case-Woodland School, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: You moved there when you were five.  You don't remember--no one ever mentioned where you lived before then?
Speaker 2: My sister [Etta Webb Young] did, yes.  And, and, and--
Speaker 1: And what did she say?
Speaker 2: We lived in a--apparently we rented part of a house from a relative.  Which relative, I don't know.  It was a private home.  That's where the mud pie story--we, that's where we were making mud pies when the--of course, I was only about two or three then.  That's why it's just a vague memory, a fright.  But that's, that's, that's all I remember about that.
Speaker 1: And then at five, from five to nine, you moved to the projects?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, so we were in the projects for about four years.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the people that you associated with there?
Speaker 2: In the projects?
Speaker 1: Yes, and are you still in touch with any of them now?
Speaker 2: No, I lost touch with them long, long time ago.  But, yeah, there was a family by the name of Wesson [ph.], and there were two boys, Sonny Wesson [ph.], and who was my age.  So, I remember him mostly, and we were playmates.  Yeah, we played ball together and, and rode our bicycles together and things of that nature.  I had no sense of being in the projects.  I didn't understand that until later, and it was public housing.  There was never a discussion.  And so I just thought that okay, this is where we live, and, and I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed, as I said, I enjoyed school, and I enjoyed my friends, and we had fun.
Speaker 1: And this was the time that your dad [James O. Webb, Sr.] was working for Fisher Foods [Fisher Foods, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 572116
Speaker 1: And the elementary school you went to was?
Speaker 2: In the projects it was Case-Woodland [Case-Woodland School, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: And what do you remember about that?
Speaker 2: Not much, other than skipping the grade.  I, I, I remember a teacher there by the name of Ms. Latimer [ph.].  I remember her as being very supportive, very encouraging, and I believe that she was the one that marched me into the principal's office and had me to read 'Tom Sawyer' ['The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,' Mark Twain] for the principal in order to get the--to skip the grade.
Speaker 1: Your mother [Bessie Eubanks Webb] was a teacher.  Did she work with you academically at home?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I do recall that we had maybe about fifteen or twenty books, mostly on history.  And I loved reading, and I remember reading those books over and over and over again.  I remember there was also a geography book.  And so I knew the material in those books very, very well, and I--
Speaker 1: And these were books above your grade level?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, they were adult books and you know, that had to do with--I mean they were high school level or college level books.  I'm not sure where they came from, but I read them until they became raggedy, you know.  And, and so I, I knew all of the states and all of the capitals and, and all of, all of this kind of information.  I knew my geography, and because that's all I had to do.  I played a lot, but I also read a lot.
Story_ID: 572117
Speaker 1: What were some of the memorable things you remember about elementary school?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember more, obviously, about Miles Standish [Miles Standish Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio] because I was, I was there once we moved to, to the new area, from the ninth--from the time I was nine years old to fourth grade until the end of elementary school, which was the sixth grade.  In those days, then we had junior high [Empire Junior High School, Cleveland, Ohio] that went from the seventh to the ninth and then, of course, high school [Glenville High School, Cleveland, Ohio], ten to twelfth.  The things I remember about Miles Standish primarily was its discipline.  The principal--I believe her name was Mrs. Carlson [ph.]--was a, a, a serious disciplinarian.  When we went from class to class, we, we went single file against the, the walls, in, in a single file line against the walls, and we were quiet.  And Mrs. Carlson walked the halls as we went from class to class.  And she would remind us that an empty wagon makes the most noise and these kinds of things.  And to this day, I tend to be somewhat quiet.  I listen more than I talk.  It doesn't sound like it right now, but, but I do.  And, but I, I learned a certain stoicism from her and a quietness from her.  I remember that in particular.  I remember in the playground at recess that I was very fast.  I was a very fast runner.  And so, as a result, I, I became the leader of an, a number of games, even though I was small for my age and really underweight.  I was very thin and, and so forth but, but fast.  And so, in those days, if you, if you achieved athletically, that, then you had some stature.  And as I recall that, I recall some of the friends that, that I actually, I became friends in the fourth grade that, as I say, remained my friends until the tenth grade when were artificially separated.  And I just remember that being a very, a very good experience.
Story_ID: 572118
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now you said that you moved from the projects and that you moved to another neighborhood.  Tell us a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Well, the neighborhood was referred to at the time as the Gold Coast and had very nice homes.  It was in a section of Cleveland [Ohio] called the Glenville area.  And at that time, Glenville had a number of--I, I--it had a number of parks.  But the, the main was, was something called the Cultural Gardens [Cleveland Cultural Gardens, Cleveland, Ohio], which was absolutely beautiful.  They had gardens from different countries of the world and trains, big, cars were at least this big, running on tracks through the entire garden.  It was, it was unbelievably beautiful, with little falls and things of that nature.  And I would pass it every day going, walking to school [Miles Standish Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio].  So it was a beautiful area and, and quite a transition.  Even though I liked being in the, in the projects, this was a very--it was different.  I say that it was called the Gold Coast, but there were some people that called it Oatmeal Row because it was a changing area.  As I said, it was primarily an area of Jewish families, and, and then African American families began to move in.  And because of the fact that it was an expensive area, the feeling was that those blacks that did move in had to confine their meals to oatmeal, so they called it Oatmeal Row.  So, you know, it is sort of a, a little folklore.
Story_ID: 572119
Speaker 1: Your dad [James O. Webb, Sr.] was still working with the--
Speaker 2: Fisher Foods [Fisher Foods, Inc.].
Speaker 1: --with Fisher Foods--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) so he must have been doing fairly well financially.
Speaker 2: I think he progressed pretty well.  I, I, I think that their compensation was pretty good.  And as, as I said, he won lots of contests that they had because he was just a, he was a good businessman, and at least that was my impression.  And I learned a lot from him 'cause I worked in the store sometimes, quite a bit as a matter of fact.  And so it could be that some of those, some of prizes might have been cash, and I didn't know about those.  I could see the other things, the, the radios, and tables, and chairs and things like that, that he was winning.  But he could have received some cash bonuses as well.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: But your mother [Bessie Eubanks Webb] didn't work.
Speaker 2: My mother did not work, no.
Speaker 1: What would you say--how would you describe them as a team?
Speaker 2: First let me explain that it, it, it's really interesting.  In, in those days, you know, my dad was, was rarely home.  I mean, because men in those days worked six days.  Their workweek was a six, six day workweek, and work hours were maybe ten hours, you know.  And his store was on the other side of town.  And so, he would leave in the morning before I'd get up.  And after he closed the store at maybe six, seven o'clock, he would then have to get the store ready for the next day and stock, restock things and so forth.  And he might get home maybe at nine o'clock.  And so I, I didn't see him too much during the week and of course on Saturdays as well.  I saw him mostly on Sundays.  And he was an avid churchgoer.  He was chairman of the trustee board at one of the large Baptist churches in Cleveland [Ohio] and had been--that's all I remember about him, is that he was always chairman of the trustee board, and so he would go to church every Sunday morning.  And, and he would stay afterwards and oversee the counting of the money.  And so he wouldn't get home until maybe 2:00, 2:30, and then we would immediately have dinner.  So that was my time with my dad, mostly was dinners on Sunday and then hours after, after dinner.
Speaker 1: And was your mother active in the church?
Speaker 2: She was not active in the church, no.  She was an avid churchgoer, but she was not active in the church--

Speaker 1: I recall that you mentioned earlier that her degree, said Spelman Seminary [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you think that she [Webb's mother, Bessie Eubanks Webb] may have at some time been leaning towards a ministerial lifestyle?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  The only thing that I can, that I attach to the seminary is some--because most of the, of the African American colleges and universities [HBCUs] in those days had church roots.  And because it, it also--I think at one time Spelman was, was only a two year school.  And it might have been a two year school when she was here.  I don't know, because she was, I, I, I know she was there between 1918 and 1920.  And, and she had a degree, and that's where I get that name from, because we have her degree.  But that's about all I know about it, and, and it's speculation at that, you know, about the, the name.  I, I don't know where the seminary came.
Speaker 1: Did you say earlier that you had met some ladies that knew your mom--
Speaker 2: Well, interestingly--
Speaker 1: --from school?
Speaker 2: --enough, some next door neighbors, when we lived in Hyde Park here in Chicago [Illinois] years ago, we became close friends with our next door neighbors, the Smalls, and found out that [HistoryMaker] Joan Small's family, who was from that area in, in Georgia, and the more we talked, the more similarities came out.  And eventually we got down to the core of it and, and found out that the two families not only knew each other, but apparently Joan's mother's sister was one of my mother's close friends.  And so we mentioned it to my mother the next time we visited, and she said, "Oh, sure," you know, and, and she, she, she knew her.  As a matter of fact, she then dug out a photograph and, of, of herself and Joan's aunt.  And Joan had it--it was an old photograph, and so she had it fixed up, and, and, and framed, and gave it to her mother as a, as a gift.
Speaker 1: You're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Small world.
Speaker 1: It is, a very small world.
Story_ID: 572121
Speaker 1: You have one sister.
Speaker 2: One sister.
Speaker 1: And her name is?
Speaker 2: Etta Inez [Etta Webb Young].  The Etta comes from the paternal grandmother's [Sarah Brown] middle name.  And the Inez comes from the maternal grandmother's [Fannie Eubanks] middle name, Etta Inez.
Speaker 1: And how is she?
Speaker 2: She is two years older than I.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was born in 1929.  She'll, yeah, she'll be seventy-eight in March.
Story_ID: 572122
Speaker 1: So are there any other memories that you have of growing up that we can--that you'd like to share with us?
Speaker 2: Well, there are a number of interesting anecdotes, as you, as you sort of coach my memory here.  It, one thought, not necessarily a pleasant one--it's, it's a plus and a minus--but it was when I was in the seventh grade, which I guess was junior high school [Empire Junior High School, Cleveland, Ohio].  Science was always one of my favorite subjects and, and I liked to believe I was inventing things.  And we used to have science contests and, and competition, which, you know, every school has those things.  And I came up with something at one time that was quite interesting.  It was a game that, in which I, I used the concept of completing electrical circuits to, to, to get the right answer.  It was a comic book game where I had the picture of the comic character on a, a big laundry board with brass tacks coming through, and then underneath was wires running.  And in order to get the right answer you had to put a flashlight battery on the tack and then, and then the other end of the cord on the, on another tack the name of the author, the writer, of that particular com- comic book strip.  And that would--if it completed the circuit, then this light would light up.  Well, I entered it.  I won a prize.  And about two or three years later, I saw the same concept in a game in the stores.  And I often wondered (laughter) if, if my science teacher might have taken it and marketed it or something.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the game--
Speaker 2: That didn't have--
Speaker 1: --that was in the store?
Speaker 2: Oh, in the--no, no, no.  But it was, it was a concept.  There--after a while several games appeared like that in stores that were based upon this concept of completing an electrical circuit.  So I just happened to remember that one.  That's a, sort of a memory.  I don't know if--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --it's a fond memory or not.  It's fond in the sense that I achieved something important.  It's not so fond in the sense that I may have not capitalized on something.
Story_ID: 572123
Speaker 1: Any other things like that?
Speaker 2: No.  You know, I'm, I'm sure that if I tweaked it enough, something would come to mind, but nothing comes to mind right now.
Speaker 1: So anything that stands out special in ele- from elementary school [Miles Standish Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: From elementary school?  Well, you know, there's one thing, not, not related to the school.  But when we moved into the area [Glenville, Cleveland, Ohio], the next door neighbor had--it was a, a girl about my age, and we used to play together.  And her--she had an uncle who I really looked up to.  He was, he was--he dressed very, very well and had a very tough demeanor, but, but sort of gentle.  I remember we, we both had victory gardens at one time.  This was during World War II [WWII].  And, and we--I was raising tomato plants.  And, and we had these little green fat worms that were, that would come on tomato plants in those days.  You didn't have all the spray stuff to kill them.  And he would come over and would put newspaper in a tin can and put the worms in there and light it, burn them up.  Well, my, my parents [Bessie Eubanks Webb and James O. Webb, Sr.] always told me not to, not to idolize him so much.  I didn't understand exactly why until I saw the newspaper one day where I think it was Bugsy Siegel's outfit was interested in him, and he eventually passed away.  But I, I thought that was a very interesting experience (laughter).
Speaker 1: When you say they were interested in him, can you elaborate on that a little?
Speaker 2: Well, they--I, I guess some way or, or another he had crossed someone, and, but he was involved with them in some way or another.  And, and I just thought that that was so interesting and so fascinating, to have known someone from quote (air quotes), the underworld (laughter).
Story_ID: 572124
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your neighbors when you moved to the Gold Coast [Glenville, Cleveland, Ohio] and your relationship with the community.
Speaker 2: Well, when we first moved there was only one other African American family and the Hogans [ph.], fairly large--I think they had four or five kids, one my age.  And we played together to, to some extent, and they lived down the street.  But obviously, if I was gonna play with anybody, most of my friends were white.  And I had not had white friends, obviously living in the projects, because it was essentially an African American community.  But it was not a problem, girls or boys, you know.  We would play marbles in my backyard.  And sometimes I'd go over to their house and play or eat at their house, or they'd come over to my house and, and eat or have lunch or dinner--
Speaker 1: And you felt--
Speaker 2: --or something.
Speaker 1: --welcome?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it, it wasn't an issue, you know, until--
Speaker 1: Until--
Speaker 2: --(laughter) until the tenth grade [at Glenville High School, Cleveland, Ohio], and then it changed.
Speaker 1: And what do you think happened that made it become an issue?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: And why tenth grade?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: What do you think there was any significance (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Perhaps that's, that's the time that parents tended to see their children as becoming adults, and they had to, and then, then, and they just felt that they had to teach them a different way of life than they had been accustomed to.  Maybe up 'til then they considered it just innocence.  And all of a sudden it might change, and they weren't going to have that.
Speaker 1: And can you just tell us a little bit about what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said before, in, in most instances nothing was said.  But people just began to distance themselves and, except for my, my male friend, who--my closest male friend, who's--made it very clear that--and he was bothered by it as well.  But nevertheless, he felt that he had to obey his parents, and that was that I--he should not invite me over to the house as much or if at all, and he should not spend as much time with me as he had been before.
Speaker 1: Was that--did your sister [Etta Webb Young] feel that same effect?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  We never, we never talked about it, so I really don't know.  Things like this, quite frankly, I--again, that stoicism that I had learned in elementary school [Miles Standish Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio]--I, I, I didn't share with anyone.  I didn't, didn't neces---
Speaker 1: Not even your parents [Bessie Eubanks Webb and James O. Webb, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: No.  I always felt it was my issue and I'd deal with it.
Story_ID: 572125
Speaker 1: Who would you say influenced you the most as a young person?
Speaker 2: Hm. I think there were several people.  Both my mother [Bessie Eubanks Webb] and father [James O. Webb, Sr.] had a lot of influence, and my father, because I, you know, I just observed his industriousness.  And, and when I worked in the store [Fisher Foods, Inc.] with him, I admired the way that he, he, he treated his customers.  They were friends, and they bought (laughter); you know, they bought and bought and bought more.  And they were there because of him.  Yes, they were coming to buy groceries as well, but there was obviously a, a strong relationship because it was, it was a neighborhood store.  It's not like it is now.  It's where you--you know, all of the food was behind the counters.  And so you had your little pad, and people would come up and they'd have their shopping lists, and they would tell you what they, what they wanted.  You would write it down, and then you'd go away, and you would collect it off the shelves and, and that kind of thing, and then come back, put it all there, add it up.  And so you--it was an interpersonal kind of relationship that was going on with the customers (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How old was your father when you were born?
Speaker 2: Let's see, he was born in 1890, and I was born in '31 [1931], so he was forty-one years old.
Speaker 1: And your mother?
Speaker 2: She was ten years younger; she was thirty-one.
Story_ID: 572126
Speaker 1: So they were not your typical young parents?
Speaker 2: Well, no.  My, my mother [Bessie Eubanks Webb] had never been married before, but my father [James O. Webb, Sr.] had been married before apparently when he was Columbus [Ohio].  And the best I can understand from that is that he was--I guess he had shared this with my mother, who shared it with my sister [Etta Webb Young], who shared it with me.  But he was, he was married to a concert pianist.  And, and, and they had quite a--between her position and his money.  They had a fairly significant social life I guess.  And the story goes--my sister told me that, that they were invited to a, a, a ball or a party or something like that, and, and she washed her hair, and it was in the wintertime.  She washed her hair just before going out and ended up getting pneumonia.  And, and of course, in those days, pneumonia was, was fatal, more fatal than it is today, and died as a result of it at a very young age.  And I understand that he took that very, very hard.  I am not aware nor is any of my family aware of any children that, that he had.
Speaker 1: Did anyone ever say or did your parents say how they met then?
Speaker 2: Again, I get it (laughter) second and third hand.  And it's, it's my understanding that my--one of her sisters, my aunt, and her husband lived in Columbus and somewhere or another introduced, introduced the--to--introduced them.  And I'm not sure exactly how that happened, but it was, that's, that's the relation, how the relationship developed.
Story_ID: 572127
Speaker 1: Okay, so now we are about to graduate from high school.  And that was what year?
Speaker 2: That was 1949.  And I told you the story of the guidance counselor.  That was the most significant thing that I can recall.  But the other thing that, of, of, of great significance I think is that most of my friends were going to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].  Glenville High School [Cleveland, Ohio] at that time, they had what they called--every graduating senior had to take what was then called Ohio state psychological examination.  And, and based upon the results of the graduating classes, that's how they ranked the schools, the quality of the schools.  And Glenville was ranked either first or second consistently.  And, and, and so the students were--could get into almost any college or university that they, that they chose.  And so I wanted to go to Ohio State with my friends.  And this was the first time that my mother [Bessie Eubanks Webb] just put her foot down about something, and so said no, that I was going to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].  And her reason for that, and my father [James O. Webb, Sr.] supported her, was that I had not, she felt, that I had not had enough experiences in the real world, and she was thinking racially; that I had lived for too long in an integrated community; I was naive; and she wanted me to go south and have a southern experience.  Furthermore, she had finished Spelman [Spelman Seminary; Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], and so she, she felt that Morehouse was the place that I should be, all-male school, African American men.  And of course, I didn't want to.  I fought her on it.  I came home Christmas; I still fought her on it.  But by the end of the, of the first year, yeah, I was a Morehouse convert.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I immersed myself into it more than most, and continued to be a Morehouse advocate, and still very active in doing whatever I can to, to help and be supportive.
Story_ID: 572128
Speaker 1: Now we're on our way to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  What preparation did you mother [Bessie Eubanks Webb] give you for going to the South?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I, I don't recall, but I don't, I, I don't want to say none, because I'm sure she must have said some things to me.  But, you know, being seventeen years old, I didn't hear most of it (laughter).  And I went down there.  There was another fellow that had been accepted to Morehouse from Cleveland [Ohio], and so we went together; in those days obviously the train.  And I got into trouble as soon as I got there.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: The--we got off the train, and a couple of upperclassmen met us at the train.  And as we were walking out of the train station, you know how you walk along the platform and we passed the flatbed car.  And there was a fellow, a white fellow there handling the trunks.  And I just happened to glance up, and he was handling my trunk.  And so I told the fellows, I said, "Wait a second."  And I said, "When do you think that'll be delivered to the school?"  And he ignored me.  And so I, I said it again: "When do you think they'll be delivered to the school?"  He said, "Are you talking to me, boy?"  I said, "Yeah, I'm talking to you," (laughter), you know.  And then by that time, the upperclassmen, one grabbed each arm and just sort of lifted me up and walked me out of the train station.  And when we got outside they said, "You just don't do that; you do not talk to him."  I said, "He was handling my trunk.  All I wanted to know--I asked him a decent question.  All I wanted to know is when the trunk was gonna be delivered."  And he said, "You don't talk to him."  And so there were a number of other incidents that occurred.  And, and finally, I was called into the dean's [Brailsford Reese Brazeal] office, and they confined me to thirteen acres of Morehouse campus for my own safety for the next six months.  So for six months I couldn't go off campus unless I had an upperclassman with me.
Speaker 1: Now what year was this?
Speaker 2: That was in 1949.
Story_ID: 572129
Speaker 1: And you said there were a couple of other things.  Do you remember what they were?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  I, I took a little job at a cafeteria downtown.  And you I--my job was to take the clean dishes out and put them on the cafeteria line or take the hot plates out and, and replenish the, the food.  And there were, of course, all white women working, you know, the line, the cafeteria line.  And there was a girl there about my age or, yeah, about my age.  And she would smile and speak, and I would smile and speak back.  It just so happened that both her mother and her sister worked there.  And the girl wasn't there one day.  As a matter of fact, we used to get our lunch together and sit at the same table back in the kitchen, okay.  And so I asked, I asked her sister, I said, "Where's your sister today?"  And she just looked at me and ran to her mother and said, "Mom, he asked me where my sister is."  And it created a little bit of stir around the place.  And then, I don't know if it was the same day or the next day, but the owner of the cafeteria called me up to his office.  And he was very pleasant about it, and he says, "I, I know your background."  He says, "I know that you're from the North, but we have a certain way of doing things down here, things that we do and we don't do.  And, and you broke that code, and so I'm asking you to understand, you know, understand this and behave accordingly."  And so I did, but I didn't like it.
Speaker 1: Had you had a girlfriend before you came to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, nobody really serious.
Speaker 1: Nothing, maybe not one of the girls from the community in the Gold Coast [Glenville, Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So then you really didn't understand (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I really didn't understand (laughter).  I really didn't understand.  Yeah, so I mean she was just a girl to me.
Story_ID: 572130
Speaker 1: And another time, once I--this is later on.  I was dating my wife [Frankie Lowe Webb].  And she, of course, lived out on Auburn Avenue, across the street from Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] and the King family and that group.  And I, I didn't ride public transportation that much because they had really discouraged me from going out into the city on my own.  But I was okay, and I was more mature, and so supposedly it was okay.  And so I got on the bus, and there were only African Americans on the bus.  And of course, in those days you were supposed to sit behind the last white person.  I don't care if the bus was empty, and the white person was in the second from the last row, you had to sit in the last row.  And so there were only African Americans on the bus, and so I sat right behind the bus driver, 'cause I really didn't know where I was going.  I thought that he would be helpful in telling me where to get off and that kind of thing.  It was a white bus driver of course.  And to--finally I got to my stop, and so I just got up and went down into the front well.  And he stopped, and he wouldn't open the door.  And so I said, "I want to get off here."  And he says, "You're not getting off here."  He says, "You'll get off the back.  You have to go to the back."  I said, "I was sitting up here; I'm standing in the well; I want to get off here."  And so then I, I looked back, 'cause I was thinking to myself this guy doesn't realize this is a busload of black folks.  And he has nerve, you know, in a black community, with a busload of black folks, telling me what I am and I'm not gonna do.  And so I looked back at, at the people on the bus, and they all turned and looked out the window.  And I thought to myself: oh, my god.  I'd, I'd better, I'd better do what I'm told to do here.  And it was the summertime.  And so I, I went to the back, step down.  He then opened the back door, and I got out the back door.  And as I walked toward the front of the bus, I heard someone say, "He must be from the North."  And I knew then that I was pretty much alone.  And my wife never would let me forget that because I was so--I'm not sure what I was feeling, but clearly it was a traumatic time in my life, because at least I always felt that even though I was having a problem with white people, that African Americans, we black people are together; we're gonna stick together.  But all of a sudden I felt very, very alone.  So it, it was, it was a key point in my life, turning point.
Story_ID: 572131
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your early years at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: I, well, as I said, I, I didn't like it that much.
Speaker 1: And why not?
Speaker 2: I, well, first of all, I had studied most of the things that they were teaching there, and I didn't have to go to class.  I, I made the honor roll throughout my freshman year without hardly opening a book because I had had it all in, in my schools.  And so I just felt that I was not gonna really get much out of Morehouse.  But it didn't take me long to realize that there was a lot more to Morehouse than the books.  And I think that's what my mother [Bessie Eubanks Webb] had been trying to tell me all along, that--
Speaker 1: Such as?
Speaker 2: Well, just being with black people, getting to know black people in a different setting.  You know, a lot of the kids came from professional homes.  I never really had that much association, other than in, in my own community [in Cleveland, Ohio].  But the people that I had grown up with, they, they were, they were black, but they weren't black (laughter), you know.  And, and so it, it opened up a whole new culture to me that I didn't know before.  So it taught me pride, confidence.  (Pause) Dr. Mays [Benjamin Mays] was a very special person.  And Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] spoke about--I think he attributes everything to Dr. Mays, and I think I do to, just listening to him talk, teaching men, very important.
Speaker 1: Did you have a personal relationship with him at all?
Speaker 2: I think every, every Morehouse man had a personal relationship with, with, with Dr. Mays.
Speaker 1: When you say some of the things he taught, such as?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the most important is that you can do anything you want to do; you can be anything that you want to be, just focus on it, set your mind to it and do it.
Speaker 1: Do you remember one thing that he may have said that may have impacted you more than anything else?
Speaker 2: I think be the best you can be in whatever you do.  He had a little story that he told about be the best.  If you're gonna be a street sweeper, be the best street sweeper.
Story_ID: 572132
Speaker 1: When you went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], what were your, what were your academic plans?  Were you planning to be a doctor?  Were you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I was gonna be a surgeon.  I'd wanted to be a surgeon since I was five years old, and you know, my, our family physician even gave me all of his medical books and everything, and so that was a given.  There was no question about it.  And my mother [Bessie Eubanks Webb] had, you know, she was just all into it.  You know, she had told me I had very small hands, and I would make a beautiful surgeon, a wonderful--sort of these kinds of thing.  So, and, and that was what I planned to do.  And I found the scientific courses fairly easy, you know, the biology and chemistry.  I liked them, and they were easy to me.  They were logical to me.  And I was in the, I think this my sophomore year.  I was, I was in the lab, biology lab, cutting up a dead frog.  And it was in the spring, and I looked down--looked out of the window, and there was a guy--you know, the dogwoods were in bloom on the, on the campus.  And there was a guy there with my girlfriend, walking with my girlfriend.  I said, what in the world am I doing up here?  He's down there walking with my girlfriend.  I'm up here cutting up dead cats or frogs or whatever.  I think it was a dead cat, as a matter of fact--(unclear).  And so I decided then that I was gonna change my major so I'd have less lab work and more time to spend with my girlfriend.
Speaker 1: And you changed your major (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So something just that frivolous, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And, and you changed it to?
Speaker 2: I changed it to business.  But it really didn't make any difference because I--to graduate from Morehouse you had to have a total of 120 hours.  By the time I finished I had to have a 136 hours.  And the--
Speaker 1: Why was that?
Speaker 2: Well, in, in those days you, you, you lost credit hours for cutting chapel, and, and I did not--I liked to sleep late, and, and so I lost a lot of hours.  So I had to have virtually a second, another semester to finish, although it didn't take me another semester.  I just took more points.  So I had to take, I took, I took almost everything they had: math, and economics, business, biology, anything they had.
Story_ID: 572133
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about chapel [at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and why--and was it something that you had to attend every day?
Speaker 2: It's one of my great regrets.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, you had to attend every day.  I think it was something like nine o'clock.  You had assigned seats.  And the dean [Brailsford Reese Brazeal] sat up in the balcony, and actually, he took attendance from (laughter) looking down on, on the seats.  And my seat was empty more often than not.  But the, the reason I regret it is that we--they were good.  I mean they had, they had speakers in from the outside and very prominent African Americans.  And, and, and Dr. Mays [Benjamin Mays] would always see to it that they, they had something relevant to say.  And so they, and also just they were driven to do the best that they could with Dr. Mays sitting there.  And so I missed out on a lot of good advice and oratory by, by cutting chapel.  It was one of those stupid things that kids do.  I never should have done it.  But on the other hand, the good news is that when I finished I, I had a helluva education, with 136 hours.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).

Speaker 1: How did you experience Dr. Mays [Benjamin Mays]?
Speaker 2: (JULIEANNA RICHARDSON):  He didn't experience him in chapel.
Speaker 1: If, since--
Speaker 2: It's walking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you didn't experience him in chapel.
Speaker 2: --walking on campus [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  But aside from that, as I said, I had a very good high school education [at Glenville High School, Cleveland, Ohio].  And I apparently had a very, very high score on their entrance examination.  And so I was sort of identified when I got there.  And I realized that because they had a freshman week, and, and a number of the professors would have dinners at their home or evening events at their home just so that they, the new freshmen--in those days we only had eighty freshmen in the class, and, and they wanted you to meet your, the professors and so forth, and, and, and Dr. Mays, and the dean [Brailsford Reese Brazeal], and others.  And after a while it became obvious to me that, that the professors had made note of my examination. And, and, and, and that bothered me too because they had, they had significant expectations of me.  And, and I just didn't like people to have those kinds of expectations of me.  But--
Speaker 1: Why is that?
Speaker 2: --but they did.  Why don't I like people to--because it puts you under pressure to, to produce, and I like to go at my own pace and do what I want to do, so.  So I, I don't know.  I, I could have been really--a little bit--part of my sleeping late might have been: well, I'll show them I'm not as smart as they think I am (laughter), you know, so they'll leave me alone.
Story_ID: 572135
Speaker 1: Was there any professor there that you would say influenced you the most or made the, an im- a greater impact in your--
Speaker 2: They all did, they, they really did.  It's hard to, it's hard to single one out because they were all so good at what they did.  You know, obviously taking so much math, I became close to the, to the head of the math department and--
Speaker 1: Who was?
Speaker 2: Claude Dansby.  And so I would--he, he happened to have a room in one of the dormitories, and so I had a lot of access to him.  And, and so I would, I would go to him and get tutoring on those chapters that we would not cover in class, because I liked math.  And, but there were others too.  I drove my French teacher crazy because I do not have any affinity toward (laughter) toward, toward languages, foreign languages.  I just don't remember them.  I took three years of French, and I can tell you words, but I couldn't say a sentence.  And so I drove him a little bit nuts.  But most of the others I, I had a good relationship with, the ones in business and so forth.  And I, I was, I was, I was not considered (laughter) a great student at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I achieved, but I was not a, a great student.  I would get into arguments with our philosophy professor.  And most people were--would fail philosophy.  He kept a number of people from graduating because you, you had to pass philosophy in order to finish Morehouse.  And I loved philosophy, but I disagreed with him a lot.  And so we would get into arguments on campus, which would draw crowds, arguing 'Theaetetus' [Plato] and, and so forth.  That was fun.  Sam Williams [Samuel Woodrow Williams] was his name.
Speaker 1: Do you remember one of those arguments in particular (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (JULIEANNA RICHARDSON):  (Simultaneous) What's his name?  You want to know his name when you (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His name was Sam Williams.  The professor's name was Sam Williams, and he was a legend and probably still is a legend at Morehouse.  But he, he was a great, great philosopher.  And I just enjoyed it, listening to--learning about the great thinkers and what they thought.  And, and I think our, the biggest argument we had, had to do--I think it was 'Theaetetus' that had something to do with being is and things are as they are because they are, and all of that kind of thing.  And you know, I loved breaking that down and, and arguing with him because he accepted the philosophers exactly as they presented themselves.  And I didn't accept anybody on that basis.  You had to prove it.
Story_ID: 572136
Speaker 1: Who were some of your classmates [at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] that you--that stand out with--in your mind most?
Speaker 2: Well, essentially my fraternity brothers, you know, and then because we roomed and, and, and we were close together.
Speaker 1: And your fraternity is?
Speaker 2: Alpha--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Alpha Phi Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity].  My closest friend was, was T.M. Alexander [T.M. Alexander, Jr.], whose dad was a prominent insurance broker in Atlanta [Georgia].  As a matter of fact, his dad was the one who, when, when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] couldn't, couldn't get any insurance on the station wagons that they were using, he cut a deal.  T.M. Alexander, Sr. cut a deal with Lloyd's of London to insure the station wagons.  He was--
Speaker 1: What was the name of his insurance company?
Speaker 2: I think it was, I think it was just Alexander, Alexander insurance [Alexander and Company, Atlanta, Georgia] I believe.
Speaker 1: Did you say T.M.?
Speaker 2: T.M. Alexander--had a big beautiful home out on, on, was at Hunter, Hunter Road or something like that I think it was called, where a lot of prominent African Americans lived in those days.  And I learned a lot from him, from his dad, because we would go down into his game room and, for dinner, you know, lots of eatings--evenings.  And his dad loved to expound, and so we would just sit there and listen to him tell stories.  And I think he was the first real black businessman that I was exposed to, and so I learned a lot from him, just listening to him, also had some good jokes; he was a, had a great sense of humor.  But T.M., his son, was--he made fraternity with me, at the same time I did and became a very prominent businessman man at a very early age himself in Atlanta.  Lou Sullivan [HistoryMaker Dr. Louis Sullivan], I, I made Lou Sullivan into the fraternity.  And I, as a matter of fact, I've been dealing with Lou just recently on some times, and so we have had the occasion to talk to each other.
Speaker 1: Now what is his profession?
Speaker 2: He was former secretary of HHS [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services].
Speaker 1: Oh, form--oh (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (JULIEANNA RICHARDSON):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yes.  And he's now of president emeritus of Morehouse medical school [Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: (JULIEANNA L. RICHARDSON):  (Unclear) medical school.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. He was actually the founder of the medical school.  Billy Borders [William Holmes Borders, Jr.], he was interesting.  Billy and I were never all that close, but his, his dad--I, I used go to church.  His dad had one of the largest churches, Reverend William Holmes Borders, a prominent church [Wheat Street Baptist Church] in Atlanta.  And I used to love to hear him preach.  And Billy was in, in my class as well, and others, you know.
Story_ID: 572137
Speaker 1: I got to know people in the community quite a bit, which is very, very interesting.  Part of my racial education came from I was always being pushed to, to take jobs out in the community because I think that they felt that this would help me to get a better understanding of how things worked in the South.  And so I took one jobs washing windows for a woman that lived on The Prado, which is where the governor's mansion is, in that general area.  And she lived by herself, big, big home, and she loved to talk.  And so, I was washing the windows, and she got to the point where she was ringing out the rag for me and handing it to me, and so we were sort of working together doing this.  And she found out that I was gonna be an actuary, because at, by that time I'd made up my mind.  I think I was a senior or either high in the junior, in the junior year, late in the junior year.  And, and so her daughter was actuary, and so that, she identified with that, and so that gave us more to talk about.  But we just talked a lot.  It came time for lunch, and she says, "I'm going inside to fix lunch."  And then she did, and she called me.  And she handed me my lunch, a sandwich and a glass of milk, and told me where to sit on the back porch.  It was a screened-in back porch leading into the kitchen.  And she pulled up a chair in the kitchen and sat there and ate her lunch.  And I just thought to myself, isn't this a magnificent picture, not necessarily magnificent, but an important picture, that this is what the South is all about; you know, that she's sitting on one side of the screen door, and I'm sitting on the other side of the screen door, still talking.  And it just dawned in me: is this what the South is?  Maybe I've missed the whole thing.  So it gave me a very important lesson again about the South and people, because I had, by this time, I had sort of developed quite a dislike for southern whites because of what I had been through.  And this woman showed me a different side of, of what it was all about, that it was--maybe it wasn't about me.  Maybe it was about culture and history, things like that.
Speaker 2: You graduated from Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] in what year?
Speaker 1: Fifty-three [1953], 1953.
Story_ID: 572138
Speaker 1: Mr. Webb [HistoryMaker James O. Webb], I would like for you to describe your college years, one year at a time.  Let's start with the first year that you arrived at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Okay, well, I, I explained to you that for the first half of that first year I was confined to campus, and (laughter) I slept a lot and--
Speaker 1: But now you were--
Speaker 2: --those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Tell us again why you were confined.
Speaker 2: There were several instances where I got into a little bit of trouble out in the community by just simply not behaving in the way that African Americans were expected to behave in, in a, in a southern environment.  I mean there was nothing in my judgment that was seriously out of line, but in the environment that I was in it was out of line.  And, and I think that they, they did this not for anyone else's benefit but my own.  They wanted to make sure that I was, I was safe and that I did not get myself into a situation that would result in some harm one way or another.  But then in, I guess in the, in the second semester, I, I started getting into it.  I, I started seeing some of the other things that Morehouse had to offer other than, other than just simply the classroom.  I got to know more people.
Speaker 1: Such as?  Tell us about some of those things that you thought they had to offer.
Speaker 2: Well, there's something that happens to Morehouse men when they, when they get Morehouse.  They, they all become philosophers and all very bright.  And if you don't believe that, all you have to do is to, is to go to someone's room, which is a, which is a gathering place in the evenings, and, and, and listen to the fellows philosophize about the world, and world events, and, and, and, and, and, and their views of the world.  And, and these aren't just empty bull sessions.  These are, are very--I learned that these are very thoughtful concepts coming from some very intelligent guys and, and things that I had not heard before.  And I, I love the art of debate anyway and, and discussion.  And, and so I just became engrossed with that kind of thing, and, and my room became one of, one of those places that people would gather in the evenings and just talk about, talk about whatever, whatever was on their mind.  And I learned a lot from that.  I took a lot away from that, and again, just observing people, too.  I, I observe a lot, and I, I, I try to learn from observation.
Story_ID: 572139
Speaker 1: With Dr. Mays [Benjamin Mays], I think that's, that's, that's what I got mostly from him, just observing him as a man, and his behavior, and his stature, and, and the fact that he was, he made a point of being constantly on campus [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], walking among the men slowly, so that if you, if you wanted to talk to him, all you had to do was walk up to him.  And he would talk to you about anything that you wanted to talk about.  And sometimes you--he never got involved in behavioral issues, because I did have some behavioral issues now and then.  And it would always be Dean Brazeal's [Brailsford Reese Brazeal] job to, to, to, to deal with those.  But all of Dr. Mays' contacts were positive contacts.  And I, I didn't hesitate to walk up to him, as I said, when, when he was on campus, just to start a conversation, just to listen to him and, and hear what he had to say, 'cause almost everything out of his mouth had meaning to it.
Speaker 2: Do you remember any of those conversations in--
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: --particular?
Speaker 1: --I, I, I don't, I don't.  My impressions of him--it's interesting--are of him as a whole man more so than any one thing that I mentioned.  One thing in particular that struck me when he was--because he said it time and time again about you can do anything you want to do or be anything that you want to be; it's just up to you; you know, you, you control your own destiny.  And secondly, whatever it is that you end up being, be the best, you know; work at being the best, even though nobody's watching you, to pick up that last piece of dirt, whatever it is.  And it's that concept, it's that philosophy about life.  So I think he just taught us to be men, and to be strong, courage, let us know what we were gonna be up against in the world.  Don't be surprised, but be prepared.  And so that's, that's essentially what I, I learned from him.
Story_ID: 572140
Speaker 1: Dean Brazeal [Brailsford Reese Brazeal] on the other hand, he was, he was, he was-you could also learned from dean, but he was a disciplinarian.  And so I had my occasions to, to see him when all of a sudden the, and the piano from chapel ended up down in the gym for a dance, and the next morning there was no piano in chapel.  And he just sort of always saw me as the brains behind everything, and so--
Speaker 2: And was he right?
Speaker 1: Frequently (laughter), frequently, but--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That--
Speaker 1: --but I think I've made it--maybe that's why I'm so close to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I'm giving them myself because I want to make sure that I make amends for some of those things that, that I did.
Speaker 2: You mentioned some of the behavioral issues, your behavioral issues and the piano as one.  Are there others that you could talk about?
Speaker 1: Main thing--in my judgment they weren't bad.  They were just mischievous, and they were--and then I didn't do them for devilment.  I did them because they needed to be done.  We needed a piano, and there's a piano.  And so my mind says go get the piano.  Nobody's using it right now.  It's nine o'clock at night, and we're having a party, and somebody will take it back.  And somebody didn't take it back.  Otherwise, no one would have known the difference.
Story_ID: 572141
Speaker 1: So in your first year, would you say that was a year of adjusting to the South--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to being in the South and--
Speaker 2: --absolutely, absolutely.  It, it was a year of adjusting not only to the South but to an African American environment that I had never been exclusively in except as a very young child [in Cleveland, Ohio].  And it was adjusting to that; I, I think also adjusting to, or at least recognizing, beginning to recognize, responsibility that here was something, an opportunity that could be--that could have a, a, a lasting impact on my life.  It was my responsibility to take advantage of that opportunity, nobody else; it's just mine.  It was a revelation in that sense.  So yes, so I came into my sophomore year prepared, mentally prepared and, and emotionally prepared to, to, to get down to business.
Speaker 1: So that first year you went home and you said to your mother--
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I said I'm, I'm absolutely going back at the end of the first year; Christmas, no.  But by the end of the first year, yeah, it was--I could see its importance to me, and I was determined to go back.  And, but, you know, I've, I've always had that little streak, and so yes, I got into a little--in my, in my, unfortunately--and perhaps I shouldn't tell this story, but my, my parents [Bessie Eubanks Webb and James O. Webb, Sr.] did not come to my graduation from Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And that's essentially because the dean [Brailsford Reese Brazeal] had written them a letter telling them that I was not gonna graduate from Morehouse.  And he had met me on campus and told me, "Mr. Webb [HistoryMaker James O. Webb], you will never graduate from this institution."  And that was because I had not gone to class and taken some classes in my, in, in the fall semester of my senior year, some very important, important classes: corporate finance and money and banking.  And I thought to myself, yeah, that's what you think; there's no question I'm gonna graduate.  And so I, I cut a deal with him--no, with the, with the professor.  I cut a deal with the professor.  He had given me incompletes because I just hadn't done all of the work for the first semester.  And my deal was that, will you give me for--in both of those classes, 'cause he taught both classes--will you give me for my first semester whatever grades I make in the second semester, and he said, "Yeah."  And so I got A's in both (laughter), and so that I got four A's and was able to graduate, which I knew I would be able to do.  But my parents--and I told my parents, I said, you know, "Who are you gonna believe, me or the dean?"  Well, (laughter) they obviously believed the dean, so they didn't show up.  So there were little things like that that just sort of reflect, you know, the fact that I, I have to do it my way.
Story_ID: 572142
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your second year at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  What was that like?
Speaker 2: The second year at Morehouse I began to settle down.  And, and really it was, as best I can remember, it was a period of really assimilating what I had learned in, in my freshman year and beginning to mature, while still doing some nutty things.  But I was maturing, and, and it was pretty uneventful.  I began dating girls out in the, in the city, and getting to know the city a little bit better, and, and sort of becoming immersed in the, in the city culture.
Speaker 1: Because by this time you understood the southern culture, so you--
Speaker 2: I was beginning to understand the southern culture.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were no longer restricted to--
Speaker 2: Oh no, no.
Speaker 1: --campus.
Speaker 2: That was just for that, that six month period.
Speaker 1: And then you started moving more out in the community, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes, primarily just through friends that I had made that went to Morehouse that were, that lived in the community or girls that I met at the movies or that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: You had a job off campus?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it was--yeah, but it didn't last long (laughter).  It was, it was sort of insignificant.  I, I don't think I worked at the cafeteria for more than maybe two months, and then I would take little odd jobs now and then.  So it was, it was sort of--the second and third year, they were pretty, pretty uneventful.  I--
Story_ID: 572143
Speaker 1: I pledged.  I was busy obviously the second year pledging fraternity and, and going through that process and getting to know my fraternity brothers better.
Speaker 2: Now what year was this?
Speaker 1: (JULIEANNA RICHARDSON):  Sophomore.
Speaker 2: In my sophomore year.
Speaker 1: But the year, 19--
Speaker 2: That would have been 1950, '51 [1951], you know, starting in, in, in the fall of '50 [1950].
Speaker 1: And then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (JULIEANNA RICHARDSON):  (Simultaneous) Describe the pledging process.
Speaker 1: Yes, what is, what was your pledging process like?
Speaker 2: It was rigorous (laughter).  It was like most fraternities then (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What can you tell us?
Speaker 2: No, I can't tell you very much, but, but it was, it, it was rigorous.  You clearly made very, very close friends because of the nature of the process.  And again, you begin to learn a lot about yourself and, and relationships.  It, the fraternity itself is a maturation process.  And I, I think the sophomore year is the right time for, for most, most people to do that.
Speaker 1: Who, and who sponsored you?  Or who influenced you to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a very--
Speaker 1: --join the frater--
Speaker 2: --question.  You know, I'm, I'm, I'm not sure.  I really don't recall.  Of course, M.L. was--M.L.K. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr,] was a Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], but I don't remember--I, I didn't know him that well then, didn't know him at all.  Well, I, I knew of him.  You know, I, I really don't, I really, I really don't know.  I really don't know.  It, it, it could have been a process of elimination.  It could have been, because I, I had certain impressions of the other fraternities with the guys that were, that were in the fraternity and--
Speaker 1: What types of impressions?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, one was, was more social and--
Speaker 1: And that was?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not gonna tell you (laughter).
Speaker 1: You're not gonna--well, there were--what were your choices?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, there were, there were Omegas [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] and Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].
Speaker 1: The Omega--
Speaker 2: Omegas, Kappas, Alphas, and those, those are the three primary ones.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I think Sigmas [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity] were there too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know, in my judgment, just looking back on it, I think the Alphas, of course, there's a certain degree of pride, you know, but the Alphas I think were more well rounded in terms of academics and social.  And, and you know, when I look at the people who pledged with me and after me, there was a lot of similarities, you know.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people that pledged with you?
Speaker 2: Well, T.M. Alexander [T.M. Alexander, Jr.] pledged with me.  Unfortunately, so many of them are gone now.  We--I think there were eight fellows that pledged with me.  And I don't think there are more than two of us.  They--it's, it's amazing how many of them died young.
Speaker 1: Who are the two that are still with you?
Speaker 2: And I'm trying--I was, I'm saying that I don't think there's probably more than one.  I'm, I'm giving credit to one somewhere, but I, I can't even, I can't give you a name.  The ones that are gone are: (Unclear) Golden [ph.]; Duvant Sells [ph.]; T.M. Alexander; Bruce Phillips [Edward Bruce Phillips] just passed away a couple of years ago, a dentist, you know.  And those were my closest friends. I used to go visit Duvant in Hawaii, he went into the [U.S.] military, and was stationed in Hawaii, and became a real estate guy when he came out, and so I spent time with him.  And he died of a massive heart attack unfortunately.  And then T.M., even though he had this tremendous career going.  As a young man, he died out on a, on a boat in, in Belize, off the coast of Belize, some of the most treacherous waters in the world.  But he was out there sailing, celebrating the election of someone from California to, to office.  I forget who it was, or did--never did know really.  But anyway, that was--so I've had a lot of, of, of, of, a lot of things to get over, so far as the deaths of my closest friends.
Story_ID: 572144
Speaker 1: Now we're at your third year at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], what's--is there anything that stands out in your mind about that junior year?
Speaker 2: No, not, not, not really, just, just more of the, of the same.  The senior year was a little different.
Speaker 1: But now, when did you change your major?
Speaker 2: When, I think I changed it in my senior year, but that was after I found out what trouble I was in.  But I, I think I knew before then.  So I was taking extra courses all the time 'cause I knew I was losing points.  I didn't realize how precarious it was though until--'cause I probably had enough points after--I probably had 120 credits after the first part of the senior year to finish or even earlier than that.
Speaker 1: But you were saying that you were, you had painted this beautiful picture about the senior girlfriend walking with someone else, and you decided then that you weren't going to pursue a career in medicine but a career in--
Speaker 2: Business.  I, you know, I went over to economics I think because I figured that I'll be a businessman.
Speaker 1: How did your mother [Bessie Eubanks Webb] feel about that?
Speaker 2: She didn't like it at all.  She was very disappointed, very disappointed.  But you know, my parents are the type that they were very supportive.  Whatever I did, they would be supportive, but I knew she was hurt.  I, I knew she was tremendously hurt.  And my dad [James O. Webb, Sr.], you never knew what, what he was thinking anyway, so he wouldn't express it.  But I know that she was, she was very disappointed, but of course I wasn't home, so.  And in those days you didn't go home that often.  There just wasn't that kind of money to be running back and forth to, from Atlanta [Georgia] to Cleveland [Ohio].  So I went home usually on Christmas, but that's because I worked in the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] for two weeks around--no, for one week--but maybe twenty hours a day for a week.  And I would have enough money to, to buy presents and get a ticket home, a train ticket home.
Speaker 1: You worked in the post office just before the Christmas holidays?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: To earn Christmas money?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's how I got home every year except maybe my freshman year.
Speaker 1: And that didn't interrupt with your studies?
Speaker 2: No, because see, I just started.  School was virtually out when you would start.  I think we were maybe out two weeks before Christmas, and, and you'd hire on at the post office I think maybe ten days or two weeks prior to Christmas.  And, and they would allow you to put in as many hours as you wanted to at the post office, long as you could stay awake--and so myself and there were a number of other guys too, but I pretty much did it on my own.  I don't even remember anybody else doing it, but I know that there were others did.
Story_ID: 572145
Speaker 1: So your senior year you were told that you weren't gonna graduate [from Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Your, your parents [Bessie Eubanks Webb and James O. Webb, Sr.] were told you weren't gonna graduate?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) After, after the first semester of the senior year.
Speaker 1: And you had already changed your major to business, or what was it?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't declare any major.  I was just taking courses.  Whatever they had to offer in math, or business, or economics I was just taking them.
Speaker 1: So what would your degree have been in?
Speaker 2: It was, it was a bachelor of arts.  And (laughter), and the way I put--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Would have been.
Speaker 2: --it down, if you look at my--I, I list, list them all and mathematics, with, with emphasis in--I think I said--with emphasis in or maybe even majors in--I don't know--business, economics, and mathematics.
Speaker 1: So you have your graduation, and your parents aren't there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was that like, and what did your mother say?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think we ever had that discussion.  I avoided unpleasant discussions.  I don't think we ever had that discussion.  But, you know, they, they were obviously pleased that I had graduated, and obviously I wasn't about to say to them, I told you so.  So it just wasn't discussed that much.
Story_ID: 572146
Speaker 1: (JULIEANNA RICHARDSON):  What I'm still trying to understand-- well, two things: this, your exposure to the South and the families in the South, what was, what did you learn in that, in your exposure there?  I mean, just how did you change and mature?  What, what, what was--
Speaker 2: Well, there is a lot of--Atlanta [Georgia] had quite a business community.  You know, there was a, there was a newspaper; there was a radio station; there were appliance, there was an appliance company.  It, it just--
Speaker 1: (JULIEANNA RICHARDSON):  Can you give the names of those?  What were they?
Speaker 2: I think the radio station was WERD [WERD Radio, Atlanta, Georgia], and, and the, and the newspaper was the Daily Word--the Atlanta Daily World.  And, and then I forget the name of the appliance company, but it was the father of one of my contemporaries who went to either Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] or, or Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And, and so just I'm observing what African Americans were capable of doing.  And it, and it, it showed me a different South, one in which African Americans could achieve and perhaps achieve more than they did in the North.  And my experience in my senior year [at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] when I was washing those windows really helped me to sort of understand this dichotomy and contradiction of, of suppression and achievement, which is a contradiction.  But it, I, I learned later that it existed throughout the South in many, many communities.  And so I just observed.  I, I just observed a lot and, and asked a lot of questions, and it just gave me a different sense and a different feel for the South.  And, and because of that, I always had sort of an affinity toward the South, which may be the reason that when I decided to go wherever I wanted to go, that I moved back South to, to North Carolina.  I surprised a lot of people because I'd been in Chicago [Illinois] for forty years and had achieved a lot in Chicago, knew a lot of people, had a, a very strong base here in Chicago, and I think a lot of people, that's what they want to retire in.  They want to live where they have all of this acclamation and so forth, and, but I didn't feel that way.  I, I wanted to sort of go off and do it again, and start again, and learn new things, and I decided to do it in the South.

Speaker 1: (JULIEANNA RICHARDSON):  The other thing, other question--and you're doing right by looking at her [Sasha Daltonn]--that I have is: were there things, do you remember things happening at the time that you were at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], any things that happened in the community that caused a lot of discussion on you or your, you know, your classmates' part, you know, in your room, you know, either, either in Atlanta [Georgia] or outside in the world?  I mean, anything that you remember happening?  'Cause you know, at that time, we would have had--you know, there were some, you know, in some of the campuses there wasn't much social activism, and others, people were starting to get involved in the local NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] chapter and things like that.  Do you remember any of, anything?
Speaker 2: No, there, there wasn't much of that going on, as, as, as I recall, between '49 [1949] and '53 [1953].  You know, it was, it was the era of I think Jackie Robinson might have entered the, the Major Leagues [Major League Baseball] during that time.  And then so we were very much aware of achievements that were going on in the greater community, but there was really nothing out in the community.  Our community was, beyond Morehouse, tended to be you know, Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], and some of the other universities, and maybe even for the younger guys at Morehouse the high schools were a place for social activity and social interaction.  And, but there wasn't very much going on in terms of civil rights unrest, as I recall.  Now there were a lot of--we, we were getting a lot of World War II [WWII] veterans back during those years, from World War II, and oh, the G- G.I Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] of course.  And we, we even had, we had to put up temporary housing for them and temporary barracks like housing for them to stay in because we knew that it perhaps would not, that enrollment would not continue, you know, forever.  And so they brought a culture with them, but quite frankly, they, they sort of stuck to themselves.  They were much more mature.  They were much more introspective than we were, and they weren't, weren't as social and outgoing as the rest of us.  And, and at age, you know, there's a huge difference between a twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five year old who has been to war and a seventeen, eighteen, nineteen year old who, who delivered papers.  You know, that was my contribution to the war effort.  I was out there delivering, bringing people the news.  I still think about that a lot, that people were standing on their front porches waiting for me because, you know, stuff didn't come back on the radio that fast from what was going on, and so they really relied on the newspapers.  And here I come riding my bicycle with their newspaper telling them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what was that?
Speaker 2: --what had happened.  Well, that goes back to when I was--
Speaker 1: To high school [Glenville High School, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 2: --be at the high school.
Story_ID: 572148
Speaker 1: --Massey [HistoryMaker Walter E. Massey] became president.  He, he asked me to head up a group of people to--he didn't like the way the campus looked.  And, and so he asked me to pull together a group of people and, and, and do a consulting job for him, without pay of course, to make recommendations as to what the campus needed.  And so I pulled together Jim Hall [James R. Hall], a retired general, because I knew that he's, you know, he's a tough guy, you know, spic span, running an army.  He ran the 2nd Army I think [sic. 4th U.S. Army]; and, and then I think his name was John Williams, who is head of the business school at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]; and then a young fellow who had finished about five or six years before but had risen very quickly to be, I think he was a vice president of one of the either cosmetic or pharmaceutical companies.  But anyway, the four of us had put--had an intensive--oh, geez, I think it was one week we interviewed something like twenty-one people and put together a report for Massey.  He implemented almost all of it.  One of our recommendations was that the former acting--it was a personal recommendation, just the two of us should go.  It, it just doesn't work when you, you know, you have an acting guy who wanted the job.  It's just gonna be hard for him.  It's not gonna work--but to clean up the campus and do some other things.  But my other private recommendation to Walter was that he hire Jim Hall, that what he needed at that point in time--I said even if you can get Jim for only two or three years, hire him because he can come in here and put this place in order because it's out of control.  I mean people just--we walked into one guy's office.  He had his feet up on his desk, sound to sleep.  And just you could see on the campus.  I mean it was not kept very well, just a whole bunch of stuff.  And so Walt--
Speaker 2: And what year was this?
Speaker 1: It was Walter's first year when he became president.  And, and he implemented just about all of the recommendations.  And we became close as a result of that, and, and we'd chat frequently.  I just visited Walter, month ago, month and a half ago, and we spent some time together.  It was during the Christmas holidays.  School was out.  So I--some of those things you can't say because they're too personal and too private that they involving other people.  But I've, I've really remained close.  I, I was, yeah, I was also--I'd forgotten that: I, I headed up their annual fund for four years.  That was when--I forget the president's name, but he was--he left suddenly.  But that was--so I've, I've had some, some--I, I really love Morehouse.  I, I--anything they ask me to do, and Walter knows that. Anything you need, Walter, just call, and I'll be there.  And it's worked out that way.
Story_ID: 572149
Speaker 1: You said your senior year--let's talk about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) You really--
Speaker 1: --that, yes.
Speaker 2: I was ready to talk--
Speaker 1: I (laughter)--
Speaker 2: --about some other stuff.
Speaker 1: I know, but we've got to, we've got to finish the senior year.  Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I had a very, a very close friend.  I hadn't mentioned him yet.  His name is George Key.  George was my roommate from--an incident occurred in my freshman year, and so they, they moved me from, from one room to another.  And, and he became my roommate after that move and, and remained my roommate throughout my, my sophomore and, and, and junior year.  He was a, he was a bright guy.  His father had been principal of a high school in Chattanooga [Tennessee].  And he called and said that he wasn't going back to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I normally stopped through Chattanooga.  I'd leave home [Cleveland, Ohio] a little bit early, stop through Chattanooga and spend time with he and his family.  And I loved his mother's southern breakfasts.   And she had everything from smoked pork chops and everything for breakfast, and I, I loved that.  And, but this particular year he says I'm freshman--I mean, getting ready to go into the senior year.  He says, "I'm not going back," and that just bothered me.  And so I said, "George, I'm coming to Chattanooga on my way back, and I'm not leaving until you go back with me."  He, he, he wanted to be a physician, and he had stuck with it.  He was just a good student and had a lot to offer.  And I was determined that he, that he was gonna finish.  And, and so by the time we got back, it was late, obviously.  And when we went to apply for a room, the woman that had been sort of my den mother for, for three years sort of looked at me with this little smile on her face.  And she says, "I'm sorry, but we're all out of rooms, and you'll have to live off campus."  And so George and I said, "Yeah, right, you know," (laughter).  And, and we knew that it was their opportunity or her opportunity, 'cause we were just sort of pains, okay.  And so we found places off campus right across the street from each other.  And mine happened to be next to a place called Ag- Alex's Barbecue [Alex's Barbecue Heaven, Atlanta, Georgia], which no longer is there.  And I had some interesting experiences.  That's how I survived in my senior year, was I would study at Alex's Barbecue.  And, and the ladies there would--I was very thin at the time, and so they would give me pork shoulder, which I learned to love.  And so I found out that if I stayed there long enough they would just keep feeding me pork shoulder and, and orange drink.  So, that's how I survived my senior year.  But anyway, it was--I had to buckle down then.  I, I still didn't in that first year [sic. semester].  But that second semester of my senior year, 'cause too much was on the line, there was no way I wasn't gonna graduate Morehouse.  And, and I didn't want to come back.  I wanted to get on with my life.  Furthermore, I had a college deferment for the, for the [U.S.] Army, and the Army would have drafted me perhaps out of college, had I gone on to a fifth year.  And so I, I just had to settle down and, and, and just, and really get going, which I did do.  And it, it, it ended up good.
Speaker 1: And that was the year when they, when your parents [Bessie Eubanks Webb and James O. Webb, Sr.] thought you weren't graduating (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And you did graduate.
Speaker 2: I did graduate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 572150
Speaker 1: You graduated in 19--
Speaker 2: Fifty-three [1953] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) fifty-three [1953], and you met your--married your wife in 1954.  How did you meet?  Did you meet her in college [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] or?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, in my junior year I met her.  I got there early that year and went to a, I think it was a high school football game, or it was a football game.  And I was with some of the local people, local guys that lived there, some of my friends.  And she came in and sat two rows in front of me.  And she had on this cute little outfit.  It was a little jockey outfit, you know, and I asked who she was.  And they told me, because they were all city people and she was city, and said they would introduce me, which they did do.  And she just promptly ignored me, totally ignored me.  And that was not good enough for me, so.  I also strategize a lot, so as she, as she left, I arranged to get myself behind her and reintroduce myself and ask for her phone number.  Well, she, she, you know, at first she said no, and so, but I insisted and kept bothering her.  And so finally, she gave it to me, but she gave it to me in such a way that she knew very well--she thought that I would not remember, you know, like, "252-175," and I remembered it.  You know, I, I, I--
Speaker 1: Do you remember what it was?
Speaker 2: No (laughter), but I immediately committed it to memory, you know, and said, "Okay, I got a surprise for you."  And so sure enough, I called her and I asked her for a date, and she said no.  And I called a few more times, and she finally said yes.  And, and--
Speaker 1: Now was she in high school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or she was just at this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, let's see--
Speaker 1: --high school game?
Speaker 2: No, she was, she was at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was at Clark at the time.  She would have been maybe a freshman, maybe even a sophomore.  And--no, when I met her she was definitely a freshman because I was a junior.  But in any event, we continued to date.  And you know, at the same time, you know, I was--there was someone on campus I had been seeing, but I had to make up my mind.  And, and so I, I really, I really liked Frankie [Frankie Lowe Webb] a lot.  And so we, we just, we continued to date through graduation.  And then I went to--that summer I, I just went home and sold insurance in the summer for my uncle's [D.C. Chandler] insurance company [Dunbar Life Insurance Company, Cleveland, Ohio].  And, and then I was, I knew I was going into the [U.S.] Army September 1st, and I did.  And, and then I was advised after I finished boot camp that they were shipping me to Alaska, where I was gonna be for two years.  And I decided that I, I couldn't be without Frankie for two years, and so I asked her to marry me.
Speaker 1: And that was what year?
Speaker 2: And that would have been in probably very early fifty--yeah, it was very--yeah, it was; it was, it was '54 [1954], because it all happened very quickly.  It, because, yes, I, I was on leave, being shipped to Alaska.  I was given a two week leave, I think.  And so I, I, I went through Atlanta [Georgia], 'cause I was stationed at Fort Knox [Kentucky].  On my way home I went through Atlanta and went to her house.  And I wrote it down on a napkin, you know, "Will you marry me?" And her response was very interesting.  It sort of reflected what she saw of my personality, 'cause I, I kid around a lot.  And so she wrote back: "If you're serious, yes; if you're playing around, go to hell," (laughter). And so that was it.
Story_ID: 572151
Speaker 1: And that was, that was after I had been cleared by Reverend King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I want to talk about that, but I wanna get this, this straight in my head first.  You graduated in '53 [1953]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You met Frankie [Webb's wife, Frankie Lowe Webb] in '52 [1952]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You graduated and went back home to work for an insurance company?
Speaker 1: Dunbar Life Insurance Company, which, which my uncle owned.
Speaker 2: And that was in Ohio?
Speaker 1: That was in Ohio, in Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what was your uncle's name?
Speaker 1: D.C. Chandler.
Speaker 2: And what did--tell me about--that was your first experience in the insurance business.  Is that correct?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Tell me a little bit about that.
Speaker 1: Well, I had already been, even while I was a student, a senior I guess at, at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], I'd already been accepted at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] to their actuarial program, to the graduate program.  And so I knew that I was going to go there at some point after I got out of the [U.S.] Army, even.  And--
Speaker 2: So somewhere before you graduated you decided you wanted to go into actuaries?
Speaker 1: Yes, the actuarial science.  My, my uncle had convinced me.  He had a--because there weren't that many actuaries.  There were only 1,200 actuaries in the entire country and 1,600 insurance companies.  So there weren't even enough actuaries to go around.
Speaker 2: And do you know how many of those were, those actuaries were--
Speaker 1: None at--
Speaker 2: --African American?
Speaker 1: --well, one at that time, one.
Speaker 2: One--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Bob--
Speaker 2: --out of 1600?
Speaker 1: --Bob Randall [Robert J. Randall, Sr.], yeah.  And--out of 1,200.
Speaker 2: Twelve hundred.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so, I was a little bit--I wasn't sure what I wanted to do.  But my uncle said, "Look, my--the fellow that I use as a consulting actuary.  He comes in twice a year, and he looks at stuff, and charges me a fortune.  And so actuaries make a lot of money, and, but you got to be good at math--." Well, I'd had all the math there was--and, and have some business sense; well, I had business too.  And so I said, okay, this is one way I can get some use out of my--all of these courses I've taken.  And so I decided, sure, I'll try actuarial science.  And so, that's, that's, that's how I decided on actuarial science (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, you said he was your uncle.  How was he your uncle?
Speaker 1: He was my mother's [Bessie Eubanks Webb] sister's husband.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And he was the owner of the insurance agency.  And you went to work for him--
Speaker 1: Not an agency.  It was a company.
Speaker 2: --in, insurance company.  And you went to work for him for a year?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Then--
Speaker 1: For a summer.
Speaker 2: For a summer, in 1953?
Speaker 1: I finished in '53 [1953], so it would have been the summer of '53 [1953].
Speaker 2: Summer of '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 572152
Speaker 1: Then you came back to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: No, then I went into the [U.S.] Army in September of '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: And what branch of the [U.S.] military was that?
Speaker 2: It was Army, U.S. Army.
Speaker 1: I said Army (laughter). You went to the Army in--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --nineteen fifty-three [1953].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you married Frankie [Frankie Lowe Webb] on leave?  How was that?
Speaker 2: I married Frankie on leave in February of '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Okay, now let's stop here.  You proposed to her--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --via napkin.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And she accepted via napkin.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit more about Frankie and her family.  And she was a member of Dr.--
Speaker 2: Ebenezer Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Ebenezer Baptist Church.
Speaker 2: Right, right, she had grown up in the church--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --across the street from, from the Kings.  She was very close to them, and the families were very close.  And so Reverend King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] insisted on--when he heard that she was dating somebody, he insisted on meeting me, and so she invited me to church one Sunday.  And I remember sitting in the first row in the balcony 'cause I wanted to be, you know, as far away from everything as I possibly could be.  And instead, he said to the congregation that, "We have a young man in our audience today who has been dating our little Frankie.  And I want you to stand up so that you can see him and meet him." And so I stood.  But anyway, after that, I, I, we, I saw him on several occasions, and, and we sort of liked each other.  I liked him 'cause he was tough.  He was, he was out there.  He was doing his own thing and had a lot of great stories to tell about himself and, and his history.  I was impressed with that.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any story in particular that he shared with you?
Speaker 2: Nah, the only one that I remember had to do with when he went to buy some shoes in a shoe store or something like that.  And I don't remember all the details of it, but he confronted the owner or something.  And, and he won; he got what he wanted or something.  But, but it had to do with, with him patronizing a particular shoe store, and I just don't remember the details.
Speaker 1: Frankie's family name is?
Speaker 2: Lowe, L-O-W-E.
Speaker 1: L-O-W-E.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they lived across the street.  Her family lived across the street from the Kings, and do you remember where that was?  What street?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was Auburn Avenue.
Speaker 1: On Auburn Avenue.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 518 1/2 Auburn Avenue.  It's now in the historical district.  And I tried to buy the house, as a matter of fact, after it was in the historic district, because we would pass by there.  And of course, nobody was living in it.  And it was, it was beginning to fall down, it appeared to me, while they were, you know, revive the historic district and doing home by home.  And her home was, was right next door to where the, I guess, the rangers were over that over, forest rangers.  It was right next door to the home that they made their office in.  And so I spoke to them on several occasions about, about buying the home and fixing it up, and leaving it as it is.  And some of the homes, once they were fixed up, were rented to--there were a lot of businesses from downtown--maybe a lawyer's office or something like that.  And I was gonna just buy it, and fix it up, and turn it back over to them, but there was some confusion over the ownership.  The ownership had ended up in someone's hands who was incarcerated in prison up here or something like that, and they couldn't get a release and this kind of thing.  And so they had to wait a certain number of years before the government could just simply take it and then do something with it.  So they did finally; they took it, did something with it, and, and, and, and put it back in its original shape.
Story_ID: 572153
Speaker 1: So Frankie [Webb's wife, Frankie Lowe Webb] was raised--was she raised next door to the Kings?
Speaker 2: Across the street.
Speaker 1: Across the street, she was raised--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --across the street from the Kings.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And her family obviously had a close relationship with the King family.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think even her grandmother, I think her grandmother either rented from the Kings for a while or, or owned the house that the Kings rented from for a while until they, until they took it over.  But she knew the house well and spent a lot of time there.  She used to play in the house and, and knew it well.
Speaker 1: Did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (JULIEANNA RICHARDSON):  (Simultaneous) She ever tell any stories of the King--growing up with the King family--
Speaker 1: She, she told a number of stories about growing up with, with the King family.  The one that comes to mind is how they all respected, I, I want to say M.L. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], because that's what she called him, even when he was, you know, a young man.  She'd tell stories that they might be having little neighborhood parties sometimes, and someone might have gotten into the liquor cabinet or something like that.  But if, if the word went out that M.L. was coming up the steps or on the way or something like that, they immediately hid all the liquor.  And so they even had this, this respect for him and, and what he stood for even, even then.  And, and, and they, they enjoyed each other's company wherever we were.  Generally, if the King family came to that area--I know when, when M.L. was in New York [New York] and was stabbed in the chest, his mother [Alberta Williams King] came to New York to spend some time with him and, and spent a day with us.  This was in--(unclear).  And when, when M.L. came to Chicago [Illinois] to see what he could do that summer in Chicago, she talked to him fairly frequently.  And, and then we met him on one occasion over at the Hyde Park Shopping Center [Chicago, Illinois] across the street from where we lived in University Apartments and chatted with him for a while.  And he asked her if--said, "Sister Frankie, you're gonna march with me?" She said, "No way, absolutely not." She says--and she told him, she says, "I'm sorry M.L., but I'm not nonviolent," (laughter).  And, and--
Speaker 2: Did everyone refer to him as M.L., people that knew him close?
Speaker 1: I guess so; yeah, in that little group there, they, they, they called him M.L.
Story_ID: 572154
Speaker 1: What was your first impression of him when you met him?
Speaker 2: Of M.L. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?
Speaker 1: And, and--
Speaker 2: Or, or?
Speaker 1: Was the first time you met him in association with Frankie [Webb's wife, Frankie Lowe Webb]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The first time, the first time I met him is interesting because he was, he was, he was down in Montgomery [Alabama] then.  It, it was after the Civil Rights Movement had started.  Then I really had an opportunity to talk to him.  And he was flying, he was flying from Atlanta [Georgia] back to Montgomery, and I was flying from Atlanta to Birmingham [Alabama].  I think he would stop in Birmingham before Montgomery--no, in, in Montgomery before Birmingham, I guess, because he got off the plane first.  But in any event, we were leaving from--we were--it was on a little small plane.  And, and so it, it was a separate terminal from, from the regular terminal at, at the airport [Atlanta Municipal Airport; Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia].  And when we got there Frankie and I, and I think her mother, took me to the airport, and M.L. and, and his mother [Alberta Williams King] were there.  I don't think Coretta [Coretta Scott King] was there.  And she introduced me, and, and, and we talked and decided to ride together.  That was because there were no assigned seats on the, on the plane at that time.  And, and so he, we sat together and, and talked.  And he was very tired.  He was very tired and talked about the Civil Rights Movement a little bit.  And, and you know, I asked him what he was gonna do when the, all of that was done, you know.  And, and he said his ambition was to be president of Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: I was going down; I was being interviewed by A.G. Gaston for a job.  I was in New York [New York] at the time.  I was in New York from '57 [1957] to '62 [1962], and I think this might have been around '60 [1960] that that occurred.  I don't know if that adds up or not.  But I know it was, it was in the latter years of my five years in New York, and so it had to be '60 [1960] to '62 [1962], some time.
Story_ID: 572155
Speaker 1: Tell me about your wedding.
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't have a whole lot of time (laughter) because this was while I was on leave, and I had to get home to see my folks [Bessie Eubanks Webb and James O. Webb, Sr.].  And typical me, I didn't tell anybody about it.  My parents didn't know about it.  And we called them the next day after we got married and told them.
Speaker 1: Had they ever met Frankie [Frankie Lowe Webb]?  Had they met her before the--
Speaker 2: Yes, Frankie had come up and visited us one summer, that summer, that summer that I was--after I graduated [from Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and before I went to the [U.S.] Army.  Yes, and they were crazy about her; they like her a lot.  But the wedding took place.  We didn't--well, I actually, I didn't have anything with me.  I just had my military clothes.  Fortunately, George Key, my good, good roommate was still living in Atlanta [Georgia].  And, and we were about the same size, so I wore George's suit, his shoes, his socks.  I had my own underwear.  I had no money, so George bought the ring and put it on his account because he had, he had gotten married earlier.  And so he had an account at his jewelry store when he bought his wife's ring.  And I had not even seen the ring until George showed up, as he was my best man.  And when I asked him when the--when the Reverend King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] asked for the ring, he played like he didn't have it or something.  But anyway, it made for an interesting moment.
Speaker 1: So Reverend King married you.
Speaker 2: Yes, we got married in Reverend King's study.  Mrs. King [Alberta Williams King] was there, and M.L. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was not there.  I think A.D. [Alfred Daniel Williams King] was there, the younger brother, and I think Christine [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris] was there.  So it was essentially the, the King family and, and my wife's family.  The Lowe family were there and then two of my buddies were both there, well, George Key and Duvant Sells [ph.], and three of them, Al Whitfield [Alphonso Whitfield, Jr.] were there.  And that was it, and Reverend King presided.

Speaker 1: You just got married [to Frankie Lowe Webb] and that interesting story about the wedding ring (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then after your wedding, you went back to the [U.S.] military.
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: And where were you--
Speaker 2: --in Alaska.
Speaker 1: To Alaska.
Speaker 2: To Alaska.
Speaker 1: What part?
Speaker 2: Anchorage.
Speaker 1: And you've, did you finish your tour of duty there?
Speaker 2: Yes, stayed there until I think it was May or June of 1957.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's when you were discharged.
Speaker 2: No, it'd be '55 [1955], '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: So you were only there for two years?
Speaker 2: I was there for two years--
Speaker 1: Two years.
Speaker 2: --active duty.
Speaker 1: Active duty, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, then six years inactive.
Story_ID: 572157
Speaker 1: You came back and lived where?
Speaker 2: Well, when we came back, I--you remember I said that I had already been accepted to University of Michigan--
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: --in their M.B.A. program in Ann Arbor [Michigan].  And so shortly after we came back, then I, I, I, again, spent that summer just, you know, getting ready and, and then starting--
Speaker 1: In Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No, in, in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: In Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Right, and--
Speaker 1: And where was Frankie [Webb's wife, Frankie Lowe Webb]?
Speaker 2: Frankie was in Atlanta because when we left Alaska, she was pregnant.  And while she was in Atlanta--she was visiting her folks--she had a miscarriage.  It was fairly serious.  They thought it was, they thought she had a tubular pregnancy.  And as it turned out, it was appendicitis.  But the surgery to correct the situation cost her the baby.  So she was in Atlanta recovering during that time.
Speaker 1: When you married she was nineteen, you were twenty-one.  She had two more years of college at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: She had one more because she--
Speaker 1: One more.
Speaker 2: --stayed until--she continued in her junior year.  She didn't join me in Alaska until after she had finished that junior year.  We got married in February; she finished in June, and she got up to Alaska sometime in July I think.
Speaker 1: And then you came back?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And when did she finish school?
Speaker 2: When did she finish school?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Never kept that commitment.  I, I encouraged her to.  I tried to get her to go back to school, but she wouldn't do it.
Speaker 1: Because under--what were the conditions that her mother let you marry her?
Speaker 2: That she finish that final year (laughter).  And it just didn't work out that way.
Story_ID: 572158
Speaker 1: You then went on to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in their M.B.A. program.
Speaker 2: It was actually an M.B.A. in actuarial science.
Speaker 1: Now why the University of Michigan?
Speaker 2: That was the only place in the country that, that had actuarial courses at the time.  I think Drake University [Des Moines, Iowa] might have had a course or two but not concentration in actuary, in the actuarial area, as Michigan did.  The only other place in North America was in Montreal [Canada].  I forget--McGill, McGill University in Montreal.
Speaker 1: And this was in 1957.  What was the African American enrollment then?
Speaker 2: Well, it was actually 1955 when I went.
Speaker 1: Fifty-five [1955], okay.
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955], yeah.  Well, there, again, end up being in the actuarial program, and there were only twelve of us in the actuarial program, and I was the only African American.  So, again, it's a small program (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's--
Speaker 2: --small profession people.  Most people had no idea what it was and--
Speaker 1: Why don't you explain a little bit to me about what this--
Speaker 2: Well, actuaries are basically mathematicians, statisticians.  But it ends up being more than that because the bottom line is that you get involved in projecting mortality.  In other words, in order to calculate a rate, an insurance rate, you need to make certain assumptions about how long that person is going to live.  And that is a function of their current age, how long they've survived, so it's a function of the current age and their health condition.  And of course, the insurance application contains information.  And, and if there's an examination involved, that information also from there is taken into consideration when determining their probability in how long they're expected to, to live.  And so, actuaries actually have to study all parts of the body, the diseases that affect the various systems of the body, and their impact upon the mortality of the individual, so that you can underwrite exactly sufficient enough to, to calculate a premium.  It can't be exactly if it's, it's a probability.  So you have to know probability theory, sta- statistics, what we call security of, of, of risk, the measurement of, of, of, of risk and those kinds of things.  So it's, it's a very complex--in order to become a member of the Society of Actuaries, which is, it's not a licensing body, but it's, it says, it's a, it's a studying body.  It, it takes a considerable amount of time and energy to--there're, there're, now I think there're nine or ten examinations that must be passed.  And normally you got to be very good to take more than one in a given year.  So you might say it takes a person who has become an actuary anywhere from seven to ten years to become a fellow in the Society of Actuaries.  So it's a very rigorous profession, which helps to explain why there are so few actuaries.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 572159
Speaker 1: Who are, or do you know if any other--well, let me put it this way: who is the fore- foremost black actuary?
Speaker 2: Well, historically--I mean there are number of black actuaries now, but historically, that was Bob Randall [Robert J. Randall, Sr.].  He was the first member of the Society of Actuaries.  And I would suspect that Bob became a member oh, back in the, I, I would say probably back in the early '50s [1950s] Bob became a member of the Actuarial Society [Actuarial Society of America; Society of Actuaries].
Speaker 1: Is there another person by the name of Asa Spaulding [Asa T. Spaulding]?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Asa Spaulding had taken courses at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], as I understand it, and, and functioned as the actuary for North Carolina Mutual [North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina] early on.  And I think there might have been a, a couple of other people as well that had gone that route, that they had studied actuarial science at some--at, at Michigan and, and, and went on to immediately practice the profession.
Story_ID: 572160
Speaker 1: Just elaborate just a little bit more on other areas that an actuary can go into other than insurance?
Speaker 2: Well, almost all areas relate to insurance, but, but, you know, I could speculate that and some actuaries have, have probably moved on to other areas, in the profession.  Now outside of the profession there are a lot of areas that they can get into.  They're limited if they wanna--in, in, in the use of their knowledge if they want to stay.  They're just, you're either an actuary, or you're not an actuary.  But within the insurance industry, because of your in depth study of the insurance business and, and, and the fundamental concept of, of insurance, which is the actuarial piece, you're probably qualified to fill any position in, in, in the insurance business.  As a matter of fact, the, the CEOs at one time, the CEOs of most of the major life insurance companies, were professional, professionally actuaries because of that, because of their in depth knowledge of the business, of the insurance business as a whole.
Story_ID: 572161
Speaker 1: So when you graduated from the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], you had an M.B.A. in actuarial science.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then what was your first job after that?
Speaker 2: Well, that's interesting because when we were ready to graduate, graduate, we had forty companies coming to interview twelve students.  And we were asked to sign up for those companies that we were interested in.  During the course of that process, one of my professors, Dr. Allen Mayerson [Allen L. Mayerson], called me in to have a frank talk with him.  And, and first he advised me that he had finished Michigan several years before, and he's Jewish, and that when he finished Michigan, the only place that would hire him was New York [New York].  That's the only place, the only companies that would hire him were based in New York.  The rest of the country was virtually off limits to him.  And his message to me was that for African Americans that was still the case.  And therefore, it wouldn't make sense for me to waste my time by signing up for any interviews other than those in New York City.  Now, he was, he was--it was a positive interview because he was trying to be supportive and keep me from being disappointed.  Well, me being me, I, I did do that.  I signed up primarily for New York companies, but I also signed up for an Alabama company.  I just wanted to see the process.  And it was a very interesting experience.  When I was told it was my turn to, to go into the classroom, the fellow was interviewing in a classroom.  He was sitting the far end of the room with his back to the door making notes from his previous interview.  And I got halfway across the room before he turned around and saw me and just was flabbergasted.  He didn't know what to do.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you were the only African American.
Speaker 2: Yes, and he knew what his instructions were as well.  And so I sat down, and he went through the interview.  And of course I was amused and because I knew exactly what was going on, and he had no idea what was going on.  So he went through the process and so forth.  And I forget how he concluded it, but I never even got a turndown letter from him, so it wasn't even turned in.
Story_ID: 572162
Speaker 1: But anyway, I ended up at Mutual of New York [Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York; The MONY Group, Inc., New York, New York].  I, I got job offers from I believe it was Metropolitan [Metropolitan Life Insurance Company] or New York Life [New York Life Insurance Company] and Mutual of New York, and I, I chose to go to Mutual of New York and started there in, in 1957.
Speaker 2: And you were there how long?
Speaker 1: I was there for five years.  It was a--in, in those days, because there were so few actuaries, your giant insurance companies had what they called actuarial training programs, sort of similar to a management training program, only they focused entirely on the actuarial end of the business.  And most of the big companies, at least certainly Mutual of New York, kept about oh, fifteen or so people in that program.  And I was told at one time that they felt fortunate if they could keep a couple of those people after their five years.  It was a five year training program.  And we were given plenty of time to study for exams.  We had a special rotating system where they would rotate us through the company to give us experience in the various areas.  It was a tremendous educational process for me.  But, during that time, as I had indicated before, some of the black insurance companies, because of their size or their level of sophistication, wanted to have actuaries.  None had an actuary, since it was--except of course Asa Spaulding [Asa T. Spaulding] at North Carolina Mutual [North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina].  And I think there was a fellow maybe at Golden State Mutual [Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company] that had taken some courses.  And so I was offered, you know, an interview in A.G. Gaston's insurance company.  I think it was called Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington Insurance Company].  I'm not sure which, of the name.  But anyway, it was in, in, located in Birmingham [Alabama].  And, and, and then I was courted by Supreme Life Insurance Company [Supreme Life Insurance Company of America] to come to Chicago [Illinois].  They needed an actuary.  And I was courted by the president, by Earl B. Dickerson, who was a very, very special man.  He's, he's another very important character in, in my history.
Speaker 2: Before we talk about that, I'd just like to ask you a couple of things.  Mutual of New York, what was your starting salary (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) My starting salary was one of the highest coming out of, out of University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  It was $5,000, something like $5,690.
Speaker 2: A year?
Speaker 1: A year, five thousand--
Speaker 2: And that was in 1957?
Speaker 1: Yes, $5,690, and, and that was in 1957.  And you know, it was--the other guys were getting oh, anywhere from ninety to one hundred dollars a week.  And I think mine ended up being $110 or something like that.
Speaker 2: And you stayed there for five years, and it was basically a training program.
Speaker 1: It was basically a training program in which they, they hoped they could hold onto people, but it was, actuaries were in, too much in demand.  And, and so companies looking for actuaries would just raid like crazy and go after their--they'd wait until they'd got in their fourth year maybe or--and then go after, go after the trainees.  But--
Story_ID: 572163
Speaker 1: Mr. Dickerson [Earl B. Dickerson] started after me, oh, I think I had only finished about three years.  And he was fascinating man.  He would come to New York [New York] and call me and say, "Webb [HistoryMaker James O. Webb], I'm in New York staying at the Waldorf Astoria [Waldorf Astoria New York], and I would like to have lunch with you at the Bull and Bear [Bull and Bear Prime Steakhouse, New York, New York], meet me," (laughter); and, and I'd say, "Yes, sir," (laughter), and so I would, I would go meet with him.  And he would talk to me about Chicago [Illinois] and talk to me about Supreme Life [Supreme Life Insurance Company of America].  Now I was not all that interested in Chicago 'cause the only time I had seen Chicago was when I had to change trains when I was on my way to Seattle [Washington] to disembark to go to Alaska.  And so I was going from one train station to another.  And of course, you know what train station areas looked like in those days.  And so it was not very impressive, so I, I was not anxious to come to Chicago.  Furthermore, we had, at that point, I think we had two children [Pamela Webb Dixon and Lisa Webb], and I needed to decide what I was going to do because he, he kept doing this.  He would come back every two or three months and take me to lunch at the Bull and Bear.  So finally, I came up with an idea.  I said I've got to decide what I'm gonna do because I was renting an apartment, and we need to buy a home for the, for the kids to, so they'd have room to move around and play.  And so I sent him a letter and saying that, "Okay, I will come to Chicago if these things are met."
Speaker 2: And those things were?
Speaker 1: If I can remember them.  It's interesting, but, but first of all, I wanted to start off being a vice president.  I wanted to be an assistant to the president 'cause I liked him, and I wanted to work with him, so I wanted to report directly to the president.  By that time my salary had gone to about eight thousand [dollars].  I wanted to start off at eleven thousand; and I wanted a guarantee of a thousand dollar increase every year for four years; and of course, I wanted all expenses paid for, for the move and everything else.  And I think that was it.  It might have been something else, but that was it, and so I sent him that letter.  And a year went by, and I never heard from him.  And I said, "Okay, that's great.  Let's move on with our lives," and so we bought a house out in Hempstead, Long Island [New York], and settled in.  About six months after we bought the house, the phone rings.  "Hi, it's Earl Dickerson.  I'm at the Waldorf Astoria.  I want to meet you for lunch at the Bull and Bear."  (Laughter) And so, and, and so I, I liked him so much, I got so much out of our meetings, I said, "Okay, I'll, I'll have lunch with you."  So I told my wife [Frankie Lowe Webb], I said, "I'm having lunch with Mr. Dickerson, but don't worry about it.  We're settled in.  We're not going anywhere.  I'm just gonna have lunch with him."  And so (laughter), we finished our lunch, and he looked at me, said, "Webb, we want you to come to Chicago.  Here's what we're gonna do for you: we are going to give you eleven thousand a year to start with, with guaranteed thousand dollar increases for the next four years.  You'll report to me, and you'll be vice president of actuary."  He went through the whole thing (laughter), just gave me everything I wanted.  To this day, he never acknowledged receiving my letter, never.  And, and so I just had tremendous--I enjoyed working with him.
Speaker 2: So, you went back, told your wife we're on--
Speaker 1: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 2: --our way to New York--I mean--
Speaker 1: On our way to Chicago.
Speaker 2: --we're on our way to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Right, right, she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you had just purchased a home in Hempstead.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 572164
Speaker 1: I want to just back up just a little bit because we didn't talk about the birth of your children.  Frankie [Frankie Lowe Webb] comes to New York [New York].  You, you move to New York.  Was your first child born in New York?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The first child was born in, in Cleveland [Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because when I accepted the position, Frankie was pregnant with our first child, again.  And because of the problem with the miscarriage and everything, we wanted her to get the best of care under circumstances where there would be people to look out for her.  So she stayed with my parents [Bessie Eubanks Webb and James O. Webb, Sr.] in Cleveland until the baby was born, and then she joined me in, in New York.
Speaker 1: And your child was born in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-seven [1957]--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --October of '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: --and that was a girl?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And her name?
Speaker 2: Pamela Ruth [Pamela Webb Dixon].
Speaker 1: Then your second child was born.
Speaker 2: The second child was born in New York, after we moved to New York, and her name is Lisa Suzanne [Lisa Webb].
Speaker 1: And that was what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 1: Okay, and what year is it when you start to work with Supreme Life Insurance Company [Supreme Life Insurance Company of America]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-two [1962].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had been in the home [in Hempstead, New York] for one year, for less than--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a year, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, just about a year.
Story_ID: 572165
Speaker 1: Okay, so now we move to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about that experience.  You're vice president of actuaries.
Speaker 2: Vice president of actuary.  And I enjoyed it.  It was a very interesting role because they hired me to, to, to be an actuary without realizing the breadth of training that actuaries have to go through.  So once they found out what I could do (laughter), I started taking over various departments and ended up with significant responsibility in the company.
Speaker 1: And significantly more money.
Speaker 2: Oh, and significantly more money, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: What is your fondest memory of Earl B. Dickerson?
Speaker 2: Oh, geez, he, he, the twinkle in his eye.  You know, he, he was so smart.  Yeah, he was such a human being.  I mean he, he was exactly what you saw.  He's--and, and maybe I had mentioned before something like that, but you know, I've always, myself, tried to make sure that people saw me for who I am, and hopefully they will like what they see.  But if they don't (laughter), you know, I'm hopeful that they like what they see.  But, and Earl was very much that way.  He was his own person, but he was out there.  He did not hide who he was, any aspect of his personality, and, and I respected that.  And, and he was extremely bright, good businessman, good insight, good instincts, and, and just observing him and working with him was very, very educational for me.
Speaker 1: How long were you with Supreme [Supreme Life Insurance Company of America]?
Speaker 2: Four years.
Speaker 1: And you left there and--
Speaker 2: I left there in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) went?
Speaker 2: --sixty-six [1966].
Story_ID: 572166
Speaker 1: And then, where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois].
Speaker 1: Here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Here in Chicago--
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: --the Illinois plan.
Speaker 1: --how did that happen?
Speaker 2: They--we had a common consulting firm.  And one day--I, I had done quite a bit at Supreme [Supreme Life Insurance Company of America].  I had sort of fostered a change in logo, new policies, a lot of change, and we had sort of run out of change (laughter), to some extent.  And these fellows that had been helping me, the consultants, and putting together marketing materials and things of that nature, they approached me one day.  And a fellow said that, "Tell me if I'm off base, but we have the feeling that you might be interested in looking at other things."  And I said, "Well, tell me about it."  And so they said, "We have a client whom we represent that is looking for an actuary, and, and we think that you might be the right person for them."  And so that's, that's how it came about.  I interviewed and as a matter of fact, they offered me two jobs because there was a, the national association [Blue Cross Blue Shield Association] is also located here in, in Illinois, in Chicago.  And they had an actuarial position open, and so they asked if they can interview me as well.  And, and so both the Illinois plan and the national association offered me a job at the same time, and I took the plan job.
Speaker 1: What was it like telling Mr. Dickerson [Earl B. Dickerson] you were leaving?  How did that play?
Speaker 2: I think he understood.  He, again, he, he didn't take things personally.  And, and I had, I'd sort of done my job.  They had somewhat a new company, in a sense, and, and, and they were okay; they were, they were gonna do fine.  And so he, he blessed it and, and let me go.
Speaker 1: If you could say that you learned one or you gained one particular bit of knowledge from Dickerson, what would it be?  Or he you said one thing that maybe changed your professional opinion about something, what would that be?
Speaker 2: I think that it was his, his demeanor and how he, how he dealt with people, straight up, frank but sensitive, caring.  You know, he, he was a kind of guy that would--you'd give him, flash your best smile, and he would tell you there's spinach on your teeth, I mean rather than to have you walk around the rest of the day not knowing it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so he wanted to be supportive in that way.
Story_ID: 572167
Speaker 1: When your family relocated to Chicago [Illinois], where did you live?
Speaker 2: We lived in University Apartments [Chicago, Illinois].  The, the human resource vice president of, of Supreme Life [Supreme Life Insurance Company of America], who later turned out to be vi- my very closest friend, Warren H. Bacon, Warren actually found it for me.  They were just, they were just opening, and so we were the first to be in the apartment that we had.  It was great location right on a corner looking toward the shopping center [Hyde Park Shopping Center, Chicago, Illinois].  And so he found it for us, and we grabbed our belongings and moved in.  He met us at the, at the apartment that day and got settled and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: And you lived there for how long?
Speaker 2: Lived for, it was either four, between four and five years.  And we watched all of the townhouses being built around in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] and had said, "Okay, when we're ready we'll move into one of those townhouses."  Well, by the time that time came, they had almost doubled in, in, in value and couldn't afford them.  And so we, I drew a circle around the City of Chicago, and it, it, it ended with Wilmette [Illinois], I believe.  And so we--on the North Side [sic. North Shore]--and I wasn't too interested on the other, you know, on the other suburbs.  And so I, I, you know, I, I, I did some searches and didn't find anything that we liked and, and, and ran into quite a bit of discrimination in some of the areas.  And at the last minute, a realtor said, 'cause I was ready to give up for a while, and the realtor said, "Are you, would you be interested in going a little bit further to Glencoe [Illinois]?  I have something that I think you might like."  And so I said, "Okay, fine, but this is our last one."  We'd been looking for three, four months.  I said, "This is the last one.  I don't want to waste anymore weekends."  We looked at it, and liked it, and bought it right on the spot, in Glencoe.  And so we ended up moving from, from Hyde Park to Glencoe, Illinois.  And as it turned out, there were a number of Hyde Park people in Glencoe, very interesting.
Speaker 1: So what was the African American population then?  'Cause we're thinking--
Speaker 2: In--
Speaker 1: --we're, we're looking at what, 1969?
Speaker 2: In--when did we move out there, '62 [1962]?  It was in Chicago.  We moved out there about '66 [1966] or '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The population at that time was a fraction above 3 percent.  Subsequent to that, the population, the African American population actually decreased, but it was about 3 percent at the time.
Story_ID: 572168
Speaker 1: Going back to your professional career, you left Supreme Life Insurance Company [Supreme Life Insurance Company of America], and you went to Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois] as the treasurer?
Speaker 2: No, I went there as an actuarial assistant or assistant act- yeah, assistant actuary was the title--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --at the time.
Speaker 1: --and that was 1966.
Speaker 2: That was 1966.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how was that experience?
Speaker 2: Well, I was there for eighteen years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I progressed well in the company.  In two years I had an opportunity to move into a different role.  They decided to establish a product development capability, and they were looking for an assistant vice president to head that up.  And my response was: "I can do that," (laughter).  And, and so they interviewed me, and, and I got the job.  And a couple of years later, there was anoth- there was a vice presidency that opened up.  I think it was maybe only a year later.  And I said, "I can do that, too," (laughter), and so, so they gave me the job.  So, make a long story short, I had a, I had a nice career there.  It was a very successful career there for, for eighteen years.
Speaker 1: And that's Blue Cross and Blue Shield, what, located here in Chicago [Illinois].  And what is their address?
Speaker 2: You know, they've, they've moved.  They have their own building that you can see as you approach the city from the south.  It has a bluish tint to it, and I understand--I haven't been in it, quite honestly, but I understand it's quite a beautiful building.  But I don't know the address, but it's in the, it's downtown.
Speaker 1: In downtown Chicago, okay.  And you stayed there for sixteen years.
Speaker 2: Eighteen years.
Speaker 1: Eighteen years, which is 1985 (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-four [1984].
Speaker 1: Eighty-four [1984].  And now in between there, did you do anything else?  Were you with any other organizations or consulting for--
Speaker 2: Professionally?
Speaker 1: Professional organizations.
Speaker 2: No, that was Illinois Blue Cross Blue Shield for that entire time.

Speaker 1: And what about your treasury with the American Academy of Actuaries [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, but that was a volunteer thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was volunteer.
Speaker 2: And I was, I was asked to by the then president of the academy if I would be willing to stand for election to the, to the board and to come on as the treasurer.  And it was a very prestigious thing, and so of course I said yes.
Speaker 1: Were you the first African American to hold that position?
Speaker 2: Well, to be on the board, yeah, as well as--
Speaker 1: In his--
Speaker 2: --treasurer, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the history.
Speaker 2: In history, yes.
Speaker 1: The absolute--
Speaker 2: And to my knowledge--
Speaker 1: --first.
Speaker 2: --and to my knowledge, I don't know if there's been one since.
Speaker 1: And how many--
Speaker 2: I just don't know.
Speaker 1: --do you know how many African Americans hold membership in the academy?
Speaker 2: Not now, you know, because at that time, I mean, you could count us on one hand.  But, oh, geez, several years ago I was invited an organization that is called Black Actuarial, Black Actuarial Society [sic. International Association of Black Actuaries] or something like that, that they were just starting up.  And they had seen historically where I had been one of the earlier people, and so they invited me to their meeting in Washington [D.C.] to participate.  And they took a historical picture.  At that time, I was amazed that there were--now these, this included students, and, and those that were going through the exams, and those that were working as actuaries and so forth.  But there, I was amazed that there had to be, oh, geez, a good fifty people there at that time.  And, but it was after my stint on the board, and I got to know people.  We encouraged the development of, of actuaries from the black community, and we, we encouraged them to do outreach; otherwise, you weren't gonna, you weren't gonna get to them because, for the most part, black students, even math students, didn't know anything about actuarial science because it's not something that gets talked about a lot unless you have a relative or, or a good friend who is an actuary.  And so, through some of our efforts, we, we got them to reach out in a formal way to, to black students until that helped to turn it around.  And once black mathematicians and students who were good at math started hearing about it, then they started enrolling in actuarial programs.
Speaker 1: Jesse Hill.
Speaker 2: Jesse Hill was, was the, the other one that I couldn't remember along with Asa Spaulding [Asa T. Spaulding] who had taken courses in, at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: You know, I did not know Asa well, but I knew Jesse very well, very well.
Speaker 1: And I understand that he's very involved in getting students involved in actuarial programs--
Speaker 2: He is.  It's my understanding too and--
Speaker 1: --and recruitment.
Speaker 2: --through his role Atlanta Life [Atlanta Life Insurance Company; Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 1: At Atlanta Life, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) he's, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1: Do you see a future for young blacks in that field?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  It's still a very, very lucrative field and a lot of opportunity, if you have that skill.  You have to have the mathematical skill to be successful.  It has to be sort of a second nature to--you really to like it, and that weeds out a lot of people.  It's not, it's most people, it's not their favorite, their favorite course in, in school.  But if, if, if someone has that skill, it's certainly a profession that they ought to look at as they're considering what they want to do for a career.
Speaker 1: So your, your career as an actuary started out at five thousand [dollars] a year, $5,600 a year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What would you say the starting intern's salary would be for someone now?
Speaker 2: Today?
Speaker 1: Today.
Speaker 2: Geez, I have no idea, but I would have to assume that starting would be someplace around at least between, depending upon how many exams they had passed and you know, someone who is just beginning to take the exams, it might be sixty-five thousand or so.  Someone who has passed all of their exams, it could probably be as high as a hundred and fifty [$150,000] to start.
Speaker 1: Which is significant--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --very significant.
Story_ID: 572171
Speaker 1: You moved to Glencoe [Illinois], and your children [Pamela Webb Dixon and Lisa Webb] went to elementary school there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they went to elementary school in--
Speaker 1: And what school was that?
Speaker 2: They both started off at South School [Glencoe, Illinois], and then their middle school was Central School [Glencoe, Illinois], and then they both went to New Trier High School [Winnetka, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And how involved were you in Glencoe?  I want you to tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I became very involved the minute I got there.  It was during the days when there were efforts to open up suburban communities to black families.  And so I became involved with the Human Relations Committee [Glencoe Human Relations Committee] because they were trying to get legislation passed, an opening housing ordinance passed by the city council.  And so I participated in that.  Much of the work had been done, and so I sort of got in on the tail end of that.  But it gave me enough exposure to, to get a sense of the community and an understanding of the community, what its needs were and you know, what its attitudes were.  And so I be--I, I continued to be active after that legislation was passed.  I continued to be active in the Human Relations Committee, eventually became its vice president and president of the Human Relations Committee.  I--one of the things that--it, it wasn't so much a Human Relations Committee activity, but there were a group of black parents then that, that expressed some concern with the school system not, not being responsive to the needs of, of black children.  And they asked me if I would work with them to try to have some dialogue with the schools.  So I stepped into that situation, and we made a great deal of progress in getting to know the superintendent and getting him to understand.  In those days, you know, the, the, the attitude of people--'cause he was a great guy.  He, he, I liked the way he, he fought.  But, but his, his, his belief at the time was that African Americans wanted to be treated like anybody else.  Well, we took the position no.  We want them to be recognized as African Americans--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) As African Americans, right.
Speaker 2: --and with special needs and that we want you to respond to.  For example, that example that we use most of the time is that, you know, our kids had a tendency to congregate in the back of the room and sit in the back row. For whatever reasons, that was the tendency.  And we made the point that when that happens, we want you to put them up front.  We don't want you just to sit back there and say oh, isn't that nice, they're sitting together (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and, and respond to them.  You know, we want you to see what's happening from a social point of view, from a developmental point of view, and get them up front, and, and, and because that's what, that's what they need in order to improve their self-image and things of this nature.  And he understood what we were saying and began to implement that in the schools.  And I, I went about it in a positive way.  I, I don't like confrontations as a way to--and not at first at least.  You know, I try to resolve things through, through negotiation.
Story_ID: 572172
Speaker 1: A vacancy occurred on the school board, and so they came to me then and asked if, if I would be willing to go on the school board, and so I accepted it.
Speaker 2: Did you serve as the village president, or--
Speaker 1: That came years later.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But your initial entree in--
Speaker 1: In politics there was--
Speaker 2: --in politics was--
Speaker 1: --was the school board.
Speaker 2: --the school board.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it was an interesting period because it was during a period of declining enrollment around the country because the birth rate was going down, and kids just weren't filling, filling schools, and Glencoe [Illinois] had an abundance of schools.  We had one school that at that time had 115 students in brand new buildings, swimming pools, everything, beautiful school, 115 students.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: And it was just totally uneconomical.  And so we decided that we were gonna have to close the school.  But we knew it was gonna be traumatic, and so I was asked to head up a committee to, to, to, to try to make this happen.  And so what I did, I actually put together a, a, a community committee of a, about a hundred people.  We split them into dera- various, various subgroups and things to study various issues, came up with a document probably about two and half inches thick to support the closing of the school, and it happened.  We closed the school.  That doesn't mean--the community accepted it, but of course the people that were in the midst of it did--
Speaker 2: Had a problem.
Speaker 1: --did have some, some problems with it.  And, and so after that, you know, I, I became president of the school board for a couple of years before my, my final term expired.  And so then I, I sort of didn't do anything in Glencoe for a while.  I served on a few small committees and things like that and--
Speaker 2: What year was that that you were the president?
Speaker 1: Well, I was on the school board from '71 [1971] to '78 [1978].  And I was president from '76 [1976], I believe, to '78 [1978].
Story_ID: 572173
Speaker 1: After you left the Blue Cross and Blue Shield [Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois], you went where?
Speaker 2: Dental Network of America [Dental Network of America, LLC].  It was a, it was a company--my, my last assignment at Blue Cross Blue Shield was, I was senior vice president of, of new business development and strategy and things of that nature.  And there was a dental company that provided services to several of the larger Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross Blue Shield Association] plans around the country, New York, and Michigan, and Ohio, and California, et cetera.  And they were about to go out of business.  And that would have significantly hurt the business of those companies.  And so the decision was that we need to step in and acquire that company and see to it that it doesn't go out of business.  Well, I was put in charge of doing the due diligence and, and, and negotiating the acquisition and that kind of thing, which took quite a bit of time.  But after we had finished, then I was asked if I would be CEO of the company, and my first response was, "No, I like it where I am," (laughter) you know.  I been here for eighteen years, and I'm--
Speaker 1: Was that a Chicago [Illinois] based company?
Speaker 2: It was a Chicago based company.  Well, we could have moved it anywhere we wanted to, but it was Chicago based.  And so my first response was, "No."  And they said, "Well, will you at least come out here Monday morning, 'cause it has no leadership.  We just bought it on Friday, and so somebody has to run it on Monday." So I said, "Fine.  I'll go out there and I'll run it."  It was based in Oakbrook Terrace [Illinois] on the west side.  And so I said, "Fine, I'll, I'll go out there and run it."  Well, I got out there, and after two or three months of, of running my own show, I said geez, "I like this. You know, there's a lot of challenge here.  There's a lot of opportunity here.  I think I can really turn this thing around and make it a success."  And so I called the chairman [Simeon Martin Hickman] of the board and said, "I'd like to throw my hat in the ring."  And so he says, "That's great.  The job's yours," (laughter), "you know."
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Your hat's in.
Speaker 2: So, and so that's, that's how I got there.
Speaker 1: What does the Dental Network do?
Speaker 2: We provided administrative services to Blue Cross Blue Shield plans that had what we call managed dental care programs.  It's very similar to a medical HMO, and these were Dental HMOs [health maintenance organization]--
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: --whereas we had a panel of dentists and dental offices, and they belong to the network.  And therefore, if you signed up and bought this program, you would go to a, to that dentist that you had selected.  And, and then we, we did the administration of it.  So we--
Speaker 1: That was like a early HMO.
Speaker 2: A very early, verily, very early dental HMO, but--
Speaker 1: Dent- yeah.
Speaker 2: And I was familiar with the concept, because while I was at Blue Cross Blue Shield, I had actually negotiated the very first HM--medical HMO in the State of Illinois, which was in downstate Illinois as a matter of fact, and so I was very familiar with the concept.  As, as, as a business development person, I've actually even had studies done on what was then called dental capitation to determine the feasibility of our entering that business, and so I knew a lot about it.
Story_ID: 572174
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So how do you do that?
Speaker 2: How do you do what?
Speaker 1: How do you do, how do you figure those equations?  How do you figure--
Speaker 2: You study the business and it, and--
Speaker 1: You study that--
Speaker 2: --its feasibility.
Speaker 1: Yeah, how do, yeah, how do you do that feasibility.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's, it's just a very extensive--a lot of it is, is research to understand what's out there now.
Speaker 1: Just in general, take me through a step.
Speaker 2: Well, first of all--
Speaker 1: --the steps.
Speaker 2: --what, what is the product?  What's the product concept that you're talking about?  And you know, and, and, and it's, it's not gonna be cast in bronze because since it's a new product, you might have to tweak it here and there to really make it a viable product.  But first you have to define what is the product?  Then you have to think of terms of is it a marketable product; can it be rated from an actuarial point of view?  Can you come up with the rates that people will buy?  Can you come up with an administrative system that is sufficiently efficient so that you can keep your costs of the, of the product down?  And, and once you feel that you have a good product, it's a viable product, you can, you can calculate rates for it.  It's something that people will buy.  Then you have to develop the administrative system for it.  How do we administer this product?  And so once all of that's done, now you have a product that you can say okay, we can present it for approval by the insurance department.  All new products have to be approved by the state insurance department.  And then you're off and running.  Start marketing it, see what happens.
Speaker 1: Interesting, so that's how we arrive at (laughter) that.  Okay, so now you, you stay with the Dental Network [Dental Network of America, LLC] for how long?
Speaker 2: For nine years, almost ten; well, actually close to ten years.
Speaker 1: You started in '79 [1979].
Speaker 2: No, started in '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: Eighty-four [1984] (unclear)--
Speaker 2: And decided to retire in 1994.
Speaker 1: And you retired in 1984--
Speaker 2: Ninety-four [1994] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) nineteen ninety-four [1994].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 572175
Speaker 1: You run for president or mayor of Glencoe [Illinois] in 1993?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I was approached in--
Speaker 1: What is the title?  Is it president or mayor?
Speaker 2: In Glencoe, they call it president.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When you're meeting with other mayors, you're referred to as mayor.
Speaker 1: To as the mayor, I see.
Speaker 2: When I would go to the U.S. Conference of Mayors meetings, I was mayor.  But I was approached in 1991.  The village was having--'90 [1990] really, 1990. The village was having some real problems.  There were some, some critical issues that, that had divided the community and clearly the community was ready to elect a new president.  And I was asked if, if I would stand for election by a group of people.  They happened to be former presidents and former village managers, and the pledged to work for me (laughter), 'cause I'm, didn't see myself as a politician.  And, and so after a lot of thought, quite frankly, my daughters [Pamela Webb Dixon and Lisa Webb] are the ones that convinced me to do it, because I felt that I had done all that I needed to do in the community where I lived.  And one of them asked the key question: "Has there ever been an African American president of Glencoe?"  And I told them no.  And it's been around since the late 1800s.  And they asked me, "What were the chances of there being an African American president sometime in the near future?" And I said, "Well, I don't know, but I don't see anyone on the horizon."  And I got the message that--
Speaker 1: That you--
Speaker 2: --that this is something that was very important, perhaps more important for others than for me.  And so I accepted; I said, "Yes, I, I, I'll, I'll run."  And I'm glad I did.  I, I, and for my second term, I ran unopposed.  And, and I, I had a, I had a good, a good two terms.  But I felt that, I'm a big believer in that when you lead an organization, if you lead it for too long, you're, you're not being fair.  You're getting stale.  You've already said everything that you have to say.  Everything, every idea that you have that hasn't worked, probably is no good anyway, and that's why it didn't work.  And so you need to step down and allow someone else to have their opportunity, fresh ideas, different perspective.  And it's not fair to sit there and, and, and, and hog things.  And, and so that's why I'm retired from Dental Network of America [Dental Network of America, LLC], and, and that's why I decided not to run for a third term.  Although there had never been a third term in the history of Glencoe, people did approach me and ask me about a third term, and I decided no.
Story_ID: 572176
Speaker 1: What do you feel are some of your most positive contributions that you've--that happened under your [mayoral] administration at, with Glencoe [Illinois], for Glencoe?
Speaker 2: Well, the very first was to bring the community back together, which I felt was critical because it had really been split apart.  And so I, I called in representatives from both sides, and just met with them, and, and said guys, we've got to--what, what's your, what's your issue?  We've got to bring this community--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --together.  What, what are--why are you fighting so hard against this?  Why are you fighting so hard for this?  And, and, and, and just to seek a reconciliation.  And then I decided to, to, again, form a committee, a large committee of people but with all of these dissidents of people who disagreed on it; and said, "Okay, you're charged with the responsibility of, of working this through and, and advising the board, the council, and me as to how we should go, where we should go from here to get this community back on its--on the right path."  And they did, and we did, and it worked.  And one of the advantages I had is that we celebrated our 125th anniversary around that time as a, as a village.  And so we put together a hun- a hundred and twenty-five voice choir that sang at our celebration of thanksgiving, that was held in the, in the Jewish temple on, on, on Sheridan Road.  And so we, we had all of this camaraderie and ecumenican- ecumenism going on.  And people started feeling good in, about the community.  And that allowed us, then, to create an atmosphere where we could move on.
Story_ID: 572177
Speaker 1: Your children [Pamela Webb Dixon and Lisa Webb], were they very involved in the community [in Glencoe, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, no, because they were really kids, you know.  They, when they went away to college--
Speaker 1: And where'd they go?
Speaker 2: Now, they were active in their high school [New Trier High School, Winnetka, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Where did they go to school, to college?
Speaker 2: In the--
Speaker 1: I--you told me the elementary--
Speaker 2: The oldest one went to, to Drake [Drake University, Des Moines, Iowa] but then decided that she wanted to be a homemaker before she finished.
Story_ID: 572178
Speaker 1: Okay, that's my, my maternal grandmother on--my mother's mother, Fannie Eubanks, and she was from Georgia.  She lived with us until I was about ten years old.  She passed away at that time.
Speaker 2: And that's my mother and father.  And we've made up stories about that.  My sister [Etta Webb Young] and I think that it's probably at Niagara Falls [New York], maybe even on their honeymoon, but who knows.  We have no idea.  We just found that among the mother's things.  My mother's name was Bessie Eubanks [Bessie Eubanks Webb], and my dad was a senior, James O. Webb, Sr.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Also--
Speaker 2: They called him J.O.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, also, sir, for each photograph, give us your best guess about the date.  If you remember exactly, that's great.  If you can only kind of approximate, that's good too.
Speaker 2: Approximations are gonna be very, very wild.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: That's me and my dad.  Obviously, I was into hats, as he was.  That probably was taken, well, it looks there like, what, I'm about maybe three, three years old or so.  That would have made it about 1934.
Speaker 1: And that's a picture of me and, and Joe Louis.  I think I was about twelve years old at the time, and so that would have made it 1943 or so.  I don't know if that adds up, 'cause I know Joe Louis was in the [U.S] military at some point.  But he was back and forth because he was in the Special Services corps.  That was the entertainment section of the [U.S.] Army.  But at that time, he was living in Detroit [Michigan], but this was in Cleveland, Ohio.  He loved golf.  And a friend and I had heard that he was gonna be at that golf course that particular day, and we went out, tracked him down, and asked him if he would take a picture with me.  And he said, "Sure, boy, come on over here," (laughter), so, and so that's the result of it, very, very nice fellow.
Speaker 2: And that's me when I was in the military.  I was drafted into the Army after I finished college in September of '53 [1953].  I, I think I was, I was still in basic training during this time, so this had to be around the fall of 1953.  I did my basic training at Fort Knox, Kentucky, and so that's where that was taken.
Speaker 1: That's my wife and I.  I, I got married while I was in the Army and just before I was shipped out to Alaska.  This picture, I believe, was taken though when we, she joined me in Alaska for part of the time I was up there.  This was taken after we returned from Alaska, and I believe this was actually taken in--it might have been taken in New York City [New York, New York].  And so I would, I would guess that this was probably around 1960 or so.
Speaker 2: These are our two girls with my mother, their grandmother.  The oldest daughter is Pam, and Pamela Ruth [Pamela Webb Dixon].  And the baby is our youngest daughter, Lisa Suzanne [Lisa Webb].  And that was taken when we lived in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: This was taken shortly after we moved to Chicago [Illinois] at the time that Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was active in Chicago.  And we were in the shopping center, Hyde Park Shopping Center [Chicago, Illinois] across from where we lived at the time [University Apartments].  And I didn't know he was there, quite frankly.  I, I think we just walked past, and he was coming out of his doctor's, his doctor's office and saw us.  And of course, he, he saw Frankie [Frankie Lowe Webb] right away, and, and they hugged, and then they, the kids took a picture with him.  I especially like that smile on his face because you, people rarely had an opportunity to, to get a sense of, of, the sense of humor that he had; he had a tremendous sense of humor.
Speaker 2: And that's the senior Reverend King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], and that was taken in our home in, in Glencoe [Illinois].  We had invited him to come and speak at a Human Relations Committee [Glencoe Human Relations Committee] annual dinner that particular year.  I remember that this was an election year.  It was just prior to Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] running for, for president because we got into a deep discussion about that.  But he stayed with us for two or three days, and I had an interesting time polishing his shoes for him and things of that nature.
Speaker 1: And that's a family picture taken in the same setting, as a matter of fact, in the same home that Reverend King visited.  That's my youngest daughter, who is, as you look at the picture to, to my left, and, and my son-in-law and, and oldest daughter to the right, and oldest grandson, who I have my hands on his shoulders, and of course my, my wife, Frankie, who is to the, the other side of my youngest daughter.
Speaker 2: This was taken not tremendously long ago.  It, but Frankie and I had gone to an event at Morehouse, Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].  And I called together some of my old buddies from, from college and invited them down to, I think this was at The Ritz-Carlton, Buckhead outside of Atlanta [Georgia], as a matter of fact, and had a grand time; you know, it was, it was just great seeing the, the guys, and it was a fun, fun evening.
Speaker 1: My wife and I, we, we vacationed a lot.  We, we traveled a great deal.  And quite honestly, I can't tell you exactly where that was, but we did go to the Caribbean quite a bit, and, and that sort of looks like the Caribbean, but I'm guessing; I'm just not sure.  You noticed I was sporting a mustache then, fairly heavy one.
Speaker 2: This is, was taken shortly after I was elected mayor of the Village of Glencoe.  And they were taking this, I believe, for our newsletter.  I initiated a, a newsletter, monthly newsletter, and each month I had a president's letter.  And, and we tried to vary the photographs that went along with my president's letter, and this was taken for that purpose.
Speaker 1: This was actually taken after my wife had passed away, even though we were living in, in North Carolina at that time.  Glencoe wanted to have a memorial service for her, and so we came back for the memorial service.  And they flew the flag at half staff that day in her honor.
Speaker 2: And this was one of the gifts that was given to me, or honors I guess, after I had finished my two terms, eight years as mayor of, of the Village of Glencoe.  They named a street after me [James O. Webb Way], and there I am.  I'm not sure of the significance of the stop sign there, but (laughter) in any event, I was honored, quite honored.
Speaker 1: This was taken at a luncheon, actually, in, in, in Washington, D.C., when Hillary [Hillary Rodham Clinton] visited the home of a friend of mine.  I happened to be in Washington, D.C., on some other business.  And she had invited me over, and I stopped over and had an opportunity to meet Hillary, and this photograph was snapped while I was talking to her.
Speaker 2: This is when I was mayor of, of, of Glencoe.  And as a matter of fact, this was, this was at one of the U.S. Conference of Mayors conventions that I had the pleasure of attending along with Frankie.  While I was mayor we went to several.  Mayor Daley [Richard M. Daley] was very, very active, as a matter of fact, when the first, the first meeting that I attended he was actually president of the, of the--for that year.  And, and so that was--we were very proud of that, of that photograph.  I got to know the mayor quite well and enjoyed talking to him.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of Ed Williams [HistoryMaker Edward J. Williams] from Harris Bank [Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois].  He was executive vice president at Harris Bank while I was a, a director.  And both Ed and I moved to North Carolina about the same time.  And, and this was a, a day that we were enjoying North Carolina, beautiful North Carolina weather.  And this was taken on my back deck overlooking the golf course in the backgrounds, very enjoyable.

Speaker 1: --CEO of Dental Network America [Dental Network of America, LLC] which at the time, that was a big deal.  And I want to put it sort of in context, you know, your appointment.  Who was actually--because this would have been, this is, you know, this is--I was just interviewing Dr. Clifton Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] in New York [New York], and this time period is very interesting to me because it's a time period that, you know, blacks were just--you know, you saw the first wave of blacks of CEOs.  And I'm wondering, you know, who you knew in other positions, you know, around the country and, and what your, what was spoken of in terms of your position and its significance.
Speaker 2: You know, very little.  I, I was, I was sensitive to other African Americans that were CEOs, but there was very little communication, I think for a couple of reason.  For me, first of all, Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois], at least in those days, was perceived as a not-for-profit.  People had not yet begun to realize that Blue Cross Blue Shield was probably, if not the biggest, one of the largest businesses in this area and perhaps in the country.  So, because we weren't listed on the stock exchange, and we were not a, you know, we were not a for-profit company.  Many times when organizations where they, they, they were publishers or magazines or newspapers, when they were listing things about companies, Blue Cross Blue Shield would be left out.  And so I was essentially off the radar for twenty years while I was with Blue Cross Blue Shield because I was probably one of the first black officers of a major corporation in the City of Chicago [Illinois] as well and became treasurer of Blue Cross Blue Shield in 1969.  And because of some things that happened there, very clearly I was the only black treasurer of a major corporation in the City of Chicago.  And then there was significant reaction to that on the part of the financial community, and so I actually changed positions two years later, simply because of the reaction of the financial community to, to that position.
Speaker 1: Tell me what, tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, banks, for whatever reasons, were, were--Blue Cross Blue Shield had cash flows of approximately $2 billion a year.  It's a lot of money.  And being treasurer, it was my responsibility to see to it that those funds were, were located properly and, and managed properly and things of that nature.  And without getting into a lot of detail, there were some institutions in the City of Chicago that were not all that pleased and, and happy with that situation and consequently, found it difficult to cooperate and be supportive.
Speaker 1: You, are you saying that you as a black person being in charge of that amount of money, that they had some issue with it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is that what you're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --you're talk--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you feel not at liberty to disclose some of the people--
Speaker 2: I'd, I'd rather not--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because those--
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: --institutions are still there and thriving.
Speaker 1: I understand. How were people like Jim Compton [HistoryMaker James W. Compton] at the Urban League [Chicago Urban League, Chicago, Illinois] and you know, others looking at this, or was this totally under the radar screen?  I'm just trying to understand.
Speaker 2: Well, there were certain people that were very aware of it.  Jim Compton happened to be one, because he's a Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] guy.  And as a matter of fact, the, the other person that was quite aware of it was Milt Davis [HistoryMaker Milton Davis]; of course, he was a Morehouse guy as well.  And so there were some that were quite aware of it, Warren Bacon and, and, and people like that.  But to others, to the larger community, it, it was, it was a bit off, off the radar.
Speaker 1: So Daryl Grisham, was he also aware at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he was sort of in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --the mix too.  This was the--
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --this was the cabal really, right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, absolutely.  Daryl Grisham was very aware and very supportive.
Story_ID: 572181
Speaker 1: So tell me, in the time period of you being treasurer and, and you know, then people sort of getting a little, like, well, maybe that's not such a good idea, what was that time period that you had that position?  Or we were talking about--
Speaker 2: That was, that was--
Speaker 1: --nineteen sixty--
Speaker 2: That was about '69 [1969] to '71 [1971]--
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so two years.
Speaker 2: --in that general timeframe.
Speaker 1: So you had the position two years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, for about two years.
Speaker 1: Were there decisions that you made that sort of ruffled feathers, I mean, or was it like someone having their picture on the, you know, on the cover of a magazine and then they're gone out of the position?  What, what--
Speaker 2: No, I think it was more an issue of potential power rather than any power exercised.  It was the power that could have been exercised.
Speaker 1: So this is both--is this inside the company, or is it out, or is it--you know, 'cause Blue Cross Blue Shield is a network, really.  I, you know, I recently had the general counsel here, so he explained to me the whole, like it's this umbrella, and he explained--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the growth of it.  So what--you were with Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross Blue Shield Association], the umbrella group?
Speaker 2: No, I was with Illinois [Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: With Illinois, okay.
Speaker 2: Illinois, Blue Cross Blue Shield--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --one of the operating companies.
Speaker 1: Okay, and who was president at the time?
Speaker 2: At the time it was Marty Hickman [Simeon Martin Hickman] was president of--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And prior to him, I actually joined Blue Cross in 1966, when Bob Redinger [Robert M. Redinger] was CEO of the company.
Speaker 1: So who was your mentor there?
Speaker 2: My mentor was both Bob Redinger and Marty Hickman, the CEOs.  Marty Hickman was an actuary, and I was brought in as an actuary of the company.  As a matter of fact, he was assistant vice president actuary when I came in and took over the actuarial function.  And Marty was a very capable, very capable guy.  And as he moved up the ladder, we worked closely together, and I moved with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you didn't answer my question though about was it inside or outside the resistance, you know, to you.  I don't think I heard that answer.
Speaker 2: Well, the most visible to me was outside; could have been inside, but I don't know, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the most visible was outside.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were these customers of Blue Cross Blue Shield, sort of?  No, yes?
Speaker 2: Not necessarily, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So what happens then?  How are you told about this?  You know, does Marty--
Speaker 2: Well, it's--
Speaker 1: --is Marty at the time--
Speaker 2: --no, slights became quite--I was aware of slights that things that were normally done, events that CFOs would normally be invited to, I was not invited.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what are you then thinking about?  So, but you still stay there though, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: You stay, you stay there for another, is it seven years?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I left there in 1984, but I actually didn't leave Blue Cross Blue Shield, as such.  I, I became CEO of Dental Network of America [Dental Network of America, LLC], which was owned by ten different Blue Cross Blue Shield plans.  It was a for-profit organization, and its stock was owned by ten different Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, including Illinois Blue Cross Blue Shield.
Story_ID: 572182
Speaker 1: Is Dental, Dental--
Speaker 2: Network of America [Dental Network of America, LLC] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) Network of America, is that, was this an HMO [health maintenance organization] or product part, or is it--I'm, I'm just trying to figure out where it sort of fit.  Was it a new product line with that?
Speaker 2: It was a new product line, and Dental Network of America was responsible for administering the product line, not marketing it, but administering it.  The various Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross Blue Shield Association] plans would market the product, and then we would put it in place with the account and then administer and provide the services to the account.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  Now, how is this, how were you told about this decision, or was this presented as an opportunity?
Speaker 2: Oh, you mean Dental Network of America?
Speaker 1: Yes, was it presented as an opportunity?  Was it that you are going to Marty [Simeon Martin Hickman] and saying, you know, "I am concerned; you know, obviously something is going on?"
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, it, this was something that actually I sort of backed into and turned down at, at, at one point.  I, at that time, I was senior vice president in charge of business development and strategic planning and was put in charge of--well, there was a company, managed dental care company, that provided--
Speaker 1: Well, you--wait, let me understand.  You were treasurer, and then you became senior--I just want to follow the chronology.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was vice presi- I was vice president of finance and treasurer--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in '69 [1969] and '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: And then you--and then '71 [1971] you became senior vice president.
Speaker 2: Ehh, that was more like a lot of time elapsed because I was, I held a number of different positions as vice president of planning and so forth.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And then I took over planning and business development probably, oh, probably around 1978 maybe or so, maybe '79 [1979], '78 [1978], '79 [1979].  And, but then at, at one point, and it must have been about 1983 or so, it was brought to our attention that there was a managed dental care company that had entered into contracts with several of the large Blue Cross Blue Shield plans to provide these administrative services for the mina- managed dental care business.  They were in financial difficulty, and the company was on the verge of going under.  The Blue Cross Blue Shield plans that they serviced could not allow this company to go under.  And so the decision was made, if possible, we need to acquire this company in some way or another in order to keep that business supported, that segment of our business supported.  And so, because of my position at Illinois Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois], I was asked to chair an interplan group that would negotiate an acquisition, that would study it, negotiate it, and acquisition it.  It took about a year to actually determine what it was that we wanted to do, and then we implemented the, the, the effort.  Of course, then we closed the books on a Thursday or Friday, and someone said, "Well, who's gonna unlock the doors Monday morning and run the company?"  And so they looked at me, and I said, "No way," (laughter), "not me.  I'm pretty, pretty happy and pretty well settled where I am."  And, and so I said, "Let's, let's form a search committee."  And, and I had been in charge of the, of the, of, of the study anyway, and so obviously I was the most knowledgeable person on how the company operated and so forth.  So finally I said, "I will go out there Monday morning, and, and I'll run it until we find somebody who can, who we can hire as CEO," and so I did that.  And--
Speaker 1: Ten years later.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I liked it and decided that--I went to Marty Hickman one day and say Marty, "You know, I think I just might throw my hat in the ring.  I'm having a lot of fun."  The company was based in Oak Brook--Oakbrook Terrace [Illinois].  So I'm having a lot of fun out there, doing some things that I otherwise wouldn't do.  And my chances of becoming president of Illinois Blue Cross Blue Shield were fairly slim because Marty was only about two years older than I was.  And, and so I said this might be a, a real opportunity to run my own show, and he tried to discourage me from, from doing that.  And he wanted me to stay at Blue Cross Blue Shield, so we sort of--he made a little deal with me that, "Okay, fine, go out there and try it for a while."  He kept me on the Illinois Blue Cross Blue Shield payroll for, actually for a year.  And he said, "Just leave your office and lock the door, and you can come back any time that you want to come back and sit behind your desk, no questions asked" (laughter). And, and, but I liked it, I liked it a lot.
Story_ID: 572183
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me ask a few questions.  One, your relationship seemed to stay intact after this whole debacle with the tre- and I call it the debacle, but you may not; maybe that's too harsh a term--but the, but whatever happened with the treasurer's, you know, position.  And there, there are several questions that come to mind.  One is, you have this team.  There's this sort of black business cabal I would call it, you know, in Chicago [Illinois] at this point in time.  I think probably Walter Clark [HistoryMaker Walter Clark] might may be a--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I did not know Walter--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that well, but--
Speaker 1: But, the--you--this is, this is sort of happening, these, you know, the, this is at the time, you know, at, in, in terms of historical business significance, is the first time that people are even able to come up to the plate that their at these positions of white Corporate America.  It's also the time, time that you're coming along.  It's a time that the Urban League [Chicago Urban League, Chicago, Illinois] is very active in getting people in, you know, blacks in position, you know, period, you know.  So, but at, and I, and so I'm wondering what hap--what was the discussion going on, you know, with the, Jim Compton [HistoryMaker James W. Compton] or you know, I mean who--what--or a Daryl Grisham about what happened?  Also, what is curious to me is your relationship with Marty [Simeon Martin Hickman] seems to stay intact, you know.  And, and, and I also say there's a quantum leap between 1967, sixty--whatever, '71 [1971] and 1980.  There's a lot happens in that time period.  So, you know, so, I'm just wondering what was going on, one, in your head?  Let's, let's answering that.  You know, what was going on in your head?  Why did you stay?  And how did your relationship with Marty stay intact?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I stayed because I was, I was having fun, and I made a, a, a significant contribution.  I was very key in the organization.  Marty essentially used me as a, a, a very strong leader in the organization, and I assigned him a great deal.  I represented him in a number of speaking engagements.  I testified before [U.S.] Congress on, on, on matters such as national health insurance and things like that on his behalf on behalf of Illinois Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois].  And so, life was good in, in, in that respect, in, in terms of my getting a great deal of satisfaction from the contribution that I was making.  I participated in the development of the first prepaid dental program in the nation and, and the same thing for the first prepaid prescription drug program in the nation.  So those are very self-rewarding, gratifying kinds of experiences that I might not have had an opportunity to, anywhere else to, to realize.  But I was known throughout the Blue Cross Blue Shield system [Blue Cross Blue Shield Association] because of the fact that I moved quite freely throughout the system, frequently representing him.  But then there were other things that, that I started on my own as well.  I stated something called the business development institute, called the BDI, in which I pulled together some of the brightest minds in the Blue Cross Blue Shield system and formed a think tank, an informal think tank.  And we would go away at least once a year for maybe a week and, and discuss focus subjects and then print manuscripts, recommending to the entire Blue Cross Blue Shield system changes that ought to take place, whether it had to do with product or, or management styles or whatever it was.  And we had a lot of support throughout the system to do that.
Story_ID: 572184
Speaker 1: I want to go back because you said you were testifying and doing things like that.  Can you tell me, in this period from 1967 to like 1984, when you took over, you know, as president and chief operate--chief CEO of Dental Network of America [Dental Network of America, LLC], what were, what were the issues that were facing the, the health and insurance, you know, health industry, insure--health and insurance?
Speaker 2: Oh, to a great extent, the, the same issues that they're facing today, you know, the--(unclear)--percentage of GNP [gross national product], you know, healthcare is percentage of G- it was creeping up just like it is now.  And people were saying that it couldn't go much further, and things had to be turned around.  But it's, it's the, the same, really the same issues, the cost of healthcare, the effective delivery of healthcare, how do you absorb the cost of new technology, things of that nature.  But it was, it was, it was quite different.  Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross Blue Shield Association] was a quite different institution then--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --than it is now.  As a matter of fact, I was just reading something that was a headline story and about North Carolina Blue Cross and Blue Shield [Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, Durham, North Carolina].  And you know, they were, they were proud of the fact that their expense ratio was 18 percent, that they were only spending 18 percent of the, of the premium dollar on operating expenses.  In my day, if we went over 5 percent, we felt that we were, we just weren't serving the people.  And so our expense ratios ranged between 3 and 5 percent, and that's what we worked toward.  So, it was a, it was a different time.  You know, this was, this was just the front page story in North Carolina, but I can remember one of the Chicago [Illinois] newspapers doing a seven day investigative report on Illinois Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois] coming in looking at every aspect of our operation and writing about us front page every day for a week.  But that's because people were, were looking over the shoulders of businesses in those days, and they were asking the tough questions.  And the department of insurance was saying that, we're not going to approve that rate increase because of this, that and the other.  You don't hear that too much anymore.  At least I don't hear it in North Carolina.  I'm not a part of the system, so maybe they're still hearing it within the system, but I, I don't see it written about.  So it's, it's a different day, a different time, and I'm not being pejorative of either one.  It's just a, it's a reality that things are just very, very different in the healthcare industry.
Story_ID: 572185
Speaker 1: But also the other reality is that Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross Blue Shield Association] during that time period experienced tremendous growth.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, your--I mean we--you--I would like you to address that.  I mean there, there was big, a big difference in that period.  Can you just sort of address that a little bit?
Speaker 2: Well, when I joined Blue Cross Blue Shield there were four hundred employees, believe it or not, and that was in 1966.  When I moved over to Dental Network of America [Dental Network of America, LLC] in 1984, '85 [1985], there were close to six thousand employees.  So there was tremendous growth during the period that I was, that I was in the organization.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what you think were some of the single most important reasons, you know, that, that created that growth?  I mean that's tremendous, tremendous growth when you think about it.
Speaker 2: Well, I think Medicare really launched it, in 1966.  Blue Cross Blue Shield plans were the dominant intermediary in their respective areas for, for Medicare, and in most instances staffs at least doubled.  And most Blue Cross Blue Shield plans even just, they put their Medicare operations even in a, in a separate building just to house, you know, so that they could house--have space to house their people and to keep it away from their basic business.  So that was, that really was the beginning of it.  But then, I think that it's just simply the onslaught of health insurance and the importance of health insurance as, as prices increased, as health--cost of healthcare increased, it became essential that, you know, that people had some way to, to pay those bills, and the best bet was health insurance.  And of course, groups got involved in purchasing health insurance for their employees.  It became a, a very important employee benefit.  I think the other factor too is that a lot of your commercial carriers that had left the health insurance market to Blue Cross Blue Shield for so many years decided that they wanted a piece of that action.  And so you got the Prudentials [Prudential Insurance Company of America; Prudential Financial, Inc.] and the Cignas, and the Aetnas [Aetna, Inc.], and the others coming in.  And they were much better at marketing and selling than, than the Blue Cross Blue Shields plans were because Blue Cross Blue Shield plans didn't have to sell.  Someone wanted health insurance, the phone would ring, and you would, you would, you would, you know, take the application and, and deliver them health insurance.  But once Prudential and some of the other high marketing companies got into the picture, then it, it sort of raised all boats.  And everybody had to start selling more, and I think that had to do with the boom as well.
Story_ID: 572186
Speaker 1: How long does the history go back though on health insurance?  Can you address that, because we all, we live now in a day we assume that it was always the way it was.  I mean, and, and then you mentioned the whole thing of Prudential [Prudential Insurance Company of America; Prudential Financial, Inc.] and them doing a better job of marketing, but I keep thinking that Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross Blue Shield Association] was viewed as, you know, the golden, you know, the, the, the stamp of approval as the--
Speaker 2: Well, there, there's no question about it.  Blue Cross Blue Shield was the first.  And even through that very competitive period, in my judgment they remained the best.  And--
Speaker 1: And what com- what is the competitive period you refer to?  What, what years are those?
Speaker 2: I would say that that was probably the late '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 1: Okay, o--
Speaker 2: --beginning in the late '60s [1960s] and then throughout the '70s [1970s], the '80s [1980s] to some extent and, and then it became apparent to some of those competitors that we just can't do it as well as Blue Cross Blue Shield, and there are other things that we can do better.  And they started falling by the wayside.
Speaker 1: So this is interesting then.  You were having these newspaper articles, you know, that were talking about, you know, 3 to 5, what, 5 percent at the time when there was extreme competition.  Is, is that, are you saying those are occurring around the same time?
Speaker 2: About that; I'd, I'd say at the beginning of the competition.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course, there's, there's no way that a for-profit company could, could operate at 3 to 5 percent.  So that's why I say we continued to be the best during that period, that competitive period.  And consequently, Blue Cross Blue Shield was a survivor, and today I think controls that market, and I think deservedly so, because they, Blue Cross Blue Shield knows what they're doing in the health, health insurance field.
Speaker 1: But health insurance went back how far in this country?  Can you tell me that?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Well, Blue Cross, the first Blue Cross plans started down in Baylor [Dallas, Texas]--
Speaker 1: Texas.
Speaker 2: --Texas, yeah.  It was around 1930.  And then Blue Shield came on the stream sometime in the late '30s [1930s] I think.
Speaker 1: Because they weren't one in the same, right?
Speaker 2: No, no, Blue Cross dealt with the hospital, the institutional care; Blue Shield dealt with the professional care.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And how did they, they ended up merging because they didn't want to compete, was that it?  I can't remem--
Speaker 2: No, it was just logical that they, that they do so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in some states they stayed separate for quite some time, up until a few years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then they started merging for, obviously for economic reasons and for business reasons.  It just made sense--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause people saw Blue Cross Blue Shield as one, one entity rather than two separate ones--
Story_ID: 572187
Speaker 1: So let's talk about Dental Network of America [Dental Network of America, LLC], because this is, now this is a sort of big deal, but it's, it--you said that--first of all, it's a new business line.  We have the on en- entry of--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --HMOs [health maintenance organization], which were a different sort of product line.  Can you talk about--'cause you're basically starting--wait, it was a company you bought, you bought.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So that is merging, you're merging--were you merging though?  It was--
Speaker 2: No, we [Blue Cross Blue Shield Association] actually acquired it.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: We actually decided to acquire the company.  As a matter of fact, because of some things that we couldn't get our hands around when we were negotiating the acquisition, we decided that we wouldn't even buy the company as a whole, and so we ended up actually buying its assets.  And so that protected us from any unknown liabilities that might pop up later on.  But that's how the acquisition went.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me, this company that you bought, what, what did you find when you sort of opened up the door?  Remember that you're, that was the, you know, the reference, you know, that someone had to open up the door, turn on the lights.  So what was the company that you came into?  How many employees?  You know, what were your challenges, you know?  I think dental, this is dental insurance.  Was it's, was it new, or had it already been in the horizon?
Speaker 2: I know dental, dental fee for service dental insurance had been around for quite some time, you know, maybe ten, fifteen years.  But the dental HMO concept was a new concept.  And these fellows that started that company, it, it was an entrepreneurial effort on their part, and they did a good job of, of establishing the company and getting it going.  But, but then when you reach a certain point, you, you, you have to shift gears.  And as in the case of a number of entrepreneurs, they have difficulty shifting gears to an operating organization as opposed to an entrepreneurial organization.  And so that's why they ran into some, some difficulty.  But when I, when I walked in, in the door (laughter) that Monday morning after I took over, it was, it was very interesting.  I--there were about, there were only about eighteen employees left.  It was not a big company to begin with.  A--trying to recall exactly what their--I think their revenues were maybe, their total revenues might have been maybe around 12, 13 million [dollars] or something like that, which wasn't bad, you know.  But, but they had had to let employees go, you know, as, as they were negotiating with us.  As I said, the negotiations took a year, and they were just hanging on and hanging on and hanging on, and so they had, had to let a number of employees go.  But anyway, the company was in bad shape.  It, it was a big turnaround job.  And the people that were there were unhappy because even though they stayed, their salaries had been cut and, and things of that nature.  And systems weren't operating properly and--
Speaker 1: So what, what did you do to turn things around?
Speaker 2: Well, you, you know, I (unclear) to quite a bit of detail, but my, my, my style relies on people.  Any institution in my judgment, it's, it's a composition of its people.  And so the first thing I did was to meet with each individual, and I took copious notes as I just chatted with them and talked to them, what went wrong, what's, what's needed, what would you do, those kinds of things.  And, and it also allowed me an opportunity to get to know them.  It was actually an assessment interview on my part as well as to the talents of, of, of the various people, to see exactly what I had.  And once I did that, then I was in a position to decided my strategy as to where do I go from here; how do I--who do I keep; where will I put them; and what responsibilities do I give them; and then how do I expand out from there to rebuild the company and to grow it.
Speaker 1: So what were your strategies that you employed?
Speaker 2: Well, first was to, to clean up things, as it were, and to rebuild a solid, solid team, a management team as well as a, a, a good solid production team and service team, and then to make sure that we solidified our customer base, that we wouldn't have people walking away from us before we could actually turn things around, and then thirdly, to grow the company.
Story_ID: 572188
Speaker 1: What were the key thing--el- elements to growing the company [Dental Network of America, LLC]?  A salesforce was important, right, no?
Speaker 2: A sales, a sales force was important, but our market--this is very interesting because our market was Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross Blue Shield Association] plans.  Now, we, we could have sold to anybody, okay.  But it was my feeling that if we want to capture the Blue Cross Blue Shield business that we need to send the message loud and clear that we exist for the benefit of Blue Cross Blue Shield plans.  And so that's where we, we focused.  So our market was--I think we had maybe--oh, I don't recall--I think about six plans under contract to administer their, their managed dental care programs.  And, and you know, at that time there were 110, 115 plans out there, and so that was our market.  But there were two things that had to be sold.  Most of the plans did not have, they did not have a dental, managed dental care product.  And so the first thing we had to do was to convince them of the value of the product, putting the product in their portfolio.  And then of course if we did that, then we would assure them that we were the best people to administer it for them.  That way, they wouldn't have to worry about setting up an administrative staff or anything like that.  All you had to--we'll even identify the product for you; we will build the product for you; and we'll train the marketing staff and those kinds of things.  You go out and market it; we'll service it.
Speaker 1: So they were the marketing arm, and you were almost a turnkey system, really--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for them.  I see.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what we were selling.
Speaker 1: I see.
Story_ID: 572189
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what was the growth you experienced?  I mean, you were there ten years as, you know, as CEO [of Dental Network of America, LLC], so what, what did you grow it to from those eighteen employees?
Speaker 2: Well, the thing that I like to remember most is that we became the most dominant managed dental care company in the country.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: And at one time, through, through the statistical games that people can play, I think that we boasted to the fact that we covered one and, said one in twenty Americans, something like that.  It was, it was, it was significant, because we--well, let's, let's figure that out.  We, we covered something like, oh, about a hundred and, a hundred and thirty thousand people.  I don't know.  I'm, I'm probably way off base there, but you can do the arithmetic on it.  But, in any event, I think when I left there we covered about a hundred and thirty thousand people.  We, we had revenues of about $70 million a year.  And so it was a nice growth.  I, I was not happy with it, quite honestly.
Speaker 1: You weren't happy with the growth?
Speaker 2: No, absolutely not.
Speaker 1: What were you, what, what, what were your projections (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think we should have been twice that size.  We should have grown much, much faster.
Speaker 1: Now what, what--why, why do you think--well, what didn't happen that you wanted to have happen?
Speaker 2: It--
Speaker 1: Did, did the--
Speaker 2: I just don't think that we were as, as effective in selling the plans on the concept of--
Speaker 1: That was on--
Speaker 2: --managed dental care.
Speaker 1: So that was on the Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross Blue Shield Association]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --side.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you--they were controlling your growth.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, they were--
Speaker 1: All right (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --there was absolutely no question.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If they agreed to, to have minis- to, market managed dental care, then without question they would have used us, most would have used us.  But, but you know, there, there were a lot of problems with medical HMOs [health maintenance organization], and some of that I think might have been rubbing off, a little bit of the luster off of HMOs in general.  Also, if you think physicians were resistant to managed care, you've seen nothing until you've seen the resistance that dentists can put up.  I was actually invited to leave the State of Minnesota by--I, I think that--I forget the guy's title, but he was a secretary of something for the State of Minnesota.  And it just so happened that the governor of Minnesota at the time was a dentist.  And, and we were in Minnesota talking to the Blue Cross Blue Shield plan there about starting a managed dental care program, and it was heard about.  And we were invited to come to the capital, and we were told in no uncertain terms that you're not welcome here.
Speaker 1: Well, there was a lot of belief on the part of the medical community that HMOs, you know, were the death nail to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --profitability as a--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, a profession, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: So, let me--I mean that's really sort of fascinating.  I actually think I was--I actually had your, your dental plan.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?  Is that right?
Speaker 1: I think I do.
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: But there were things also it wouldn't cover too, I think, I think.  Those are--that's--well, I mean, that's general--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --perception of HMOs, too (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's right.
Speaker 1: See, it's the same thing.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) that's probably--
Speaker 1: That's a perception of that's--
Speaker 2: --true for some things, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.  But let me, let me ask--but it was affordable, as I remember too (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes.
Speaker 1: And I did have--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was able--actually I got, I had a major operation when I was part of the plan.
Story_ID: 572190
Speaker 1: Let me ask about things like the Chicago Caucus.  When did that occur, and the forum [Chicago Forum], and the home [Home Investments Fund, Chicago, Illinois]--when did--are these around, or are these earlier?
Speaker 2: That was while I was at Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Good, okay.  Oh, so they were earlier.  They were--
Speaker 2: They were earlier than Dental Network of America [Dental Network of America, LLC], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's go back and cover those before I go to--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --mayor (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, this was just, these--
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the caucus first.
Speaker 2: Okay.  These were activities that were taking place in Chicago [Illinois] when Chicago was trying to deal with its racial issues at, at, at a fairly high level and, and a very professional level.  The Chicago Caucus was organized--this was during the time that the black community was trying to get more African Americans to serve on corporate boards and civic boards.  And--
Speaker 1: What year are we?
Speaker 2: Oh, geez.
Speaker 1: Has to be in the mid--
Speaker 2: It had to be--
Speaker 1: --sixties [1960s] and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I say that it is early '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 1: Okay, early--okay.
Speaker 2: --maybe early '70s [1970s].  And so some of us, [HistoryMaker] Josie Childs, and myself, and Warren Bacon, and Lenora Cartwright, and, and, and, and Tim Black [HistoryMaker Timuel Black], and some others, Bren--
Speaker 1: Tim Black was in there?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and Bren- Bren- Brenetta Barrett, Brenetta Howell Barrett.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and it was a small group of us.  It was about eight of us.  And, but we decided that we would start the caucus for the purpose of identifying African Americans because, you know, many boards were saying, well, we can't find them.  And so our position was, okay, fine, we will find them for them.  And we will make sure that they understand that we are a resource for African Americans, for, for boards.  In addition to that, we felt it very important that, since not many African Americans had served on boards before, that there should be some education involved and some preparation so that, so that they were prepared to, to do, perform the services that you're expected to perform at a board meeting and as a board member.  And so we established some seminars and held seminars on Saturdays and, and things of this nature and just invited people to come, even people--
Speaker 1: Where were these seminars and things being held?
Speaker 2: You know, I think, I think they were being held out at Malcolm X College [Chicago, Illinois], I believe, and, and Tim Black taught some, and others taught some.  But, but, and then we, we came up with an award called the Golden Gavel Award, which was an annual award to be given to an African American who had performed outstanding service as a director of either a, a corporate or a, or a civic board.  And the first person to receive that was Warren Bacon, who received it because of his service on the, on the school board, Chicago school board [Chicago Board of Education].  And so we did that for a while, until it was, really, it was no longer necessary.
Story_ID: 572191
Speaker 1: One of the things that we did that we were most proud of I think was when Chicago [Illinois], when in the State of Illinois ended up with three African Americans in [U.S.] Congress.  And we decided this was the first time in history that the State of Illinois sent three African Americans to Congress.  And so we commissioned a bas-relief that was done by Ramon Price [Ramon B. Price] at the DuSable Museum [DuSable Museum of African American History, Chicago, Illinois], beautiful, beautiful piece, but it, it was depicting three African heads in a very beautiful way.  The last time I saw Ramon shortly before he passed away, and it, it was not on display, and he said that it was in their--but he was thinking about bringing it up from, from the, from their archives or wherever it was.  And, but anyway, we had a reception in the Red Lacquer Room at the Drake Hotel [sic. Palmer House Hotel; Palmer House Hilton, Chicago, Illinois], and it was well attended.  And as a matter of fact, that's when Harold [Harold Washington] first indicated that he was interested in running for mayor.  Harold came representing the three congressman and, two congressman, one congresswoman.  And, and we had a little bit of an interview session after he had made his address, and, and we asked the question.  And I forget exactly what he said, but he announced and people were thrilled.  I'm sure that [HistoryMaker] Josie Childs and others remember that, but that was very significant for us.
Speaker 2: Now, now, what--who were the three congressmen at the time?  You had Cart, Cart--
Speaker 1: I knew you were gonna ask me that (laughter)--
Speaker 2: --[HistoryMaker] Cardiss Collins.
Speaker 1: Cardiss Collins, [HistoryMaker] Gus Savage, and, and, and Harold Washington--
Speaker 2: And (unclear) and Harold Washington.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You think of--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: This is even--you know, you think of Harold Washington more the mayor than you think--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --of Harold Washington, congressman and the state senator, right.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So, this was what year though?  You--
Speaker 1: Well, when did he announce that he was--
Speaker 2: You know, 19--
Speaker 1: --he was.
Speaker 2: --well, 1979 he--no, no, no, no--
Speaker 1: It was before that.
Speaker 2: --nineteen eighty-one [1981].
Speaker 1: Was it that late?
Speaker 2: Eighty-one [1981].
Speaker 1: (SASHA DALTONN):  (Unclear) '81 [1981], '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: Eighty-one [1981].
Speaker 1: Was it really?  Was it that late?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he ran in eighty--he, he, he--because I was at the city--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in '82 [1982].  No, I was at the city in '82 [1982], when he--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he ran, right.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he came in, so it must have been '80 [1980], '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, let me ask, let me--the Chicago Caucus, was it the precursor to Chicago United or was it--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --along the same concept?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: Was Chicago United around at that time?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I'm not so sure that it was a publicly known organization at that time or not.
Speaker 2: But Chicago Caucus was?
Speaker 1: Chicago Caucus was.
Speaker 2: I see, okay.
Speaker 1: Chicago Caucus was.
Speaker 2: So who were--so you say you, Tim Black [HistoryMaker Timuel Black], Josie Childs, Warren Bacon.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lenora Cartwright--
Speaker 2: Lenora Cart- okay.
Speaker 1: And Brenetta Howell Barrett.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I'm sure I'm leaving some--well, yes, Arthur Macklin [ph.]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --was on there as well.
Speaker 2: Now, you're saying when it became no longer necessary, you're saying that--when did it no longer be- who were, who was in place at different places?
Speaker 1: Well, that probably wasn't the only reason.  You know how some organizations--a lot of organizations begin to lose some steam, and, and, and people became busy doing other things.  You know, Lenora joined Harold as his head of human resources I guess.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And I think Brenetta might have been involved too, and, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But Lenora was actually part of Byrne [Jane Byrne] too.
Speaker 1: That's right; yes, she was.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's--
Speaker 1: That's right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause that's right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But anyway, she became busy--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and our people just became busy--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --doing things, and, and the urgency just didn't seem to be there anymore, you know.  African Americans were finding their way onto especially civic boards and some onto corporate boards.  And, and so it, I think the general feeling was we kept it alive, but we stopped having our annual meetings and things of that nature.
Story_ID: 572192
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what about the Chicago Forum?
Speaker 2: The Chicago Forum was a very interesting group that was actually started I believe by a woman by the name of Eleanor Petersen.  And it was Eleanor's idea that if we could get young black and white executives working together and socializing together in an early stage in their career, and if we can identify those who are apt to become leaders of the future and in key positions, leadership positions, in the City of Chicago [Illinois] in the future, that we would have made a significant contribution, because as these people became leaders, they would be in a position to communicate with each other because they were friends socially as well as in business and, and, and otherwise, politically, whatever.  And so she handpicked people, large group of people, maybe about fifty altogether, and included some very significant people.  Jim Thompson [James R. Thompson] was a member of the group and, and Jim Hoge [James F. Hoge, Jr.], who later became--I guess he was editor of the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times], that what he was, and, and others.  And it worked.  We met on a regular basis.  We, we had different, heart discussions, you know, no holds barred kinds of discussions on racial matters and, and issues in the city.  All of our, all of our meetings were--they weren't held in secret, but there was a commitment on everybody's part that you do not talk about what goes on in these meetings.  And that was, of course, to, to encourage people to be open and to, and to challenge each other and each other's feelings and, and ideas.
Story_ID: 572193
Speaker 1: --With the Chicago Forum, that you would have frank, honest, open discussions, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what were those discussions about?  Eleanor Petersen, I haven't heard that name in a long time, but she was very significant.  She's--
Speaker 2: She's extremely significant in the City of Chicago [Illinois] in improving race relations--
Speaker 1: Can you talk--
Speaker 2: --at, at--
Speaker 1: --about her?
Speaker 2: --that level.  Well, she was just very effective.  I, I, I don't know exactly where Eleanor came from, but, but she appeared, and she was very effective in the way she went about establishing things.  She was very creative, and she had very few failures, which was a surprise, you know. She, she had ideas for starting organizations, and then she would handpick the leadership.  And it was hard to say no to Eleanor.  And you did it, and it worked.
Speaker 1: So what were those discussions that were behind closed doors?  What were the issues that had to sort of--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I really don't recall them all, but they were all related to race relations and, and, and, and current--just race relations in general as well as current issues that might have been facing the city.  You know, during that time there were issues with the board of education [Chicago Board of Education] and, and, and, and those kinds of things.
Story_ID: 572194
Speaker 1: Now the Black United Fund [Chicago Black United Fund, Chicago, Illinois] it says--were you involved with the start of that?
Speaker 2: Well, I understand that there is a Black United Fund [Black United Fund of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois] now, and I'm--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --I'd, I'd, I'd want to--wouldn't want to confuse that with what--
Speaker 1: Oh, the--
Speaker 2: --we, we--I don't know if it's a continuation of what we started--
Speaker 1: Well, you know--
Speaker 2: --but it was--
Speaker 1: --I can tell you what, you know it, it does, right?  It funds--
Speaker 2: You, you tell me.
Speaker 1: --it funds black charities.
Speaker 2: Well, that's--
Speaker 1: Was that what you were?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what we started off doing (laughter)--
Speaker 1: So, so--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --it may be a continuation.
Speaker 2: It could be, but it was [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett, and myself, [HistoryMaker] Joan Small, and about, there are about four or five other people.  I know there were a couple of lawyers and so forth.  And the idea was--we had a very focused mission in that we, we were not thinking just simply of raising funds from the black community for the black community.  And Lerone was president, and it was through Lerone's leadership; you know, he doesn't think small.  And Lerone's position was that look, we need to become one of those boxes on the card that goes out from United--not United Charities [United Charities of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] but the--
Speaker 1: United Way [United Way Worldwide] campaign.
Speaker 2: --United Way, to give employees an opportunity to check off the Black United Fund.  And so that became our mission, more so than raising funds and things of that nature.  As a matter of fact, we never did really raise funds.  But that was our idea, to be a conduit to, to establish a basis by which an organization, a Black United Fund, could be sustained.  And so we had numerous meetings with United Way, with various board members, and with staff.  And, and at that time they just weren't willing to, to see it our way.  But we felt that that was quite important.  They did offer a compromise, and that was that they would, you know, they would allow if we got employees to write in Black United Fund or something like that, that, that they would accept that, and any, any write-ins would come to the Black United Fund.  But it was our position; that, that was not our goal.  Our goal was to get a box preprinted on the form.
Speaker 1: So what was the resistance?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't recall exactly other than the fact that I think it was as much political as it was anything else that--I'm sure that, I'm sure that there were other agencies, because as you recall--I don't know what it is now--but at that time, the only other two agencies listed were I believe the Salvation Army and the Red Cross, American Red Cross.  And so this would have been a major, major step on their behalf.  And I just don't think that they were prepared to take that step.
Speaker 1: Now were you going to be a funding umbrella for other black organizations, the Black United Fund?  Was that the concept?  Were you--
Speaker 2: Yes, that was the concept.
Speaker 1: --gonna disburse, you were going to disburse the funds?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and then we would--
Speaker 1: You know, now--
Speaker 2: --disburse the funds.
Speaker 1: --there's something in New York [New York].  I think it came along after you would have been doing this called Associated Black Charities that is a similar, you know, but I don't think they're--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --checked off in any box either.
Speaker 2: It might have been around the same time because someone had written a book, because I remember reading a book on Black United Funds.  And so someone I think had done a study, and I think it was done out of New York.  So it could have been around that same time, or maybe we might have been a little after.
Story_ID: 572195
Speaker 1: But this was a move.  What is significant about this, is looking because, you know, with the caucus [Chicago Caucus] you were looking at, you know, corp- corporate--I mean board, board positions--civic, and.  And in the forum [Chicago Forum], it was sort of a, let's have a discussion about a variety of issues, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: But let's have open, honest discussion.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But.
Speaker 2: But let me, let me close a loop on the forum--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because it's very important that exactly what Eleanor [Eleanor Petersen] said could happen, did happen, that these young people, twenty years later, twenty-five years later, were the leaders in these corporations, and, and the, the relationship held.  And consequently, I can personally vouch for the fact that it was possible for members to pick up the phone and call another member when there was an issue that had to be dealt with, significant issue that had to be dealt with.  And you could get right through, and the issue was dealt with.
Story_ID: 572196
Speaker 1: Do you think the black community, you know, as a member of the black community, especially in the case of let's say the Chicago [Illinois]--well, in all these cases (unclear)--so, what did the black community, in hindsight, you know, really have to learn about dealing with Corporate America?  Do you think that they, or you think the learning curve was more on the other side?  But if you would sort of--you know, you're talking about the end product.  You're saying, you know, this really did, it did happen twenty years.  You know, this is so much different city--
Speaker 2: You know, the, the thing that pops in my mind right now is trust.  You know, there was a period that I lived through where I think that there was just a lack of trust, which probably came from a lack of understanding of the other, of the other person and their point of view.  Even within a corporation, that that was a factor as to how that black employee survived.  A lot of it had to do with trust and understanding.  And so I, I, I hadn't thought of it that way before, but I, I think that's, that's what it boiled down to.  And, and maybe Eleanor [Eleanor Petersen] was clairvoyant in her, in, in her strategy of getting these people to know and trust each other at an early stage in their life, where they have less to protect.  They don't have, you know, corporations to protect with their position.  They can really thrash it out right here in this room.  And then when they get to that level, then they can trust, because I know personally that some very difficult favors were asked, and they were granted.
Speaker 1: Now, the--let's go to the--
Speaker 2: Not personal favors.  That's very important you--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --realize that, but, but, but, but, but--
Speaker 1: I thought you--
Speaker 2: --favors on behalf of the African American community.
Speaker 1: Right, personal favors on behalf of--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--on be--
Speaker 2: --you're asking on pro- on a personal level--
Speaker 1: Level.
Speaker 2: --but not for a personal benefit.
Speaker 1: No, I understand.
Speaker 2: That's what I wanted--
Speaker 1: I got you.
Speaker 2: --clear up.
Speaker 1: No, for societal benefit.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: People were extending themselves.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with the hope that things would turn out.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 572197
Speaker 1: What about the Home Investment Fund?  What is that?  Is that right, the Home Invest (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the Home Investments Fund [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now when did that develop?  That's--
Speaker 2: That started in 1968, and that was another one from Eleanor Petersen.  If you recall, around the mid-'60s [1960s] a number of suburban communities were passing open housing ordinances.  And most of them were in the older suburban communities, like Wilmette [Illinois], Winnetka [Illinois], and Glencoe [Illinois], and Highland Park [Illinois], Deerfield [Illinois], et cetera. And Eleanor and others had noticed that there had been this clamor to open up these communities.  They had been open for a while, and African American families weren't moving in.  And so after a little bit of analysis, it was determined that the issue was that whereas African Americans were being given jobs now that paid them well enough to be able to afford a mortgage to live in Glencoe, they didn't have the down payments.  And in those older communities at that time there were no such things as FHAs [Federal Housing Administration] or, or, or VA [Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] loans.  They were all conventional loans requiring anywhere from 20, 25, 30 percent down.  Well, even though a fellow might be making fifty thousand dollars a year and, and quite able to pay for that mortgage, he did not have the six, seven, eight, ten thousand dollars in the bank to pay the down payment.  And so our ideas was then to develop a financial organization that would make second mortgages to African Americans very specifically moving into predominantly white communities, white suburban communities.  Now, we modified that to some extent as we went along because some we, we paid to move into white city communities, because our objective was to help to open up communities, the feeling being that once you had two or three, four families in a community, more African Americans would be encouraged to at least look in the community.  And so we just didn't want these communities to stay enclaves, you know, of, with no African Americans forever.  And so we thought this would be a start, and again, it worked; it worked like a charm, beautifully.
Story_ID: 572198
Speaker 1: So who were the critical entities in success?  First of all, Eleanor Petersen is there, but who else is involved with--
Speaker 2: Well, the thing about Eleanor never became in the management of any of these.
Speaker 1: No, but I'm saying--
Speaker 2: They, they were all her ideas.
Speaker 1: --she was the gathering force, okay.
Speaker 2: She was the gathering force, and she would pick who she wanted--
Speaker 1: So who did she--
Speaker 2: --to
Speaker 1: --pick?
Speaker 2: --she picked me (laughter) to, to, to lead it.  And so I became the first chairman of [the Home Investments Fund, Chicago, Illinois]--and she went to her friends at the Chicago Conference of Religion and Race [Chicago, Illinois].  They gave us space in their building.  They also went to the (unclear)--which--we, we raised our money by selling debentures in our corporation.  And those debentures would yield anywhere from 0 percent to 4 percent interest, depending upon your social commitment.  And most of, of those organizations that, that bought our debentures had 0 percent interest because that was, they were fully, you know, willing to support us.  And we had some very good--John Baird [John W. Baird], of Baird and Warner [Chicago, Illinois], bought debentures in the organization.  And so we raised something, initially something like $275,000 that we had available, which was substantial, because our average loan was anywhere from maybe three thousand to six thousand or something like that.  And some of our loans were not for down payments.  They were just simply bridge loans because the people already owned a home.  But they had to sell their home before they could get cash for the down payment, and so we would give them a bridge loan.  But anything that would help them to, to, to--now you have to understand the difficulty at that time too was First Federal Savings and Loan [First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] was the primary mortgage lender in this area.  And they did not make first loans on top of second mortgages, or first mortgages on top of second mortgages.  And so we had to sit with the leadership at First Federal and explain to them what we were doing, and asked their support, and asked them to make an exception in their policy, and they did.  And after a while, they were so committed to what we were doing that they accepted the paperwork up that we did for the second mortgage as their paperwork for the first mortgage.  And so it was almost a guarantee if we granted a second mortgage, First Federal would automatically grant a first mortgage, so it worked.
Speaker 1: So how did you--did you do anything about qualifying candidates or getting your perfect candidates lined up?  Or it was just letting the opportunity--
Speaker 2: No, we worked at identifying candidates, and we would also have training class, because for a number of people these were first-time homeowners.  And so we had classes that taught them how to, what to look for in buying a home and these kinds of things.  And so we worked with them in a great, in, in a detailed level.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you working with any other, like the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]--I know that, you know, or any other places?
Speaker 2: Well, we worked very closely with the Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, and that--was [HistoryMaker] Aurie Pennick running the org--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.  Who was running it then?
Speaker 2: Kale, Kale, Kale Smith.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Was it Smith?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was Kale.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Kale Williams, I'm sorry--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Kale Williams.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was consistent with their mission though, in many ways.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Right, so you--
Speaker 2: Well, it was started about the same time that Home Investments Fund [Chicago, Illinois] was started, but it was started for a different purpose.  They were, they were more concerned about discrimination and taking legal action to open up communications where discrimination had occurred.  And quite frankly, there were instances where we would refer cases to them because we would be working with a client from a financial point of view, and they would run into discrimination.  Now some of that we could manage ourselves because we had our own legal, legal staff and legal folks working with us.  It Marshall Holleb's law firm [Holleb and Coff, Chicago, Illinois], Stan Glass [ph.], and, and Bob [ph.]--I forget Bob's last name, but they worked with us very, very closely.  And, but in some instances where it required much more legal work, we would pass it on to the Leadership Council, and they would follow through.  We eventually, again, the organization just it outlived its usefulness at a point.  And so we converted our assets to cash and turned it over to, turned the responsibilities and the finances over to Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities.
Speaker 1: I see.  Now, so that means--well, were you still active in any of these organizations by the time you became CEO of Dental Network of [Dental Network of America, LLC]--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: You were?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that, so you would say their usefulness lasted until when?
Speaker 2: Oh, any of those organizations--
Speaker 1: Those organizations--
Speaker 2: --the ones, the ones that we've been talking about--
Speaker 1: Right, the four.
Speaker 2: No, the forum [Chicago Forum], the forum, again, it, it was just not necessary after--I think it lasted for maybe about six, seven years, but people remained friends.  And the--
Speaker 1: The forum, the caucus [Chicago Caucus]--
Speaker 2: --and the caucus.
Speaker 1: --the United Fund [Chicago Black United Fund, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I, yeah, the caucus.  Again, I, I discussed that before, and, and Home Investments Fund.  I don't recall exactly when we turned it over to the Leadership Council, but I'm pretty sure it was before 1985 when I went out to Dental Network of America.
Story_ID: 572200
Speaker 1: Now where are living at this point?
Speaker 2: I live in Durham, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: No, no, where were you living 1984 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, at that time I, I was living in Glencoe, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Now how did you get to Glencoe?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Is that, is that a question--you smile.
Speaker 2: Well, no, it's, there is a little--it's, it's, it's sort of interesting.  I, when we first moved here, we moved into Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], and that was in 1962.  And we lived in an apartment in University Apartments there in Hyde Park.  But, and we always really wanted to live in the townhouses that were growing up all around us, being built all around us in Hyde Park.  And when we felt that we could afford a townhouse, we really couldn't, which was about five years later, because they'd become so popular in Hyde Park that the prices just were out of sight.  And so I drew a circle around the City of Chicago [Illinois], on, on the North Side [sic. North Shore].  I wasn't interested in going to the south suburbs, and it ended up in Wilmette [Illinois]; the circle, the end of the circle was Wilmette.  And so I told the realtor, "Okay, we'll, we'll look anywhere in the city all the way out to Wilmette."  And we found that the better values were in the, in the northern suburbs, you know, rather than in the City of Chicago.  And for some--at that time the City of Chicago was hot, and especially Hyde Park.  Hyde Park was very hot, which is the area of the city that we really liked.  And so we were about to, to give up.  We ran into all kinds of interesting experiences while we were looking in Wilmette and when--and, and even Evanston [Illinois].  But we were about to give up.  I felt that we had spent enough weekends, you know looking for, for houses.  And, and the realtor said, "Look, there's--I have one more house.  I think it's exactly what you're looking for; however, it is in Glencoe, which is beyond your circle."  And so I said, "Fine."  This is, "Since this is our last day, we'll make it our last house, and we'll go look at it."  And we did, and we fell in love with it.  It was a little cape cod, beautiful area of Glencoe, and we bought it on the spot.
Story_ID: 572201
Speaker 1: So what was your neighborhood like then?  This is 1960, sixty-some, '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: That was in 1967.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now it's not that those communities, you know, Glencoe [Illinois], Wilmette [Illinois], the other one, had the--
Speaker 2: Winnetka [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Winnetka--haven't had black communities there, but, 'cause there was always, you know, black com--
Speaker 2: In Glencoe, there was.
Speaker 1: Was Wilmette--
Speaker 2: Not, no, not, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So can you talk about the community that you found there?  And like, were you integrating your block?  Was that what you were doing or not?
Speaker 2: I was integrating east of the tracks, if that means anything (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --because the black population living there before had been west of the tracks.  And so most black families moving into Glencoe had moved in west of the tracks.  Well, we didn't know what we were doing because, you know, we saw the house; we liked it; we bought it.  And so we knew nothing about the history of Glencoe or anything.  We just knew that we liked the house and, and so we bought it.  It was later on that we, we learned things about, about the house and about the area--
Speaker 1: And so what--
Speaker 2: --and about the community.
Speaker 1: --did you learn?
Speaker 2: Well, the word immediately went out to Human Relations Committee [Glencoe Human Relations Committee], and they put out a, a watch and had people sitting on the street and driving up and down the street during the day of the move.  The police department was carefully watching the house the day of the move, and they weren't sure what was going to happen.  And some neighbors were friendly; others were not friendly.  A very interesting incident did occur though.  I was--it was before we had curtains at the windows, and we lived right on the corner.  And I was putting some books up on the shelf in the living room, and all of a sudden I heard what sounded like a shot.  And I, I dove for the floor, because this was in the back of my mind all along.  And I, I dove for the floor and then turned down all the lights, crept to the lights, turned out the lights, looked out.  I didn't see anything and so forth.  Anyway, it, it, it ended up that one of the books that I had put up, was one of these large coffee table books, and it fell flat and, and made quite a noise.  And so it, it showed you where my head was, and I had to get my head straight on that matter.  So, anyway, it, it turned out to be a good move for us.  The people were very friendly.  We very quickly got involved in the Human Relations Committee, which was very close to getting the village to pass an open housing ordinance.  So we helped them to get that done, and, and so we just stayed involved in the community.  It was a great community.  We really loved it for the thirty or so--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --years that we were there.  It was just a great community.
Speaker 1: Well, such a great community that you ran for, and become mayor.  I mean that's, that's what I'm--
Story_ID: 572202
Speaker 1: You became civically active, right?
Speaker 2: I became civically active.  That's, that's a good way to put it.  I, I became active first with a group of black parents who felt that their children were not being dealt with in a proper way, not badly, but in the proper way.  They were being, as the teachers and the superintendent explained to us, they were being color blind, and we didn't want them to be color blind.  We wanted them to notice our kids and, and work with them because the requirements were different and do different things.  If they're sitting in the back row, ask the boys to come to the front row, these kinds of things.  And, and so we started having meetings with them and discussions with them.  And one thing led to another and, and some other things in dealing with the high school.  And they were giving little plays in which they--we didn't like the way that they portrayed African Americans, and so we dealt with those issues as well.  And so I ended up being president of the Human Relations Committee [Glencoe Human Relations Committee].  And because of my activity with the schools, a vacancy occurred because of a conflict of interest with one, for one of the, one of the trustees on the, on the school board.  And I was approached and asked if I would take his seat, and I agreed to.  And so that's how I really became involved in--because I didn't have to be elected by the public at that point; that was an appointee.  Now for my next term I did have to be elected by the public, but that was my first foray into public office there in Glencoe [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was, that's 1993 though, right?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: That was, that was--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry (unclear) for mayor.  That's when you were  (unclear), some of--
Speaker 2: That was in 1971 to--
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-one [1971], okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --about 1978.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I served on the school board.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, on the school board.
Speaker 2: And then I, I sort of relaxed and jus helped out here and there because I felt that I'd done my civic duty.  Furthermore, I was so involved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Involved.
Speaker 2: --in the City of Chicago [Illinois] that I just wasn't interested in doing much more at that time (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 572203
Speaker 1: One day a former village manager [Robert Morris] and village president [Roland Calhoun] called me and asked me to go to breakfast with them.  And they asked me if I would run for president of the village.  And I told them I'd think about it and quite frankly, had pretty much decided not to until I talked to my daughters [Pamela Webb Dixon and Lisa Webb].  And my youngest daughter asked me, she says, there'd never been an African American president before or mayor before.  I said, "No, not that I know of," (laughter), you know.  And she said, "Is there apt to be one anytime in the near future," (laughter)?  I said, "I don't think so.  I don't see anyone on the horizon right now."  And she said, "Well, then I think you have an obligation to do it," and so I did it.  And--
Speaker 2: So how was it?  So you ran a whole campaign and everything, or were you appointed?
Speaker 1: Well, no.  They have a caucus system--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: --in Glencoe [Illinois], where the caucus actually, they can go out and seek a slate of candidates.  They can select people and encourage them to run.  And they seek a slate of candidates.  And, and, and that's how it just so happened that the two fellows that came to me were fairly influential, one having been president for eight years and the other having been village manager for forty or so years.  And quite honestly, the issue, there was an issue that, that they were having at the time, a little problem in the community with, that had sort of turned residents against each other.  And one of the things that I had survived when I was on the school board and during a period where I was president of the school, was closing a school, which is a very traumatic thing for any community.  And, and we had helped the community through that, and they remembered that.  And they essentially were saying to me that, "Jim [HistoryMaker James O. Webb], we think that, we think that you could really help to bring the community back together, and, and so that's why we, we're coming to you."  And so that was the challenge for me, was to try to bring the community back together.  It was over an issue of what to do with downtown Glencoe.
Speaker 2: And no ra- it wasn't a race issue.
Speaker 1: Oh no, had nothing to do with race issue.
Speaker 2: That's interesting, okay.
Speaker 1: No.  'Cause Glencoe is, it's never been more than about 4 percent, since I was there, 4 percent African American; so race has not really not been an issue in Glencoe.

Speaker 1: Who are the families?  Can you just keep rolling?  Who are the black families that were the black families there?  Can you like--
Speaker 2: Oh, in Glencoe [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Oh, there were a lot of them, but--
Speaker 1: Like?
Speaker 2: An historical family there is the Rankins.  And the Rankins had been there for years.
Speaker 1: Is that Stu Rankin [HistoryMaker Stuart Rankin], his--
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know them all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know one, I think one was a lawyer, if I'm not mistaken.  And the King family had been there for years; the Camfields [ph.] had been there for quite some time; and there--and, and the Williams.  As a matter of fact, Bill Williams [William A. Williams] was actually the first African American to serve on the board of trustees in, in Glencoe.  He was a, he was a trustee in Glencoe.  And, and Dr., Dr. Dove [ph.], I think her name was Dr. Dove, who was a physician who I gather was very well known by the black community years ago.  But I, I never really got to know--since we lived east, and I was working hard--

Speaker 1: We were talking back when--we ended last time about some of the organizations that you had started and been a part of, you know, with [HistoryMaker] Josie Childs, you know, that were--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --more along, I would call more community, you know, development, you know, adding to the sort of fabric.  One was more focused on the community; one more focused on, you know, blacks in Corporate America.  I want to start this time by really talking about your run for--we had touched upon it, but I want to start here with this, your run for mayor of Glencoe [Illinois] and how it came about.  And I would like you to restate how you ended up moving to Glencoe first.
Speaker 2: Well, when we first moved to Chicago [Illinois] in 1962, we moved into Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] and enjoyed it very much.  Our, our two children [Pamela Webb Dixon and Lisa Webb], I think the oldest one--well, both I think, yeah, both were in Ray School [William H. Ray Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] I believe.  But in any event, we liked the area, but we knew all along that we wanted to live in a private home as opposed to an apartment.  And we watched the townhouses go up in Hyde Park and had pretty much decided that's where we wanted to stay.  As it turned out, they had outgrown our budget by the time we were ready to make a move, which was about five years later.  And so we decided that we would look for housing, including suburban Chicago, so we drew a circle around the area that we were willing to, to go to.  We went as far, the circle went as far as Wilmette [Illinois], and I believe it was Wilmette.  It might have been Evanston [Illinois].  I think it was Wilmette.  And we spent several weekends looking for home and saw nothing that we really, we really liked.  And some of the communities--a little--lot of these communities were still closed to African Americans.  And we just were not crazy about the way we were greeted in some of those communities, and, and so we weren't necessarily interested in moving in of course and taking--exposing our children to, to that environment.  The very last weekend that we had decided to devote to our search, the realtor said well, you know, "If you'd be willing to expand your search, I think I have a home that you would really like.  It's in Glencoe.  It's outside of your circle.  So, if you're willing, we'd like to take a look at it."  So we did, and she was absolutely right: we loved it.  We immediately bought it, and that's how we ended up in Glencoe, and that was in 1967.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was your realtor white that sold you that house in Glencoe?
Speaker 2: The realtor that was helping us was, was white.  Now as it turned out, they, that realtor actually turned us over to the realtor in Glencoe, and she happened to live across the street from the house that we were buying, which also made us feel very comfortable.  The broker that she worked for actually lived around the corner from her, which also made us feel that much more comfortable.  And so we thought that that was the kind of scenario that we wanted.  Here was someone that was bringing an African American family into an area of Glencoe east of the tracks, which heretofore had not had any African American families.  And the broker and the realtor were our neighbors, our immediate neighbors, and that was a very positive statement about the community to us.
Story_ID: 572207
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the community you came into.  How large was the community in 1967?
Speaker 2: It was about 10,600, close to 11,000.
Speaker 1: What is the history of Glencoe [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Glencoe had African Americans for a number of years.  And it's my understanding that early on it was, it was, it was a very wealthy community of people who actually made their money in Chicago [Illinois] but, but lived in Glencoe.  Some of the men actually on weekends, I under, understand, it was almost a summer home type of thing simply because of the distance and the lack of really quality transportation at the time.  But in any event, most had people who helped around the home, gardeners, maids, butlers, so forth.  And most of those people were African Americans.  Gardeners tended to be Italian.  And so they had a fairly good sized number of Italians and African Americans coming into the community during the week.  Most of them would be staying in the homes, and then they would go home on weekends.  Again, as I understand it, sometimes they wouldn't come back on Monday mornings.  And so people got their heads together and said, look, why don't we create an, a community here for them to live in, and that way we will have access to them, you know, 24/7, and we'll solve the problem of, of the turnover of, you know, of the servants.  And that's how the community got started, is my--so they devoted an area within Glencoe for mostly Italians and African Americans.
Speaker 1: Was that an area located in proximity or would, you know, was there Italian section and then the African, black section?  Was that--
Speaker 2: It was, it was, it was my understanding that to some extent it was mixed. That Italians and African Americans lived in the same area.  Now, I'm also led to believe that some time shortly after that, Italians began to move to what's now known as Highwood [Illinois].  And that's why Highwood now is, or at least until recently, was a fairly--
Speaker 1: Robust, Italian--
Speaker 2: It was a robust community, a lot of restaurants and lot of activity--
Speaker 1: But Italian.
Speaker 2: --but primarily Italian.
Speaker 1: Now what period of time are we talking about where, you know, there became the, these separate communities to support the wealthy white community?  What, I mean are we talking--
Speaker 2: That's testing--
Speaker 1: --late 18--
Speaker 2: --a little bit.  My, my impression--oh no, that was, that was still in the, in the 20th century.  It was around 1930, '40 [1940].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And was there any evidence--and I'm asking you this 'cause you were mayor.  But was there any evidence ever of, you know, racial tension or anything like that or anything like that?  You know, did--
Speaker 2: I never heard of any.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you have to understand too that it was a well protected community, because these people were very important to the residents.
Story_ID: 572208
Speaker 1: Tell me, you know, from the time--because we're really talking about '67 [1967] to 1993 when you were, you know, elected mayor.  What, what was the community that you came to sort of love and become part of?  And, and, and I'm asking about the white community and the black community?  'Cause I'm, you know, and I'm asking these questions because there has been historically--you know, and I think this, the way you painted, there has been historically a, a black community on the North Shore [Chicago, Illinois], you know and, but not a lot is known about it.  So that's why I'm, I'm trying to sort of get a sense of what was that community you came into.
Speaker 2: Well, when you say there was a black community on the North Shore, when I moved to Glencoe [Illinois], I, I know there was one black family--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Wilmette [Illinois], one black family in Winnetka [Illinois], one black family, I believe, in Kenilworth [Illinois], and, and then of course Glencoe had--I think the population, the percentage of African Americans in Glencoe when I moved in was around 3, between 3 and 4 percent.  It, and that declined.
Speaker 1: Over your time, from 1967 to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That population declined I think to a great extent because developers were buying up a number of the older houses which just happened to be in the African American community.  And they were replacing them with fairly expensive houses, mansions, things of this nature, which some people, some of us tried to resist because it was changing the character of, of the community.  But, some things you can't stop.
Speaker 1: So you're saying Glencoe had the most than rest--
Speaker 2: Glencoe had the most.
Speaker 1: --it was, there was no, like, community.  It was just--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: So who were these fam- who were, do you remember who the (laughter) 3 or 4 [percent]--I mean of, of the other North Shore--do you--
Speaker 2: Well, in, in Winnetka it was [HistoryMaker] David James, an, an attorney, and his family; in Kenilworth it was Lillian Calhoun.  Do you remember--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and her husband [Harold Calhoun].  And in Wilmette, I just don't remember (unclear).  I remember exactly where they lived because all of us got to know each other (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --sort of well.  And, and I remember going to his house several times, but I just don't remember his name.
Story_ID: 572209
Speaker 1: So what was this community?  What was the attraction of the community to you?  And what, how did it sort of expand your own horizons in a way?  'Cause we're talking about still, you know, I mean, we're in the '60s [1960s].  Those are still somewhat turbulent times, you know, racial relations, attempts to, you know, go across sort of racial boundaries in, you know, some respects.  But, so I'm just, you know, I'm trying to get a sense of, you know, what home life was, you know, how you're integrating yourself in the community, the, the relationships or associations you formed (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, Glencoe [Illinois] was, what we found was a very liberal community, a very active Human Relations Committee [Glencoe Human Relations Committee].  It was not a commission; it was a committee of residents.  And at that particular time when we moved in, as a matter of fact, the Human Relations Committee was very active in developing and pushing for an open housing ordinance.  It was, it was just about committed to the--their work was just about completed.  And I became active, of course, and my wife [Frankie Lowe Webb] and I.  And once that got approved, then we were looking to do other things with the Human Relations Committee.  And I'd become sufficiently active with that shortly after I became active.  I was asked to be vice president, and then I became president.  But while I was vice president, we implemented a number of things, newsletters and a special festivals or events that would bring the community together.  And so it was, it, it, it was a good place to start because it was a liberal community that wanted to, to welcome African Americans in a different way, at a different level than they had before.  And, and I, I think to, to some extent, they succeeded, but then, economics I think sort of got in the way of, of complete integration of the community.
Speaker 1: I, I think--so you say to some extent and then economics got in the way.  So what time period are we talking about?  You know, what, what is to some extent mean?  And then what does it mean by economics got in the way?  And what time period?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I would say that things were going great up until probably about the '80s [1980s], early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: So during more the Reaganomics, the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], Reagan period and the high inflation?
Speaker 2: Inflation and, and yeah, home values just went up dramatically on the North Shore [Chicago, Illinois], you know, homes that were initially maybe around fifty thousand [dollars], within a few years they were up to $150,000.  And then, of course, through--it accelerated when developers, as I said, began becoming interested in purchasing some of the older homes, smaller homes in Glencoe and, and then developing larger homes that were much more elegant but costing, of course, much more money.
Story_ID: 572210
Speaker 1: What was the progress, though, up until those '80s [1980s]?  What, what was, what was happening to the whole nature of the community in that way?  'Cause you said, you know, it was an open community [in Glencoe, Illinois].  It was, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, things were, thing were changing I mean.  An integrated community was being implemented.  An African American was elected to the city council, to, to the board.  We called it the--
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: --board of trustees.  Bill Williams [William A. Williams], and he had lived in the community for quite some time.  And African Americans were just being integrated throughout.  African Americans were put, were elected to the park board, the library board, and so that was one method of integration.  But they were also in, in neighborhood parties.  You would tend to see African Americans as part of the, as part of the, of the community, socially as, as, in, in every way.  Things had improved in, in the schools.  There was never a, a problem in the schools in that--it wasn't that, that the school system was totally insensitive.  They just simply didn't understand what was needed at the time by African Americans.  For example, and I may have mentioned this before, but a number of parents noticed that African American boys would congregate in the back of the classroom.  And, and of course the feeling was that, you know, the, the good stuff is being taught.  You gotta be up front.  You're gonna have to pay attention.  And, and so they wanted their kids sitting integrated throughout the class and up front, if necessary.  Well, the response of the school system was that, "We don't see them as African Americans.  We treat them just like the other children."  Of course we said, "No, that they are African Americans, and we want you to treat them as such, that which means that therefore you recognize their difference and what their unique needs may be, and you address those, and deal with them."  And so those--we, we were listened to; those ideas were accepted; and, and they were acted upon.  And so that was the, the, the process of getting change, which as I said, wasn't change from an anti to, to, to a, a positive, but it was simply a, a, a better understanding of really the value of integration and, and, and how it works best to the benefit of, of everybody.

Speaker 1: You had children [Pamela Webb Dixon and Lisa Webb], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, how--your children grew up in Glencoe [Illinois], did they?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Essentially, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, what kind of environment was it for them you think growing up?  And, and if you had, if you could, you know, think about how that differed from they, you know, the life they would have had growing up in--and their view of the world--I guess is what I'm saying--how it differed from them growing up in, in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: You know, that's a hard question for me to answer, you know.  All I can do is sort of relate some of the feedback that they've given to me from time to time.  They, I think as they look back on it, they're very pleased with the education that they received because it was an outstanding education in, in Glencoe and then, of course, high school at New Trier [New Trier High School, Winnetka, Illinois] in New Trier School District [New Trier Township High School District 203], which is clearly one of the best in the area.  They, they have some concerns as it regards the, the social aspects, and I can't tell you I understand what all of that means.  But, you know, children be- they can behave a bit differently than, than their parents.  So whereas the people that I'm socializing with might have their hands in, in, in this camp, the, the, the, the kids may be behaving a little bit differently.  So, I'm, I'm not exactly sure to what extent the social aspect was a positive one for the, the social experience was really a positive one.  So I, I think it's a mixed bag for them.  Given the choice though, I, I think that they, they are so pleased with their education that they received that I think they would choose to do it over again, I think, but that's my guess.
Speaker 1: Right.  I understand that.  I grew up in a small town myself in Ohio, very, very, you know, very, very similar in that way.  And I would say that would be my assessment, too.  And then you know also the other thing is that you know how to deal in a white society and--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) with very great ease, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.

Speaker 1: Let's talk about what led to you, you know, running for, for mayor.  What were the positions?  You know, you talk about being head of open house--is it fair hou--
Speaker 2: No, the Human Relations--
Speaker 1: Human Relations--
Speaker 2: --Glencoe Human Relations Committee.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  But what other things?  What sort of led to you, you know, at this point--so, we know in the '80s [1980s] things sort of, you know, thing--not take a nosedive, but things were starting to change--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --a little bit, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The people have been in the community.  The kids are not necessarily staying there.  They're going, you know, maybe to the city or whatever.  Parent--you know, homes are selling and--but what--
Speaker 2: And they were, these--I don't want to mislead--these weren't only--it was truly an economic change initially.  It impacted whites as well as African Americans but probably disproportionately African Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And are you saying that there was just development?  There was--even though it was--there was a lot of develop- and they were, there was--land was a premium, at a premium.  And so people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --were coming.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And of course, you still had African Americans continuing to move into the area, but they were of a different economic level.  They could afford to move in.
Speaker 1: So they were high, higher, okay--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --okay, okay.  Now, so how did it come that--so what other positions did you hold besides being, you know.
Speaker 2: I was on the school board from 1971.  Actually, I was appointed to the school board to fill the vacancy of the fellow that turned out had a conflict.  And I think there was one year left on his, his term, and then I ran for two terms on my own, two three year terms on my own.  So I actually served on the school board for seven years, from '71 [1971] to '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Now those years, were you--where were you?  Were you at Blue Cross Blue Shield at--I mean you were at the--
Speaker 2: I was, I, I was at Illinois Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, at the time, okay.  So you're, you know, very active in that community or active in the Chicago [Illinois] community, well, business community.  So, what--so, the school board, what did that teach you about the community though, and what things did you sort of put in place?  So, first of all, how much money was being spent per child?  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Geez, I don't recall--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but it was, it was, it was--
Speaker 1: It was a good amount (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Sorry, that's (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Weren't skimping (laughter).
Speaker 1: Sorry, not supposed to be laughing.  But what else did you learn, you know, as president of the school board?  Did you--or was there anything?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, the first thing that I learned was that the parents in Glencoe [Illinois] are extremely demanding when it comes to the education of their children.  And they worked at it; they devoted their personal time to it; they worked closely with the teachers, with the faculty, and with the principal, and with the school superintendent to see to it that their children received a top notch education.  They attended board meetings.  They took a deep interest in, in everything that we did.  And so I, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to paint a picture that it was, it was a highly educated community and with a tremendously high value placed on education.
Speaker 1: So there was a lot of micromanaging going on (laughter); a lot of resources to deal with.  I'm sorry, no more laughing, okay.
Story_ID: 572213
Speaker 1: Tell me how you came to run for mayor.  How did that happen?
Speaker 2: I was approached by a former village manager and a--
Speaker 1: His name?
Speaker 2: Bob Morris [Robert Morris] and a former village president, Roland Calhoun, and who asked me to breakfast, and that was their purpose.  They asked me if I would consider running for president.
Speaker 1: And why did they want you to consider?  Why did they think you such a good candidate?
Speaker 2: Well, there was some, there were some things going on in, in, in the community at that time that, to some extent, had the community at odds with itself.  Essentially, it was a matter that, that related to downtown development, and people took very hard positions on one side or the other.  And because when I was on the school board we dealt with a very, very similar issue, very ticklish issues because of the declining enrollment at that time and that we projected out for the future, we had to close a school.  And we went through a process.  I chaired that process, and it worked.  It worked in the sense that the community understood that we had to do it, and the majority of the community supported us in doing it.  Of course, the people that were impacted by it, they, they still disagreed because they didn't want to lose that school in their community, and that's understandable.  But it was successfully dealt with, and our, as a matter of fact, our effort was one of the early efforts nationally.  And to some extent, the work that we did by involving the entire community in the decision making process, it was recognized around the country.  A number of people, a number of other school districts used it as a model.  But we had well over a hundred people involved in, in, in that effort and leaders in the community as well.  And I think that they, they were thinking that well, you know, maybe Jim [HistoryMaker James O. Webb] could help to bring the community back together with this issue as well because there were very, very strong feelings.  The Glencoe [Illinois] news was full of editorials every week and letters to the editor.  And, and just the community was taking sides, and a line was being drawn.
Story_ID: 572214
Speaker 1: Who were you running against?
Speaker 2: You know, there were, there were about four or five people I think, but I don't recall.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you were the mo- so now, tell me the, the system of government there.  I mean there's a mayor and there--
Speaker 2: Well, the system of gov- government is called the village--the, the manager, council manager--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --system and where you have a, a manager who is the operating, the chief operating officer, so to speak, of the community, and then you have a president.  He's called a president, although when you leave Glencoe [Illinois], I'd always refer to it as mayor because people understood it better that way.  And the president is sort of the CEO of the community and the person who sort of is the buffer between the community and the village manager--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --on certain issues.  I shouldn't, shouldn't say that because on many issues people go directly to the, to the, obviously, to the village manager.
Speaker 1: Now in that type of system or--
Speaker 2: Glencoe, by the way, was a first community in the State of Illinois to have that form of government.
Speaker 1: In that type of system, how do you--what's your role versus the village manager's role?  I mean how--there, are there any conflicts ever?
Speaker 2: No, no more than you would find in a CEO, COO--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --corporate situation.  It, it's pretty clear, and the CEO understands or should understand that he has someone there who runs the, the show on a day to day basis and someone who is certainly much more, that's a professional.  That person is a professional, and they knew exactly how to do it, how to run a police department, how to run a public works department.  And the president is an elected person, as I was an actuary, and knowing absolutely nothing about running a, a village or a city on a day to day basis.  But I brought other skills to the table that were important for the CEO.
Story_ID: 572215
Speaker 1: Oh, you had four year term, like typical mayor [of Glencoe, Illinois], four year terms.  So you served really for--
Speaker 2: Two terms.
Speaker 1: Two terms--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so eight years.  Is that amount of terms that a mayor can serve, and, you know, or--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --village--
Speaker 2: --it was sort of the, it was sort of an unspoken thing.  I don't think that it was by statute or anything.  As a matter of fact, I was approached about the possibility of running for a third term.
Speaker 1: So what did you learn?  How--first of all, did you like it?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed it--
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: --very much.
Speaker 1: So what did you like about it, and what, what were the things that were the issues you were dealing with during your--
Speaker 2: Well, I liked the challenge most of all because in government you can--as opposed to a corporate situation, frequently you can see the results of what you do.  If, for example: if you have a, a downtown beautification project and, and you can make that happen, and you can convince the community and the residents to support you on it.  And perhaps there is a referendum involved, and they support that referendum, and then it gets built, it gets developed.  It's, it's something you can see, touch, feel, and you can see the progress there, and you can see people enjoying it, the parks and things of this nature.  And it's, that's one of the things that I got a great deal of enjoyment out of, was just seeing--making improvements and seeing people enjoy those improvements.
Story_ID: 572216
Speaker 1: So what were some of the improvements that you actually made during your tenure?
Speaker 2: Well, the, I, I think the one that people are giving the most credit for was we had had some land next to our incinerator, which was not in, immediately in Glencoe [Illinois] but was on the other side of--it was actually between Winnetka [Illinois] and Northbrook [Illinois], in that area.  And it had just been there, and we had been using it for a while to store our salt in for, for the streets in the, in the winter.  And so it just wasn't being used productively at all.  And so what I did, and, and, and quite frankly, a large part of it, even though it was in Glencoe, most of it was owned by the Cook County forest preserve [Forest Preserve District of Cook County].  And I spent at least three years off and on working with the Cook County [Illinois] commissioners and with, with President Stroger [HistoryMaker John H. Stroger, Jr.] and others to first of all get them to agree to sell us the land.  And that took some doing, but we got it done.  And then we proceeded to negotiate with automobile dealers.  Because it's over on the expressway, not in, in the Village of Glencoe.  It's on the expressway and an ideal spot for automobile dealers.  And so today I think there are probably about four dealerships there.  And the net result of it, it's probably quadrupled our tax base that we get from sales tax.
Story_ID: 572217
Speaker 1: Were there challenge--what were the--first of all, the first time you ran [for mayor], what, what was your--what did you win by?  How many votes--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: --or percentage?  You don't?
Speaker 2: I don't--
Speaker 1: Were you a--
Speaker 2: I, I think it was--
Speaker 1: --popular candidate?
Speaker 2: I think it was, yeah, it was very significant.
Speaker 1: It was?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there were no--it--you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, first of all, you have to understand it's a caucus system.  And the, the caucus is--we have thirteen precincts in Glencoe [Illinois].  Each precinct has three representatives.  So there're thirty-nine people that make up the caucus.  The--if, if you're interested in running, you must file your application by a certain date with the caucus.  The caucus will then interview these candidates, perhaps a number of times, and they'll, they'll begin to, to, to narrow it down, because their objective is to end up with one single candidate that they can recommend to the community.  And then they will present that candidate.  Now this will take place in the fall of the year.  They will then present that candidate in January at a town meeting to the community so that the community has a chance at the candidate and to ask whatever questions that they want to ask.  Now at that town meeting it's possible for other nominations to come from the floor.  The caucus is just simply saying this is who we recommend for president of the village or for a seat on the, on the council.  And the community then can respond to that by ratifying that.  And, and then that name is the only ballot unless there is a write-in, but there can be a write-in.  As a matter of fact, in my second term, three seats turned over because of a write-in, of a write-in campaign at the beginning of my second term.  So, when, when the voting actually takes place in April, it's--if, if you're the caucus candidate, most people will just vote for you unless there's an, an active write-in candidate.  So the question I guess is how many of those thirty-nine people on the caucus voted for me?  I have no idea.
Story_ID: 572218
Speaker 1: The other question I have for you is what were some of your other key initiatives, things that you were proud of that happened in those eight years [as mayor]?
Speaker 2: Well, the first was the reason that the two fellows that, that the village manager [Robert Morris] and the president [Roland Calhoun] came to me and asked me to run.  I saw that as a, a real challenge because the community was in, in turmoil.  And, and quite honestly, up until that time, I had not gotten into that fray at all, and so I was, I just watched it as an observer.  And so I had not taken a public position on, on, on the issue at all.  So it gave me a certain objectivity, where it allowed me to present myself as an objective individual in getting, in getting the matter resolved.  And we did get it resolved, and, and there were a number of things that we did.  We, we took a fresh look at the, at the project as to the recommendation.  And again, I, I used the method of, of involving the community.  Again, we involved, I don't think it was a hundred people, but quite a few in studying different aspects of the, of the issue and coming up with recommendations.  And so in the final analysis, the, the recommendation was the, was the recommendation of the community that came to the, to the council for their action.  The other thing that helped at that particular time, 1994 was 125th anniversary of the founding of Glencoe [Illinois].  And so we decided that we would make this a twelve month celebration, positive celebration.  And every Thanksgiving, for example, we would have an ecumenical service in one of the temples or one of the churches.  And we put together a choir, 125 voice choir, representing the 125 years from all of the churches in Glencoe, and there are quite a few, all of the churches and temples in Glencoe.  And it was absolutely beautiful, and we had a wonderful Thanksgiving ecumenical service and, and things like this.  Then we had an annual banquet at the botanic garden [Chicago Botanic Garden, Glencoe, Illinois], where the entire community was invited, celebrating our 125th.  We had contests for children to come up with a logo celebrating the 125th.  It was won by one of our residents, a little girl.  I think she was in the seventh grade.  And we made it into buttons and these kinds of things.  So, it was, it was a good feeling.  By the end of our, of 1994, it was--people had a good feeling about their community.  And so now we were then able to begin to work on some other more positive things.
Speaker 1: Well, you were also, you know, in a leadership position and running things.  And this was--you had already left Corporate America at this point, right, 1990, yeah, not?
Speaker 2: It was, it was a little bit of an overlap--
Speaker 1: It was a little bit over.
Speaker 2: --but not much.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay, okay.  I mean but you were able to--you--it wasn't like a part time situation, was it, this whole--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  The present--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --it--the president does not need to spend forty hours a week.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, if he did, he'd be micromanaging too much.  I would say that I, I, I'd probably put in twenty-five hours a week between just the social aspects and, and, and working with the council, and with the community, and then, and, and of course, with the village manager.  So I'd, I'd say it was a good twenty-five hours a week.
Story_ID: 572219
Speaker 1: Is there anything else about that [mayoral] experience?  Otherwise, you know, we've talked about the celebration.  And I would talk about your board involvement some.  But I, I want to, before we leave Glencoe [Illinois], I want to understand the, the community that you sort of left at that--you know, when you--what had changed about the community in many ways?  You know, had it just become wealthier, you know, or (laughter), or--
Speaker 2: Well, that's true (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (laughter).  I want to just asking, you know, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, Glencoe gained quite a bit of notoriety during that period.  I think--
Speaker 1: Why is that?
Speaker 2: Well, I think because people began to see it differently.  You know, our downtown was looking good.  There were some things going on in Glencoe that actually--for example, there is a theater there called the Writers Theatre, which started in Glencoe and by Michael Halberstam, who is the artistic director and the producer of some of their plays, most of the plays.  But he's the driving force be, behind Writers Theatre.  And it started off in the back of a bookstore.  And, and it was, it was just a wonderful, actually a wonderful venue for that kind of, for that kind of theater at that, at that particular time.  I think there were only fifty seats but, but it began to draw people from outside the community into Glencoe.  And then we, we got our own Starbucks [Starbucks Corporation] and our own Caribou Coffee [Caribou Coffee Company, Inc.] and, and things of this nature.  And, and so downtown started perking up, because Glencoe, it, it, it has--it's a place where you must go to.  In other words, it's not a place that you pass through and stop.  And so we started getting people to actually decide that Glencoe was a destination for them.  "Let's go to Glencoe and, and, and go to--." We had a number of, of fashionable boutiques for women, small boutiques, and children's, children's clothes and things of this nature.  And so, people started coming to Glencoe to, to, to shop as a destination.  And so, I, I think that they began seeing the beauty of the community.  It's a little bit different from some of the other North Shore [Chicago, Illinois] communities, in that we've always taken pride in, in, in open space.  Our twenty year plan emphasized the importance of open space, green areas, and, and not doing a whole lot of apartment building in those areas.  And, and, and so it, it's, it's a significant park community for that section of the North Shore.  And, and people started hearing about this, and, and, and it was being written about.  And I think that we were voted, you know, number one or number two suburb, Chicago [Illinois] suburb for a couple of years by Chicago magazine or other magazines.  And it started attracting young people with the financial wherewithal, the economic ability to, to purchase some of these beautiful homes that were being built in Glencoe.  And that just continued and has continued to this day.  So, you--I left it, yes, as a, as a community that was sort of the place to live or, or one of the places to live in the Chicago suburbs.  And of course, it always had a reputation of quality education.  But, yes, the economic value had, of homes, had increased significantly.
Story_ID: 572220
Speaker 1: I want to ask you, though, because you--were you serving on the board of Harris Bank [Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] or director?  What does (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was a director on the board.
Speaker 1: Okay, director, okay.  Was that, were you all--when you became a director of the board of Harris Bank, were you already serving on other boards as, I mean for-profit?  I'm talking about for-profit.
Speaker 2: For-profit boards, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I was.  I was serving on the Harris Bank Glencoe, Glencoe-Northbrook board--
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: --of Harris Bank--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: And how had you been asked to serve on that board?
Speaker 2: Well, again, they had approached me--oh, geez, I don't recall exactly when.  And I was really pretty busy, doing other things.  I, and, and I said no initially, but I told them I would be interested at some time in the future.  And I think it was a couple of years later I went back to them and after I had retired from Dental Network of America [Dental Network of America, LLC], say I now have a little more time to do this.  And, and so I was elected to the, to the Harris Bank Glencoe-Northbrook [Glencoe, Illinois] board.  And shortly after that, Daryl Grisham, who was on the downtown board, saw me at the Harris Bank function, not knowing that I was on the board and, and at the Harris Bank board in Glencoe [Illinois], and he came up with the idea that, geez, we'd really like to have you on the downtown board.  And so one thing led to another, and I ended up being elected to the downtown board.  And I immediately offered my resignation then to the Glencoe board.  And they asked me not to because they felt, they had never had a person, a director on the downtown board who also at the same time served on the suburban board, bank board.  And they thought that it would be an interesting perspective that I would bring to the, to the downtown board because of that.  And, and I did find it interesting because there's no question about, two very different operations when it comes to the, the director's role of, of those two situations.  One's a community bank, and the other is a main bank.
Speaker 1: So now, what--so Daryl, was he still on the board, the downtown board when you came on, or were you replacing him?
Speaker 2: Daryl was on his way off the board--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so I was more or less a replacement for--that's the way he saw it, I'm sure--
Speaker 1: You know the--
Speaker 2: --as a replacement for himself.
Speaker 1: Because that has been in the right thinking mind a tradition, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that there was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --one, you know, black seat or one female seat.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: So, the board you came on, how many--
Speaker 2: Well, certainly a tradition in the sense that, if there is a seat, you certainly want continuity in that seat.  You don't want to lose, lose that seat.  And most outgoing African Americans who have been serving as directors, I--outgoing African American directors--most take it upon themselves to really do their best to see to it that there is an African American there before that.  But I, I have to say at Harris we were actually looking--there were, there was a second person that came on the board oh, a couple of years before I went off.
Speaker 1: The board was how large?  How many people on the--
Speaker 2: The Harris Bank board?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Harris Bank.
Speaker 2: Oh, geez, I don't recall--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --maybe a, a dozen or more.
Speaker 1: So one black and--
Speaker 2: Well, there was one when I replaced Daryl.
Speaker 1: Daryl.
Speaker 2: But then, within a few years there was a second.
Speaker 1: And who joined?
Speaker 2: Haven Cockerham.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: I know, we know Haven, okay.
Story_ID: 572221
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, did you learn anything?  Have you learned anything with your board experience?  Did you--you know, I just go back to when, when, not headed anyplace with it, but I just--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: --no, no introspection, but you know, that, that's the thing that's so popular right now, you know, is getting on corporate boards.  And you have, you know, people like Jewel Lafontant [HistoryMaker Jewel Lafontant-MANkarious] and you know, and then, you know, now Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] is sitting on, like, twenty--I don't know, some outrageous number of boards.  But he often spoke of, of, you know, how he got on and how it was a whole--you know, well, he was trying to get a lay of the land--think he's pretty much gotten it now.  But, but (laughter), but was there any getting the lay of the land or because of really, you know, the background you had had with running, you know, a, a major company and the being president, you know, of a, a very wealthy, you know, predominantly white community [Glencoe, Illinois]?  Was there, was there any adjustment on your part?  It was just, you know, very easy to sort of move in.  You had definitely had different experience than Daryl Grisham is what I'm saying, though he had--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --(unclear).
Speaker 2: No, I, I was pretty well prepared.  The, you know, like going into any new situation, every situation is different because there's a corporate culture that you have to understand.  You have to understand your colleagues on the board, you know, that you're gonna be working with, and understand how they think and things of that nature.  In other words, you're looking for exact--your niche.  How can I contribute to this board?  And so that takes, you know, a, a few meetings.  But other than that, I, I felt fine.  I, I was quite comfortable coming on board.  And as you say, my prior experiences taught me pretty much everything that I needed to know to, to be able to function effectively fairly quickly.
Speaker 1: Okay, now were you on any particular committees?  Were you on audit committee or I mean or, or--
Speaker 2: I was on--you're really testing my memory.  I was on the trust committee.  I was on the governance committee that sort of oversaw the, the operations of the board.  And there was one other key committee I was on which, which I, which was really--yeah, the--I forget what it was called--the, it's a--banks are required to, to provide services to the community.
Speaker 1: Community Reinvestment Act [Community Reinvestment Act of 1977].
Speaker 2: Yes, the CRA.
Speaker 1: Yeah, CRA, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, CRA committee; I was on that committee.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is before Sarbanes-Oxley [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002], 'cause that's just, that's later, right?  It's just before Sarbanes-Oxley--
Speaker 2: It, it--
Speaker 1: --about the time you got off.
Speaker 2: It was about the time, yeah, that, that I got off.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have any of those, those requirements.  But were there--what were the main issues at Harris [Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois]?  'Cause now, I mean, you know, like LaSalle [LaSalle Bank, N.A.] just got bought out by, you know, Bank of America [Bank of America Corporation], you know.  Harris is still sort of hanging in there.  But what were some of the issues that you remember being discussed or that were--
Speaker 2: Well, I can't talk about those--
Speaker 1: Oh, you can't.
Speaker 2: --but, but, but they were the typical business issues that any--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --bank would have at, at, at those times.  A number of banks were being acquired and, and acquiring, and we were no different.  You know, during my years on there we acquired some banks.  And of course, before I, I went on on the board, Harris Bank was acquired by the Bank of Montreal [BMO Financial Group].
Speaker 1: That's right.  So, so that, now there were issues; now I've heard that there were issues in terms of culture.  You know, that you had a, right, a Canadian bank, right, with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --American culture.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: That's, I had heard there were some issues--

Speaker 1: You also back in 1997, you had founded your own consulting firm, Baker, right?  Is it Baker-Eubanks [Baker-Eubanks, LLC, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, my consulting firm is James O. Webb and Associates [James O. Webb and Associates, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay, but what is Baker-Eubanks then?
Speaker 2: Baker-Eubanks is a, is a company that I, I got involved with on behalf of my, my son-in-law.  It's a security company--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --about which I know absolutely nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay, I got you.
Story_ID: 572223
Speaker 1: I'd like to just explore some sort of philosophical things with you a little bit, 'cause I--you--let's talk about your views about Corporate America and, and the opportunit- there are two tracks I want.  I want to talk about civic engagement, you know, and the period of time that you have sort of seen, which is really probably, you know, like a fifty, you know, forty, fifty year period.  And, well, let's talk about that first.  Then we'll talk about Corporate America.  But when you look at this city [Chicago, Illinois] that, you know, you know quite well and all the, you know, changes that have sort of occurred and the fact that you were involved in some, you know, early initiatives to bridge the, you know, economic--you know, racial barriers, to, you know, open communities, as you refer to, what are you thinking at the point we are, you know, in the society and the work that you did?  Was it all--do you see the, the benefits with the hopes that you had at the time?  Have the hopes that you had, have they manifested in the way that you were, and your cohorts thought?
Speaker 2: You know, my, my immediate reaction is, is yes.  You know, I, I could answer that no with, with some caveats or yes with some caveats.  And I, I think I would say yes with some caveats because if, if, if, if I thought back on, if I could think back on the, the objectives and the vision that we had years and years ago, I, I think that I would see that vision raised into being a realty today.  I, I think what I did not see was the fact that there would be still pockets of resistance and so many of them.  And, and maybe that's because our look, our, our, our vision was more of a global vision, rather than it was our broad vision, as opposed to a very specific vision.  So when I look at the, at the, at the broad vision, it's there.  You know, there, there are more and more African Americans being wealth--welcomed into, into the corporate world, more and more being dealt with fairly.  And it's, it's, it's just not the issue that it was before trying to break through the door and, and, then to be treated fairly with promotions and so salaries and things of this nature.  And so that's there; to a great extent it's there.  The vision has been realized.  But it's disappointing to find out that there still survived, almost like snipers, here and there.  That can do a great deal of harm, and they're in a position to do a great deal of harm to African Americans personally, and, and to their cause, and, and to this whole vision that's there.  In other words, it, it's a vision, but it could be--it, it, it's, it's, it's sort of under fire periodically from these people.  And they're successful in, in, in, in realizing their objectives from, from time to time.  And that's the surprise to me.  I don't know if I'm, I'm being clear on that, but that's the surprise to me, that so many of them still exist, and they're in key spots.  These are individuals that are in key spots in major corporations that are in decision making positions that still have not gotten the picture and still are not supportive to the vision.  And consequently, from time to time, you, you can see where they've done some harm.
Speaker 1: Now, you're talking about their tendency towards racism or judging people on the base of race or treating?  Is that what you're ex--
Speaker 2: Basically, yeah, yeah.  It's, it's, it's hard to define--depends on how you define racism, but essentially it's the net effect of, of a person being dealt with unfairly and differently because of their race.
Story_ID: 572224
Speaker 1: Can we look at the question, though, from the inverse?  You said yes, but I'd like you to take it from the no standpoint and answer the same question, and that's the issue, you know, on sort of race relations.  You said I could--I think yes, it made a difference.  But what if you said no?  What--how would you answer if you said it from the inverse way?
Speaker 2: Well, it'd be hard for me to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it would, it would be sort of the mirror image of, of, of what I said.  And, and, and that is that, given that situation, then I would be surprised to find out that so many advances have been made, and, and, and so much of the vision has been realized.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it, the way I see it, I see it as a plus, and then that allows me to highlight--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --those things that still, I think, need a lot of work.
Speaker 1: Okay, so back then, could you envision a Ken Chenault [Kenneth Chenault] or Stanley O'Neal?  Could you envision that?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I, I think the answer to that is yes, absolutely.  Now, my only hesitance there was, you know, American Express [American Express Company] is such a major, major financial institution in, in this country, I might have, if some had said, including American Express years ago, I, I might have hesitated a bit, but yes, African Americans as CEOs of, of major corporations, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Now, what about Corporate America, though, because is, do you think that the whole--that the--what do you think the opportunities and the obstacles that exist still in Corporate America for African Americans?  And I say that in light of increasing emphasis on globalization and the, you know, impact.
Speaker 2: Well, I think all of the opportunities are there, you know.  And, and as a matter of fact, they're probab- they're greater.  I know they're greater, because now with, with many of those barriers or most of those barriers broken down, it allows African Americans to, to develop and progress based upon their own skills, or knowledge, smarts, and ability to, to make things happen.  And I think given the education that so many African Americans are getting now and graduating at the top of the class and ending up as Rhodes scholars and things of this nature, I think that in an environment where there is not this artificial barrier to their growth and development and advancement, that they will become even a, a much, much greater part of the landscape.
Speaker 1: You do believe that?
Speaker 2: I do believe that.
Story_ID: 572225
Speaker 1: There's one other thing that I will mention, though, that I think is very, very important to this whole thing.  In almost every situation that I can think of where African Americans have achieved even beyond our, our, our, our dreams, there's always, and even in regular situations, and not necessarily all those just beyond the dream, but there's always been a mentor and someone who has said, "I'm going to move this situation along."  I believe that this person can be CEO of this corporation.  I believe that he can be better than anybody else that I've seen on the horizon, and I'm going to see to it that he has an opportunity to prove that, and to develop, and to learn, and I'm gonna give him all of the supports that are generally given to his white counterparts.  And I, I think that most of these people that you would speak to and ask them a, about their advancement and how they got to where they are, some place in the background I think there would be an individual like that, that just simply took them under their wing and said, "I think this person can do it; I'm gonna see to it that he does it, and he does it."  And that's very, very critical.  I think there will become more and more of those; I think that, that group will grow, and that's gonna be a positive development for African Americans, because they are also going to be a major offset to these people I referred to as snipers before that are just looking for opportunities to get in the way and to block that development.  I think you'll find more and more mentors that are going to step, step up to the plate.
Speaker 2: And what would, do you think is important for African Americans, for the community, to secure?  I mean not just be- but to secure their, their, their position in Corporate America to stay relevant?  Do you--would you answer that any, any differently?
Speaker 1: Not for a while because I think that that kind of support from the people in power is going to be important.  If that fades, then I think the progress will fade.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: In other words, it's, it's fragile.  I still think it's in a fragile stage, and it needs to be solidified so that it has a life of its own.  And given that life of its own, then I think that yeah, it will, it will, it'll generate itself; it will self-generate.  And you'll find African Americans just sort of blooming into key positions in, in corporations totally on their own.
Story_ID: 572226
Speaker 1: Mr. Webb [HistoryMaker James O. Webb], what are your, like, hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, my biggest concern is the separation of--the economic separation.  I don't think there's any question about it that the rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer.  And unfortunately, the, the, the percentage of African Americans that are in that poor group are disproportionate.  And to that extent, they're being harmed more and more by that separation.  Now, there are those who have escaped and find themselves in the, in the privileged economic class.  And I'm talking about class, and I'm not talking about race, and they're benefiting from it.  And so I think it's going to be critical that people who find themselves in that class don't forget where they came from, and, and, and, and carry with them the sensitivity that other people had that helped them to get to where they are, and to make sure that when they're sitting in board rooms that they are black, they remember that.  And when those decisions and those conversations are taking place that impact black people, make sure that their dialogue becomes a part of the key dialogue and make sure that that decision is a decision that they personally feel is in the best interest of the black community.  I think that's gonna be critical.  When we get into those positions, let's make sure that we're doing what we can do in order to protect at least the gains in the positions that we now have and to improve the lot of the--of, of, of most of the African Americans.
Speaker 1: And your hopes?
Speaker 2: My hopes are that, you know, as, as we, as we look at snapshots every five, ten years, that we will continue to see improvement even at a more rapid rate than we've seen in the past, that it'll be an accelerating rate of improvement in the lot of African Americans, and that to become more a part of the total society, whereas now we have a, a privileged group and a not so privileged group.  Hopefully those, those lines of distinction will begin to blur, and, and, and you know, after twenty, twenty-five years, they just won't be there anymore; you're on your own, so to speak, and what you put into it, you will get out of it.

Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: My legacy, geez, I've never really thought of that.  What I would like for my legacy to be, that, I guess that, that I, I put my energies where my mouth is.  You know, when I, when I talk about the visions that I--you know, from, from, from the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] to now and, and now looking into the future, I would like to think that during that period where I had an opportunity to have impact, and to bring about that kind of change, and to assure that vision that we dreamed about, that, that I indeed participated, that I, I was a, I was one to be reckoned with, that people saw me as being out front and as a leader and not as a follower--nothing wrong with being a follower--but leading the band to help that happen.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  We're done.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
