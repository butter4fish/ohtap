Speaker 2: The headquarters of TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And your occupation?
Speaker 2: That's difficult to answer (laughter).  I've had at least three or four different careers.
Speaker 1: And where are you--which--what's the title now?  Where do you--of your (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Retired.
Speaker 1: Retired (laughter).
Story_ID: 535874
Speaker 1: So, we'll start with--like these questions will appear on our website so they're short answers.  Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Chinese.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I would say spring, summer and fall, actually.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation designation?
Speaker 2: That varies.  I have--we have a home in Upstate New York in the Village of Cooperstown, New York, where we have a home.
Speaker 1: That's where the baseball--
Speaker 2: That's where the Baseball Hall of Fame [National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Cooperstown, New York] is, yes.  And that probably is our--one of our favorites I would have to say.
Speaker 1: So that's your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: At the moment, yes.  We also have a favorite place at the Ocean Club in the Caribbean [One and Only Ocean Club, Nassau, Bahamas], but we also like to travel, so.
Speaker 1: What about your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure that I have one.
Story_ID: 535875
Speaker 1: Well, let's start with your family tree, and we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  If you can give me your mother's name, her date of birth, place of birth?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, my mother is deceased.  She--her name is Harriette [Harriette Banks Wharton] and her maiden name was Banks.  And she had a brother named Hubert [Hubert Banks].  Her mother [Mary Pratt Hicks] was born in North Carolina, but I know very little about her background.  Her husband, Banks [Albert Banks], I didn't--I never met.  Although I discovered after he died that he had a restaurant here in New York City [New York, New York], which is very interesting.
Speaker 1: Now, then, do you know anything about the restaurant here in New York City?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  I've tried to find out and I haven't as yet.  I've been too busy working on other aspects of my biography.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your mother was born in North Carolina also?
Speaker 2: No.  She was born in Virginia.
Speaker 1: Virginia?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you know what city in Virginia?
Speaker 2: No--I do, but I'd have to look it up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything at all that you remember about your mother from your childhood?  What was your mother like as you were a child?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a fairly long answer.  First of all, my mother attended school in Boston [Massachusetts] where my grandmother had moved.  She had separated from her husband, and so the three of them moved to Boston.  My mother--grandmother became a chef, and my mother went to a girls high school [Girls' High School] in Boston.  She was an excellent student, and so the--one of her teachers persuaded my grandmother that my mother should go to college, which you could imagine was quite unusual both for women and for a black woman to go to college.  She did, and so, she enrolled in Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] majoring in chemistry.  Now, the interesting thing is that, while she was at Boston University was when she met my father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.].  I'll come back to my father in a minute.  But my father went to English High School [Boston, Massachusetts], and he graduated and went straight to law school.  In those days you could do that.  And he met--he went to law school at Boston University [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts], and that's when he met my mother.  And so, my father received his LLB in the same commencement that my mother received her bachelor's degree.  Now, subsequent to this, in terms of my mother, I would get back to it when I talk about my childhood, but she was an excellent student.  She became a teacher, professor actually, at what subsequently became Virginia State University [Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].  But she was teaching languages instead of chemistry; that was until she married my father, and then the rest I can tell you about in terms of what happened in terms of their marriage and my father's career.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, your mother--did your mother have any other siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes, I said she had a brother.
Speaker 1: Just only the brother?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct, a younger brother.
Speaker 1: And do you know anything about your uncle?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, he worked--he had several occupations and jobs working in Boston, yeah, um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now were you ever--did you ever--your mother's parents, did you (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was only my grandmother.  As I said, I didn't--
Speaker 1: Grandmother, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 535876
Speaker 1: Moving on then to your father's [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] side of the family.  What was your father's name and (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I'm a junior, so he has the same name.
Speaker 1: Of course, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My father's family I have been able to trace back on the paternal side a great deal.  My great-great-grandfather was named Peter Wharton.  He was born in 1793.  He was a freeman Negro.  He bought and freed my great-great-grandmother, Tabitha [Tabitha Wharton].  And their children were quite unusual, including my great-great-grandmother [sic. great-grandmother], Maria [Maria Wharton].  The family in that generation--those generations, were quite unusual, particularly those and the subsequent ones; for example, one became a physician, another one became superintendant of schools in Baltimore [Maryland].  His daughters, two of his daughters became principals of schools.  One was a school teacher.  Another one, another brother, my great-great-grandmother became a school teacher in another section of Virginia, graduated from Hampton [Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], became a clergyman, and there's a church named for him in Virginia, the Wharton Memorial Baptist Church [Nelson, Virginia].  And I recently spoke to the deacon in the school--I mean in the church, and he had a son, Ulysses [Ulysses Wharton], who became a physician; two grandsons, Ulysses and Murdock [Murdock Wharton] who became physicians.  So it's a fairly interesting family in terms of the number of different things.  One interesting sideline, for example, is that one of my cousins is Charles Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel], and his mother [Blanche Wharton Rangel] was a Wharton, and his great-great-grandfather and my great-great-grandmother were brother and sister.  So that gives you a sense of that aspect of the family.  On my father's paternal--maternal side, his mother came from the O'Neill-Griffin family.  The O'Neills in Baltimore owned a very successful department store and were millionaires when they died.  So, now, the sad part is that when my grandfather [William Bowman Wharton] moved to Boston [Massachusetts], he went from Virginia where the homestead is for the Whartons in Accomac [Virginia], he moved to Baltimore, then he moved to Boston and joined two of his brothers in Boston, one of whom owned a grocery store.  There was a fire and his wife [Rosalind Wharton] and my father's sister [Enola Wharton], my aunt, died and it was just my grandfather and my father who were left after that.
Story_ID: 535877
Speaker 1: But my father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] was an extremely fascinating person.  He had--he was very successful in t- he was a, he was in track, in swimming, in boxing.  He worked his way through law school at Boston University [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts].  He then joined a law firm, but because he didn't feel he was moving sufficiently rapidly for his taste, he decided to go into government service; became a clerk and then he took the--in Washington [D.C.], he took an exam for the [U.S.] Foreign Service, and this was the first time that they had had ever had exams in Foreign Service.  This was part of legislation that had been passed.  And the legislation was intended to change what had been seen as the exclusive elite group, who were the only ones chosen for Foreign Service.  And my father, thereby, became the first black to pass the Foreign Service exam.  This created a certain level of consternation in the state department [U.S. Department of State], because at the same time under the legislation they had created the Foreign Service Institute, which was supposed to provide training for a year to new entrants into the U.S. Foreign Service.  The state department did not know what to do with my father.  So what they did was, they decreed that my father had taken the exam and gave him his diploma and sent him off to Africa.  There's some interesting sidelights on this.  There's a marvelous cartoon which I have that appeared in the Afro-American newspaper [Baltimore Afro-American; Afro-American Newspapers] showing my father knocking on the door of the Foreign Services Institute and a hand is throwing the diploma out of the window with a ship in the background saying, "You're going off to Liberia."  So my father and mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] went to Liberia.  That was my father's first post.  That's why I recently pointed out when I was receiving an award from Africare [Washington, D.C.], that I was conceived in Africa, but born in Boston [Massachusetts], which is true.  My father then thus began a forty-year career in the Foreign Service.  Ultimately, he ended up becoming the first black career ambassador.  That's the highest level that you can reach.  But he served in a number of different posts, and both are--not just in Liberia, but also in Spain, in the Canary Islands [Spain]; he also served in Madagascar; in Lisbon [Portugal]; the Azores [Portugal]; in Marseille, France; and then he was ambassador to Romania and to Norway.
Speaker 2: So you said that your father went directly from high school to law school.  What was the name of the high school, do you know?
Speaker 1: English High School [Boston, Massachusetts], I said.
Speaker 2: English High School.  Okay.  And did you say he was also a good athlete?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 2: Did he purs- did he also continue to be a sportsman after university?
Speaker 1: No, no, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 535878
Speaker 1: At what point did he [Wharton's father, Clifford R. Wharton, Sr.] meet your mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] in Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I said in, in--at BU, atBoston University [Boston, Massachusetts] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At BU, I know, but is there a story?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did he ever talk about how they met? They met on campus, any stories surrounding it?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: So, at, at, and then when you were born--I also read that then around eight--he had already started his career at the time.  Do you remember traveling?  Can you talk to me about being in the Canary Islands [Spain], what you remember about the early years of traveling with your mother and father?
Speaker 2: Well, there--I have a number of memories of traveling.  First of all, in those days there were no airplanes.  So travel was always by ship.  And I've forgotten how many times I'd crossed the Atlantic Ocean as part of this as a child.  But, I remember certain incidents occurring while I was in Liberia as a child.  And the interesting thing is that, in terms of the travel, I only discovered this when I began writing my autobiography, that I had a practice as a child where every time I boarded a new ship, I insisted on canvassing the entire ship.  I would go up to the bridge, I'd go down into the engine room, I would go to the kitchens, I'd go to the dining rooms; I had to find out where everything was.  On every ship I did that as a child.  And as a child you are allowed to do that.  I mean, you weren't supposed to be in the bridge, but you know it's only a little kid and you let him do it.  I discovered, subsequently in life, that this was a practice of mine so that, for example, when I became the chancellor of the State University of New York [State University of New York System] which has sixty-four campuses, as soon as I took office, I then proceeded to visit all sixty-four campuses in the first ten months that I was there.  When I came here [New York, New York] to TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund], I took two days and visited every single floor in all three buildings and met all of the employees.  There are other incidences like this, but in writing about this I suddenly discovered that this was a habit or practice of mine that dates back to my childhood.  The Canary Islands was a wonderful place.  I lived there for--until I was ten, until I was ten years old.  It was a wonderful six years.  I became completely fluent and bilingual in Spanish, which I still am.  Most of my interaction was with the Spanish children.  As a matter of fact, my first Spanish friend, who lived directly across the street from us, is still a friend.  I talk to him on the telephone every other month.  He and his wife have been and visited our family here in the United States.  We've been to the Canary Islands and visited him and his family there.  But it's been a very close friendship ever since.  Another very dear friend of mine was my closest baby friend when I was in Liberia, who died not too long ago.  And his mother and my mother were good friends.  And he and I, when I was at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], he was at Tufts [Tufts College; Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts]; so we were friends.  We used to write music together.  But the Canary Islands was a wonderful experience for me.  But the entire experience of being the child of a U.S. diplomat living abroad, to a certain extent, completely insulated me from racism and discrimination here in the United States.  My mother tutored me through a correspondence course.  This correspondence course, which still exists, called the Calvert School in Baltimore [Maryland], was one where the lessons would be sent out by ship, it would take two weeks.  I would then do the lessons, and then take my exam and the exam and the lessons would come back to the teacher in Baltimore, and he or she, and in most cases it was a female, would then grade it, and then send it back and another two weeks and I'd get it.  I have all of those evaluations which is really quite enlightening.  But I did that for a number of years.  But then my parents decided that it was important for me to become Americanized and, quite frankly, many of the children of other diplomats would go home to go to school at about that age.  So I didn't see it as being quite unusual.  And so, I came back to the United States and lived with my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Pratt Hicks], but I didn't see my parents for three years.  And that was a period of time when I began and went--started going to school in Boston [Massachusetts], and then I entered Boston Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts] and was enrolled there for six years, which is a six-year program at Boston Latin School.  But, when my parents came back in 1939, that was the beginning of World War II [WWII], and so, the decision was made that my mother and then my three siblings, one of whom was born in the Canary Islands, another one was born in the United States and another one was born in--my baby sister [Mary Wharton Sampson] was born in Spain, would stay in the United States because it was very dangerous, and my father went back overseas.
Story_ID: 535879
Speaker 1: So it was extremely unusual for an African American to be in your father's [Clifford R. Wharton, Sr.] position and to travel abroad and--in the way in which he did.  Did you, did he bring any traditional African American customs with him?  I mean, did you celebrate Christmas the same way that the African Americans are doing here in the states or Thanksgiving or any traditional--
Speaker 2: Well, those are not African American traditions.  But, the--we would celebrate Christmas, we would celebrate Thanksgiving.  One of my joys as a youngster was that at Christmastime the Spaniards celebrate the Three Kings.  And so, I would get presents both for Christmas and for the Three Kings.
Story_ID: 535880
Speaker 1: One thing I should point out is that both my paternal grandfather [William Bowman Wharton] and my father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] do not look black, particularly my grandfather.  You would never realize he was black unless he told you, and he did.  The--interestingly, I recently found the documents indicating where they had enrolled for World War I [WWI].  And both my grandfather and my father were registered as black.  But you would not have known it unless they told you.
Speaker 2: So having said that, did--in tracing, do you know their makeup?  Do you know the history, like the mix of their--(unclear)--okay.
Speaker 1: Not in the usual sense, no.  But the--for me, the important thing was that, by the time I came back to the states, my observations and learning about the issues of race in America were, I think, to a great extent protected by the fact that I had not had that direct personal experience.  Although on one occasion, during the time when I came back for home leave, for a period of time I was enrolled in the fourth grade.  I was tested by the principal of the school.  And as I remember it, I tested at the seventh grade in reading and eighth grade in history and second grade in math and things like that.  So eventually they put me into the fourth grade.  And one of my experiences was my mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] told me that when I first went to school, she said, "Don't use any words that you never heard before."  And, accordingly to her, I came home that first day and I had a lexicon of all of the profanity that anyone could imagine.  And she would say to me, I'd say the words, she said, "Don't use that word."  And would say the word, "Don't use that word."  And finally, we got to the word screw, and I said, "Screw."  She said, "But what does that mean, like screwing into the wall?"  I said, "Well, I don't think so."  She said, "Well, don't use that word either."  But, during--because I was extremely good at reading, the teacher on one occasion, not too soon--not too long after I enrolled, a young classmate of mine was making mistakes in reading, so the teacher asked me to read that section, which I did.  And when I went out into the playground area at the break, this little boy came up to me and he called me and said, "You think you're just smart, but you're nothing but a nigger."  And I didn't know what he meant.  And so I came home and I asked my mother.  And she told me that this was a term that was used by whites to put you in a box.  And she said, said, "You're a Clifton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], you're black, but you're proud of who you are, and you should never let anybody put you into their box, because to make you inferior because of your race."  Now, keep in mind that during the time my mother tutored me, she always taught me a great deal about black history, although it was not part of the curriculum from the Calvert School [Baltimore, Maryland], so that I knew about all of the great people in black history in the United States, whether it was Banneker [Benjamin Banneker] or Frederick Douglass, and she went through all of these and explained about them, including my father.  So I recognized that here my father was a black historical figure.  And so, the result was I was quite comfortable in who I was.  And so, when she told me this, I said, "Okay, I understand."  But this meant that to a certain extent, I was inoculated in terms of my reaction to that aspect of racism in the United States.
Story_ID: 535881
Speaker 1: Well, at that time as a child when you were traveling around with your mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] and father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.], what were your dreams?  What were your aspirations?  What did you think you wanted to become (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wanted to become a diplomat like my father.  Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what did that mean to you?  What did you see your father as?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was one of my--he was my idol, you know.  He was--and--there are many stories about him, but quite frankly, he was--as I say, he was an extremely unusual person, very bright.  And despite the fact that he was to a great extent discriminated against in the early years in the [U.S.] Foreign Service because in those days anybody who became a diplomat, whether you passed the exam or were a direct admission of appointment, you were always sent to black posts.  And at one point, my father told the people in the state department [U.S. Department of State], "You're exporting American racism."  But he eventually broke through.  And one of the things that's very interesting is when they were going to appoint him to be the minister ambassador to Romania, he flew back to the state department, and it's quite a well-known story, and he met with the Loy Henderson [Loy W. Henderson], who was one of the greats in Foreign Service diplomacy, and he said, "Am I being appointed because I'm black or because I'm good?"  He said, "Because you're good enough, not because you're black."  And that's the way my father was.  He would not use race as a crutch to do things or to get ahead.  He had to do it on his merits.  And he was.  He was very, very good.  And he was highly respected by all of his peers.
Story_ID: 535882
Speaker 1: You said that you liked to read.  What were you reading during this time?
Speaker 2: Oh, Ulysses, Aeneas, everything.  I mean, I start--interestingly, I discovered when I was writing my autobiography that my mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] started teaching me reading when I was about three.  And she taught me to visualize words so that I would read more rapidly, which I did.  And one of the interesting anecdotes is that, I have my mother's diaries which go back from the period before I was born.  And in her diaries she describes what I was like as a student when she was teaching me.  And one of the stories is that she said that I was doing extremely well in all my lessons except arithmetic, and she could not understand why if I was so bright in everything else I could not do arithmetic.  And she told me, finally she said, "Visualize the numbers the way you visualize words."  And I tried and I couldn't do it.  And so finally she said, "Well, visualize.  Look at the clock."  And we had a beautiful banjo clock which I since inherited from her, and so, I visualized the clock.  But I had to stop and think, what comes after twelve?  Comes after twelve is one.  So I couldn't go beyond twelve and visualize any numbers.  And when I read this entry, entries in my mother's diary, I suddenly remembered, back to my childhood, what it was that happened.  And this sounds very strange, but to this day, the way I visualize a series of numbers is in the form of loops.  So it goes from 1 to 10, 10 to 20, 20 to 30.  And what happened was I realized as a child I broke open the circle of the clock.  By breaking it open, I could then visualize the numbers in sequence.  But I still visualize numbers in that way, and I hadn't reali- I wish that she were still alive because I could have told her what the problem was.  And then after that, she said I was doing very well.  She didn't realize what I had done to be able to visualize numbers.
Story_ID: 535883
Speaker 1: So you were spending a lot of time in different places.  Was there a parti- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it was primarily Liberia and then the Canaries for me [Canary Islands, Spain].
Speaker 1: Well, let's start with Liberia.  Can you talk to me about--
Speaker 2: No. I was what, two?
Speaker 1: Two?  Okay.  Then which place do you remember?  I guess Canary Islands?
Speaker 2: The Canary Islands.
Speaker 1: Can you talk to me about--create for me the neighborhood in which you lived, the street you lived on, who were the neighbors?
Speaker 2: It was a very nice, very nice neighborhood.  The neighborhood was comprised of Spanish families, as well as foreign.  There was an English family, there were some diplomats, a Brazilian family, Norwegians, French, but primarily Spanish.  The family that I mentioned that lived across the street, the Riveros, he--the father was a wholesaler in dry goods and the store--had a huge--he was very successful.  There were six boys and one girl.  And the youngest son [Ignacio Rivero y Noble] was my friend.  As a matter of fact, several years ago, my wife [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I went back to the Canary Islands and visited with my friend, and he had hosted a luncheon at the golf club where my father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] used to play golf and invited to the luncheon all of the boys who were still alive that had lived in that neighborhood, that we used to play with.  And we had the most marvelous, almost three-hour luncheon where we just reminisced about all the different things that we used to do.  But it was a wonderful experience for me because, as I say, not only did I learn Spanish, but it was a different culture in that sense, and we were close as friends, and we did a lot of things together.
Speaker 1: Now, was--now, you were homeschooled?  Your mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] was--
Speaker 2: Up until I came back to the states.
Speaker 1: Now, what about the other students?
Speaker 2: The same thing happened.
Speaker 1: So that was--was that commonplace at the time?
Speaker 2: There were no international schools and no American schools.  You have to remember, this is the 1930s.  So it's--it was a very different world.
Speaker 1: Because we were talking about that.  We were trying to figure out, you know, the diplomats' children.  Where did they go?  Were they all schooled together?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I did go to--part-time--to a French school while I was there.  And then my two brothers [William Wharton and Richard Wharton], who were left--who had stayed behind when I came to the states, they went to a German school for a period of time.  But it was primarily through a correspondence course.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My sister [Mary Wharton Sampson], who was born in Spain, she came back.  She was not in school when she was--she was about two when she came back.
Story_ID: 535884
Speaker 1: We'd spoke about one of your uncles who--I think it was an uncle who had a church [Wharton Memorial Baptist Church, Nelson, Virginia] named after him?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was a [paternal] great uncle, a great-great-great uncle, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A great-uncle?
Speaker 2: I don't know that much about him other than what I began to find out.
Speaker 1: But what I want to ask is how big was religion within your family, the immediate family?  I mean, in traveling abroad a lot, were you able to go to church?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  The--my mother's [Harriette Banks Wharton] family were Episcopalians, high Episcopalians.  The--we went to an Episcopal church in the Canary Islands [Spain].  Then when--then when--came back to the states, the--when my mother and my siblings came back and stayed, then we went to a Episcopal church in Boston [Massachusetts], primarily almost exclusively black.  I was confirmed, I became an acolyte, and that was an interesting experience.  So it was--yeah, it was part of the family tradition in that sense.
Speaker 1: What was interesting about the experience?
Speaker 2: Being involved that close to priests, and what was happening in a sense behind the scenes and all.  And also, there were a number of times in my life where I raised questions about religion.  I remember when I came back and I was being--I was going through confirmation and I couldn't understand.  I remember going to my mother and asking her how could I confess to a priest who was just another person, and why was it that he could give me absolution, you know.  And so, my mother tried to explain it to me, and I still couldn't understand it.  And then I sort of used him as an example of what I couldn't understand was the fact that my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Pratt Hicks], who had been divorced and remarried, could not take communion.  And I said, "Well, how can these priests who are not married understand what it's like being married?"  I mean I--and I raised these questions as a youngster, and I just could not understand these kinds of things.  So that--but I did have, from time to time--when I was a young person in the Canary Islands, I remember there's a practice, there used to be a practice there on a particular feast day when penitents would walk from the top of one of the mountains on their knees down to the main city, and they'd be all bloodied and so on.  And I remember asking my mother why would God allow them to do this to themselves.  And she tried to explain it to me, and I just couldn't understand that.  It didn't make sense to me.  And so, there were a lot of things I kept questioning about religion because I guess I was a curious person wanting answers, but.
Story_ID: 535885
Speaker 1: So what year do you arrive back in the states and start (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen thirty-nine [1939].
Speaker 1: --and start to attend Boston Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can we talk about the school, the teachers that were there?  Were there any teachers that made impressions on you?
Speaker 2: Every year I had at least two or three that were tremendous teachers.  It was a great school, very tough, highly competitive.  Entry was competitive across the whole span of Boston [Massachusetts].  In those days, the primary schools in Boston were excellent no matter where you lived.  And the result was that the classes were--I once told a reporter--were made up of people from all income levels, all racial and ethnic groups.  So that the smartest kid in French could be a middle-class Jewish kid.  And the smartest kid in math could be a poor Irish kid.  So, I mean, it was all mixed up.  But, to give you an example of the competitiveness, of all of the students who entered in Boston Latin School in my class, only 42 percent graduated.  The result was that, among us there was a very strong bond, and my wife [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] was the one who pointed this out to me.  When I would go to--I've gone to reunions both at Boston Latin and Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], et cetera, but she said the Boston Latin School reunions are very special because we all are very close and we know each other.  Actually, the spouses know each other, too.  And the interesting thing is, in thinking about it, I realize that, first of all, we went to Boston Latin School for six years before our preteen years, right through teens, a very substantial number of us went on to Harvard.  So, you have ten years in which we had associations and relationships.  Moreover, the interesting--you do not find Boston Latin graduates being arrogant about their having met the competition intellectually.  They're just not that kind of people.  But they're outstanding individuals.  So that you--and you're steeped in this from the time you enter the school, because in the auditorium they have around the frieze the names of the graduates, like Benjamin Franklin and the Adamses and so on; they're all graduates of Boston Latin School.  But, you're proud of that, but you don't--they're not people.  And so, for example, Leonard Bernstein is a graduate, and there a lot of outstanding graduates.  And so, I was very--of the different awards and recognitions that I've had, one of the ones that I treasure is that in 1970 I was chosen as the Boston Latin School Man of The Year.  They don't call it that anymore because it's man, and now it's bi- it's both boys and girls.  But, that was meaningful to me, yeah, um-hm.

Speaker 1: So, during the years at Boston Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts], you said there were several teachers that had inspired you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you name just one or two of them and--
Speaker 2: There are lots.  There are lots.  There was a wonderful French teacher, Max Levine who had a reputation that every student who studied French with him--you could study French for several years--would achieve a level of performance in your college boards that would exceed the requirements for your French language requirement in college.  Every single class did.  And he was a wonderful, wonderful teacher.  And I had a marvelous reaction when I went back to Boston Latin School many years later, and I discovered his name was on the frieze then.  But, I also had a great teacher in Latin named Cray.  Great teacher.  I had a great teacher in--Russo [ph.], in English.  I mean, these are names that people would remember.  And one of the more humorous ones at this point was a professor, teacher I had, (laughter) who--he used to--he would--he was very tough, and you sat alphabetically.  And he would start at the front seat and you'd stand up and you'd translate.  If you made a mistake, he'd sit you down and give you a zero.  And the next boy had to stand up and correct the error made.  And if he didn't correct it he got a zero.  He'd go up and down the class in this way.  And (laughter) so, because I'm W,  I'm sitting in the front, and I'm just praying he doesn't, you know, get to me.  Well, when my mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] came back to the states in 1939--keep in mind, by that time I was in my first year of high school, and I was studying with this teacher.  And she discovered that I didn't know Latin.  She'd taught Latin, she knew Latin.  So she goes up to the teacher and she tells him, said, "You know, Clifton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] is very much afraid of you and doesn't know Latin, he's just using his memory.  He has a very good memory and he's just using his memory."  He said, "Really?"  She said, "Yes."  And so, he said, "Well, I tell what I'll do, Mrs. Wharton," he says.  "Every day I'm going to call him first in class and then I'll send you a note home telling you how he did."  And I was devastated, devastated.  And, of course, that's what happened.  Now, fast forward.  Many years later I was asked to give the keynote speech at the 350th anniversary of Boston Latin School.  Keep in mind that Boston Latin School was founded before Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And so, I was in Boston [Massachusetts] in this huge auditorium; a huge hotel ballroom.  And as part of my speech I told this story, and--about Roche, his name was Roche.  And so, after the speech--oh, when I told the story, everybody in the place roared.  They all knew Roche.  They knew exactly what I was talking about.  And so, afterwards another one of my classmates, who I guess was a year behind me, who eventually became president of Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts], he comes up to me and he said, he said, "Cliff," he says, "You know, Roche is still alive."  I said, "Really?"  He said, "Yeah."  He said, "Let me give you his address."  So he gave me his address.  So I sent Roche a copy of my speech.  And he wrote back a most wonderful letter in which one of the things he said was, he said, he used to worry a great deal about perhaps he was too hard on the boys.  He said, but seeing how I and the others had made out you know (laughter).  It was a wonderful, wonderfully thoughtful letter.
Story_ID: 535887
Speaker 1: But there was so many, I--as I say, I don't think--there was never a year in which I did not have two or three absolutely magnificent teachers.  But they were tough.  I mean, there was no question about it, but they were--they cared about the boys, they cared about their learning, and they set a standard, an expectation that you must excel.  It was not should you or shouldn't you.  You were expected to.  That was part of their culture.  And, but because people--the students came from all over the city, you competed.  And I returned many years later.  What happened was, when I graduated from Boston Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts], and most high schools, they give out prizes, and so--.  Oh, I should also explain.  We had monthly, every class had declamation.  You were to memorize a piece and then you would stand in front of the class, you declaim it, be it poetry or a speech or what have you.  The winner in each homeroom would then go and compete in the auditorium at your class level.  Each class would compete, and then there would be an overall winner.  And I never won.  So at graduation they were giving out prizes, and suddenly I hear my named called out.  And the prize that I won, they announced that I had--was graduating without ever having received a misdemeanor mark.  Now, misdemeanor mark, if you don't do your homework or if you'd talk in class, I mean you'd get a misdemeanor mark, if you get six, you get a censure.  And there were all kinds of penalties involved in it.  And they said I'd graduated without any misdemeanor marks.  And, of course, my classmates all booed and the parents cheered.  And what happened was, the parents didn't understand that, if you got less than, I think, three or something like that in a month, they wiped them out.  So, I--you know, so I was absolutely devastated, but then I said to myself, I said, "I--one of these days I'm going to get back, I'm going to be on that stage to speak."  And I'd come back from Asia, and I'd promised my wife I wasn't going to accept any more speaking engagements for a while, that I had things to do.  And I received an invitation to speak at a high school concordat (unclear) from all high schools, all over Massachusetts was going to be held at Boston Latin School.  And they wanted me to talk about my experience.  And I said, "Oh, really."  So I said to my wife, to Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], I said, "I really would like to go back to get on that stage."  Well, when I went back, as I walked up the steps of Boston Latin, the then headmaster greeted me at the top of the steps.  He gave me a certificate of approbation, which you'd get it every month, and then he introduced me.  And I told the students in the audience this story.  And, of course, half of the audience were Boston Latin School students.  And when I told them this, I said, "And I always vowed I'd be back on this stage one day to give a speech."  They just clapped and carried on.  But I told the reporters--they asked me what was my most--what subject did I like most and what I learned the most.  And I said, "It wasn't the subject."  I said, "What I learned was that innate ability is randomly distributed in society, because these students came from all over, but they were bright, and they had the talent and they did it.  And they accomplished it."  So it was a wonderful experience for me.

Speaker 1: What was the process in getting into Boston Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Recommendation from the--your school principal and your grades, um-hm, in those days (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, where did your recommendation come from because --
Speaker 2: I was in a sixth grade for part of the year [at Henry L. Higginson Elementary School, Boston, Massachusetts] when I came back, um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: And that was enough to get your recommendation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So at this time, now then, did you still want to be a diplomat like your father [Clifford R. Wharton, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you have any idea how you'd pursue it?  Pursue the road?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean at this time, in high school.
Speaker 2: Other than going to college, yeah, yeah.  But in Latin School, I also--I went out for track and became something of a track star in Boston [Massachusetts].  And in my senior year, I was captain of the track team.  Broke a couple of records in high jump and things like that.  But--oh, another story which is that, on one occasion, my father was on home leave--on consultation, they do not call them leave--and my father had gone to English High [English High School, Boston, Massachusetts], which is a competitor of Boston Latin, okay.  So it's English and Latin.  And there was a young man who--from English, whose times in that particular race that I was also running that year, were always better than mine.  And I knew I could not beat this boy.  And, my father went to this race.  It was the first time he had ever seen me run.  And they had--it was indoors, and they had--at each corner of the room they had banks that you would run on in order to be able to make the turns.  And my father was at the third bank just before the finish line.  And we start off, and this boy just--English High boy, he just pulled out ahead of me, and I was chasing him all around.  And when I hit the third bank--if you're in track, you realize that you do not hear the crowd, you don't hear anything when you're running.  But when I hit that bank, I did hear my father yell at me and he said, "Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], go get him."  And this young man, he pulled out a little bit as he was heading for the finish line, and I passed him on the inside and I beat him.  And I did that every single race against him the rest of the year.  It was riotous.  But that was quite an event, but I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were in high school, where was your father?
Speaker 2: In Spain.  But then he was also in the Azores [Portugal], he was also in Madagascar.
Speaker 1: Now, were you able to visit him back and forth?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: You didn't visit at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he--how did you communicate with him?
Speaker 2: By letters.
Speaker 1: By letters?
Speaker 2: Letters.
Speaker 1: Letters.  And can you briefly tell me what sorts of things you were corresponding about with him?
Speaker 2: Well, he would send me--very often he would send me photographs of what he was doing on different events, which I still have, um-hm, yeah.  And he always would be writing me about what was happening.
Story_ID: 535889
Speaker 1: Now, were you in the student government at all?
Speaker 2: Where?
Speaker 1: At Boston Latin S- [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They didn't have a, not really a student government.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the only extracurricular activity you did was (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, I had a lot.  I had the French club, the history club, you know, things like that.  No.  They had a lot of different things.
Speaker 1: So the history club, was that your--the start of your love with history, being in the history club?
Speaker 2: No, no.  It was just something I thought I was interested in, so I tried it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So graduation, you graduate Boston Latin in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-three [1943].
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-three [1943].  And talk to me about the process of getting into Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or deciding that Harvard was the place you want to go.
Speaker 2: Well, in that era, you had--you could only submit three applications to three schools and you had to rank them.  You had to indicate which was your first choice, second choice and third choice.  Consequently, you worried about giving a ranking to a particular school because they might feel insulted that they were not your first choice.  For some reason, I was interested in Bowdoin [Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine].  A classmate of mine, who was a year ahead of me and whose family I knew, had gone there and he liked it.  And it's--I just thought it was kind of a neat place.  I had never been there, never visited.  My mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] wanted me to go to Harvard, apply to Harvard.  But she also said, "You should apply to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] because your mother and father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] are alumni."  So I went ahead and made those three applications.  Well, it turned out that I was admitted to Bowdoin and BU [Boston University] and then I was admitted to Harvard as well.  So I had all three.  And, but that's what happened.
Speaker 1: How had you ranked them?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I don't remember. Yeah.  My guess is that I probably ranked BU third, and probably Bowdoin second, and Harvard first would be my guess.  I don't know.
Story_ID: 535890
Speaker 1: You're accepted into Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you--talk to me about life on campus, the first year as a freshman at Harvard University in 1943 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the first year or most of the first year, I lived at home and commuted.  Keep in mind, by this time it's wartime.  And Harvard introduced a system where you had instead of just two semesters, you had three semesters a year.  This enabled people who went to the [U.S.] Armed Forces and then came back, could catch up or could take courses beforehand.  You could take more than the normal level in order to sort of adjust to whatever might happen.  So I began in June after graduation [from Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts] to go--started at Harvard.  After, I think two semesters, then my mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] felt that I should live in the dorms.  So we did.  I moved into the dorms to Adams House.  And the--my roommate, my first roommate was Harold May who was the--who was a twin and son of a minister from Poughkeepsie [New York].  But he--yeah, and he was my first roommate.  But then we had an extra bed.  There were three--it was supposed to be three in this room.  And I kind of figured out--I knew why the bed was empty.  So I went to the secretary of the dorm who's in charge of it.  And I said, "You know," I said, "We've got an empty bed."  And there was tremendous demand for beds because they had the V-12 [V-12 Navy College Training Program], the ASTP [Army Specialized Training Program] program there which was taking up a lot of the dorms at Harvard.  So I said, "You know," I said, "I'm bilingual in Spanish.  I'd love to have a Spanish roommate," you know.  And I knew I was breaking the stereotypes for them.  But it turned out that there was entering a scholarship student from Mexico whose father had emigrated from Spain during the civil war, and he was Basque, and a great soccer player named Carlos Blanco.  So, they asked him if he wouldn't mind being our roommate.  So he said, "Great."  So he moved in, so we had a roommate.  We became dear friends.  I'm still in touch with him and so on, and also with Harold.  But that was the experience of moving into Adams House.
Speaker 1: Were there--how many black students were in Harvard?
Speaker 2: There were only--ultimately, for that class only four, which is very similar to my father's [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] class in BU in law school [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts], which in those days--keep in mind, it's interesting; the areas of greatest problem of discrimination for admission to Harvard were not just they may have had a quota on the number of blacks, but they also had problems, more problems for the Jewish students.  And so, that for the Jewish students to try to compete and to get in was very tough.  So that if you didn't have a Jewish name and you came from Kansas City [Missouri], you had a better chance of getting admitted than if you had a Jewish name and you came from Brooklyn [New York].  I mean, it was one of those--really, it was a very interesting problem.  The other aspect of it is that all of us were not seen as special admits.  Quite the reverse.  We were not the result of affirmative action.  Quite the reverse.  So that the black students who were there were there because they were so good.  It wasn't because they had--they were given special dispensation.  So it was a different environment in that sense.
Story_ID: 535891
Speaker 1: What else can you tell me about the environment of the students in, on campus, the interaction with the other--with the larger population?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was--I found it interesting, the experience of living in the dorms was very good.  Made a lot of friends.  I then went to--I joined the radio station, became an announcer, and then production director, which is a great experience in terms of speech and learning how to be certain (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you still have an announcer's voice (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, I don't know about that.  But that fun.  And, as a matter of fact, many of the persons who were with me at that time became quite successful.  For example, Marty Bookspan [Martin Bookspan], who is on WQXR [WQXR Radio] in New York [New York], he was--we were there together.  And the--another person who wasn't on the radio station but used to use the station was John Simon, the one who the--the critic.  But there were a lot of people who were involved in different ways, who subsequently had careers related to or involved in radio.  But it was--that was one interesting thing.  I went out for track also.  I was doing extremely well and then I pulled a hamstring.  And in those days they didn't know how to handle those.  So after that I just couldn't do very well.  The--but you had an exposure at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] which was quite broad to a universe of both courses as well as extracurricular activities that enabled you to sample, to deal with things that might be of interest to you in life.  I then went and joined an organization called, the New England Student Christian Movement, which had quite an influence on me at the time.  I was on, I guess, a couple of student--oh, two student organizational committees, dealing with international work.  My major was in history, but I concentrated on U.S. diplomatic history.  I had a tough time in history courses.  Got my--one of my worst courses, my grades in the first semester in history, but I still was going to major in history.  The only reason I majored in history was I felt that it was a better preparation for entering the [U.S.] Foreign Service, and that was my reason for taking it.  I had some interesting experiences.  One of them was that I decided to take a course in Spanish and the reason was very simple.  I spoke Spanish but I never studied it.  So I didn't know grammar.  I didn't know structure.  I just could speak.  And we had a great teacher whose name was Robert Jordan Carner. And it was alleged that he was the character who Hemingway [Ernest Hemingway] used for 'Whom the Bells Toll' [sic. 'For Whom The Bell Tolls'].  He always denied it, but anyway--but he used to love to tell jokes in class in Spanish.  And one day he told a joke which was kind of an off-colored joke, and you had to know the language very well.  And I was the only person in class that broke out laughing.  So he said, "May I see you after class?"  And I said, "Oh, oh.  Okay."  So I go up to see him, and he said, "Where did you prepare?"  So I said, "Boston Latin [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts]."  He said, "Did you ever take any intensive language training?"  And I said, "No."  Then I said to him in Spanish, "No, I didn't, but I can speak Spanish."  He said, "Aha."  So I then said, "Well."  I explained to him, I said, "I know the language, but I never studied it."  He said, "Well, that's just no different than anybody else.  If you speak English you've got to know the grammar."  So he allowed me to take the course.  And it was wonderful.  But the sequel to this is that, just before the final exam, we were sitting in the exam room, we had our books and they gave us the blue books that you used to take exams in.  And I suddenly remembered a highly irregular verb.  So I turned the book over and in the back page I started writing this irregular verb.  My book happened to be open.  And the invigilator saw me, and he thought I was copying something out of the book and then putting it into the blue book.  So he came down, took my blue book, took my book and took it to the front and had me sit up in the front.  And he let me take the exam and he kept looking through the book during the exam trying to find this verb, but he couldn't find it.  So when Carner came back to pick up the papers, the invigilator said, "This young man was cheating."  And he told Carner what I'd done.  And Carner looked at the verb and he said, "You didn't find it in the book, did you?"  And he said, "No," he said, "but it must be in there."  Carner said, "No, it's not in the book."  So then he turned, Carner turns to me and start saying in Spanish, he said, "I should have put that in the book, and then you would have been in trouble, you know," and I was answering him.  And the invigilator could not realize this.  So then Carner turned to the man and he said, "Listen," he said, "Mr. Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], he speaks perfect Spanish."  He said, "He didn't cheat, you know.  He didn't have to."  But it was just one of those cases where I learned then even the appearance is something you need to be careful of.  But, but I had an interesting time at Harvard.
Story_ID: 535892
Speaker 1: What did those years at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], looking back, what did those years prepare you for as far as your future career?  What do you think you took away from Harvard?
Speaker 2: It's interesting.  I think that more than anything else it was the opportunity to interact and become familiar with, if not friendly with, a number of individuals who you stayed in touch with in later life, who became significant leaders, or in different fields.  And that's really quite interesting.  That was much more so than the question of the specific course preparation.  There are different things you learned, but that was base.  But the contacts and friendships were quite considerable.  And, for example, I'll give you a couple other.  When I was on the board of the Rockefeller Foundation and we were going to hire a new president, the person we hired was a classmate of mine.  And I was one of two people on the board that knew him.  I didn't--I wasn't on the nominating committee, but--. When I became chancellor of the State University of New York [State University of New York System], the chairman of the search committee was a Harvard classmate of mine who I didn't know at Harvard.  But it was a contact.  When I was on the board of--it was a case of where these individuals have roles that they interacted and then they moved in terms of leadership roles.  And it made--Jack Lemmon, was in my class, Tom Blair Lehrer was in my class.  There were many who were classmates.  And your degree of interaction with them varied.  But you didn't become friends just because you expected them to become leaders.  You became friends because they were people who were active, and that was the way it worked.
Story_ID: 535893
Speaker 1: We will continue with Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], but one of the significant things at Harvard is meeting your wife.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Right.  Well, the--during the Harvard years, of course, I--by this time, I was also dating a number of different people.  And one of my childhood friends was a young woman named Elizabeth Fitzgerald, she and her sister Barbara [Barbara Fitzgerald], who were good friends.  Their parents are good friends of my parents [Harriette Banks Wharton and Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] in Boston [Massachusetts].  And Betty enrolled as a freshman when I was a sophomore at Harvard.  And so, she wanted me to take her cousin, Dolores Duncan [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], to a Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] event, dance.  And Dolores at that time was a senior in high school in Danbury, Connecticut.  And I actually had met Dolores before, although there's always an interesting byplay between us as to whether this was a first blind date or not, because I didn't believe in blind dates, but, at any rate, so I agreed that I would take Dolores as a--to the Radcliffe dance.  And she was an absolutely stunning young lady.  And we got along all right, but I didn't date her again.  And I didn't date her again until several years later.  By that time I was working in New York [New York] with Nelson Rockefeller.  And that's another story which we can get into.  But that was an interesting event.  However, she and I corresponded.  And then my roommate Harold [Harold May] would date her occasionally.  But I didn't date her.  But that's another part of the story we can get into later.
Speaker 1: So, but--did the black students that were in your class, it was you, Harold--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and who were the other two?
Speaker 2: Oh, Jackson [William Jackson], Ernie Howell [Ernest M. Howell].  Ernie Howell is--Jackson is passed--but Ernie Howell, he's here in New York.  Ernie has had an outstanding career, and he's--works in a Wall Street brokerage firm here.  But he also was very outstanding with The Asia Foundation in Asia and so on.  Um-hm, yeah.
Story_ID: 535894
Speaker 1: Continuing to move forward, you receive your B.A. in history from Howard in 1947--
Speaker 2: Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Harvard.
Speaker 1: Harvard, sorry.  Harvard (laughter).  In 1947.  Let me just ask you since I made that flub, did you ever consider at that time--had you ever considered or what were your thoughts about black universities [HBCUs]?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.  It didn't even come up.
Speaker 1: So 1947 you graduate Harvard.  What are your plans?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew that I needed more training to be prepared to take the [U.S.] Foreign Service exam.  And so, at that time, there was a--Fletcher School [The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy] at Tufts [Tufts College; Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts] was one of them, and the other one was a brand new school which had been started by a man who had been the dean at Fletcher, and he began the School of Advanced International Studies [Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies] in Washington, D.C.  And so, I applied.  And then many years later I learned that this (laughter) created quite a controversy in the school.  The school had been asked by some black members of the board of education where they were receiving their certificate to grant degrees, whether they would admit blacks.  And they said yes, if any qualified ones applied.  And my application shows up that I was the son of a career Foreign Service officer, had majored in and had a degree cum laude in history, had lived abroad, spoke Spanish, and I also had a partial Foreign Service Association [American Foreign Service Association] scholarship, plus my G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944]; we haven't talked about my wartime period but--in Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama].  But, so here I am, my application comes in.  They didn't know what to do.  In Washington then was segregated, the school building was the building in which housed the students' dormitories, dining rooms, library, classrooms; all in one building, and it was in Washington, which was segregated.  And, so they finally admitted me.  And so, I was the first black admitted to the school.  It was very interesting because for a period of time when I would go to the dining room to meals, I would sit down at a table and sometimes two or three people would get up and leave.  The environment was one in which there were some students who were very friendly and others who were not.  Didn't have any problem with most of the teachers that I can recall.  But this was the first time in my academic career when I decided I would not have any extracurricular activities.  I used to be great on that sort of thing.  And I decided to concentrate on my studies because I knew that as the first, I could, if I failed, then that would have a negative impact on anybody else that might want to apply.  So I decided I was going to concentrate on my studies, which I did.  And when I finished, the head--not the head of the school, but one of my professors leaned over and he said, he said, "You know, you had the second highest score of anybody in this class."  I was one of the youngest people in class.  But, by the time I finished, there was no reaction at all; quite the reverse.  As a matter of fact, there was one student who came up to me afterwards, he said that, he said, "You know, I used to hate you because you were black, and then I hated you because you were smarter than I was." He said, "And then I got to like you."  He said, "I realized." He said, "When I go back, I'm going to fight on the issue."  I was very proud.  I said, "Thank you very much."  But it was a very interesting experience.  It was nothing like the experience I had as a cadet at Tuskegee.  That was very different.  That was out-and-out, at times, really tough racism, yeah.
Story_ID: 535895
Speaker 1: When were you at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama]?  What years?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-five [1945].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, let's talk about those years.  How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, you were being drafted in those days.  And so, I learned that if you allowed yourself to be drafted, all the blacks were being put into very menial jobs or even in jobs in which you were in harm's way.  And I learned that you could also enlist and apply to go to--to be considered to go to Tuskegee to enlist and to be a pilot.  So that's what I did.  And I went to--I had a number of interesting experiences.  My first experience was, I arrived in Biloxi, Mississippi. And keep in mind that you are processed in segregated fashion.  And in those days, the forms that you filled out when you enlisted were always kept in a sealed envelope, were only seen by the officers where you were going.  And I was going down the line after I arrived, and I should explain.  There was another chap who was with me named Edgar Williams who was eighteen years old and had just graduated from Howard University [Washington, D.C.] with a summa cum laude in math, and myself, and we're going through alphabetically--and the officer, the sergeant opened up the form.  He was passing it down the table and he gets to my form, and he looks, and he said, "Where did this--how did this get in here?"  And then he looked up at me, and he said, "Where did you have this filled out?"  And I said, "Fort Devens, Massachusetts."  He said, "You can be court marshaled for lying, for falsification of your forms."  And I said, "Well, what's wrong with the form?"  And he was getting more and more incensed and angry.  And there was an officer sitting in the well in the back and he heard this commotion and he came over, and he asked the sergeant, he said, "What's wrong?"  He said, "Well, this here recruit," he said, "has falsified his form."  So the officer looks at the form, he said, "What's wrong?"  He said, "Well, he couldn't speak all these languages and visited all these countries and he's eighteen and a half years old, and is already a junior going to a senior year at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]."  And officer said, "You went to Harvard?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "Did you live in the dorms?"  I said, "Yes."  He said, "Which one?"  I said, "Adams House."  He said, "How is Dr. Little these days?"  And that was the headmaster.  And he said to the sergeant, he said, "I guess this is okay."  Well, he knew Harvard, and he knew Adams House, he knew what it was.  And that got me through.  So I leaned over to Edgar, I said, (laughter) "Wait until he sees your forms."  I mean, but--and he just threw it down on the table.  But that was my first exposure.
Story_ID: 535896
Speaker 1: Then when we got to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama], the officers were mixed.  They had both whites and blacks.  The black officers, by in large, were those who had come back being with the Red Tails overseas, who were great.  But a lot of the officers also were white, and some of them were out-and-out racists.  And it was quite, quite, quite something to be immersed into that kind of situation, largely because you had no direct control.  You were subjected to these individuals.  And they would--sometimes they would come into the dormitory at night and would harass you.  They were officers and you had to take it.  And there was one officer in particular who one night, was quite almost drunk, and he identified me and came over and gets all under my face, and I'm standing at attention, and he said, he says, "You're smarter than me, aren't you?"  And he knew who I was. I said, "No.  No, sir."  He said, "I think you're a smartass."  I said, "No, sir."  He said, "I order you to say I'm smarter than you are (laughter)."  So I said, I said, "I'm smarter than you."  And he said, "Goddamn it."  He was--it was a very--I mean he has your life in a sense in his hands, and there you are, you're being sort of treated in this fashion.  But it was quite something.  I had a test pilot who I'll never forget as long as I live.  This was when I was in primary and my first test.  And my classmates would get in with him, fly up in a pattern, clear it, and the plane would make one maneuver, fly, and then come right back down.  And then he'll say, "You're washed out there."  And the next kid would get in, go up, same thing would happen.  By the third time, I said to the ones who were there, I said, "What is he doing?"  He said, "He gets you up there and he starts and he starts cursing at you and calling you racial epithets and the rest of it."  And I said, "Really?"  He said, "Yeah."  He said, "And you get so angry, you yell back at him."  So I said to myself, what on Earth am I going to do.  So I got into the plane with him on my turn, and then we went up, and sure enough, he started in.  And I made up my mind then he is not going to wash me out.  So I just pushed my earphones back, and I would follow his instructions.  I will not repeat what he said.  I mean it was just some of the vilest things I ever heard in my life; black and--I just did everything, everything, everything.  So then we landed and he looked at me and he says, "You pass."  And that was it.  But I'll never forget the control that it took to not react adversely, because it takes a lot of control in those circumstances.  And--but he washed out people who were very, very good.  I mean, no question about it.  But it was an intriguing experience.  What happened was that I was in basic, and then I was going to go to advanced when the war [World War II, WWII] ended.  And we were given a choice of staying in for three years or going back, leaving.  And I said, "I'm going back to school," and I went back [to Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  But it was a very interesting experience.  And--but I had great--as I said, we had some great, great classmates.  Great classmates.  My roommate, Harold [Harold May], he was in the next class after me.  And my cousin, Murdock [Murdock Wharton], who is the great-grandson of the one that I mentioned to you who was a clergyman, he was there.  He was there.  Yeah.  But it was an interesting group.  The group were invariably highly selected because it was only one place for them to be trained.  And so, the result was, we used to say that better pilots were washed out at Tuskegee than even passed, than most of the rest of the entire [U.S.] Air Force training.  And that was probably true.  It was probably true.  Very well, I mean in my class, there were groups, we used to call us the Warm Ws.  One was a student at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Williams [Edgar Williams], myself, and others [Alfred Woodland and William White].  It was just a very top group, and that's one of the reasons I think why they were so, so successful.
Story_ID: 535897
Speaker 1: After you returned from Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama] to--you--
Speaker 2: To Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: To Harvard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I continued to study.
Speaker 1: And you continued to study.  Any effects--any effects from Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Probably a--the awareness of the significance of racism as an adult.  As a child it's one thing, but as an adult to see that kind of an environment.  And it made me conscious of what individuals, all of us in those days, had to go through in order to succeed.  And it was very much in line with the old adage in terms of what you learned from your parents, grandparents in terms of having to succeed.  The--I remember one time I went back to Boston Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts] to double check on my grades, and I happened (laughter) to see that in my first year in class six, which was the equivalent of seventh grade, I'd flunked Latin in my--in one of the first or second or third months.  And I'd gone home with this grade and my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Pratt Hicks] just lit into me.  And she got a tutor for me and all the rest of it.  And then, I saw this (laughter), then I also remembered that a few months later I saw where I'd gotten an A, and I came home to my grandmother, and I said, she said, "What is that?"  I said it was an 85.  My grandmother said, she said, "Did anybody in the class get a higher grade?"  I mean, that was my grandmother.  And so, you know, you had to, you know, not just--you had to be the best, and that was her mantra.  And it was a very--but all of that, when you are in the setting where it's strongly racist, not totally, but strongly, you recognize the incredible importance of the need to have the level of human competence in capital that enables you to, not only to overcome, but exceed the negatives that exist in any situation.  And that was very important.  But, I'm--very often I'm asked by young people do I experience aspects of racism at some of the levels that I have been at.  I say, yes.  And sometimes they're shocked to find that that's true.  I say, "Sure.  But that's not something that you're going to spend time worrying about.  You just go ahead and you do what you're able to do in terms of excellence and it quiets down in no time, flat."  But that was--the impact there was quite considerable in giving me a direct personal exposure to it in an environment where you could see the effects of it.  It also helped me understand why there are so many blacks, behave in a particular way, react in a particular way, and in an antisocial way.  It's--you can understand why if you have that miasma constantly around you.  It's not an easy thing to live with.
Speaker 1: So, we were just talking about, just speculating what your father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] possibly had experienced; was it equal to what you experienced in Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I really don't know.  I think undoubtedly he experienced it.  The difference is that, I think, people were not always initially aware that he was black.  Plus, my father, he had a basic philosophy of not liking hyphenated Americanism.  He just thought that that was the wrong issue to deal with.  And, while I didn't completely agree with him, I understood why he had that view.  But he was--I know that he experienced it, no question about it.  The fact that he would go back to speak to Loy Henderson [Loy W. Henderson] and ask him "Was this being given to me because I was black?" That's what he said, he didn't want it if it was going to be just because he was black.  I think that's quite very much my father.  Not that he was denying blackness, but he was saying, that's not the criterion that you have to--you should use in terms of the determination of whether a person wants it or not or should be given this position.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have any personal conversations with him about your experience in Tuskegee, what you'd ex- (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no.
Speaker 1: No?  Okay.
Story_ID: 535898
Speaker 1: Let's just go back to those years at John--Johns Hopkins University [at the School of Advanced International Studies; Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.].  Were you--in that was, again, I guess you were somewhat prepared because--for the racism aspect because you'd experienced it at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it was not intense in that way, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what did they do with you as far as your dorm life on campus?
Speaker 2: Oh, I lived in the dorms.  Yeah, yeah.  As a matter of fact, it got to the stage where after a while, I sort of forgot that I was in segregated Washington, D.C.  And one of my favorite stories is that--although we haven't talked about it--I was involved in the founding of the U.S. National Student Association.  And at the time--at the founding convention, constitutional convention, I was the national secretary, and a man from Texas, University of Texas, was the president.  And he had gotten married and he came to Washington on his honeymoon and was staying at the Willard Hotel [Willard InterContinental, Washington, D.C.], and he called me to come down and have dinner.  And I forgot I was in Washington, so I go down to the Willard and I go into the lobby, I go over to the phone, I called their room and they weren't in.  So then I went and sat down, which was a big mistake.  And so, everybody in the room, in the lobby was looking at me, and finally a clerk comes over and he asked me who I was, what was I doing there.  And I'm explaining who I was and I was waiting for my friends and so on.  And he was getting ready to throw me out of the hotel, and just then my friend and his wife came in and they saw what was happening, so they grabbed me and took me out of the hotel.  And, of course, the story, the point of the story is that, many years later, the Willard Hotel closed and was not operating.  Then there was the decision made to reopen it and they needed to get funding for the reopening.  And they came to an organization called TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York] to get the funding (laughter).  And I was not involved in the decision because I discovered this at one of my first meetings at Teachers, of the investment committee and I was looking at the minutes.  And I said, "You mean to tell me we made a loan to the Willard Hotel?"  They said, "Yes."  I said, "Boy," I said.  "That's the place that tried to throw me out when I was a young man."  And it indicated to me something about the fact that there has been progress in that sense; that is, here, this organization that wanted to throw me out now is coming to get funds from an organization which is headed by a black.  But, but that was--it was an interesting experience, an interesting experience.
Story_ID: 535899
Speaker 1: So let's step back.  Let's talk about you founding the government--the stu- I mean the--
Speaker 2: The Student Association [U.S. National Student Association] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Stu- the Student Association.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Well, one of my roommates at that point was William Ellis, whose brother Courtland [Courtland Ellis] and I had been track stars together, younger brother.  And Bill had been--Bill is also Latin School [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts], but he was two or three years ahead of us.  And Bill had been a member of a group that had gone to Europe to a meeting of the International Union of Students [IUS].  And at this meeting, the American students were surprised to discover that the United States was the only country that did not have a national student organization.  So they came back and wanted--they decided that they should explore whether or not there should be established a national student association in the United States.  So they were going to convene a meeting at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And they contacted all of the universities and suggested that they should elect delegates to come to this preliminary meeting to decide.  At Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], they had, I think it was, they had four delegates; one was a graduate student, and three undergraduates.  And at this point, my roommate was not Bill Ellis, but I said--I guess he was.  I said, "You know, this is something that would be interesting for me to get into."  So I decided I would run for the election.  And one of the reasons I think I was elected was the fact that I was by that time well-known, because I was a radio announcer on the student radio station [WHRV Radio; WHRB Radio, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  At any rate, so I went to the preliminary conference at the University of Chicago.  And another one of my classmates had been in the group that went to Czechoslovakia [Czech Republic and Slovakia] to the IUS, was Douglass Cater.  He and I became good friends years later in different ways, but he went to work in the White House [Washington, D.C.] with Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] and he became a reporter for The Reporter magazine; things like that.  But, at any rate, at that meeting which I participated in, I was elected secretary of the continuing committee, which is where this chap was president.  And we then had our constitutional convention at the University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] in 1947.  And that was fascinating because it was--there were a lot issues that we dealt with.  We dealt with issues dealing with the status of students, the rights to students, with internationalism, with civil rights.  We had the predominately black schools and the predominately, exclusively white schools in the South, and that almost broke up the meeting.  And I was very much involved in negotiating a compromise to solve the problem.  And--but I became very much attuned to the politicking of student organizations and how you work these things out.  And, again, many of the people who were at that meeting, in later life became incredibly well-known.  The--but, and to give you one little example.  When I was having my confirmation hearings in the U.S. Senate over being appointed deputy secretary of state, one of the members of the committee was Senator Paul Simon.  And Paul, when it came time for him to speak or ask any questions, he said, he said, "Dr. Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.]," he says, "do you still know how to hunt (laughter)?"  And he talked about the lion hunt.  I used to use a lion hunt to break the crowd down and he said, "Do you still do a lion hunt?"  Well, that just broke me up.  I mean, but here was--he had been at the convention.  He knew who I was.  It was a tremendous group of people who were involved in that founding.  And we had just issued an anthology, huge, huge anthology.  I think more than eighty or ninety of us had written chapters in the book, sort of for the first five years, the founding and the first five years of the organization.  But in that group, we've had, I think it's four or five university presidents, I don't know how many ambassadors, judges, congressmen, senators, governors.  I mean its--and they've all--the interesting thing about it is that we all have had lives in which some aspect of our lives and careers have been involved in public service, which is fascinating in terms of how, how that impacted us in terms of our work.  But, that was a--that was an interesting experience.
Story_ID: 535900
Speaker 1: Two things that I want to follow up on.  The lion hunt?  What was that?  How do you do it?  And then how did you, I mean, I guess it's the same, but you know, you said the two groups.  The civil rights almost broke up the meeting, and you had to sort of negotiate between the two.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Well, the lion hunt was just, well, you do something and the audience imitates you.  And you go looking for a lion and they go, yeah.  You have words and do various things while you're doing it.  It's fun.  But on the compromise, there was a question of how to recognize that there were existing laws in the southern states where if the students engaged in certain activities, they would be subjected to imprisonment.  So they couldn't violate the laws.  But at the same time, there was a need to address the issue and to be concerned about the issued.  So we worked on language and so on to allow for that to happen so that the predominately black colleges, historically black [HBCUs], were supportive, and then the others were supportive.  And so, it--just to give you an example.  One of the people was later the president of Jackson State College [Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi] who--where they had the riots and here I was having riots in Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], and his daughter was enrolled in Michigan State.  And the interlockings are really quite, quite fascinating.  But you had to have been there at that era to have understood the importance of trying to get the organization [U.S. National Student Association] on record as being against discrimination and being in favor of everything without forcing the predominately white or exclusively white campuses to engage in activities that would indeed be counterproductive, and they couldn't get it done.  It was beyond--long before the question of the civil rights marches and demonstrations.  I mean here you were, but these young people were committed.  They wanted to be committed, but they had--it was a very interesting process.

Speaker 1: Continuing with Dr. Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifford R. Wharton, Jr.] on May 12th [2006], with the completion interview with The HistoryMakers.  I'll reintroduce myself as Shawn Wilson, the interviewer, and Neculai Burghelea, the videographer.  So we will start.
Story_ID: 535903
Speaker 1: We left off talking about your--the people you'd encountered at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  We'll just start with Harvard.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And we will talk about what you considered to be the important aspects of what you learned at Harvard that would later make you the man you are today or the man you would become after those years because you entered so young at sixteen.
Speaker 2: Well, the, my--when I went to Harvard, it was a period during World War II [WWII].  And as a result the classes were allowed to take three semesters a year rather than two, and that was because people were going off, being drafted, joining the forces.  And this meant that you could accelerate in terms of taking your courses.  And the classes were somewhat mixed up.  At Harvard, when I attended, there were only four of us who were blacks.  And it was a very interesting period.  I believe I mentioned the fact that there were so few of us that we were not considered special admits in the usual sense of today.  We were viewed as being rather unusual in the sense that we had to be fairly good to be able to get in.  In fact, the most serious discrimination at Harvard in those days was against Jews, not blacks because they really had a tough time getting into Harvard, and it was very competitive.  During my years at Harvard, I went off at track as I had, as you know, been captain of the track team at Boston Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts], did very well until I pulled a hamstring.  The--I also went out for the Harvard radio station [WHRV Radio; WHRB Radio, Cambridge, Massachusetts], became an announcer, then became production director.  At the time, I didn't realize I was the first black to be part of that.
Story_ID: 535904
Speaker 1: Following that period, then I decided that I would go into--would volunteer to go into the training for Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field], for the [U.S.] Air Force.  I did that in 1945, was successful in being admitted.  I think I discussed that previously.  And that was a very interesting experience in your home state of Mississippi and then into Tuskegee, Alabama.  When I returned from being in the Air Force and being at Tuskegee in the [U.S.] Army, a cadet program, I then completed my work at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  The--all of the time I was there, I was majoring in history, particularly specializing in U.S. diplomatic history because I was preparing myself to go into the [U.S.] Foreign Service to follow in my father's [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] footsteps.  The--I graduated with honors as a cum laude.  And then I enrolled at the School of Advanced International Studies [Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies] which was in Washington, D.C. during the period of segregation in Washington.  The school at those, in those years, was relatively new.  It was in one single building.  The dormitories were in the building, the dining rooms, the classrooms, the libraries, et cetera.  And that was an interesting experience for me because I had a number of experiences I think I've previously discussed in terms of being in Washington where it was segregated.  The--I had intended in going there to prepare myself to take the Foreign Service exams.  During that period, however, I became quite interested in the whole field of U.S. foreign assistance, technical assistance.  It's a new area.  And partly because of the commencement speaker at our commencement at Harvard was General George Marshall, who was then secretary of state.  And that was when he announced the Marshall Plan.  Following that, President Truman [President Harry S. Truman] announced what was then called Point Four, which was the earliest suggestion of developing a program of U.S. technical assistance to lesser developed nations.  Also, at that time, I finally decided that I did not want to join the Foreign Service like my father for I suspect the reasons one would have as a young, young person.  I decided that most of my father's good friends in the [U.S.] Department of State whenever I met them would always say, "Well, when are you joining in?  You're Cliff's son," you know.  And I wondered whether in doing that I would be, be achieving because of my father or achieving because of myself.  So I decided I would go into the field of foreign assistance if I could.

Speaker 1: There was a professor at the school [School of Advanced International Studies; Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.] by the name of Simon Hanson, who was a specialist in Latin America.  And he suggested that I should go and meet with some of the people in the office of Nelson Rockefeller in New York City [New York, New York] because Mr. Nelson Rockefeller then had just come back from Washington [D.C.].  He had been a coordinator of Latin American affairs in Washington.  And he was setting up programs.  He was setting up both profit-making programs, and non-profit programs to work in Latin America.  And so I, I came up.  I was twenty-one going on twenty-two, was interviewed, and it was a very interesting interview because the gentleman who interviewed me said, well, he didn't think there'd be a job there for me except in public relations, but he didn't think it was a very good job for me.  But nevertheless, if you--about a month or so later, the man who had been chosen to head up the non-profit organization, which was called--a long name, called the American International Association for Economic and Social Development.  It was called AIA for short, who had previously been the head of the Farm Security Administration, came and was selected by Nelson to head up this program.  And he saw my vitae and he wanted to meet me.  And so I came back up to New York, and he interviewed me.  He was a wonderful man.  He was from South Carolina, veteran of World War I [WWI], still had shrapnel in his arms, was very dedicated to the problems of development.  He had been a great proponent of supervised credit for poor farmers all over the United States.  And so at that same time, Nelson had decided that he would have a few people selected to be trainees, executive trainees, and he selected two--I guess it was four of us in all.  Three were in the various profit-making activities, and I was in the non-profit, NAIA.  And that was a wonderful experience because it enabled me to, for that one year, become acquainted in different aspects of the operations of the Rockefeller activities.  I was able to be in touch with the people in public relations, with the people in finance, some of the managers of the programs, some of the advisors to the Rockefeller family.  And I know it sounds maybe fairly heady for a young person to have that sort of exposure.  But it was a, an incredible opportunity for me to see things from the top, what was happening, how they work, what they did, et cetera.  And, of course, while I was there, soon after I was, finished my traineeship, the head of the program, named, by the name of Pete Hudgens, gave me the position of being a program officer in which I primarily was to design the reporting arrangements for the programs which we had in Venezuela and Brazil.  And that was a, an opportunity for me to develop from scratch a whole series of how do you secure the statistical information that could then be used to provide to the board of trustees on what was happening and how it was going about.  So I became very proficient in developing all kinds of schemes and charts and all the rest of that.  And I also took the position that, for me I would do whatever was asked of me to learn, to acquire that experience.  Then another gentleman joined the organization by the name of James Maddox [James G. Maddox], who was a--had just finished his Ph.D. at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in agricultural economics and was from Arkansas.  And he also became very supportive and helpful to me in terms of my work.  I then became head of the reports and analysis for the AIA, made trips to Latin America, to Brazil, and, of course, because I'm bilingual, that was also very helpful.

Speaker 1: There came a time--we--I've gotten married [to HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton].  If you want, we can get into that.  We had a incredible courtship and were married.  But I decided that I really needed to have more training, professional training in order to be able to work in this field [foreign assistance].  I was fascinated by the field of technical assistance to lesser developed countries.  And so in talking with, particularly with Maddox [James G. Maddox], he said, "You really should go back and get a Ph.D. in economics."  And we talked about this, and he said, "Well," he said, "you shouldn't go back to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you know, you've been there." And he said, "You don't have all of the, usually the prerequisites for training in economics further."  He said, but, he said, "There're two places that probably will be good for you.  One is the University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] where they have an institutional economics bias."  He said, "But the really exciting one is the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]."  Now, so I--he gave me some materials to look at and to read, and it just turned out serendipitously, I suspect--and maybe he did it on purpose.  I don't know.  But he gave me the first issue of a journal that had just come out which was published for many years called Economic Development and Cultural Change which was put out by a professor at the University of Chicago.  And in the book, there was an article written by a man whom I did not know called Theodore Schultz.  And so I read that and what happened was that a day or two after I'd read this, I was in the office working and Maddox said to come on in, and I'd like you to meet somebody.  So I go in and here's this tall gentleman, very imposing.  He says, "Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], I'd like you to meet Theodore Schultz" (laughter). And so I said, "Oh, really?"  And I said to him, I said, you know, I said, "I, I tried to read your article," and said, "and I couldn't understand it."  And he said, "Well," he said, he said, "I've been told that before" (laughter).  But we talked and I did not know at the time that Schultz had just received a very large grant from the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] to undertake a survey, a complete survey of the history of U.S. technical assistance in Latin America.  And so he, then he hired me, he suggested--he wrote to me and he suggested that I should--if I wanted to become a research assistant, working on this program with him, and then I could enroll at the University of Chicago in economics. And this was a great opportunity.  It meant that I went to study economics in a sense, part time, because I could not take a full load while I was also working for him.  But I could not have asked for a more challenging setting.
Story_ID: 535907
Speaker 1: My experien- it was quite sobering, because I arrived and took my wife, Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], and a relatively newborn son, Clifton [Clifton R. Wharton III], to Chicago [Illinois].  We lived in prefabs in--which is right on the Midway [Midway Plaisance, Chicago, Illinois].  We, we had a food budget per week.  I think it was either twelve or fifteen dollars a week.  It was really quite, quite an experience.  But intellectually, Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] was highly mathematical and highly statistical.  And I had virtually no background in that.  And the advisor for graduate students in economics, who was also a professor of economics, he recommended that I take a course, certain courses in statistics and in mathematics, which I did, but no economics.  And literally, he saved my life by my doing that.  It--I would have to say in many ways, it was probably the most challenging intellectual experience I've ever had in being in that department.  The students were brilliant.  The faculty was superb, very demanding and challenging.  Once you passed your preliminary examinations, you were treated just like a member of the department.  It was just an incredible period.  I didn't realize at the time.  I did later, many years later, that this was a, almost one of the great, golden years of economics at the University of Chicago.  We had outstanding professors, Frank Knight was still teaching, Milton Friedman, I took courses from him, courses from Schultz [Theodore Schultz], other economic historians.  And it was just an incredible experience.  And then while I was working on this project on Latin America, I used the, one of the programs that Nelson Rockefeller had had that I'd done some work on in Brazil, as the basis for the work that I did for my doctoral dissertation.  And my doctoral dissertation was a study of the economic impact of technical assistance in Brazil.  And it was based upon a lot of the data that--I hadn't done it on purpose, the data that was being collected was data that I used for, for my analysis.  It was, again, in a way serendipitous, but that's the way life sometimes turns out to be.
Story_ID: 535908
Speaker 1: The project that we worked on, one of the key members of the project was a gentleman who--but, again, also figured largely in my life, named Arthur Mosher [Arthur T. Mosher].  Now, Art Mosher was the son of an agricultural extension agent, a very famous one, who had become an agricultural missionary in, in India.  And he in his day did something quite unconventional because he decided that for him to do his Ph.D. in economics, at Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]--he also was studying in Chicago--that the way for him to do it was to take his wife and family and go and live in a rural village in India and take a farm, an actual farm of an Indian and for a year, he would run the farm just like any other farm.  And then he used that as a basis to come back and write this up as the dissertation.  And Schultz [Theodore Schultz] had been on the, his thesis committee.  So Schultz had been very impressed with him.
Speaker 2: Was this Mosher that you knew or the father that had done this?
Speaker 1: No, the Mosher I knew.  Not the father (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm just mentioning his background.
Speaker 2: He'd gone to India, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the, no, the Mosher that I knew went to India.  And so then he became a member of the team that was gonna study Latin America, and he and I became very good friends, very close.  And when we went on field trips to Latin America for the project, very often, he and I would go together.  And he, he was just an incredible man, just an incredible man.  And so what happened was that when he finished the project, with the project, he went back--he went to Cornell University [Ithaca, New York] as a professor.  And while he was there as a professor, he was recruited by John D. Rockefeller III to head up the Agricultural Development Council.  And so then one of his first hires was he wanted me to come (laughter) and be with in Agricultural Development Council.  So that's how I got into the Agricultural Development Council and work in Asia.  So, I shifted from Latin America to Asia, and that's how, how it happened.
Story_ID: 535909
Speaker 1: So I have a couple of questions for you.  You talked about the four students.  There were only four of you at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], when you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --arrived.  Do you know--remember their names, the four students?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, yeah, yeah.  Bill Jackson [William Jackson], Ernie Howell [Ernest M. Howell] and my roommate Harold May.
Speaker 1: And do you know what their majors were?
Speaker 2: Well, Harold May became a, he became--he graduated, went to Harvard Medical School [Boston, Massachusetts], became a, made a very successful physician.  Then he went for many years to Haiti and was with the Albert Schweitzer Hospital [Hopital Albert Schweitzer, Deschapelles, Haiti] there, came back and is--now, he's retired now.  He was on the medical faculty at Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Bill Jackson subsequently died.  Ernie Howell who's still a friend, as well as my roommate, Harold.  Ernie joined The Asia Foundation and was stationed by them in different posts in Asia.  It's along India and the Philippines, Vietnam.  He was badly injured in Vietnam when a bomb exploded near the American embassy.  He became a stockbroker, and he's with a stock- Wall Street today.
Story_ID: 535910
Speaker 1: During World War II [WWII] when you were, you were--were you corresponding with your father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] at the time through letters (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All through my life, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what sort of advice or what was, what was your father's response to what you were doing and the path you were choosing to take?
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter) my father always wanted me to go in the [U.S.] Foreign Service.  And he, this came up, of course, when I decided when I was at the, science at the School of Advanced International Studies [Paul H. Nitze School of International Studies, Washington, D.C.], that I decided not go to the Foreign Service.  His position was, well, you're young.  You've got--there's plenty of time.  And so I went ahead and did it.  And, of course, my argument with my father was that I felt that U.S. technical assistance and foreign assistance was going to become a major aspect of U.S. foreign policy.  My father said--he didn't think so.  He thought this was just do-goodism.  But I thought it was going to become one.  But it was all right.  Then when I, when I decided to go to get my Ph.D., his position was, well, that'll be good too, you know, you can use that.  But then you should make a lateral entry into the Foreign Service.  And I decided not to do that again.  And I decided to not only join John D. III's--John D. Rockefeller III's program of ADC [Agricultural Development Council], but I would also go out to Asia.  And that's when I went to Southeast Asia.  And at that time, my father said, "You're going out for how long?"  I said, "Well, I have made a commitment to go out for at least ten years."  And he said to me, he said, "Well, you know, you really shouldn't, you know, make that kind of lengthy commitment.  And why are you going out to Asia," et cetera.  And what I said to my father was, I said, "You know," I said, "I have observed that you have been a head of mission at virtually all of your posts thus far."  And I said, "You have learned the ability to take responsibility for your decisions."  And I said, "And that's been part of your experience."  I said, "For example," I said, "I know what it would be like in terms of when you are having a staff meeting, let's say, in the embassy, and you're--there's an issue that has arisen, and you want to make a recommendation to the [U.S.] Department of State.  And you go around the room, and you get each one of the individuals or your subordinates, and they will say, 'Well, on the--Mr. Ambassador on the one hand and on the other hand,' they're giving you the two-handed responses.  And then there's some young person sitting near the end of the table, and they're watching your reaction when you arrive.  And they'll say, they'll think to themselves, maybe, I think he's really in favor of this position.  And they'll give you a 60/40, and you'll say, 'Oh, that's a very bright young person.'"  I said, "But what happens is, it gets all the way back to you, and you make the decision.  And the decision goes off to Washington [D.C.].  Now, if the decision is accepted, and it's a good decision, if it's accepted by the department in Washington, everybody in the embassy goes around saying, 'Gee, we did a great--.'  If it's a bad decision and rejected, then everybody in the embassy says, 'Well, the old man, he, he--it was a clunker, you know.'"  But, I said, "But you, my father, you have taken this as part of your job.  And you have learned how to do that."  I said, "I wanna have the experience of having my own where I'm going to be able to acquire these skills of decision making and responsibility."  So he smiled and said, "Okay," you know, so I went on.  That's how I went on to--but that was it.  Now, just to wind up that issue in terms of my father, when I came back from Asia--that was the last time, I guess, the--because I had so much base of experience in the region, I became very attracted by--attractive to various organizations, institutions and so on.  And then there were some, I'll use the word feelers to me about particular positions in government.  And at one point, the, they were interested in whether I was--well, they asked me whether I would be interested in a position as assistant secretary of state for Latin America.  And my father was, he goes, "Oh, this is wonderful," you know, kind of thing.  But I wasn't sure about that.  I felt that this was not the right timing.  I wasn't sure that they were really after me or whether they wanted to, in a sense, be responsive to the issues of, of the whole upsurge in civil rights at the time.  And--but it turned out, they didn't ask me.  They asked somebody else.  But my father could say, "Well, you know, that's, you ought to really think about, you know, going to Foreign Service."  But then when I became president of Michigan State University [East Lansing, Michigan], my father said, "Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.]," he says, "you've gone further than anything I've ever thought of."  So it, it was kind of funny but, from that side of it.  But he, at that point, he gave up (laughter) on it, yeah.  But that's one thing I was, I felt sort of sad about was that when I became the deputy secretary of state, my father had already died.  And it would have been nice if he'd known that I had actually, finally (laughter) gone into the, to the department.
Story_ID: 535911
Speaker 1: I want to talk about your, your courtship with your wife [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], but before I do, I would like to have you explain to me, did it just come about that you would happen to work in Latin America in economic development or did you have a desire?  Why was Latin America your first --?
Speaker 2: No, in those days, you, you--I would have to say that young people in those days going--finishing school, you looked for a job opportunity in the areas that you thought might, where you might be qualified and which you had an interest in.  But if you didn't find what you wanted, you took what was there (laughter), okay.  Now, in my case, for example, when I was at SIS [School of Advanced International Studies; Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.], I was interviewed by--they had a lot of corporations that came to interview us.  And I remember one in particular because it was subsequently very humorous.  He was from, one of the oil companies, from Exxon [Exxon Mobil Corporation].  It was SO [Standard Oil Company] in those days.  And when he int- the man interviewed me, he did it fairly, fairly perfunctorily, and then he said, well, he said, "I don't think you'd be happy in a company," which I knew was the code word.  And I--oh, he said, he said--and I said, "Well, you know," I said, "I don't understand that," I said, "because you're working in Latin America, and you're looking for people in Latin America."  And I said, "I'm bilingual," and went through the whole thing.  And he was really kind of upset, you know, that he, he knew that he didn't want to hire me for racial reasons.  But he, he didn't wanna say so, you see.  Now, fast forward.  Many years later I was on a, a U.S. commission.  And one of the members of the commission was then the chairman and CEO of SO, became a good friend.  His first name is also Clifton, by the way.  And so one day, with a cocktail, I said, "By the way, Cliff, you know, I all--," I said, "I never did get a chance to get a job with SO."  He said, "Really?"  I said, "Yeah," and I told him the story.  He was mortified.  He was mortified.  I said, "'Cause you know I could have been working (laughter) in your company."  But, but, no, I, I knew that I had the skills and the background, and therefore, Latin America was an obvious choice for me, in terms of field.  Now, I was interested in technical assistance, so here's Latin America, and I had the competency that gives you a special advantage.  Among my classmates, they were surprised that I took the job because actually, my starting pay was lower than most of the other students who were graduating with me.  Two years later, I was at the highest.  I mean I just knew where the, where the mobility was, but I didn't, I didn't say I want Latin America.  I have to have it.  It wasn't that.  It was just what was available and then, what you did.
Story_ID: 535912
Speaker 1: How did you meet Mrs. Wharton?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I'm not sure I didn't tell you this before, but I'll go over it.  Her cousin, a woman named Elizabeth Fitzgerald, in Boston [Massachusetts], she and her sister I've known for--I'd known for a number of years, about since, you know, our childhood.  She became a freshman at Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] when I was a sophomore at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And one day she asked me if I would take her cousin, Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], to be her escort to a dance at Radcliffe.  And I said, well, I have a rule of no blind dates, and so she said, well, but you may not remember, but you met her at our, at my home.  And I remembered that Dolores had come on a visit to Betty's house, and Betty had had a, a party.  And she was a stunning girl, and I remember her being surrounded by a sea of (laughter) young men.  So at any rate, I dated her on that occasion, and there's a lot of stories connected with it, which are very humorous but I did not date her again until I became one of the people working at AIA [American International Association for Economic and Social Development].  And then the same cousin was coming to New York [New York] because she and Dolores had dates with West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] cadets, so Betty said, please meet the train and pick up my cousin so he can carry my bags and (unclear).  So I picked up Dolores and went down to meet her at the train.  And in--I had been in touch with Dolores in the intervening periods, and, and I was sort of thinking--well, my goodness, you know.  She's really grown up and matured and so on.  And so that started the courtship, and we--it was an absolutely, incredible courtship.  It was, it was kind of--from my, from our standpoint, both of us--she'll tell you the same thing.  It was just absolutely glorious, the spring in New York was fantastic, the things we did together were tremendous.  We were not at the time--we weren't even thinking about marriage.  We really weren't, quite honestly.  But a year later, we were married, you know.  We were married in Marian Anderson's studio.
Story_ID: 535913
Speaker 1: We're at Marian Anderson's studio in 1950, you were married--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Why did you choose that partic- -why did you choose that place for the--?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, Ms. Anderson was a childhood friend of Dolores' mother [Josephine Bradford Duncan], and they grew up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] comes from a very, very unusual distinguished black family.  Her--I guess it's her great-great-grandfather, was a very successful caterer in Baltimore [Maryland].  And the--it's an interesting story about that whole family in terms of the Bradfords.  And her mom, her mother married a Kenneth Duncan [V. Kenneth Duncan], who was--he and his brother [John Duncan] were very successful funeral directors in Harlem [New York, New York].  And so my wife, for example, she went to the Little Red School House [Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School, New York, New York] that they had opened here in New York.  She went to, briefly to NYU [New York University, New York, New York] and then Connecticut State Teachers College [Central Connecticut State University, New Britain, Connecticut], but she really was interested in theater and dance.  So she went to the Neighborhood Playhouse [Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre, New York, New York] and then she was studying dance with Martha Graham.  And that's when I started courting her (laughter).  But she did complete her degree at Chicago State University [Chicago Teachers College; Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] when I was at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  The--but, so she came from a very, upper-middle class, very successful black family.  And traditionally, I mean there's a long multi-gen- multi-generational kind of family.  And so, and her, her grandfather, as a matter of fact, knew my grandfather, which is very interesting.  They were not friends, but they knew each other in Baltimore because my grandfather, my paternal grandfather [William Bowman Wharton], migrated from Accomac [Virginia] to Baltimore.  And my father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] was born in Baltimore.  But then they moved to Boston [Massachusetts].  And, but Gray [Gray Bradford] and my grandfather knew each other, which we didn't know until my grandfather told us.
Story_ID: 535914
Speaker 1: But when we had the wedding, Ms. Anderson [Marian Anderson] offered the studio because her home was, was just about a half--a mile down away from Dolores' mother's [Josephine Bradford Duncan] home.  So they had their two estates nearby each other.  And so, and then I--we would be visiting her even before, while we were courting and so on.  And so she offered the home, the studio for the wedding.  And it was, within the black community that year, it was one of the big social events up and down the eastern seaboard, you know.  You know, so it was, it was quite-- We got married (laughter).  I'll tell you we--(laughter).  And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I have a few questions.
Speaker 1: And it definitely was a great wedding.
Speaker 2: How did you ask her, and then how did you ask her father [V. Kenneth Duncan]?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Good question.  The--by that time, her mother and father had divorced.  And her mother had remarried.  And that's when they were living in Danbury [Connecticut].  The (laughter), the--it's very interesting.  Her mother, at first--I asked, I asked Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] to marry me in the, in the Rockefeller Plaza [New York, New York] and, on the northeast area where they used to have benches.  And that's where I proposed to her.  And fast forward many years later, we tend--we regularly exchange rings on the anniversary.  And we were sitting on the bench there.  And we were doing this, and a young couple with some children (unclear), they saw this, and they came over and they said, "Did you just do what we thought you did?"  (Laughter) And we said, "Yes."  They said, "Isn't that nice?"  You know, and we said, well, at that (unclear), I don't know how many years we had married at that point.  It was something like forty or forty-five years.  And they, they just really thought this was incredible, but that's where it was.  But, but I asked her father, sure, yeah, and her mother, you know, yeah.
Speaker 2: How did you ask the father?  Did you just (unclear)--
Speaker 1: I just asked him.
Speaker 2: --say, "I'd like to marry her and like to ask for her hand."
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it was, as I say, it was a--it was almost like a foregone conclusion.  It was so natural, and we just, it was--anyway, absolutely great and perfect fit.  It was just that way.
Speaker 2: And it was the social event of the season for (laughter)--
Speaker 1: I think, I mean that's my impression of it, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean, yes, of course.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 535915
Speaker 1: So then after your--you marry in 1950, is that when you go to Chicago [Illinois] after--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  I was then working.
Speaker 1: You were then working.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I began working for Nelson Rockefeller in 1948.  We didn't go to Chicago until 1953.
Speaker 1: But you spent twenty-two years working for the Rockefeller Foundation?
Speaker 2: No, I spent ten--well, twenty-two years working in foreign and economic development and philanthropy.  So I had, I had, starting in 1948 until I went to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], you see, because I was working in foreign economic development all that period of time.  And one period was with the Rockefellers.  Then I was at Chicago and now with the other; with John D. Rockefeller III.  I worked for John D. Rockefeller III for thirteen years, you see.  So you add that up, and that's the period.
Speaker 1: So what is it--what do you think it is about those years that pre- that pushed you towards academia to become the president of a university?  Was it a logical step or, I mean it doesn't seem like one?
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter) many people say that.  It actually is, in my case, logical, although I had not anticipated it.  I had not even thought that this was what would be the next step.  At the time--we lived in Southeast Asia for six years.  And I covered Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia.  And the first year, I also included Indonesia until we had a person sent there.  So I had a pretty wide area to cover.  And it was very exciting.  It was a--for both of us, it was a very significant, life-changing experience to be in a setting where you had a multiplicity of cultures, non-Western, different religions, different ethnic groups.  The--many of the countries were just emerging from independence.  For example, we spent two years to begin with in Singapore, and it was still a British crown colony.  And if you've been to Singapore, and the skyscrapers--when we first went there, there were only two tall buildings in the whole city.  One was the Cathay Hotel and the other was the AIA [American International Association for Economic and Social Development] building in Raffles Place.  And if you went to the top of the hotel, then you could look right across Singapore, and you could see the AIA building.  And this is how, this is when we went there.  When we were in Kuala Lumpur [Malaysia], there were eighty American families in the whole country.  I mean it was just a whole different world.  And so my working was one of where I was given the charge to help develop the rural, social sciences, particularly in universities.  And so I would try to find top, bright young people that I could send to the United States to get their Ph.D.'s, people that I'd give research grants to, people that I would want to give them financing to go to major international conferences.  Well, in Vietnam, no Ph.D.'s in economics.  Thailand, no Ph.D.'s in economics.  Malaysia, no Ph.D.'s in economics, Singapore, too.  I mean this is, it was virgin territory.  And so to have the opportunity to start from scratch and help work was just wonderful for a young, young budding scholar.  Now, during the whole time that I was there, I taught.  I taught an average of sixteen hours a week, in addition to being a foundation executive, in addition to making grants and traveling in the region.  And I did research on such things as subsistence agriculture.  I did research on trade.  I did research on the demand for, for rubber.  I did the first major study, econometric study, on the inelasticity of rubber supply.  There were a whole series of things that I did as a researcher and published them.  I did--one of the articles that I did (laughter) which became rather famous within the field out there, was a--I did an article called 'Marketing, Moneylending (laughter) and Merchandising in Case of Middleman Monopsony in Malaysia' [sic. 'Marketing, Merchandising and Moneylending: A Note on Middleman Monopoly in Malaya,' Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.].  But it's because, in teaching the students, I discovered that there were no textbooks that dealt with monopsony, a single buyer.  But in most of those countries at that time, in the small villages, there was only one buyer of the product.  So I wanted them to understand how to analyze it economically.  So that's what I did, prepared the journal, and I published the thing.  And boy, zip, it took off.  Now, what happened was that in, in doing all of this, I was working with universities over there.  I also did a survey before I left on major universities in the United States on the experiences that Asian students were having studying in the United States and published that as a monograph.

Speaker 1: When I came back for the ADC [Agricultural Development Council], to the United, to the United States, I became director of their program which was called the American Universities Program--Research Program [American Universities Research Program], AURP.  The program was intended to help new scholars and researchers have an opportunity to do research on the problems of development overseas.  Now, why?  Mosher [Arthur T. Mosher] very brilliantly realized anybody who wanted to receive a grant--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  Is it the father or the son?
Speaker 1: No, no, the father's out.
Speaker 2: The father's out of it, so the son.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, the son (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think I only met him one time or twice.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So.
Speaker 1: But Mosher, Art Mosher, he realized that young, newly starting scholars who wanted to do research on the development problems, couldn't get grants because they didn't have the experience.  So how do you get the experience if you can't get the grant?  So we have a grant--we had a grant program which was just four people who had not had overseas experience, to give them a chance to do that.  There were a whole series of activities we had connected with that.  We had workshops, seminars at different universities where we brought together different people to discuss research priorities.  And so what happened was that they, through this program--again, I was in touch with the various individuals in the major universities all over the United States, okay.  And also, during the time when I was having, spending--when we were at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], I had a sabbatical at Stanford when we first came back from Southeast Asia, and for the years '64 [1964] to '65 [1965], I was a visiting professor at Stanford University.  That in itself is another story because I was supposed to be having a sabbatical but they ended up making, asking me to teach.  But I also organized a, a major conference on subsistence agriculture and economic development.  And that was held in Hawaii in 1965.  And I brought together the leading scholars in the world who were experts on subsistence agriculture on the rural, sociological aspects of it, psychological aspects of it, and so on, econometric studies.  They came from all over, from Europe, Japan, Asia, Afri- even Africa.  They are all in this conference.  Many of them had--some of them had known each other's work but never--very few of them had been in touch with each other.  And we had this--I organized this conference, and, again, there were people from some of the major universities.  And that conference and the work of that conference, I then edited which became the book that I edited, called, 'Subsistence Agriculture and Economic Development' [ed. Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.].  It developed a, an incredible set of research priorities.  And many graduate students would use that for the purpose of their studies.
Story_ID: 535917
Speaker 1: So here I was doing all of this, and what happened was that I began to get inquiries from, from various universities.  They would say, "Well, we're inter- we're, we're looking for a chairman of the department of agriculture economics."  "Really?"  "Yeah."  Or, "We're looking for so and so."  And then I received an inquiry about would I be interested in a presidency of a university.  And I was kind of surprised.  I said, "Well, you know, I hadn't even thought about that."  Meanwhile, I'd become vice president of ADC [Agricultural Development Council], and all of the indications were that when Art Mosher [Arthur T. Mosher] retired, I'd become president.  So, but then, interestingly, when Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] approached me, my wife [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I talked about this.  And we said, boy, now, that is a, an ideal campus for me because it was probably, at that time, the leading, if not one of the leading universities in foreign economic development, very strong, had, its--my predecessor at Michigan State, John Hannah [John A. Hannah], had been one of the leading people in supporting Point Four and foreign assistance.  They had a, a developing program for enrollment of minority students, increasing that.  They were highly diverse.  They were very committed to the land grand philosophy of education for the underserved and for the rural sector.  It was a, it was an incredible fit.  And so when they asked me, you know, I said, "Well, that's really, that's an interesting one."  And that began the process.  Now, I've often been asked that the--that, did I, did I have consciously in mind the fact that by getting that position, I would become a black pioneer.  I hadn't thought of it in those terms.  I honestly hadn't.  It was not--it was much more the fact, here was a university that I thought was a great university, where I had the set of competencies that might mesh very well with what they were doing, and I could be involved in.  And, but I, I had (laughter) no idea what would happen.  Now, having said that, sure, I'd been a pioneer at SIS [School of Advanced International Studies; Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.], but it hadn't sort of registered, you know, that this was a pioneering, just didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And in '48 [1948], also you were the first African American to be at John Hop [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland]--the international (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's what I said.
Speaker 2: That's SIS.
Speaker 1: SIS, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, at--so it was not, I wasn't thinking, oh, this is gonna be a pioneer--not until it hit.  Then, all, it was really something.  I mean it, I could--I have to tell you, I've never--it was--when the announcement came, we were, we were on the front page of The New York Times, above the fold.  They did a (unclear) of (unclear) me.  I had three to four TV crews outside the corridor of the offices.  I mean it was unbelievable and it was just a (makes sound).
Speaker 2: How did the press cover it?  More of the--just that you were qualified to do the job or that you were the first African American to do the job?
Speaker 1: Well, both, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The--it was, I--it's hard for me to tell.  I mean I--and I have the clips and all.  It was--the reaction was incredible, both within the white community and the black community.  The-- one of the things which I think sort of exemplifies it in my mind is that when, when Dolores and I went to be introduced on the campus--and they took us to a football stadium (laughter), and we went out on that field, I have to tell you, when seventy-six thousand people stand up and cheer, you know, that (laughter), that really hits you.  I mean it--and you sort of say wow, you know.  But having said that, it wasn't easy.  I was elected by a five to three vote.  There were three members of the board of trustees who vigorously were against my appointment.
Speaker 2: Because?
Speaker 1: Because they wanted Soapy Williams [G. Mennen Williams], the former governor of Michigan.  And they blocked me at every board meeting as long as they were on that board, every time we met, every month.  But it was a very--it was not, sort of, all roses from the beginning, even before.  And they blocked me even before or tried to stop my election.
Story_ID: 535918
Speaker 1: What were your private conversations with Mrs. Wharton [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] about taking the position?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we had--well, we talked about it.  You know, it was a big, big move.  I, I suspect, although I've--you may wanna ask her.  I, I don't think either one of us fully appreciated just how big, how much the challenge was.  I mean we knew it was gonna be challenging.  That was for sure.  But keep in mind, it was not just, it was not just issues of race, but it was also the issues of student unrest and riots and demonstrations.  Here was the second largest, single campus in the United States.  We had forty-six thousand students.  I was, what forty-two, forty-three years old.  And, you know, and we, when we did it, I mean it was--and, and she was unbelievable.  I mean, and so it was one of those things where if you, if you go to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] today, they will never say President Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], they'll say President Clifton and Dolores.  They always do.  It--because she was as much involved as I was.  And it, it also, I would say, whether it was her participation--I use that word advisedly, in the student demonstrations or what have you, it was, she was right there.  It was--if I wasn't--I remember one time--frequently, I would be at the police headquarters getting intelligence on what's happening on the campus with regard to rioting going on at demonstrations and she'd be in the president's home by herself.  And sometimes the students would come over (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You wanna change that?
Speaker 2: Sure.  But the, it was--
Speaker 1: Sometimes the students would come over.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.  And they would, and whether it was, there was demonstrating or not, she'd handle it, yeah.
Story_ID: 535919
Speaker 1: You said that there were challenges [at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  What were some of the challenges?
Speaker 2: All of that.
Speaker 1: All of that, just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  I mean very few people can fully appreciate the fact that when you're a university president, you are on call, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.  You had to be ready to handle any unanticipated emergency or crisis as well as your regular activities.  And it is very demanding, very demanding because you've got issues in regard to your constituencies, you've got the students, you've got the faculty, you've got the alumni, you've got the donors.  You've got the legislators.  You've gotta deal with them.  Then you've got issues of budget, you've got issues of academics.  You've got issues of athletics--you name it.  Then you have problems of, of--well, one of the hardest things to get (laughter), I had to get used to was, every morning, I would get a phone call from the head of the campus police who would tell me about any of the major, serious incidents that had occurred in the last twenty-four hours.  And you suddenly realize you're in a city, you know.  They're telling you about somebody was arrested for this, somebody was done for that (unclear).  This is what you have to deal with, or anticipating that there's gonna be a problem dealing with it.  It's--and you, you don't have--I used to tell people regularly on the student demonstrations and the rioting, there was no manual.  You didn't get a--you had no course, you hadn't taken a course on this.  And how do you do it?  How do you deal with it?  You learn or you use your gut instinct, your reaction.  For example, when Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I would confront a huge crowd of students demonstrating, we very rarely would ever have visible police around us because I was convinced that if we did that, it would be a sign of our sense of weakness and fear.  People would say, "Well, did you, weren't you afraid of being attacked?"  And, no, you cannot display fear.  I relied upon the fact that, that Dolores and I would stand there, and we would communicate as best we could and with total, total sincerity.  I had one advantage--we had one advantage.  We lived in the region.  So we knew Vietnam.  We knew Vietnamese, so we knew the situation.  But having said that, still, it was our personal relationship which would be the most significant.  As a result of that, we developed a program where we would go to the dorms two and three nights a week and have dinner with the students in that particular dorm.  After the dinner, we'd have what I--we would call a lounge dialogue where anybody could come and ask me any questions they wanted.
Speaker 1: Did they talk to you a lot about Vietnam, and your experiences (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Anything, oh, sure, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they--very often they--during the height of the riots, many, was a time that the students would come into the house.  And my--Dolores would welcome them in, and they'd sit down.  And sometimes, they were on one side of the issue or another, and friends, you know.  And they would talk, and so, and she would talk to them and all, oh, yeah.  But it was a--people don't quite realize the--it was dangerous.  Don't, don't forget.  You had individuals who were quite prepared to engage in violence.  So you had to be aware of that.
Story_ID: 535920
Speaker 1: But you also had students who were very upset and caring about issues. One, (laughter) one of my favorite stories is about when, on one occasion, a group of students were in the student union [at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  Now, the student union was about eighty yards away from the president's house.  And what they were doing was, at night, they were having this meeting.  And it was discussing racism in America.  And three or four, as a group, would go out in the cover of darkness and start breaking windows in the buildings.  And then when the police came after them, they'd scatter in different directions so the police couldn't, police couldn't catch them.  And then they'd slip back into the building.  And then another group would go out and do the same thing.  And this was going on while they're discussing racism, you know.  And so came the time when the building was due to close.  Now, meanwhile, I'm at the police headquarters monitoring this and a lot of other activities going on, on the campus.  And so the leadership comes over to the, to the house, to Cowles House, the president's home and Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] comes out to greet them.  And they said to her, they said, "Well, Mrs. Wharton, you should tell President Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] not to close the student union or arrest us.  We're talking about something very important.  It should be very important to him.  We're talking about racism in America and he should care about the fact that we're discussing this issue."  Now, mind you, there're only two black students in the whole crowd, and not then, but in the whole building in terms of the issue 'cause the black students had their own--at any rate.  So she was standing there, and she was wearing a long gingham dress.  And it happened that there was a little bandana in her pocket.  So she takes the bandana out (laughter), and she puts it over her head, and she says, "Lazzie [ph.] me."  She said, "My people have been in this country a hundred and fifty years, and tonight's my night" (laughter).  And the, the girl screamed and ran off.  But everybody started laughing.  I mean it was--but she handled it just like that.  I mean she was very, very quick and very good.  But again, you had to know what you were doing.  And it was not easy--it was--but having said all of that, we had the most incredible eight years there imaginable.
Story_ID: 535921
Speaker 1: You said that you--what sorts of issues would you go before the board with monthly?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Everything.  Personnel appointments, budget items, programs, you name it, yeah.
Speaker 1: What sort of programs were you looking to implement at--
Speaker 2: It wasn't, it was--you have a constant series of issues.  You have changes in curricula, you have--but you're--that all begins in the committees of the Academic Council and the Academic Senate.  And I'd chair those.  I mean it's--and then I had the, one of the major issues I began working on very early was the issue of admissions.  This was a period when open admissions was the hot subject all over the country.  And the minority students at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] wanted us to increase minority enrollment.  Great.  But the opponents would say, well, why admit people who are not qualified, okay?  Now, now, I knew from my standpoint that this was an issue which, for me particularly, was a very explosive one, okay, because the expectation by those who, let's say opposed my appointment or who had questions about my appointment, would assume automatically that I would use my position to see to it that there were huge admissions of unqualified blacks into the school, into my campus, okay.  Now, but what did I do?  I created a special commission on admission and student body composition.  I included in that commission people within the university, outstanding faculty, students.  I had representatives from the staff.  I had representatives, key people from around the state, alumni, a huge group.  And we worked on this.  We had a group.  We worked on the issues.  Now, there were a lot of good recommendations they came up with.  But let me tell you some of the most important ones.  They differentiated between those who were economically disadvantaged and those who were educationally disadvantaged.  They're not the same thing.  They then advocated that we should not have a goal or quotas, but that we should have a program of admit and keep and to see to it that, in fact, the students admitted would be successful.  So when I was approached about having a goal, like the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], I refused.  I said, "Look," I said, "I do not want a revolving door."  I said, "I can get large numbers.  But that doesn't mean anything because if they flunk out, you know, every year, you're increasing the numbers, but nobody's really graduating."  So I then created a special assistant provost, a wonderful man, to work on the programs for the minority youth coming in.  I had some other programs, but I won't go through them.  But that was one of the major ones.  We developed a program where they were admitted, came in, in the late summer, before they enrolled in the fall, had special training for them to get up to speed when they came.  We had special monitoring as well as tutoring programs, all of that done once they were admitted, okay.  We increased the level of enrollment, graduate.  When, by the time I left--oh, I guess we, about three of four years before I left, we had a larger--we had one of the largest total enrollment of minority students in the United States.  We had a very high percentage.  The level of graduation on the minority students was almost identical with the rest of the students at campus, okay.  Now, people weren't gonna say to me, "Oh, look what you--."  Yeah, I said, "Look.  This is what we're gonna do.  We're gonna do, but it's important.  It's graduation that's important.  It's getting the education that's important, not just numbers."  We got the numbers too, but that was not the primary goal.
Story_ID: 535922
Speaker 1: You were thinking about whether or not you had a personal mission statement?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  As a matter of one of the--when I first arrived, the--my very first speech at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] was to the faculty, and I decided to use this as an occasion to describe what my values were.  And the student newspaper blasted it because they said I had, I had not given any plan for Michigan State University.  And I mentioned to the editor, the young editor, I said, "You know," I said, "I believe in free speech.  You can say what you want."  I said, "But, you know, if I had come out with a plan, your editorial would have blasted me for making statements with less than a month on the campus."  I said, "You can't do that."  I said, "I first get to know what the situation is, what the problems are and the issues are.  Then I'd be able to do it."  Now, ironically, many, many years later, Michigan State University did something which I still think is very unusual.  They decided to have a celebration, a thirty-year anniversary of when my wife and I worked at Michigan State University.  And the then provost, who is now the president, in her speech said she'd gone back and read that very first speech of mine.  And she said, she said, "That speech described everything which President Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] did."  She said, "It's all there," you know.  But they were (laughter), they wanted me, but they kept after me.  Don't you have a plan, don't you have a plan?  No.  That's not the way I work, no.  But one of the things that--in many ways, one of the legacies which we left, which in a way was not intended to be the way it turned out, my wife at that time particularly, was very much involved in the arts.  And it was very clear that Michigan State University had outstanding academic reputation, a great athletic reputation, but the arts were being given second, second-class status.  And she did everything she could to sort of encourage it.  For example, she began a program of rotating the art of the faculty in the president's home which was very well received.  And we had activities reaching out to the community, all sorts of activities like that.  But one of the things which she pushed me on was to change the priority so that there would a strong--higher priority given to a performing arts center.  We had a theater, a building which was used as a theater and had two sides to it.  So you could only produce one thing at a time, but it was really seating on both sides.  And one--actually the theater were all folding chairs, if you can imagine this in a university at that time.  So when I launched the first fundraising drive that the university had ever had, one of the major components was a performing arts center.  And so we had, and we organized--it was really quite something because we hired a outside consultant because the school had never done this before.  And although my wife and I had worked to increase the number of members of the President's Club--this is those who have given ten thousand dollars--and provided activities.  They'd never done anything for them before.  And the numbers began to grow significantly.  We decided we'd have this drive.  And the drive was eventually launched by having a gala.  In the gala, we had Tony Bennett and Lena Horne which was a great occasion.  Now, the building eventually was--it was not finished by the time we left.  But five years later, they named the building for Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and myself, which was really quite, quite moving.  And--but that, in many ways was a, intended to give a greater balance to the university in terms of its image, in terms of its activities.  And today, the Wharton Center [Clifton and Dolores Wharton Center for the Performing Arts, East Lansing, Michigan] at Michigan State is a tremendous facility in terms of the whole region in the state.  I mean it really is.  And it had, it has had record-breaking attendances and all that sort of thing.  And people just love it, you know.  The, the fun part (laughter) is that they hosted--when Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was running for presidency the first time, they were having presidential debates.  There were four presidential debates, and the last presidential debate was held at the Wharton Center.  And so Dolores and I went to the event.  I wasn't too eager to go, but we went.  And as we walked up to the building, the press recognized us and started interviewing.  And the students gathered around, and--I may have told this before, but one of the students came up after and said, "Are you--?"  And I said, "Yes."  And he said, "We thought you were dead," I mean because, you know, you name a building for a dead person.  But it was--but we, we go back to Michigan State quite frequently.
Story_ID: 535923
Speaker 1: Well, just to move back a little bit from Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] and back to your work in Southeast Asia.  You--can you just give me sort of a timeframe as to when you were there and what was happening?  I mean I'm basically interested in Vietnam because later the children at this university were, were protesting it.  I'm sort of interested in, in your, sort of your knowledge and what you were able to present to the kids, you know, ten or twenty years later about what your experiences had been in Vietnam?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure it quite works that way.  First of all, as I said, except for Thailand, all of the others--and the Philippines where I was not involved personally in the Philippines, were just coming out of colonialism.  And so there were many aspects of that.  The goal to achieve independence.  They had the goal to achieve their sense of self identity, the goal of their achieving their status in the world and in the region.  I mean all of that was part of this process.  And there were many, many aspects to it because, for example, they had, they had many times been suffered--had suffered under the colonial period.  But Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I, in traveling--and Dolores would travel with me quite frequently when I would go to some of the countries.  And we would get to know the people, learn about their culture, learn about their history.  All of that is part of the process of becoming enmeshed and engaged in, in a country.  One of the things which was very clear was that, first of all in terms of Vietnam, particularly--but even some of the other countries, the United States did not have very many people who knew very much about the countries.  There were some, but not very many.  And the result was that there were at times, policies that were being adopted in the United States which were not particularly appropriate for the actual circumstance and situation.  But we very often were eventually trapped by either the history or what we were doing, it was wrong.  Let me give you, I'll give you one example, and I'll stick to Vietnam.  When, during my first trip to Vietnam, the exploratory, I had a practice that whenever I went to a foreign country, officially for ADC [Agricultural Development Council], I would always try to see the U.S. ambassador, and I would always try to see an aid person if that was in a country that had foreign aid.  Sometimes the ambassadors would know my father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.], so it was always kind of courteous.  In the case of Vietnam, I went, toured the countryside.  There was some insurgency but nothing like what eventually became the war.  And this was, as you know, as I said, I went out--we went out to live there in 1958.  So this was the period.  And after I'd done the visits in the rural areas and paid my calls on the ambassador, they asked me, "Well, is there anything that we should know about that you picked up while you were around?"  I mean, just, you know, what did you learn and so.  And I said, I said, "One thing I know," I said, "I think that you need to have somebody look at the government's rice price policy."  The rice price policy was where the Vietnamese government would buy rice for export from the farms.  But they did not pay the farmers the world-market price.  They paid the farmers a lower price.  They charged the lower price to the people in Vietnam in Saigon [Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam] who ate the rice, but on the export market, they received the world price.  And then the rest, the difference was what, with the government revenue.  And I said, "This is not good."  I said, "Because the farmers are being squeezed." And I remember not the ambassador, but somebody, one of his aides said, well, he said, "Well, they're semi-literate peasants."  I said, "Look, they may not be literate," I said, "but they know what the world price is."  So they said, "Well, that's too sensitive a subject."  Okay.
Story_ID: 535924
Speaker 1: Then several years later, my wife [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I, and our two sons [Clifton R. Wharton III and Bruce Wharton] were on a vacation, my first one in about eight years, on a boat going up to--boat trip going up to Japan and then turning around and coming back.  And we were coming back, getting ready to come back from Japan, we get a cable, a call, a telephone call from the American embassy in Tokyo [Japan] asking me to get off the ship and fly to Vietnam.  Why?  They wanted me to (laughter) give them advice on rice price policy.  So I said, "No," I said, "I promised my wife the vacation.  I'm not--," so I went back to the south--to Malaysia.  Then I went up and visited 'em again.  Same thing.  It was worse now than before.  Okay, but they still wouldn't do anything.  Fast forward to 1966.  By this time, I'm back in the states.  I was on the East Asia and Pacific advisory committee for the [U.S.] Department of State.  And President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] decides that he's gonna have a rice roots initiative.  So he formed, he decides to form an agricultural mission to Vietnam.  And it was going to be headed by the secretary of agriculture, Orville Freeman.  And I was a member of the commission.  Okay.  We--I won't go through all the details of the launch and Hawaii.  And we get to Vietnam.  Very interesting.  On my first visit to the Ministry of Agriculture [Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development] in Saigon [Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam], there was a long line, lined up to greet us, and here about half of them are people I knew from my work in Vietnam.  And I was concerned because I didn't want them to feel that somehow, you know, because I was now on a presidential mission, I was going to exploit it.  And they said, they said, "Don't worry, Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], we know you.  You've been with us for years, and we've talked."  So I--we went around the country.  Finished.  Guess what the big problem was?  Rice price policy.  What was happening?  The Vietcong by this time would go to the farmers at night.  They would commandeer the rice and they would say, we will come back two days from now, and we will pay you the world market price.  They'd take the rice and come back and pay them the market price, the world market price.  What do you think these farmers would do?  They said, they're the good guys, you know.  They're giving us the world market price.  We wouldn't do it.  They said, "It's too explosive.  If we change it, then Saigon is gonna explode."  And so I, I told them, I said, "Don't ever ask me for my advice on this," I said, because I had been telling 'em this for quite some time; didn't pay any attention.
Speaker 2: Since 1958 now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean it's very--that--one of the things that where there are times when certain issues don't, don't completely mesh.
Story_ID: 535925
Speaker 1: Now, there are other times when attention is paid.  Strangely (laughter), one day on this advisory committee of the state department [U.S. Department of State] that I was on--interesting, one of the members of the advisory committee was Abe Rosenthal [A.M. Rosenthal], The New York Times, just died, you know.  But one day at one of the meetings, I made a comment about that some of the issues they were dealing with were not all of the issues.  And I began to discuss the political--the foreign policy significance of the Green Revolution.  This was the revolution in rice production that was coming from research in the Philippines, and international (unclear), funded by the Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York] and Rockefeller Foundations.  And afterwards, Bill Bundy [William Bundy], who was the assistant secretary of state at the time came to me, he said, "Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.]," he said, "if you--have you ever written that up?"  I said, "No."  He said, "Well, you really--."  He said, "Talk some more about this afterwards."  So I said, "Okay," and I did.  He said, "You really should get it written up."  So I went back and over a weekend, I wrote this up, sent it to the Foreign Affairs magazine.  They published it in their--it was one of my classics, I guess.  It was called Green Revo- 'The Green Revolution: Cornucopia or Pandora's Box' [Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.].  And, now, many of the points that I made in there subsequently did have an impact on, particularly, the practice of some of the aspects of the programs.  But, so it does work sometime, but not always.
Story_ID: 535926
Speaker 1: So to end this section of the Vietnam years kind of, later on, what, how did you feel about the war [Vietnam War]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was opposed to it.
Speaker 1: You were opposed to it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  I made that very clear to the students.  But I also said to the students, I cannot be your representative in speaking on the issue because if I did that, it would compromise the university's neutrality as a site where diverging views may contend.  And I thought that was very important that, that the student understand that that's a locus, where the seekers for truth in an academic sense on an issue, can, can debate the issue, can discuss and disagree, can try to find the answer to these issues in that forum.  If I'm in charge of the forum, I say, "Oh, no, no, I have the answer."  It compromises the neutrality.  I think some of the students had difficulty with that, but they at least understood what I was--I think they understood what I was saying.  There was one interesting event like this many years later at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  When the Iranian students were there studying then, objected to the university accepting a grant from the shah of Iran's [Mohammad Reza Pahlavi] government to do films on the Persian Empire.  We had a faculty member, naturalized American, Iranian, who was a cinematographer.  And there was a U.S.-wide committee to evaluate the three films, the substance, the subject matter, the history, et cetera.  It was all about ancient history in Persia.  But the Iranian students felt that this was, you know, supporting the Iranian government.  And the issue was academic freedom.  Should this faculty member be--when a peer group from other universities evaluate it and said this is very good scholarship.  It is not propaganda.  Shouldn't he be allowed to make these films?  So--but the Iranian students came to a board meeting wearing paper sacks over their head with the holes in it.  And the usual.  And I said, I said, this is a very important issue, and I believe that we should have a large meeting just devoted to this topic and have those individuals from the university community who are for and against this, to have an opportunity to express their views.  So we had a huge meeting in one of the auditoriums.  And we had both sides being able to debate the issue in the presence--in my presence and that of the board of trustees.  It was fascinating, absolutely fascinating because some of the most liberal faculty defended the right of that professor to make these films.  It wasn't propaganda.  It was history, okay.  Afterwards--I never will forget it, a student, one of the more activist students came up to me as I was leaving the auditorium.  He said, he said, "This was the best course I've ever had at the university."  And he meant it, and he was true.  But that was giving them the--that's what a university is like, to me, in terms of what gets done.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  I mean, I mean this may not be a comparison, but I mean I under--yeah, well, it's interesting.  I mean--how did you then get from--oh, the thing I wanna cover about Michigan--and I may have the facts wrong, but isn't it Michigan State University that a few years back had the white student sue the university for its legal (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: That's the University of--
Speaker 2: University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 535927
Speaker 1: After Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], you became the chancellor of New York State's--
Speaker 2: The state university system (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) --state university system.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did you--so what was the transition from--?
Speaker 2: Well, you go from being chan- head of one university to sixty-four (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you wanna leave Michigan?  Had the time come for you to move on?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  It was a case of where I took a good look at the State University of New York [State University of New York System] and I felt that this was an interesting challenge in terms of its complexity because it had--there's no other system quite like it.  We have community colleges, four-year arts, university centers, medical, you name it.  It's in there.  And it's different from the California system which is segmented by tiers.  See, the community college is one system, four-year is one system.  We're the whole thing except for the City of New York [New York].  And, and I felt that it was also a, a managerial, administrative challenge and I was interested in that.  And I also--then I was right on this one.  I also felt that it was a great board of trustees for the system.  So we decided we'd do that one.  So, came and had nine great years running the State University of New York.
Story_ID: 535928
Speaker 1: It did a lot of thi- got a lot of things done.  And it was, it was interesting.  I visited all sixty-four campuses in the first ten months I was in office.  And it goes back to my earlier story about my shipboard tours, you know, I gotta figure out where everything is.  But when I finished the tours, I knew every campus.  I knew what their problems were, what the issues were.  And I could talk knowledgably about them to the members of the state legislature or to the county executives.  So I knew, I knew the system.  I then developed a program of public service.  The land grant universities particularly have a public service dimension.  There's research, teaching and public service.  State University didn't have it.  So I said, we should have that, for goodness sake.  Here we are the, you know, the biggest, et cetera.  And one of the things that I helped to develop was a, a network of business development centers at the SUNY [State University of New York System] campuses, and they still exist today.  I think there're about thirty-two of them.  And the idea is that if a business, particularly a small business or otherwise, has a problem, it can go to that center and identify a talent within the university that could help work on those problems for them.  And it's contributing to the development of the state.  That was important.  The part--one of the other aspects, the lega- one of the legacies that I left which is still talked about, I guess, is the university was run like--as one of the commissioners said, like a prison system.  It was run like a state agency.  And they micromanaged everything.  And you couldn't move positions from one place to another.  You--all sorts of things.  And I took the position, I said, this is--you cannot run a university in this fashion.  And it took me a while to get it done, but I created a commission made up of leading figures, outstanding figures, both in New York and nationally, to look at the issue of the operation and management of the State University of New York.  I was not a member of the commission, had them run it.  And we had, we had a tremendous array of people.  We had former treasury secretary, Mike Blumenthal [W. Michael Blumenthal].  John Whitehead [John C. Whitehead] was the--he was on it, you know.  It was a, it was a range of these caliber of people who were well known, Don Marron [Donald Marron]; all of these were people on the commission.  And I, I was (laughter), I deliberately, when we had the first meeting did not tell them how bad the problems were on this score.  And I said, what I would like you to do before the next meeting is for each of you to have a chance to visit at least two or more of the campuses, just to go up and see.  They came back.  They were aghast, absolutely aghast.  They said, this is incredible.  Nobody should be able to--cannot run a university this way.  You need more flexibility.  I said, right, you know.  I knew that's what they would find out.  The co-chairs were Ralph Davidson [Ralph P. Davidson] who was the head of Time [Time Inc.] and the former president of The Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio], Harold Enarson [Harold Leroy Enarson].  And we also had Bill Friday [William C. Friday] from University of North Carolina [University of North Carolina System].  And there was a whole--I mean it was really a stellar group.  These were not people that either I could sort of brow beat or, or they were not--they were people whose, who had reputations and standing in the wider community.  And I did that deliberately.  And they came in and they presented a report which was called 'The Future,' [ph.], you know.  But they then--when we issued the report, it was fascinating because I was told, they said, well, it's gonna take at least two years to get this done.  I said, no, no, no, no.  We're gonna do it this year or it's not gonna happen.  And by George, in four months, we got it through.  And it was really quite a, quite a coup.  But it freed up the university so that you didn't have to go through all the multiple clearances.  Sometimes it took so long that by the time you finished, the budget year was over, and you had to go through the whole process.  It was, it was just unbelievable.  But they said, but they knew--I knew what the situation was.  They changed it.  But that was one of the things that people still talk about and--you know.  Now, since then, the barnacles have been stopped (laughter).  But it--but I, I enjoyed it.  I really did.  It was, it was a--I had a great board of trustees, great people in central.  And it was, it was really--it was, it was great fun.
Story_ID: 535929
Speaker 1: What was Mrs. Wharton's [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] role in New York--
Speaker 2: It was different.
Speaker 1: --comparable to Michigan?
Speaker 2: It was different.  By this time, she also had been developing her own, independent activities like she had at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] in the corporate world.  And so she was on quite a few corporate boards.  And many--she was the first woman and the first black on at least three of her corporate boards.  She was on Gannett [Gannett Company, Inc.], the newspaper media, she was on that.  She was the first woman and first black on that.  Phillips Petroleum Company, and she was on the, the board of COMSAT [COMSAT, Inc.].  She was on the board of banks.  She was on the board of Michigan Bell [Michigan Bell Telephone Company], then New York Tel [New York Telephone Company; Verizon Communications, Inc.].  She was on quite a few.  And the Kellogg cereal company [Kellogg Company].  She was many of them for 20 and 25 years, 20 or 17, 20 years, a lot of them.  But she had that as an activity.  She also began--that was when she began her program of the Fund for Corporate Initiatives [Fund for Corporate Initiatives, Inc., Albany, New York].  What happened was that in serving on these corporate boards, she quickly discovered that women and minorities will move up, and then it would stop.  And this was before the invention of the term glass ceiling.  This was long before that.  And so she was puzzled as to why that was happening because they had good degrees and were well trained.  So she did a canvass of her friends who were corporate CEOs and discovered that there were certain components that were missing.  So she started a program, first for seniors in high schools--I mean seniors in colleges in the greater Albany [New York] area, which was designed to give them a leg up.  I won't go through all of the details of it. But that was eventually turned over to the Albany Chamber of Commerce, and is still run.
Speaker 1: So can you just briefly tell us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But then the big one, the big one was the Young Executives Program, and that one, she ran with the Aspen Institute [Washington, D.C.] where mid-level, high potential minorities and women particularly, not exclusively, would come for a one week, intensive exposure to people from--we would have philosophers, we would have senior executives, particularly women and minorities, who have almost already made it.  We would have corporate chairmen and CEOs and corporate directors.  We would have people from business, from the congress, from music, the arts, and so on.  Each day, we'd have four different people.  So it was a very exciting program.  And the, the graduates of that program have done extremely well.  And they all talk about it in raving terms.
Story_ID: 535930
Speaker 1: You were going to explain to me the problems--
Speaker 2: Oh, well by (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You said, by explaining the program [Young Executives Program].
Speaker 2: Yeah, what, what the program did was, the morning would--each day we would have, she [Wharton's wife, HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] would have four different resource guests each day.  The morning would be, for example, someone who would talk about Western philosophy.  The next day, be a specialist talking about Asian religions.  Next day, somebody would talk about African values.  Next day, someone would talk about corporate ethics and values, okay.  But then the second session in the morning would be a presentation by a, particularly a woman or minority, but not exclusively, who had come and gotten near the top.  So she would have, Dar Davis [HistoryMaker Darwin N. Davis, Sr.] who just died.  She'd have, she'd have--oh, at one point, she had Dick Parsons [HistoryMaker Richard Parsons], okay.  She had Barry Rand [A. Barry Rand].  You get these people who were there, and they would share with the corp- young executives what it was like getting up to that point.  What were the pluses and minuses?  What was the experience like, okay?  Then in the afternoon, she would have a, usually a former or sitting chairman and CEO of a major corporation.  And they could talk about any subject they wanted to.  Then in the evening, she would have a section--session called cultural connections.  She would have a lobbyist from Washington [D.C.].  She would have a congressman.  She would have people like [HistoryMaker] Billy Taylor, Arthur Ashe, you know.  They came, okay.  So, she would have Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.].  But all of these.  Now, what happened, each day, you'd get four different people like that, all right.  Now, what was that (unclear).  It was the fact that these young executives came from different corporations.  They would send--it would get a broadening, an opening up.  They would have a chance to interact with a CEO, questioning them, not about their corporation but about the person's corporation or the issues that they were discussing.  They then had a chance to interact with each other so that they would learn how, how this would work.  And it was a, it was deliberately designed to make them aware of the broader dimensions of competencies that were necessary for upward mobility.  And many times, we could see the bells go off in their minds because they would suddenly think, "Oh, that's what's involved," you see.  But it was not where you had a fixed curriculum, you know, where you had to learn it.  Now, I would have to say that she did it for about--she did it with her own money, by the way too, from the corporations.  But the Aspen Institute [Washington, D.C.] tried to keep up, and they did it after she stopped.  But I think they've stopped it now because--and we thought this was the case, that the corporate environment for something like this has changed very dramatically.  Many of the major corporations have programs inside now.  And the issues that, that this program addressed are not the issues of today.  So it, it's changed.  And, but the other thing too, which I think I should mention is that both Dolores and I have had strong commitments in this area.
Story_ID: 535931
Speaker 1: When I was at--I should have mentioned this.  When I was at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], one of the more interesting programs I developed was a program of Presidential Fellows.  And this is where--it was patterned after the White House Fellows.  But every--usually, it was a, an academic year.  I would select one undergraduate student, one graduate student and one assistant professor, and they would be in my office and just shadow me.  They would go to the meetings that I went to, the speeches that I gave.  They did all this sort of thing with me.  And they had a chance to see what it's like to run a university.  And (laughter) we had a reunion of this group.  I guess it was in 1996 or something like that.  And in that group, I think, were three college university presidents, two college university presidents--assistant, vice presidents.  One of them, for example, has just been named provost at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], okay.  Professors and some--a few went into business, but those who have stayed in academia, it's amazing to watch what happened to them.  But that was there.  Here at TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York], I had a program of rotating special assistants; same thing, had them shadow me, learn what it's like.  Each time, in both cases, they had special projects that they worked on.  I would meet with them privately.  In Michigan State, it was every other week.  I think here was every week, where they could ask me any question they wanted about something that had happened because they would go to the board meetings.  And they'd say, when you answered so and so about that issue, what--why did you say it that way?  Or what was your--or what--how would you--why were you handling it that way?  Why didn't you do so and so?  And I always (unclear) look, I will give you my honest reaction or comment provided it is confidential.  I don't want you just screaming it out.  I said, it's for your help.  And I would do that.  And I did that with the, with the Presidential Fellows at Michigan State.  I did it with the, with research, with the special assistants here.  The fellows--Michigan State, when we had our reunion, it was--they blew my minds a couple of times because they remembered things I had not even remembered, you know.  And they'd say, "Boy, you told me so and so," yeah, and it was that kind of thing.  And they'd say, "I remember this."  But, again, that--I mention this, these two because it--the reason I did it was my own, the way I started as an executive trainee.  I had learned so much as a trainee myself, at that stage in life, and I soaked it all up at that age, give them a chance to--you do the same thing with others.  It took time besides, you know, your regular work.  But I, I've never, in a minute, regretted it because to see what--and they call me.  They talk to me.  They still call me.  I had (laughter), I had a long email from one of them just last week, who's now a university president.  And it--he said, "Only you would understand."  I mean it was, but, again, it's not, it's not strictly mentoring in that, in the usual sense.  It's a case of where I gave them an opportunity to learn, to get that kind of exposure because I thought it was--you never know how helpful it might be to some young person coming along.
Speaker 2: It resembles the program [Young Executives Program] that your wife [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and, you know --
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's different.
Speaker 2: It's different but the results kind of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, right, exactly.
Story_ID: 535932
Speaker 1: How do you decide to leave academia and to go into cor- into the corporate world?  Was it your wife's [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton]--seeing her on all these boards?
Speaker 2: No, I was on as many boards as she was.
Speaker 1: You were on as many boards as well, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  No, see, I'd been on corporate boards since--when I went on my first board in 1969, there were only three blacks.  I was one of the three in the United States on corporate boards.  So it was Cliff Weaver [Robert C. Weaver] and Sam Pierce [Samuel R. Pierce, Jr.] and myself.
Speaker 1: And which board was that?
Speaker 2: Equitable [Equitable Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial].  Yeah, yeah, and, and it--the, but it's--so I went on Equitable, Ford [Ford Motor Company] and all the others.  I mean I--but it was not--so we both were on a lot of corporate boards.  In fact, I guess it was Newsweek.  Yeah, they had a picture of us once and the story about--they said, you know, we only meet in airports.  It was an exaggeration, and I kept telling them that that's not true.  But they said we were the high, high-wire fliers in Corporate America.  Well, at any rate, but, no, but I always maintained a ceiling on my outside activities.  But, no, I--the reason why I was attracted here was that first and foremost, again, it was more logical than what it would seem, just like becoming a head of a university.  The primary customer for TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York] is academe, all right.  And it never--I don't think they've ever had a chairman and CEO who've been a university president.  But besides that I had run huge operations.  In personnel terms, this was small.  It was smaller than Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] (laughter), not nearly as big as SUNY [State University New York System].  Asset wise, it's big, okay.  But our customer base is predominantly people in the academic world, all right.  So when I came in here--I never will, (laughter) I never will forget it.  We had some issue that arose, and somebody was--made a presentation to the executive cabinet.  And after, I was asking him all these questions.  After he got out in the hall, we were going down the elevator, and he said, he said, "How did you know all that, those questions?"  And I said, "Look," I said, "I've been on a corporate board."  I said, "You know, (laughter) and one of them was an insurance company."  I said, "I know (laughter) what's going on."
Story_ID: 535933
Speaker 1: But it's--for me, coming here was absolutely great fun.  I mean, I enjoyed it largely because I knew almost, very quickly what needed to be done.  And it was not, I didn't have--my learning curve here was very short in terms of what--it was, it was almost like, you know, I, I'd done this before.  And the, and the changes that I was able to produce.  But one thing I'm most proud of at Teachers [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York] was that I actually produced massive changes with no loss in morale, no firing of individuals, using--except in one instance, the people inside to do all the changes.  And it was great.  The only--I had to use one outside consulting group simply because I could not personally do all of it together.  That was for our computers.  But for everything else, I used inside groups.  And I knew that they all knew what needed to change and how to do it.  And we worked on it and got it done.  And it--we just, I just completely changed the situation.  But as I say, what I'm most proud of is, I energized the people.  There was no loss in morale, and in fact, I think it improved.  No massive firings and any of that.  And, just went just like that.  And I doubled the assets in six years.  Now, it was--and people, they just--the thing was this is kind of indicative--I think maybe indicative.  I did a tour (laughter) of all six--three buildings, my shipboard tour.  And afterwards, I said to the man in charge of the buildings who was--let me just stop a minute so I can change this (changes tape).  The, the man who's in, the man who's in charge of the buildings, after he finished, I said to him, I said, "I think I know which units in the company are giving us the greatest problems."  He said, "Yeah, which?"  And I had a list.  He said, those are the--I said, yeah.  He said, "How'd you know that?"  I said, "I can tell you right now."  I said, "I wouldn't wanna come to work there."  We had areas which were dense, crowded, dark, terrible.  The density was huge in some parts.  I said, and then I asked our personnel people, I said, "What's the turnover rate?"  When I arrived, I discovered we had a 28.6 percent turnover rate at personnel, particularly at the lower levels.  I said, "Do you realize what the cost of that is?"  And so I went to the board, and I said, "Look," I said, "without changing the budgets," I said, "I want to get your approval on doing a systematic reconfiguration of the building, the offices, the density, the appearance," and so on.  So we started bit by bit.  We went through, through the three buildings.  We made the changes in terms of density, lightness and so on.
Story_ID: 535934
Speaker 1: And then I kept track.  Every time we made a change in one of the major areas, turnover rates dropped.  By the time I finished, I think we had a turnover rate of 6 percent.  And I said, look, I said, this was not rocket science.  I said, you want a place where people want to come to work.  It's both physical as well as human.  I said, the human is the way you treat them.  I said, but the physical is what's the environment like?  You know, so if you look at this floor, okay.  This was redone, okay.  Who did it?  My wife [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], working with the, with the decorators and the architects.  And the next three floors are all like that.  And people enjoyed it.  I mean, you know, this is nice.  I mean it's, it's one of those things, and it's not--there's no book that says, oh, you--but it's a case of where, from my standpoint, you have to ask yourself the basic questions.  And so, we did it, and everybody went, "Wow, this is great.  We love it."  But that was, but it was a, it was really a nice--it was a fitting climax on the, on my career.  But the aspect of it which was really probably the most interesting from a standpoint of the history, when I was chosen as chairman and chief executive here, I became the first black chairman and CEO of a Fortune 100 company.  The press didn't cover it (laughter).  And The New York Times did a story about my appointment [as CEO of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York], didn't even mention it.  So I called up a friend of mine at The New York Times.  I said, you know, I said, "You folks missed a little point."  And he said, you know, he said, "You have been a figure in terms of your standing and position.  It just didn't come up (laughter)."  I said, that's nice, but I said, "You've gotta think about the broader issues."  So then subsequently, they did another, they did another story and they mentioned it in passing that I was the first black.  But that's one of the reasons why sometimes within the black community, they're always surprised to find out that I was the first.  They think about the current crop, but a few times people would say, no, there was another one before you.  And, really?  And then they realize that this happened.  But it was--the press just didn't cover it.  It was really kind of intriguing, but, yeah.
Story_ID: 535935
Speaker 1: You talked about the broader, you know, the broader aspects.  Do you--have you, often with your career, thought about the broader implications of what you were doing, what they would mean for other African Americans that were, that were coming up behind you?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  That is to say, in every one of the pioneering positions that I've been in, I've always been very conscious of the fact that, that you're the first and you want to do everything that you can so that you do not do something wrong or inaccurate or that leads to that not happening again.  That's why I always say, I wanna see twos, threes, fours and fives.  But the point is that you do the best you can.  When I went to the School of Advanced International Studies [Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.], I was very conscious of the fact that I was the first black.  And I did--I sure didn't want it ever to be that I sort of performed badly and nobody could come in.  At Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], that was really under a microscope.  And everything we did, I have to tell you.  For the first year, year and a half, we [Wharton and his wife, HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] couldn't, literally, we couldn't do anything that wasn't covered by the press, both of us.  And people--those who were our detractors, were just looking to see if we would make a miscue or misstep.  It was that--but, again, I had to be--I was very conscious of this from my standpoint of not doing the wrong thing or making, making an egregious error or mistake, knowing all--that's very important.  Now, having said that, there's also the other issue which is that, for many individuals, they see accomplishment or achievements of this nature as only done where there's been sort of a demonstration of, of blackness or a demonstration of a, some kind where you go out and you, you chant. Well, you know, I, I happen to--I subscribe to--I love the title that [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks' book 'Choice of Weapons' ['A Choice of Weapons,' Gordon Parks].  My choice of weapons is, whatever talent and skills I have to integrate and compete and exceed in that universe, which is a different universe than, let's say, exceeding and excelling in the athletic universe or exceeding and excelling in the entertaining universe.  I'm exceeding in those universes, those three or four universities--universes where I have worked.  But that's integrating it and it's achieving it.  And it's opening it up for others.  But I don't do it by saying, okay, I've gotta march.  And that's not, that's not my comparative advantage.  I could do it, but my comparative advantage is in these other areas.  And I think it's very important to realize that there are multiplicity choices of weapons to be, to accomplish it.  You also, very often in those situations, need to, I believe, recognize the occasions when you can make a, an impact and a difference in what you do and how you do it with regard to the issues of race.

Speaker 1: I remember here at, at TIAA-CREFF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York], it was a very interesting one.  I needed to recruit a chief financial officer.  And so I canvassed many of my friends who were in the life insurance business.  And I said, who are the best chief financial officers?  And they would give me the names of different ones.  And it was one name that kept coming up.  And this was a name, Tom Jones [Thomas W. Jones].  And it turned out Tom Jones was black.  And I said, huh, I said, well, I said, so I called him on the phone.  And I told him who I was.  He knew who I was, and I said, you know, I said, I'm really--I'm interested in a chief financial officer.  I wonder if I could have a chance to chat with you.  And Tom said, he said, you know, he said I've been approached by many recruiting firms, and I very rarely ever talk to them.  He said, but you're the first CEO to ever call me directly.  So he came, and we chatted.  And I was tremendously impressed.  Now, he was the number two chief financial officer there in Boston [Massachusetts].  And so I (laughter), I said, so, he said to me after we'd been talking quite a while, he said, "You know who I am, don't you?"  And I said, "No.  Should I?"  He said, "Well," he said, he said, "Willard Straight Hall."  "Oh," I said.  Now, Willard Straight Hall is in Cornell University [Ithaca, New York], and if you remember, there was that incident where the black students took over Willard Straight Hall.  And then when they finally left the building, they were wearing bandoliers and a rifle, okay.  That was Tom Jones, bandolier and rifle.  So he said, "Does that make a difference?"  I said, "Absolutely not."  Now, I then called up Jim Perkins [James A. Perkins] who was the president of Cornell at the time, and many people feel that Jim lost his presidency because of this incident.  So I called up Jim Perkins and, because Jim is a dear friend, and he--on committees and commissions with me.  And I said, "Jim," I said, "I want you to know I'm, I'm gonna hire Tom Jones as chief financial officer."  And Jim Perkins had been a trustee at TIAA-CREFF.  And he said, "I think that's wonderful."  And he said, "I would like," he said, "I'd like to see him."  I said, "Well, I'll--let me see if I can set it up."  So I told Tom that he wanted--he wanted to see him too.  And I wish to this day I'd had a tape-recording of the meeting.  We had a--I had them for lunch here at Teachers.  And the conversation was incredible where they were reliving the experience from their separate perspectives, and they hadn't met before that.  Now, about a couple of years later, Jim Perkins died.  In the interim, Tom Jones went on the board of trustees of Cornell University.  He was working here as chief financial officer.  And he then--when Jim Perkins died, Tom Jones endowed an annual award at Cornell for the individuals who did the most at Cornell to promote racial amity, named for Jim Perkins.  Now, here at Teachers when he was hired, I made it clear to everybody.  I said, "I hired the best."  He wasn't here more than three or four months, everybody said, "He is phenomenal."  And he was.  I didn't recruit--I recruited excellence.  But he was black, but boy, he was superb.  And when I left, he became--when Biggs [John H. Biggs] became chairman and CEO, he became the number two person until he was hired away by Citibank [Citibank, N.A.].  But again, there are impacts that you make and the way in which you approach it.
Story_ID: 535937
Speaker 1: Well, this is a good place to insert this question.  What are your feelings, and your feelings about affirmative action, and we can break it down if you'd like, in education, for Corporate America (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it's--
Speaker 1: --or just broadly (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think that too much, I think too much attention is paid to labeling and defining as opposed to what it is that will help achieve the goal.  It goes back to what I said at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  No matter what you describe it as, there is, there's no question but what.  There are barriers that need to be overcome, both institutionally and individually.  Now, the steps that you have to take to overcome them, I don't care what the label is that you put them on.  But one thing, to me, is very clear, and that is that you can, you can help to level the competitive playing field a great deal and then proceed.  But you don't have to in a sense have, what I would call, automaticity of, of how the approach is taking place.  I was--I'll have to tell you, I was not surprised at what happened at Michigan State.  When we put the programs in place to see to it that we dealt with those areas of deficiency, but we knew that the students were bright.  They were able.  We offset that.  And to me, if you say--let's say, you award, you have aid for students based upon need.  Now, what are you doing when you do that?  You're saying, not everybody can afford to go.  So you're correcting a deficiency.  You're not saying, this is an affirmative action aid.  No, you say it's need based.  So I get hung up--I don't get hung up on labels as much as I do on what it is you want to accomplish that needs to be done so that you get the end result that you want.  And to me, the end result is to see to it that you achieve, that the individuals have the opportunity to achieve to the best of their ability, to acquire what they need so that they can succeed in life.  Now, at the same time, with my background obviously, I have a very strong commitment to excellence.  But I don't believe that excellence is limited exclusively to those who in, I would say in terms of the traditional measures, are, you know, all Phi Beta Kappa [Phi Beta Kappa Society].  I had a prize when I taught in Asia, that I gave to every class.  One--I had two prizes.  One was for the prize for the student who had the best scores.  The second prize for the student who showed the greatest progress.  And I never will forget the first year I did this.  There was a young man in the class, and, the British system which they had in place then was one where, at the end of the first year, if you did not reach a particular level, you were not able to go for honors.  And in Malaysia, it made a difference in terms of what career path you could choose.  If you were honors, you got one career path.  If you didn't have honors, you got another one.  And this young man was, I think, two or three points below that cut off, and there were two in the same category.  And at the faculty meeting, I argued very strongly that this young man should be able to try for honors.  I said, because I'll tell you, in my class, he started at the bottom, I said, and he--to work, he worked hard.  Now, he was not a pyrotechnic brilliant, but, boy, he got--and he was almost at that point.  I said, he deserves to get this.  And he showed it.  Well, they finally let him in, but then discovered, his father, I think was a groundskeeper on the university campus.  But to me, that's excellence also.  I mean it's not just that, you know, here, he was doing what he had and he showed progress.  I said, you know, I said, I have to tell you, I said, I know from my experience at some universities, you admit geniuses and you graduate geniuses, and you say, look at what we did (laughter).  You know, well, okay.  But, no, there's, there's more to it than that.  So, to me, it's the end result that is the most important.  And I have a problem with people saying, well, I've gotta put a label on it.  Okay, you label it, but I wanna see what's underneath, what you really are doing in terms of achievement.
Story_ID: 535938
Speaker 1: I want to, at this point, talk, I mean we were talking some about your philosophy.  But I wanna continue in that vein and just to--and at this point in your career, in looking back, do you still--do you have hopes for the African American community?  Where do you see the community?  Do you have hopes for it and what are your hopes for it?
Speaker 2: Now, that's--that requires a lot of discussion, mainly because, first of all, I'm, I'm not--I'm no longer in a, in a kind of, what I would call even a leadership position within, within the fields that I've been in.  I'm known, but I'm not in a leader position.  And you tend to, well, I think, look at things from your historic perspective as opposed to what is current.  So I have concerns.  There's absolutely no question in my mind that there has been incredible, incredible progress on the part of some sectors within the black community in a variety of arenas, no question about it.  My greatest concern is the areas that have been neglected where there is a hardcore, I would say, subculture that has, has adopted highly negative characteristics for its own sake; negative in terms of such things as the value of education, the importance of education.  And I'll stick with that.  That, to me, is a source of great concern because there is, in my book, nothing that can be replaced in terms of the basic set of competencies and skills that an individual needs for their own enlightenment, life and personal achievement.  That worries me a great deal.  And I know that it's very unpopular to criticize it because the criticism is somehow taken as being anti-black.  It's not.  It's the--I was interviewed in Boston [Massachusetts] not too long ago where I'd given a speech.  And I was interviewed by a reporter from The Bay State Banner which is a black newspaper.  And the founder and publisher [HistoryMaker Melvin Miller] of it is a friend who really was a close friend of my brother--younger brother's.  And during the interview, he and I were sitting, and the reporter was interviewing me.  And the owner and publisher and founder and I were talking about, sort of yesteryear and what life was like in Boston.  And it was very interesting because I think the younger reporter was fascinated by our description of what was involved and one of the things we talked about was, there was no question within the black community and all income class levels; education was absolutely, critically important.  There was not even a debate about it.  That was, you know, what you strived for.  Today, unh-uh.  It's not nearly the same degree.  And so we talked about that.  But it's a very--and it's easy for me to say having been in academe, you know, this is important.  But it goes beyond that.
Story_ID: 535939
Speaker 1: Well, from your standpoint, how, in such a short amount of time could that happen?  From, you know, the educational--people's, black people's points of view about the importance of it?  How in such a short amount of time could it go from what it was in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I don't think it's short.  There have been forces that work on--I think, first of all, you're asking for a whole sociological analysis, but I have spoken on this a number of times where there is a, an issue of intergenerational communication and influence and peer communication and influence.  And the sources of influence on values and preferences and attitudes is significantly greater between peers today than it ever was thirty or forty years ago.  So that it's--they leapfrog.  They don't deal with either the institutional or the inter- or the generational.  For example--and I've given a lot of speeches on this.  If you were to ask young people in London [England], Tokyo [Japan], Rome [Italy], you name it, Manila [Philippines], you give them the names of some of the current rock stars or musical stars or what.  They all feel the same.  They have the same--they're taught patterns of clothing, communication.  It's peer, it's peer.  I have to explain it by the businesses, but it's peer.  So that there is--and I believe that that has had an effect on many of these values.  It's true, particularly, within the black community.  They--the individuals want to belong, they want to belong to that group.  They don't care that if their pant, style of dressing has come from prisons.  It's because everybody else is doing it.  That's the culture.  That's the peer interaction.  So that is one aspect of it, and, and then the other thing is that, given the fact that the society still has not satisfactorily dealt with the forces and factors that are creating this hardcore, neglected, underprivileged group, they have formed their own hard shell of resistance to it because that's their, that's their world.  The wider community was shocked in Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] with New Orleans [Louisiana] where they suddenly discovered who are these people that suddenly didn't have ability to get out of New Orleans, you know.  And, it was a--many, many whites were just absolutely amazed.  But within the black community they knew it was there.  But the society has not dealt with those satisfactorily.  And so that, that hard set of values is in there, and it takes forms of, you don't act white or don't do that because that's not part of the culture.  And, and so you don't want to put yourself in a position.  If you're in that group, you don't want to say, I'm gonna be different and go outside of it because then you're ostracized, you're attacked, sometimes physically.  It's very hard.  One of the things which--we're diverging a bit, but not quite.  One of the Presidential Fellows, one of the first Presidential Fellows that I had at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] is a professor at Michigan State University now.  His field is urban gangs.  The research that he does, he will make your hair stand on end, literally.  And he has an understanding of what's going on in that, in that sector amazingly.  And it's very frightening in terms of this incrustation.  But I, I do not put the blame on the victim.  There are some, some blame there, but a lot of it is the fact that our society is not dealing with this.  They're just not dealing with it at all.  And, and I think we will, we're gonna pay for it in terms of what is happening, both to those individuals in that sector, but also in the wider society.  And it's too bad because I think there are those who could do something, but are very reluctant to put themselves in the position of dealing with it.
Story_ID: 535940
Speaker 1: This is just along the same line of philosophy, but do you have any opinions, one way or the other about the debate about reparations?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I don't really--it's not a, it's a way of, I suspect, a way of getting additional visibility and recognition to the issue.  I mean it's not a--no, I, I--and, you see, to me, the things, some of the things that are going on with regard to--what is the change in the tax structure, for example, right now?  The way in which the current administration is persisting with a tax structure that, in fact, gives significantly greater benefits to the wealthy versus the poor, to me, that's--you can talk about reparations, but that's, you know, worse.  I mean it's, that where, you see, I keep coming back to what I think are some of the more basics of where you are.  You could achieve what is being talked of in reparations, by getting taxes to be more progressive, (unclear) much more, much more thoroughly, you know.  But, no, no.  Well, it's, to me, it's a very--I, I have a, as you can tell, I have a tendency to go to the, to what I call gut issue and the gut force that really is gonna make the change.  Some of it is cosmetic.  It's not that you say it isn't worth it or deserved, but you could wipe out a whole series of things.  If you looked at the, if you looked at the size of the expenditure being made on the war in Vietnam [sic.] today, just think of the alternative ways in which that money could have been spent.  It's mindboggling, and I mean spent in terms of improvements in the United States.  Never mind about security, just, just improvements.  I mean it's mindboggling.  And you could deal with issues of the, the negative (unclear) of taxes, you could do all sorts of things, schools.  No Child Left Behind [No Child Left Behind Act of 2001], but you don't fund it.  I mean, you could fund it several times over.  I mean it's just incredible to me that we don't deal with that issue in terms of the black community saying, look, this is, this is where the real payoff is gonna be.
Story_ID: 535941
Speaker 1: So, as you look back over your career, over the, the three different aspects of--what, what, what stands out for you as some memorable events or occasions?
Speaker 2: It'd be very hard to say.
Speaker 1: Very hard?
Speaker 2: Very hard to say.  I mean it's not--
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I'll ask, of the things you've done, what are you most proud of?
Speaker 2: Oh, my marriage.  That's an easy one, yeah, yeah.  No, it's, it--and I would have to say that you--there's a great deal--most people would probably not agree, but I believe that very often, there's also a great deal of serendipity in what happens to an individual.  Yes, you have to have intelligence, and you have to have, you know, training, and you may--but sometimes things happen right at that particular time when it's, it's ready, you know.  And, and in my case, I've been in a position where, with, with my wife, Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], we've been at that stage, many times in terms of what we were ready to do.  And it came along, bingo.  And we were there.  I could never have imag- I could never have imagined that when I graduated from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] that I would become a university president.  Just never occurred to me.  I would never have thought that I would have become chairman and CEO of one of the largest corporations [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York] in the United States.  Never even occurred to me, but it was an opportunity that occurred, and bingo, I was there.  Now, I might have been there, and I wasn't ready.  Or I might have been there or wasn't ready--I was ready but the situation wasn't ready.  You can't, you can't always predict those.  And I think many times, people sort of say, well, you plan things.  Yeah, you plan, but it's, it's a question of where you are in terms of your own growth, maturity, development and the situations that emerge.  But, but I'm not, I'm not arrogant enough to think, oh, well, you know, it would have happened anyway.  I'm not so sure.
Story_ID: 535942
Speaker 1: Well, you said before that you were, that you felt now that you're retired, you're not in the leadership positions that you were before, but what do you think, what do you think n- that you are doing now that is still important for the advancement of African Americans?
Speaker 2: Well, there I would say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Clubs, organizations.
Speaker 2: The--I would say there it's really the--my book ['Privilege and Prejudice: The Life of a Black Pioneer,' Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], largely because I, I'm, I'm regularly--I used to be, not as much now.  But I used to be always asked things like, "How did you do that?"  Or, "What was it like?"  Or like one of the questions is, "Do you still experience discrimination?"  And when I tell 'em, "Yes," they're, "Really?"  You know, and they don't understand how, how it works.  "Well, what do you do?"  Well, the--it's--and so one of the reasons--not the only reason, but one of the reasons for writing the book is my autobiography is to sort of lay it out so people can see what, what it was like, and what happened, and why I did things or why things occurred or what I thought about these various things.  The (laughter)--I remember one speech that my wife gave.  We went back to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]--this is after we'd been there quite some time and left, and we went back and we had sort of an extemporaneous, they asked us to say a few words.  And Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] got up and said she was pleased to be back.  She said, because I can remember when I came here, there were a lot of--there were a few people who thought that we didn't--we were gonna eat mashed potatoes with our fingers.  I mean, you know, it, but it, you know, you get--there is a whole set of attitudes that you have to encounter.  And one of the things which I do have in, at least a current draft is, the role which negative expectations play.  I have, I don't think I have ever been in a new situation or a new environment in which there is not some element of negative expectations that I'm gonna fail or not succeed.  This is not within me.  I'm talking just generally.  They, they see you, and say, you're black.  Therefore, you, you can't do it.  Or they expect you to--and it's--I've gotten so used to it, I just, just take it as a matter of course.  And it is.  And it's always there.  It is always there.  I don't care who you are.  And it's not until you suddenly, bingo, get them to sort of wake up that it registers.  The--I remember, I remember one incident which maybe encapsulates it a bit.  When I was a student at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and still thinking about becoming a [U.S.] Foreign Service officer like my father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.], and there was a young man that was at the same dinner table with me.  And I, I had a date, and he had a date, and we were not dating together, but we just happened to be sitting at the table together.  So I was asking him, you know, what was he studying?  So he said he was studying poli- political science, and I said, well, what are you gonna do?  He said, oh, he said, he said--no, this was, trying to figure out who he was.  No, it was there, yeah.  And--no, it was not there.  It was at SIS [School of Advanced International Studies; Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.]. And he said, well, he said, well, where did you--what do you wanna do?  I said, I wanna go in Foreign Service like my father.  He said, you're gonna go to the Foreign Service?  Yeah.  So he said, well, where did you prepare?  So I said, Harvard.  He said, well, Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] is not a very good school.  He thought I had said Howard because I was black.  See, that's the negative expectation.  It's that sort of fact that you automatically are seen in that way.  But, you get used to that.  I mean I do, I mean it's just, it just--and I, the--by the time you've passed them by, they suddenly realize, what happened?  You know, where, you know, but it's, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 535943
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So as your father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] grew older and saw some of your accomplishments, what were some of the things he said to you about what you'd done?
Speaker 2: Oh, he just said, you know, "You far exceeded anything I expected," yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your father--what has been your father's legacy in the [U.S.] Foreign Services?
Speaker 2: Well, the end of this month, we're going to Washington [D.C.], and there's a stamp for my father being issued.  There are six what they call Distinguished American Diplomats.  And he's one of the six.  And we're very tickled about that because there will be several people whom I know or he knew and so on who are in this group of the legends, as they call them, the six legends of Foreign Service.  And that's very nice, and unfortunately, they only do it when the person is dead, but, but it's, that's very touching that he's being remembered.  But it was--his career was incredible, in my mind, because it was not, it was not easy.  I don't know if I--did I tell you what happened with his career and how it started because it was very--not a easy one.  And when he finally did break through it was quite, quite something.  So it's nice for him to be recognized, yeah.
Story_ID: 535944
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I--that's not for me to say, not for me to say (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, well, what do you wanna be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Not even that, no.
Speaker 1: Not even that, no (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, I, no, I, I--no, I don't--that's not one of those things.  I, I'm always amused at the presidents in their second term, well, what's gonna be your legacy?  I say, oh, (unclear), if you spend your time on that, you can spend, spend too much and not, not get to it.  I, I don't--I, I personally I've always felt that in, in virtually every job and position I've had, I've had the satisfaction of knowing that I tried to do the very best that I could.  And if in the process, certain things happen or certain things are left behind, great.  But I did what I had to do in terms of what I thought was to the exce- the best and excellent job I could, in that time, in that period where I was.  And then afterwards let the historians decide on, you know, what did or didn't occur.  The--I had a visitor from Albany [New York] just the other day and on a different subject, and he was saying, they're still talking about the Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] golden years in SUNY [State University of New York System].  Well, that's nice, you know, but it's, it's not, it's not that I said, oh, I want to do that.  No, no, or I want that.  No, it's--all I want is that they said, you did the very best that you could, you know, fine.  That's good enough for me.
Story_ID: 535945
Speaker 1: So are you optimistic about the future of African Americans?  Do you think it's something that we can get a (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know.  I mean I think--and that sounds harsh, but I--there's no question but what as I said before, the, there are a very significant, increasing number of younger blacks in the subsequent generation who are doing very well.  They're accomplishing a great deal.  So I'm not worried about that at all.  I am worried about the other subset.  I am, and I, I'm worried about it simply because I think that not enough is being done to really try to deal with the forces and factors that are at work.  And they're multi-variant.  They're not just one variable.  It's multi-variant and you've got to find ways of dealing with it.  But I would also have to say that my far greater personal concern is not just blacks.  It is the fact that today, globally, we have a growing pattern of, of racial and ethnic separation, based upon difference which is designed to increase the perceptions of difference, which leads to hostility, hatred and violence.  So that it's within cultures and without cultures.  When you have Muslims fighting Muslims in Iraq and you have Catholics fighting Protestants in Israel--in Ireland and you've got, you know, the inside groups, and then there're groups between groups.  And it's all rooted in this horrific pattern of you're different, and therefore, I don't like you.  I hate you.  And I'm going to, and I--everything is done.  I gave a talk not too long ago, I think, where I talked about, there was a wonderful movie where the--there were two tribes back in the Neanderthal days, and they didn't--nobody spoke, and they only grunted, you know.  And one tribe was a little darker than the other tribe.  And, and it was wonderful to watch.  And this whole thing, just exactly what's going on in the world today, really.  And you say, good Lord, you know, it's going back to the beginnings.  They--if you're different, you're not part of my group.  You don't believe what I do.  You don't wear the clothes that I do.  You don't like the clothes that I have, the food that I have, and you're different and I'm gonna hate you, you know.  And if I hate you, I'm gonna attack you, you know.  And as I point out in this speech, the genetic difference between, among human beings is, in fact, less than the genetic difference among monkeys.  But because we are only--I think it's two-tenths or something like that or nine-tenths of a percent different, and we're still acting like it's huge.  And we're create--and much of it is man created.  That, to me, is the most serious thing we face in the globe today, really.  I just think we are not really addressing what the--how to overcome the negativity that is involved in these differences that exists between us.  And it's, it's gonna be the destruction of a lot of people because it's just not being dealt with.  It's being enhanced, encouraged, and it's not good.

Speaker 1: So my very last question for today is, you were a history major.  You started off as a history major is, if you can explain to me and the--and I'm asking for the broader context of, you know, fifty years from now people will have these tapes--as to why history is important and specifically, more as to why oral histories are important?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know about the first.  The second, I think oral histories are always very interesting because it gives you a, a less structured insight into the individual.  And it's one thing to carefully craft and explain events and happenings.  It's another just to talk informally, and you get a different, different perception of the individual.  My, my wife [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] is my greatest critic on my speeches.  And if she'd have her way, I would never use a written speech.  But it's two different speeches, I know.  But I learned early on that if you're going to be criticized for what you said or didn't say, it's better to have it written (laughter) because then you could always say, this is not what I said.  This is what I said.  But, but I do think that that's one of the great advantages of oral history, yeah, um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, you've accomplished a lot, and we greatly appreciate your being a part of The HistoryMakers (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I enjoyed being, being part of this.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.

My next career was in higher education, and my next career was in the field of business.  But continuing throughout that period I've also had an involvement in U.S. foreign policy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's gonna be hard--okay.  If you--if there was one way of categorizing you, what would you choose?  Would you cho- it would be hard.

Story_ID: 535949
Speaker 1: Dr. Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], I consider you unique because you come from a background, a very, sort of long and illustrious background.  And I'd like you to talk about your background on your father's [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] side.  Can we start out by that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, my father, his family originated in Virginia.  And it's a very interesting family.  My great-great-grandfather was a free Negro in Accomac [Virginia] which is on the peninsula, Delmarva Peninsula.  And, but my father was born in Baltimore [Maryland], and then as a young man, a young boy, he moved with his father [William Bowman Wharton] to Boston [Massachusetts].  He attended English High School [Boston, Massachusetts], went to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  He went straight from high school to law school which you could do in those days.  He received both his bachelor's in law and his master's in law.  He joined a law firm for a few years in Boston.  But he was not happy with the situation and so he applied to, for a job in Washington, D.C., became a law clerk in the [U.S.] Department of State, and then took the U.S. Foreign Service exam.  And that was the very first year that the examination was given.  A legislation had been passed to--and work toward having a more merit-based Foreign Service.  It had been in those older days, largely what they used to call the white shoe group, the establishment group in the United States.  And so they had an examination system.  And my father applied, took the examination, and he was the first black to pass the U.S. Foreign Service exam.  However, when he passed the exam, it created quite a bit of consternation in the Department of State.  And at that time, the legislation had also created or established a Foreign Service Institute which was a, an operation created to provide a year's training for the graduates or the persons who have finished the exam successfully, to receive training in being a diplomat.  And so the department didn't know what to do with my father.  So what they did was, they decreed that he had taken the examination, gave him his diploma and told him (laughter), now, you can leave, go to Liberia and Africa which created tremendous consternation within the black community at the time.  There were front-page articles, cartoons, et cetera talking about the treatment that my father received from the Department of State.  But that's how he launched his career.  He went overseas with my mother [Harriette Banks Wharton], and it was very interesting because this meant that he began his work as a diplomat without receiving the exact same kind of training which the others who had graduated with him in the examination, had received.
Story_ID: 535950
Speaker 1: Can we go back to your father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] a little bit (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Surely.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what he--what stories you remember or did he talk about his growing up at all?  Do you remember any stories?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, I think the most important or significant aspects of my father's life were that his mother [Rosalind Wharton] and sibling, his sister [Enola Wharton], were killed in a fire in Boston [Massachusetts] which had quite an impact on my grandfather [William Bowman Wharton].  And also, I don't, I believe that my father's major--I've often asked myself, what was his primary motivation?  What made him so driven?  For example, he was one of the founders and the first president of one of the black sororities created in Boston.  He was on the track team.
Speaker 1: Which soror- what fraternity was it?
Speaker 2: I think it was Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity].  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: It was Alphas, okay.
Speaker 2: But he was on the track team.  He was on the boxing team.  He was--he was a very energetic person, very bright, extremely brilliant person.  And, but he also, I think it's important to--he had individuals within his family who themselves, many--quite a few of them were extremely successful individuals.  He had an uncle who had, who became a minister of a church in Virginia, whose wife was a post mistress.  The minister was very successful in creating a program to enable the parishioners in his church to buy the land on which they were working as, as sharecroppers.  And I've forgotten the total number.  I have it in my forthcoming book ['Privilege and Prejudice: The Life of a Black Pioneer,' Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.].  But he, I think enabled, I don't know, thousands of the members of his parish to be able to buy their, their lands and become farmers.  Not too long ago, I tracked back where he was and found the church where he had worked.  And they had named the church for him [Wharton Memorial Baptist Church, Nelson, Virginia], which is really fascinating.  Now, that individual, for example, he had a son who was a physician, two grandsons who were physicians.  And they were very successful.  There was another who was extremely successful in terms of land ownership.  The, one of his grand- one of his great uncles owned, was an extremely large landowner in Virginia and created--donated the land for the first black public school for the children in the district.  I mean there were a lot of different things that they did.  He had another uncle who became a physician in Baltimore [Maryland].  His sisters became superintendents of schools.  So it's a very interesting, interesting family.  If you come all the way down to the present, one of my relatives and cousins, my father's cousins is Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel].  So it's a very, it's an interesting, it's a very interesting family.  On his mother's side, there were several members of his mother's family who were quite successful.  So it was a very--it was an interesting background which I think, as I think about it a great deal, I think it gave him an awareness that accomplishment was possible, that he could strive and perhaps succeed.  And it also, I think explained why he was determined to excel in what he did.  So I had a great admiration for him.
Speaker 1: Now, you're saying his mother and his sister--are you saying there was a fire that--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, his mother and his sister were killed in a fire--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Boston, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what age was he?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: I think he was probably about ten, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you know the circumstances of the fire?
Speaker 2: No, it was just a fire, and my grandfather saved my father, but was not able to save his wife and his daughter.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he was there because it was a--my grandfather's oldest brother was a grocer and went and moved (unclear). He became--opened a very successful grocery store in Boston.  I mean it was a very--as I say, it was an interesting family.
Speaker 1: Now, one other question I have for you.  Just on the, I think it was the uncle with sons who went to medical school.  Where were they going to medical school?  Do you know?  Was there any documentation--?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  I know the two grandsons went to Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] and I knew both of them, particularly the younger grandson, who--and I subsequently had a wonderful experience with him in Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama], so (laughter). But, but it was a--one thing I should mention which I think is relevant.  My, my father's father, my grandfather, looked completely white.  So that you would not have realized he was black unless he told you.  Now, my father's mother, however, was, was very strongly Indian, American Indian [Native American].  And so it was a very interesting mix.
Story_ID: 535951
Speaker 1: But it was--I would say that era--this was at the turn of the century, great deal of the migration of blacks from the South, particularly to Boston [Massachusetts], was largely motivated by the desire to secure a solid education for their children.  This has come out very recently, for example, in a very interesting article in the Boston weekly newspaper, the Bay State Banner, which described the tremendous impact and desire for education among the very small number of blacks who were in Boston at that period of time.  And it was pervasive, the whole area.  And the number of individuals that, who came out of that particular background--getting off it a bit, but, for example, in our immediate neighborhood, we had judges, we had a medical physician, we had lawyers.  For example, Carl McCall [HistoryMaker H. Carl McCall], he lived three blocks away from us.  He was a playmate of my brother's, my younger brother's.  There was Wade McCree [Wade H. McCree], who became solicitor general.  All of us, all came from that area in Boston at different ages.  And it was a very interesting community at that time.  And that, also, but that was not my father's [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] generation, it was my generation.  But that had that kind of impact on--
Story_ID: 535952
Speaker 1: Now, my mother, for example, she--my grandmother [Mary Pratt Hicks] was a chef.  She was a single mother.  She had my mother and my uncle.  My mother went to, was very smart--a bright student.  She was encouraged to go to college.  She went to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], which is where she met my father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.].  And my father's law degree was obtained in the same graduation as my mother received her degree in chemistry.  And my mother then became a professor or a teacher at Virginia State [Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].  But after they married, then she became a, a mother and a housewife.  But subsequent to that, when she came back to the states, and subsequently, at the time, my mother and my father were divorced, my mother became a school teacher for a number of years in Boston [Massachusetts].  Then she became a social worker, and a social work supervisor.  So there's a very interesting, again, background in terms of education.  My mother got her master's in social work, for example.  And, but it was, it was an environment which I think nurtured academic achievement and commitment and education.  And that was a very important part of the life of those days.
Speaker 2: Now, give me your mother's name?
Speaker 1: Harriette Banks Wharton.
Speaker 2: Okay, and the other thing, with her--now, did she, did her family also originate in Virginia?
Speaker 1: No, the, the--I don't, I never met (laughter), I never met my grandfather [Albert Banks], although I discovered after he died that he was in New York [New York] at the same time.  He was, he owned a very successful restaurant in New York, in Harlem [New York, New York].  And I never met him.  But, but he was--again, I have no, not a great deal of information about him at all.  But he was a very large man.  That I know because my uncle was quite big and quite strong.
Story_ID: 535953
Speaker 1: But it was, it was a period I would say in American history which had some fascinating aspects to it in terms of the relationships be- among blacks within the community as well as between blacks and whites.  And there was a, a fascinating aspect to it which was that--and I've written about this a bit, when we came back to the United States from being overseas, we were members of a church in Boston [Massachusetts], St. Augustine's Church.  And I was always struck by the fact that whenever any of us, the young people succeeded in something that they heard about--for example, if a young girl or a boy in the church was admitted to one of the, one of the good Ivy League schools, the entire congregation was just thrilled.  And they would, they would praise and say, how, what--and it really was, quite sincere about it.  And it was wonderful to have that sort of community reinforcement about the way in which the individuals achieved.  And the other day, Carl McCall [HistoryMaker H. Carl McCall] was, we were having dinner with him and his wife--Dolores [Wharton's wife, HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I--and he was saying how when he was growing up, everybody knew who I was.  You know, it was, it was--you know, I didn't realize this.  But it was the way in which the community functioned in terms of aspiration, which I think is very significant.
Speaker 2: You know, I was just talking about that the other day, about how that used to be, you know, part of our tradition.  But you--the period you're talking about when you said it's a fascinating period, the early 1900s, right, is that the period?
Speaker 1: Well, there's a--from the 1900s through until--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry--not--I'm talking about the early--the 19th--20th century, but early 20th.
Speaker 1: Yes, well, then also down through--I would say it was characteristic, at least in Boston, until World War II [WWII], yeah.
Story_ID: 535954
Speaker 1: Since we're talking about your mother [Harriette Banks Wharton], can you first talk about what type of person she was and what stories--you said that she was a child of a single, a single parent?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What, what stories do you remember her talking about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, she, she was encouraged in school by her mother [Mary Pratt Hicks].  She used to do, she used to do work for her mother before she went to school.  She--but it was a, it was really--I would say much of her experience that I know about was after she was married because, for example, I have most of her diaries before she was born--before she was married.  And they're fascinating because they describe her first trip abroad with my father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] to his first post in Liberia.  And there she was, I think she was only twenty-one, twenty-two years old.  This was just the two of them, and her reactions to being in Europe and traveling by ship and so on.  It's fas- it was simply fascinating.  Her experiences in Liberia, what Liberia was like, the kind of people she interacted with were all interesting experiences for her.  Now, I've figured, I have calculated and figured out, I was conceived in Liberia, but I was born in Boston [Massachusetts] which created an interesting minor event recently where there was a cal- a calendar put out for 2000 in which they had me being (laughter) born in Liberia.  But that's okay.  But it was--but her early life with my father was really quite interesting because she was quite good in languages.  She was very good in French and Spanish.  And then when my father was posted to the Canary Islands [Spain] as counsel--this was in the early, in the early 1930s, there were no American schools for abroad anywhere.  There were no international schools, and the children of U.S. diplomats were tutored by correspondence course [Calvert School] which was headquartered in Baltimore [Maryland].  The school still exists, believe it or not.  And she tutored me.  And the, the interesting thing is I have my records for that period, which describes what, what my teachers' evaluations were of me at that time.  And I also have my mother's diaries which describes her reaction to my learning process.  And there're a number of interesting, sort of incidents which is that--for example, one of them is that in my mother's diary, she describes how I was--she started tutoring me, I guess, at three and a half.  And I was doing very well in everything except arithmetic.  And she couldn't understand why I could do so well in one subject, but not in arithmetic.  And as I was reading her diary, and I hadn't done that in many years, I suddenly remembered what the problem was.  And the problem was, very simply, in order to teach me to read, my mother had taught me to visualize the words as I was seeing them.  And I could read more quickly.  And, but when you get to arithmetic, she wanted me to visualize the numbers.  And I couldn't do it.  And one day in frustration, she said, like the numbers on the clock.  And my grandmother, who at the time was a chef for the Waltham Watch Factory [Waltham, Massachusetts], for the executive suites, had sent us a beautiful banjo clock which I still have, which she left to me in her will.  And this is the wonderful clock, and I looked at the clock and I'd visualize the numbers.  Well, what number comes after twelve?  It's one.  And I couldn't go beyond twelve.  And I suddenly realized that as a child--I probably was about four at the time, I solved the problem.  And to this day, which is very strange, if I visualize a series of numbers, starting with one, I see them as loops, and they go in loops, and they go from ten to twenty, twenty to thirty because I took the clock, and I broke it open, as a child.  And I said, I wish that she was still alive 'cause I could have told her now what the problem was that I had.  And, but I still, I visualize numbers and I will all the way up to a hundred in, in these loops, not in sequence.  But those are the kind of things that emerge when you (laughter), when you go through this sort of research.  But she was an excellent teacher, and she tutored me very, very well.
Story_ID: 535955
Speaker 1: We did have some home leave from time to time, not very often because in those days in the [U.S.] Foreign Service, you paid for your home leave, yourself, the travel, not by the state department [U.S. Department of State].  And on one of the home leaves was the first exposure that I had to racism in the United States.  When I came back, I was tested, and at my age, I should have been in the third grade.  But I had seventh grade reading, eighth grade geography.  I had second grade arith- math.  And the woman who tested me at the school, decided to put me in her class in the fourth grade.  And so in that class, any time that some student was not reading well, she would call on me, both to make me feel comfortable as a new student in the class, but also because she knew I could read very well.  Well, I did, and during recreation, release outdoors, a young white boy came up to me, and he says, "You think you're smart just because you're a nigger."  And I had never heard the word before.  And so I went home to my mother [Harriette Banks Wharton], and I said, said to her, this--I said, "What did he mean by that," (laughter)?  And my mother told me what the meaning was, and she said, "I want you to remember something."  She said, "That young boy was trying to put you into a box, into a box of discrimination and segregation," and said, "Don't ever let anybody put you in that box."  And I've always remembered that, that particular incident with my mother.  But there was another aspect of it.  She told me I should never use any word that I had not--did not understand.  And I came back from my first day in school, and she said I had a huge, long list of (laughter), of terrible language and curse words.  And I would use a word, and she'd say, don't use that.  And I'd use a word, she said, don't use that.  And I got to the word screw, and she said, "You mean like putting it into a wall?"  I said, "I don't think so," (laughter).  She said, "Well, don't use that word either."  But there are lots of incidents like that which, which came back.  But it was, it was interesting because my experience of living abroad until I was ten, primarily, in a, in a Spanish community, where many of the children were--had the same basic skin color that I did, meant that I did not have--I had not been injected with this issue of race.  And when I came back to the states, despite the experience in the fourth grade, I looked upon it as rather peculiar, very strange.  Why would people have these kind of views and attitudes?  I was subjected to it, no question about it.  But I, I had a--I had been almost inoculated from some of the excesses of my reaction to, to, to racism.  But I did come back to the states.  I lived with my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Pratt Hicks] because my parents stayed overseas with my siblings.
Story_ID: 535956
Speaker 1: Let me go, I just wanna ask, Dr. Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], because I think, tell me, back to your mother [Harriette Banks Wharton], do you--how would you describe her though, as a person?  Was she, you know, you said she was very smart, very good at languages.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But what was she, you know, what kind of person was she?
Speaker 2: She was a very, she was a person who thought very positively about things.  She was very popular, very well liked.  She had a very, wonderful, sort of personality, very much a mother.  She loved her children, all, all four of us.  She used to refer to us as her jewels in her crown.  She also was very strongly committed to education.  She was deeply in love with my father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] and both of them were, and we, it was--I had a, during those years I had an idyllic childhood.  It was just incredible.
Speaker 1: Now, your father, what kind of person would you describe him, you know, as--?
Speaker 2: Demanding, very fun-loving, capable of being at home sometimes, a prankster, loved to play golf, great golfer, played tennis too, was very, very much a diplomat, very smooth, very--there was a recent article in the [U.S.] Department of State magazine just last month where a former person who had worked with him was reacting to the postage stamp issue that included my father.  And the individual said, he was a diplomat's diplomat.  And he was, had a--was highly respected by his peers.  But, had a sharp mind, did not suffer fools gladly very often, but was a very loving father.  But he loved to play with us.  We'd go on picnics together and so on and do things together.  He was a very--that particular period was quite, quite ideal for, for all of us.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you have of your parents in you?  Have you thought about what you have, what of your mother you have in you, and what of your father?  Who are you most like?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know.  I really don't.  I think my wife [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] would probably (laughter) be able to tell you better than I do.  I think, I'm sure that I have some of both of them in me.  I suspect that in his own way, my father was probably tougher than I am, although it's hard to tell.  But I had tremendous admiration for my father because one of the things which my mother would do when, in the years when she was tutoring me was that she would include in the lessons, very often lessons about black history, which were not included in those days in the materials.  So she would tell me all about the great pio- black pioneers.  And she would--sometimes she'd tell, "Now, remember your father is one of those," you know.  And so I was aware, you know, what my father was accomplishing.  And that was important to me, not in a ego sense, but just in the sense that here was a person whom I--my father who was doing, at that time even, very unusual things in his lifetime.  And that was important.
Story_ID: 535957
Speaker 1: Now, your parents [Harriette Banks Wharton and Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] met at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] as you said (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know what--did they say how they met at Boston and what attracted them to each other?  Did you ever--?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  The--although I will say that when, when they married, it was--'caused some discussion in Boston [Massachusetts] because my father was light skinned, and my mother was dark skinned.  And as you know, in those days, there was, internally within the black community, very interesting gradations in terms of skin color within the community.
Story_ID: 535958
Speaker 1: Wasn't your mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] giving you instruction, you know, teaching you?  That was age three.  Was that your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, actually, some of my earliest recollections were in Liberia.  See, I, I was born in Boston [Massachusetts], and then my mother took me back to Liberia.  I remember being on, on the ship.  It was either the ship coming back to the states or the one going out.  I think it was probably the one coming back.  The--I remember, it's sort of like occasional flashes of different things in, in Liberia.  And I re- I do remember them.  But that's, but it's both of them.  I mean I remember my father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] doing certain things with me and my mother doing certain things with me, yeah.
Story_ID: 535959
Speaker 1: And, now, you--can you give your siblings in birth order to me?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.  My next brother is William Bowman Wharton [William Wharton].  He is named for my grandfather [William Bowman Wharton].  He was born in the Canary Islands [Spain], and he--all three male siblings went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  My brother, Richard Gilbert Wharton [Richard Wharton], he went to Harvard as well.  And my brother, William, went to--but he went to English High School [Boston, Massachusetts], and then my next brother, Richard, he went to Boston Latin [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts] as I did.  And he went to Harvard.  And when, when the third, when the last one of us graduated from Harvard, we gave my mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] a sterling silver Revere bowl with our names and the years of our graduation and gave my mother a letter thanking her for what she'd done in terms of supporting us while we were at Harvard.  But my brother, William, then graduated from law school after being in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: From where, where in law school?
Speaker 2: The John Marshall Law School in Chicago [Illinois], then joined the state department [U.S. Department of State].  He was the only one of us who had a career in the state department, became head of the legal division for the passport agency and retired a few years ago.  He was married, adopted a son, then lost the son and just lost his wife.  So he is a widower now.  He's still in Washington [D.C.].  My brother, Richard, was married twice.  He had his Ph.D. from Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] in education, then joined the department of education--well, he taught for a number of years in New Jersey along with my sister [Mary Wharton Sampson], then joined the department of education in Connecticut, married twice, one son by his first wife and two sons by his second wife.  He's retired now.  And my sister--my brother, Richard, was born in the United States.  My sister was born in Spain (laughter) in the Canary Islands, and she, she taught school in New Jersey, and she's also retired now.  So I used to joke that you could always tell home leave in my family because I was born in the states, and my brother, William, was born in the Canary Islands and my brother, Richard, was born in the United States, and my sister was born in the Canary Islands.  But then when our [Wharton and his wife, HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], our younger son, Bruce [Bruce Wharton], was born in Singapore, my father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] joked that--Singapore at the time was a British, it still was a British crown colony.  And as a result, Bruce was a British national--no, a Singapore national, a British subject and an American citizen, all three.  So my father joked that, no longer since I was a diplomat at the time, we were caught.  And, but the, but as you can see in the family background, there's always this theme of education, you know, which is still there.

Speaker 1: Now, Dr. Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], what--tell me about your memories of your childhood.  You've shared some really about your, you know, your mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] instructing you and, but other memories that you, you know, had?
Speaker 2: There're a lot.  Well, there're (unclear)--I don't know what ones you would want.  The, the Canary Islands [Spain] were largely the memories of an extremely happy childhood.  Most of my friendships were with the Spanish children.  There were children of foreign diplomats that I knew from Argentina, Brazil, Germany, France, but the American--the foreign population was very small in those days.  So most of my friends were all the children.  And as a matter of fact, it's interesting, my two oldest friends--my oldest friend who died about three years ago was a baby with me in Liberia.  And his mother and my mother were very good friends, and her father was in the U.S. diplomatic corps and married a Liberian.  And then he attended Tufts [Tufts College; Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts] when I was at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And he and I used to write music together, but that's another story.  But my next oldest friend was a boy who lived directly across the street from us in the Canary Islands in Las Palmas [Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain], and he and I were friends for the rest of our lives.  And he just died last year.  And the--and I would be in and out of his house all the time.  And there were seven children, six boys and one girl in that family.  He was the baby of the family.  He was about eighteen or--he was about ten months younger than I was.  And the last time we were, we visited--my wife [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I visited him in the Canary Islands, he hosted a--we did a lot of things, but he hosted a luncheon for, and he invited all the boys that we used to have in the neighborhood and their wives.  And we had the most incredible time imaginable, sort of reminiscing about what we used to do as young, young people.  We went back to visit them in 1964 when we were coming back from living in Southeast Asia.  And his mother and father were still alive, still living in the same house across the street.  And my wife and I and our two boys [Clifton R. Wharton III and Bruce Wharton] were hosted in various events there in that home.  And the first time I went back in the house, in ten minutes, it was like I had never left.  I mean it was just amazing.  And then--there were lots of things that happened during that visit.  But we did everything that we used to do as, as boys and children, I mean picnics and trips and so on.  It was wonderful.
Story_ID: 535961
Speaker 1: Can you take us back to that time and tell me what sights, smells and sounds remind you of the Canary Islands [Spain] if you can put yourself back there?
Speaker 2: It's the, it's, it's not sights, sounds and smells.  It's, it's the people.  It's the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What about the people do you--
Speaker 2: The attitudes.  It's the, the--well, it's the warmth of the people because keep in mind, because I'm bilingual, and all of these young boys that I interacted with and now their wives and family, we were in a slice of the community that you don't get to see today if you're a tourist.  These were families we interacted with.  And it's, it's just a very different environment.  For example, when, when my brother, William [William Wharton], was born, for example, the women in the neighborhood--and these were fairly affluent families, they were all in our house because William was born in our home.  And the interesting thing was, 'cause I remember it, the nurse was English and the doctor was Spanish, and the nurse didn't speak Spanish (laughter) and the doctor didn't speak English.  And during the birth, my mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] was interpreting (laughter) to them.  But I mean, it was a, just a--the environment was one of very tremendous warmth and involvement which is very different.  Food, there're a lot of different things that were there.  But that was very characteristic.  There are a lot of things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What kind of food do you remember?
Speaker 2: From, just typical Spanish food, okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, did you--you lived there from--okay, I'm just--
Speaker 2: From the time I was, I lived there for six years, from the time I was four until I was ten.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 535962
Speaker 1: And I became--see, I learned Spanish as a child.  So I don't translate.  I will think and I will speak either language, but I don't translate.
Speaker 2: And the Spanish has stayed with you all this time?
Speaker 1: Yep, um-hm, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean I know, okay, that--that's--was it spoken?  Did your mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] continue to speak in that way (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, what happened was when my mother and my siblings came back and stayed in the United States because of World War II [WWII], and one of the maids came back with my mother and the family.  And she only spoke Spanish.  So it was very easy for me to continue Spanish.
Speaker 2: Now, were you going to American school there?
Speaker 1: Where?
Speaker 2: I mean what school?  Can you talk about the school you went to?
Speaker 1: I said there were no schools.
Speaker 2: So you, totally the whole time your mother tutored--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: But, you, oh, okay.  I mean I had read that, but I wasn't sure.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, and she taught your, your siblings [William Wharton, Richard Wharton, and Mary Wharton Sampson]?
Speaker 1: Yes, she did with them too.  But, I also went to a--at the same time, I went to a French school for a period of time toward the end because my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the Canary Islands [Spain]?
Speaker 1: In the Canary Islands because my mother wanted me to have some exposure in terms of formal structure with other children.  I think my, either one or both of my brothers went to a German school for a period of time, but it was always the tutorial that you had, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that when I came back to the states, this is why I say that when I came back to the states, that I had, I entered public schools, you see.
Story_ID: 535963
Speaker 1: Now, you--do you remember any other times around holidays or things that may have happened, you know, as you became aware as a child?  I'm just trying to--like I'm--were there special celebrations around, you know, holidays?  I'm just trying to, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, oh, yeah, well, we had--we celebrated Christmas, and--but in Spain, they have the celebrations, the Three Kings.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So I got presents for both (laughter).  And we had presents that'd be shipped by my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Pratt Hicks], by ship, of course, 'cause there were no--there were no airplanes in those days, you see.  Everything was by ship.  And so I remember one Christmas my grandmother sent me a, an Indian [Native American] outfit with the great, big, long feathers and so on.  And there are lots, sort of things like that.  But you, you were aware of the various celebrations on the island [Canary Islands, Spain], the different religious festivals and so on.  It, it was--you were totally immersed in that culture, and you became aware of what their culture was like.
Speaker 1: Now, were you a churchgoing family (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, we went to a church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what--?
Speaker 2: It was an Episcopal church.
Speaker 1: Episcopalian church.
Speaker 2: Yeah, British, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 535964
Speaker 1: So at ten, when you came back--I just wanna--your father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] stays or he goes or they--?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I came back (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Everyone comes back.
Speaker 2: Everybody stayed there.
Speaker 1: Everyone.  But--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, I--see, what happened was, I also began to come down with asthma.  And they tested me and couldn't figure out what it was.  But because of the war [World War II, WWII] and also because, particularly because my, my parents wanted me to become more Americanized, my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Pratt Hicks] who had come out on a visit, took me back to the states.  And I lived with my grandmother, and I did not see my family for three years while I was living with my grandmother.  And it was not until that--I left in 1936 and my parents came back to the states in 1939.  During that whole period of time, they didn't come home.
Speaker 1: That was very difficult, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It wasn't?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I, in retrospect, I think it's because--I guess I was a very secure child.  And I mean I missed them, but, you know, it wasn't, I wasn't--it was, you have to realize in those days, the foreign children who lived, let's say in the Canary Islands [Spain], they also went back to school.  And so it was quite customary.  You didn't think, well, oh, this is a terrible thing, I'm not gonna be with my parents.  But I did have--and my grandmother--she was quite a woman.
Speaker 1: Now, this is your paternal grandmother.
Speaker 2: Maternal, maternal.
Speaker 1: Maternal, maternal grandparent.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother's mother.  She was, she was a very unusual woman.  She was very strong, very demanding.  She, one of my favorite stories about her is that when I enrolled in Boston Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts]--this is when I was living with her, and Boston Latin School in those days particularly, was a, a competitive admission, and it was a very tough school.  For example, of those who entered in my class at Boston Latin School, only 42 percent graduated.  And you just, if you didn't make it, too bad.  They were--and you were expected to strive to excel.  That was the school.  That's why they produced the kind of people they did.  In any event, while I was writing my autobiography at this section, I have all of my grades.  I told you about the grades when I was tutored, but also I have the grades for Boston Latin.  But I was missing the names of two teachers, and so I called up the headmaster at Boston Latin, whom I knew.  And I said, I needed the names.  She said, "Well, why don't you come on up?"  And so, on my next trip to Boston [Massachusetts], I went and visited him.  And he pulled out all of my records.  And he pulled the monthly records which I hadn't--did not have.  I had the annual.  I didn't have the monthly.  And he gave them to me.  And I (laughter), and I looked at them.  And I suddenly remembered.  In the, I guess it was the, in my first year at Boston Latin, they--the years are divided--the first year you're there is class six, then five, four, three, two, one.  So I was in the seventh grade.  And I think it was the second or third month, I failed Latin.  And my grandmother had a fit.  She did not want any failures.  And so she got--had me get a tutor to tutor me.  And then two months later, I got a, I got an 85 [percent].  So I came back and showed my grandmother my 85.  She said, "What's that?"  I said, "Oh, that's an A."  She said, "Did anybody in the class get a higher grade?"  (Laughter) And that was my grandmother.  She was, she was very demanding, very strict, very--she was, we joke about it.  My cousins and I (unclear) and Frederick [ph.], we joke about my grandmother because she was--when I lived with her, I had chores.  One of my chores was, every Saturday was to wash all the windows in the apartment, inside and outside.  And if a window, one window, had a single smudge in it, I had to do the whole window over again.  That was my grandmother.  But it was very good.  I mean it was, it gave you that kind of, kind of discipline.  But it was a, it was a very interesting period because I did then become immersed in the American culture and American friends and the situation there.  So it was a very--for me, it was an important change in my life.
Story_ID: 535965
Speaker 1: Now, s- and because this is a time you're really sort of coming of age as a young man too in some respect (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was ten, going on--
Speaker 1: Ten, twelve, ten to twelve?
Speaker 2: Well, I was--I came back when I was ten.
Speaker 1: Eleven, twelve, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask.  Were you living with your [maternal] grandmother [Mary Pratt Hicks] and going--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and attending the Boston [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  But is, Boston Latin was also a boarding school?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't.  Oh, it was--
Speaker 2: No, it was a public school.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's public.
Speaker 2: It's the oldest public--it's the oldest school in the United States.  It's older than Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  Right, I just didn't know, I--for some reason I didn't know it was a public school.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Because Dr. George Branche [HistoryMaker Dr. George Clayton Branche, Jr.] said he was at the school at the same (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --time that you were there.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, no, George, George was, I think three years ahead of me.  And his brother, Matt [Matthew Branche], was a year ahead of me, a year behind me, I'm sorry, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, can you--where were you living in Boston [Massachusetts]?  Can you describe the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) With my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Right, where your grandmother lived?
Speaker 2: It was on Highland Street in Roxbury [Massachusetts].  And then when my parents [Harriette Banks Wharton and Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] came back, my--we, they bought a home on Walnut Avenue in Roxbury.  But Roxbury was very different then than what it is now.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 535966
Speaker 1: Now, did you--tell me what, what your other experiences, like the teachers that were influencing you there, and, you know, at Boston Latin [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts], you know, what classes you liked, what things you gravitated to?  That's what I'm sort of interested in.
Speaker 2: Well, I had some very, I would say I was very lucky from my perspective in that I, I can, I can remember for every single class, at least two or three professors or teachers, masters, that were just wonderful; demanding, most of them, but wonderful.  The--I could pick out many of them.  The--I'll give you two examples.  One was a teacher called Max Levine, who taught French.  And he looked French, but he was an American.  And his reputation was that anyone who took his French course, particularly, in the senior year, he had graduated those who, and took exams for entry into college, to meet the language exam, and they all would pass it.  Now, most colleges in those days had a language requirement that you had to pass at the college or if you took an exam in the language and you passed what would be the requirement at the college level, you didn't, you were no longer required to meet that language exam, or the standard.  Every single one of the boys in his class, every year, passed the language at a high enough level so that they did not have to meet the language requirement in college, every year.  And that was Max.  And I have to tell you, when I went to give a speech there at Boston Latin one year, for me, it was a thrill.  In the auditorium, they have the names of the very famous graduates of Boston Latin School, Benjamin Franklin, three signers of the Declaration of Independence, you know, the whole thing.  And then here was Max's name.  And all our class--we each, you know, this was wonderful.  I mean we knew what this man had meant and what he did.  Another (laughter) example which my classmates love, I was in class four which was first year of high school when my parents [Harriette Banks Wharton and Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] came back.  And you have to remember that my mother also taught Latin when she was at Virginia State [Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].  And my mother quickly discovered that I did not know Latin.  And so without telling me, there was a teacher that I was having in those years, called Mack--called Mr. Roche, who was a martinet.  You sat in class, alphabetically, and he would start at the front of the room, the first row.  And you would have to stand up and translate.  If you made a single mistake, he'd sit down and give you a zero, and the next boy had to stand up, correct what the mistake was and continue until he said, sit down.  And I'm a W, sitting over in (laughter), in the last row, praying he doesn't get back to me during the class.  And my mother goes up, visits Mr. Roche, and she tells him that, Clifton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] does not know Latin.  He's just using his memory.  And I said, you did what? (Laughter) And she said, yes.  So he said, Mrs. Wharton, that's very interesting.  He said, what I'm gonna do, I promise you.  What I'll do is, I'm gonna call on him first every day in class, and at the end of the class, I'm gonna send you a note through him to tell you how he did.  I was absolutely devastated.  You cannot, you can imagine my reaction.  And to this day, if I think about it, I can just see my hands on the books, you know, kind of just sweating.  But I told--when I--I was asked to give the, I forgot what, it's the three hundredth anniversary of the founding of Boston Latin School, and give the commencement, the major speech.  And I told this story about my mother and Roche.  And two thirds of the people in the audience, they all knew who Roche was.  I mean they just roared with laughter because they could appreciate my situation.  And after the speech, one of my classmates came up, and he says, you know, Roche is still alive.  I say, you're kidding, no he's not.  I think he's ninety-five (unclear).  So I wrote him a letter, and I sent him the speech.  And he wrote back a wonderful response.  He said, you know, he says, I sometimes worry that I may have been too hard on the boys, he said, but seeing how you and the others have made out (laughter), I mean, and it was a wonderful thing to remember and to sort of be able to communicate with him.  But, you know, I had never found out what his first name was (laughter), but, but there are lots of incidents like that at Boston Latin.  And I, I would say that to this day, my strongest alumni affiliation is with Boston Latin because, keep in mind, the boys were--we were together for six years through our pre-adolescent and adolescent years.  We had the largest number of Boston Latin School graduates admitted to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] from that class.  So we had four years additional.  We had--so we had ten years together.  And we know each other, and our spouses very, very well.  And it, it is a tremendous bond.  And the characteristics are, they are not--you very rarely ever find a Boston Latin School graduate who is arrogant or who, someone who says, I'm, you know, I'm a Boston Latin--they know what they went through to get there.  And they're wonderful, wonderful people.  And they also have that sense of the importance of education from the standpoint of public education, not private, but public education.  And every year in my day, there used to be a competition between Exeter [Phillips Exeter Academy, Exeter, New Hampshire], Andover [Phillips Academy Andover, Andover, Massachusetts] and Boston Latin to see who'd get the most in graduate--into Harvard.  And my year, they--Boston Latin School won.  I mean that's the kind of school it was.  It's a little somewhat like some of the special schools and public schools here in New York City [New York, New York], science and all, but--
Story_ID: 535967
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about, because we're in Boston [Massachusetts] in the 1940s when you're at, at Boston Latin [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What, and you said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: The 19--
Speaker 2: Thirties [1930s] and '40s [1940s].  I graduated in '43 [1943].
Speaker 1: Forty-three [1943], but I thought--oh, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, in 19--late 1930s.  Okay, I was, I'm sorry, I forgot.  So can you describe--and you said, you know, it was good that I came back, you know.  I learned a lot.  I'm wondering, like, the questions I have are how many, you know, blacks were in your class, you know, or were you the only one?
Speaker 2: No, no, the--
Speaker 1: Okay, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) the, there were several who were admitted, who eventually did not make it.  In my class, there were, oh, I guess about four or five, yeah.  But the interesting thing was, it was--there were (laughter), it was a, I think it was William White, I think it was William White who said something about that, Boston Latin School was an equal opportunity--not equal opportunity failure, but it was some kind of an expression like that which meant that you could, you failed regardless of what your background was.  I mean it was, the Jews would fail, the Irish could fail.  But, by the other token, when I came back one time to give a speech, I was interviewed by the student newspaper.  And they asked me what was my, my most memorable teacher or my most memorable experience at Boston Latin School.  And I said to, to the reporter and they quoted me--it's been quoted several times since, I said, "It was not an experience, it was a lesson."  And the lesson I learned was that innate ability is randomly distributed in society because the best kid in Latin could be a low-income, Irish kid and the best kid in, in science could be a wealthy Jewish kid, and the best kid in Latin could be a middle-income black kid.  It made no difference what their background and incomes were.  It was randomly distributed in society.  But I would have to amend that to point out that in my day, one of the reasons why that was true was that the primary schools in Boston in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], particularly, were good all over the city.  It made no difference whether it was Jamaica Plain, East Boston, Roxbury, Dorchester [Massachusetts].  They were all good schools, and so the pool from which the competitive group was drawn had that mix which meant that when they got to Latin School, they were able to, to perform.  As I said, out of my class, only 42 percent graduated even at that.  So you did not feel--and I don't think any of us ever felt that those who did not make it were to be looked down upon because you knew how hard it was.  And it was not something where you said, oh, well, that's not a very good person.  No, we never did.  We thought ourselves lucky to have been able to make it, but it was never that way.  And that's one of the reasons why when you meet a Boston Latin School person, it's very different.  The, I met one the other day who I'd heard about--I never met previously, who actually had been looked to as a possible candidate for the job here at TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York].  And I knew who he was, and he was Boston Latin.  We met, it was through Boston Latin.  It was very--and it's not, it's not like some of the graduates of universities who look upon themselves as being, you know, we're the elite.  It, it was, at Latin School, it was a question of the intellectual ability and the fact that you were able to meet the competition and you knew it, but it never had that aura of, of that sort of super.  So it could be--whether it was William White who was a Boston Latin School or Leonard Bernstein who's a Boston Latin School, it was, you know, it was that characteristic.
Speaker 1: How many students to a class when you were (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I don't remember now.
Speaker 1: Do you remember?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 535968
Speaker 1: I wanna go back a little bit because I was just looking at the outline and I wanna understand before--can you take me back to--are you saying, when your mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] taught you, that this Calvert correspondence school [Calvert School, Baltimore, Maryland], was that part of the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's how she taught you?
Speaker 2: Yes, right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, what happened--
Speaker 1: And that's how you got the grades because you were sent (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What happened was that the course would be sent out by ship- no airplanes.  She would take the materials, teach me.  I would take the, write the essays and take the exams.  Then that would be shipped back and take two weeks to get over.  Then the grades and evaluations would come back and take another two weeks.  But in the meantime, the second portion would come out in the meantime.  So you had, you had materials going back and forth to the school.  And the teacher would, the teacher back in Baltimore [Maryland] would evaluate what you did.  The, one of my more humorous examples, I--in going through my evaluations and my grading and so on, I ran across one which I thought was great.  The teacher wrote that, she said, she said, "I thought that your, you'd be--the first sentence--."  No, "I thought your essay on 'Sleeping Beauty' was very interesting, and your first sentence was quite well done, but I can't believe that you only wrote two more sentences or something like that for a whole hour."  Now, and so I had to redo it.  Now, the interesting thing was this.  I remembered when I read this what had happened.  My frustration was this.  I had read 'Sleeping Beauty' and then I'm supposed to write an essay.  I started to copy the 'Sleeping Beauty,' and my mother said, "No, you can't copy it."  I said, "But it's already been written."  Now, as you stop and think about it, as a child, if somebody's already written it, how can you write it again?  It, and that to me, well, you can, I mean it's already been written (laughter).  (Unclear) was the problem.  But it's those kind of things that you're suddenly, from your perspective as an adult, you read these things, and you say, "Ah, now I know what was the problem," you know (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 535969
Speaker 1: Also explain, so the Nathan Hale School [Roxbury, Massachusetts], that was when you were at home--.
Speaker 2: That was on a home leave.
Speaker 1: Home leave.  So you came home for--what happened at Nathan Hale?
Speaker 2: That's when I had the racial experience.
Speaker 1: Oh, that, okay.  I see.  But were you there for--?
Speaker 2: Oh, maybe about two or three months, yeah.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  So instead of keeping you out of school, your mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] put you in school while you were in, okay--
Speaker 2: That's right, sure.
Speaker 1: I see, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and when I came back the next time, I was in school again for a period of time.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  These were on home--now, what about the brief return to Las Palmas [Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]?  That's Canary Islands [Spain].
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  And that's when I came back, and that--my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Pratt Hicks] went out with us.  And then my parents decided I should come back with my grandma, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then what about traveling to Paris [France] with Nana.
Speaker 2: Well, that was an experience with her, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, but that's your--that's the--
Speaker 2: Trip back.
Speaker 1: --trip back, okay.  Oh, I see, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, you went by way of Paris?
Speaker 2: Well, by ship, you--
Speaker 1: By ship?
Speaker 2: The ships would, some, depending upon which ship you took, you'd go different ways.  She wanted to go to Paris, so we took a ship that went up and stopped in, I think it was Le Havre [France], and then we took a train to Paris, and that was a nice experience.  Yeah, but I, she--because I was, I could speak very fluent French then.  So I was an interpreter, and one of my stories is that there was a strike in France at the time, so there was not any food being served in the hotel.  So we had to go out to eat.  And I happen to like lobster, even as a child.  And so whenever we went out to lunch and dinner, I kept ordering lobster.  And my grandmother, (laughter) the second day I started to order lobster, she said, "You know, Clifton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], I see some people over there with chicken.  There must be something else than lobster on the menu."  But I mean it's that, it's, you know, (unclear) what do you think a ten-year old is gonna do, but--
Speaker 1: But did you guys go, did you go around and see sights and things while you were there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure.  We went to the Louvre [Musee du Louvre, Paris, France] and the museums.  It was really wonderful, yeah.
Story_ID: 535970
Speaker 1: You just continued at Boston Latin [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts] for the whole--
Speaker 2: Six years.
Speaker 1: --for the, for the whole six years?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, was there division between lower--was it--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).  It's only, six years.
Speaker 1: --there was no division?
Speaker 2: No, it's six years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about sports or other things?  Were you active in the, in sports?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was in track, and I ended up as captain of the track team at Boston Latin.  I had a high school high-jump record one year.
Speaker 1: And was there any communication between Boston Latin and Girls Latin School [Boston Latin Academy, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Not really--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I mean I knew a couple of the girls that were there, but no.
Speaker 1: Was Dr. George Branche's [HistoryMaker Dr. George Clayton Branche, Jr.] experience different in that his family out--I remember him saying that his mother and father moved up so both he and his sister could go to--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: --to boys and girls.
Speaker 2: But it was mostly, as I remember, it mostly was his mother 'cause the first couple of years--see, George and his parents, George and Matt [Matthew Branche] lived next door to my grandparents on Highland Street.  And the--George taught me how to play handball, I remember.  You know, see, I mean I didn't know, I didn't know American sports.  I didn't know, I didn't know football, baseball, basketball, you know, even the street ball.  I didn't know.  So he taught me how to play handball (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, you almost, you said that you had come back with a, you know, really, basically a sense of self.  And you, but I'm wondering what your other--what are you learning about Boston [Massachusetts], you know, where are you learning about the United States?  How are, how are you aware of, you know--?
Speaker 2: You just, well, for me, it was, it was like going to another country in a sense that it's different when you come with a tourist visa like with home leave.  But then, when you're there permanently, you get exposure to all sorts of things about the country.  I mean it's--and you also become aware of the society, the nature of the society.  It's a very, for me, it was particularly on race in certain areas, not always, it was a very interesting experience.  It's sort of, "Oh, so that's why they do that" or "That's how they do that," you know.
Speaker 1: But that's why I want you to speak a little bit more about that.  What were you learning?  What were the issues (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, those, as I say, there would be so many different things.  The passing was one.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you encounter passing?  That's what I'm asking?
Speaker 2: Because I knew people who were, you know.  I had a cousin who I knew socially, and one day in downtown Boston in a store, he and his father were there.  And I was getting ready to go over and say, hello, and my mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] said, "No, you can't, you shouldn't."  I said, "Why?"  So she told me.  I thought that was very strange.  I mean that was the first time in the family I'd experienced it.  I didn't, you know, why do they do that, you know.  So I had to find out what that was about.
Speaker 1: Now, what age were you when that happened, Dr. Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: I was about thirteen--no, let's see.  I may have been younger.  It may have been on a home leave period.  I don't remember, but, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay, okay.
Story_ID: 535971
Speaker 1: Where this came from, I don't know, but I have a--one of my--I have discovered that one of my interesting characteristics is what I call the shipboard tour.  I began the practice as a young child, whenever we went on a new ship to travel, my first action was to canvass the whole ship.  I would go, find out where the dining rooms were, where the, the sitting rooms were, where the kitchen was, where the--I'd go up to the bridge and the captain would, of course, let you in, when you're a little boy.  I'd go down into the engine room.  I had to find out where everything was on the ship, first thing I ever did.  I always--on any new ship, I had to canvass the whole ship.  And this is a characteristic of mine.  I was totally unaware that it's a characteristic of mine until, in retrospect, I saw what I do.  I could give you many examples.  Let me give you one.  When I became chancellor of the State University of New York [State University of New York System], sixty-four campuses, I visited all sixty-four campuses in the first ten months that I was in office at SUNY.  Why?  I wanted to see the campuses, find out what they were like, get to know their leadership, et cetera.  And I visited all ten [sic.].  Many of them had never been visited by the chancellor before.  That was a characteristic of mine.  When I came here to TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York], we were at that time in three buildings.  I spent two days--I walked every single floor in all three buildings and met all of the employees.  I have lots of examples like that, but the examples come retrospectively.  I was not conscious of doing this.  It's a characteristic of mine to, to want to know, personally, at the most basic level what it's all about, what it's--what's there.  When I go, when I used to be in--when I went out to Southeast Asia and I was given the charge of developing a new program, completely new program from scratch in the countries for which I was responsible, primarily, in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and for the first two years, Indonesia, I went to those countries, visited as many people as I could in the areas that I was interested in.  That was my first thing--I wanted to find out what it was like, what's there, what's involved?  Then I began to put things together.  And it's--I have always found it to be valuable.  When I went to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]--a little different slice of it, before I ever arrived at Michigan State as president, I went out to the campus, I think at least twice, and I interviewed every single dean on the campus, extensively and every single one of the senior officers extensively.  What--to find out what they thought, what their problems were, what they thought the problems were, what the issues were, you know.  It's my shipboard tour (laughter).
Speaker 2: So what you really speak to is really an innate sense (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's an innate--
Speaker 2: --interest.
Speaker 1: And it's, in getting to understand, getting to see and understand what the facts are, what the situation is and so on.  So, as a child, I'm sure that this was involved in my looking at what was happening.  What, what's this about?  What is this, you know, to get to know it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 535972
Speaker 1: Now, you know, I wanna--you spent some sum- summers at Camp Atwater [North Brookfield, Massachusetts] and just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --because that's, you know, a pretty well-known camp.  I want you to talk about your experience, you know, there and also the significance of the, you know, the camp.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  I would say that I went to Camp Atwater almost every single summer, except for maybe when I was in the [U.S.] Air Force, including my first, I think it was my first or second--I think it was my second year in college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  The--it was the first experience that I had had being in a totally black environment.  And, again, I was, I was fascinated because it was the first time that I saw the walls come down.  What I mean by that is I had observed that most blacks walk around with a wall up.  It's a protective wall.  They have to be ready.  They have the walls up because they never know when they're going to encounter racial acts or actions at any moment.  And they all walk around with the walls up.  I, I observed that.  They walk around with the walls.  And then suddenly, here I am, the walls are gone.  The walls are--I don't like that person, but it's got nothing to do with race, okay.  And I was fascinated by that.  I thought that was very intriguing.  The, the other thing was at Atwater, we had, in my day, we had counselors who were by and large, high achievers, who demonstrated this and therefore, and the young men came from up and down the eastern seaboard of the United States, from Atlanta [Georgia], Washington [D.C.], Boston [Massachusetts]--New York [New York], Boston, up and down.  And this formed a relation- set of relationships so that, again, you got some regional variations but--and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]--you got also this whole tier of people, and this broadened your base of interaction within the black community.  And you were able to see those who came and had similar family backgrounds and experiences as you did.  And, again, that gave you a sense of, you know, my family is not the only one that's doing this, that and the other.  So whether it was the--I remember the Scott boys in Atlanta and their father had the big newspaper down there or it was--.
Speaker 1: Atlanta Daily World.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Atlanta Daily World, I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and Andy Anderson [ph.] whose father was a dentist, and he was a dentist in New York or it was the Branches or, you know, it was Matt Bullock [Matthew W. Bullock, Jr.] whose father was a judge, and he was a judge.  I mean they were up and down, and they were all there.  And, again, it was a wonderful experience.  And you, you had a very--I thought, a fascinating experience where, with the walls down, people would say things to each which they would never say in, in mixed, mixed racial groups, positive and negative.  But it was, it was all there.  And, and it was fun.  It was great fun.  But I would say, best of all, it did give me a, a slice of, of the--of blacks and our people in the United States, which I could not have duplicated any other way.  And, and I have (clears throat), I have friends from that period right down to this day, where they're a--it's a very important part of that awareness.  And many of the people, for example, that, that you have interviewed, you know, are Atwater, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, what's--and I guess that also was probably in some respects helpful to your growth in maneuvering, you know, the United States in some respects.  You didn't, you came in with self-esteem, so that was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --so that was not an issue.  You have a very strong family environment, so that wasn't an issue, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but it was not the--no, it was more a matter of, of being more aware of, of different aspects and dimensions of the black community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 535973
Speaker 1: One other thing which there is some--not completely, but some comparability with the experience at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama].  At Tuskegee, both of them were interesting examples of the unintended positive outcomes of segregation.  By that I mean at Tuskegee, because they only had one place where blacks could be trained to become pilots and the pool of potential candidates was very large, they only selected the very best.  So then (laughter) they put the very best people at Tuskegee, that you could find among the blacks in the United States.  And the same, to a certain extent, was true at Atwater [Camp Atwater, North Brookfield, Massachusetts].  And at Tuskegee, you know, it's--I always find it very amusing.  It's not an accident that people like the former mayor--Coleman [Coleman Young], the former mayor of Detroit [Michigan] or Percy Sutton here in New York [New York] or, you can go on--they're all Tuskegee, you know.  But what happened was, you picked from that pool, that large pool, and you have only certain numbers, and you get the very best.  The amusing thing about it for me was that while I was there, there was a, a test down of, I've forgotten.  It was sort of like the IQ level--it wasn't the IQ, but it was that level of thing, among all of the bases in the eastern seaboard.  And it turned out that Tuskegee had the highest level (laughter).  And so what they did was, the leadership in the [U.S.] Armed Forces shipped in a huge battalion of illiterate blacks to lower the level.  They didn't want this base to show up as being the highest.  Really, it's true.  And I, at first, I couldn't--what are these people doing here, you know?   That's what it was.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 535974
Speaker 1: Atwater [Camp Atwater, North Brookfield, Massachusetts], describe where it's located, you know, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's outside of Brookfield, Mass [Brookfield, Massachusetts], and it's near, between Worcester [Massachusetts] and Springfield [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Do you know the history of it, what, how it got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, it was started in 1935 [sic. 1921] by William DeBerry, minister.  And it was to provide a camp for black youngsters, yeah.  It, it has changed a great deal.  It closed for a period of time, and it's back active again and so on.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you went there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's boys one month and girls the next month.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.  So it was a month away.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: You went for a month?
Speaker 2: We went for a month and then the girls--the boys were in July and the girls were August.
Speaker 1: Okay, but when you went, it was relatively--it hadn't been existence a huge amount of time, maybe about--
Speaker 2: No, I first--yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Now, the other thing I just wanna ask about is--
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure it was 1935.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm not sure.  Let me see.  I have to go back and look that up for you, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 535975
Speaker 1: I wanna ask about two other things.  One, you took piano?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And was there any s- you know, 'cause you said--that was what I found interesting, and I may be skipping ahead, but I don't wanna forget about this, that you also wrote songs.  Was that later--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the song writing.  Okay, now, can you explain--is that tied to your early years of playing piano or--?
Speaker 2: Well, I began--my mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] began to teach me piano when we were in the Canary Islands [Spain] 'cause she played.  And my father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] played.  My father was quite a musician as well.  But then when I came back to the states, my father's cousin, Marie [ph.], taught me for a while.  She was a graduate of one of the--New England Conservatory [New England Conservatory of Music, Boston, Massachusetts].  And then when I came back permanently, then I had a teacher who was also a graduate of the conservatory, very good.  She had huge, she had a large number of pupils.  And then my brother, William [William Wharton], took piano and drums.  My brother, Richard [Richard Wharton], took piano and violin.  My sister, Mary [Mary Wharton Sampson], took piano and viola.  The three of them used to perform for different groups.  The--but, but I took lessons up until I went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] when I was sixteen.  But in my sort of mid-to late teens, I began to write songs like (unclear) and compose them.  And all kinds of love songs and things like that.  And then when my buddy from Liberia, Richelieu Morris came, then he would--he was a tremendous musician.  He could pick up any instrument and play it.  I mean he was a wonderful person.  And so then he and I got together and we started writing songs together.  And (laughter) we would do things like this.  We would, we go up to Wellesley [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] and in one of the girls' dorms, they had a piano.  And he and I would play music for the girls and all that sort of stuff.  It was great fun.  And then at Atwater [Camp Atwater, North Brookfield, Massachusetts], one year, Richelieu and I wrote a musical comedy.  And it--both, we wrote the songs and the music for it.  It was great fun.  We had a lot of fun.  It was nothing, you know, majorly serious, but it was, it was an activity that we enjoyed immensely.  But actually, Richelieu's son, one of his sons became a very, he's a very successful musician in Spain right now.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Richelieu's last name?
Speaker 2: It's like the French, R-I-C-H-E-L-I-E-U, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And did he--you're saying he came over for college or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --okay, he did (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From Africa, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: From Africa, okay, okay, okay.
Story_ID: 535976
Speaker 1: What was social life for you like in your teens?  Was there, was there any involvement around that time in Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] or--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, no, no.
Speaker 2: What happened was that, in Boston [Massachusetts], there was a time when--I guess this would have been pre-adolescence or close to it, the parents in Boston and all, most knew each other, decided that they should have some kind of a social activity for the children.  And so they organized, I forgot, sort of a dance, sort of things.  The girls wore semi-formal dresses.  The boys were all dressed up.  And that was very interesting.  It was fun.  We got to know each other, and I think we had it two years that I remember.  But then when we were full adolescents, we had, we would have parties at each other's houses, you know, you bring the records and--that sort of thing.  And we traveled all over Roxbury [Massachusetts] and Boston and became sort of a group.  We, we did not--we sometimes went steady, but it wasn't all that, that serious.  But, again, it was a social community which was good for us.  The, just three weeks ago, yeah, three weeks ago, I learned that one of two girls that lived next door to us in Boston, just died, and I had not realized that she was still alive.  But her cousin is still alive, and I talked to her on the phone.  I hadn't talked to her in, oh, sixty years.  Yeah, it was fun, fun to talk and so on.  But it was, it was a very interesting set of relationships (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 535977
Speaker 1: So when your parents [Harriette Banks Wharton and Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] came back, you were thirteen--it was thirteen, right?
Speaker 2: Thirteen.
Speaker 1: Thirteen.  So where did you live at that point?  Did, is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Boston [Massachusetts], in Roxbury [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: In Roxbury, 28--
Speaker 2: On Walnut Avenue.
Speaker 1: On 285 Walnut Avenue, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, now, was your father back with you at the time?
Speaker 2: No, he went back overseas.
Speaker 1: Okay. He went back, so who is--it's your mother and--?
Speaker 2: And the siblings [William Wharton, Richard Wharton, and Mary Wharton Sampson].
Speaker 1: And the siblings, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, were your parents still--they were still together at that point?
Speaker 2: They were still married then, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But what happened was that during the war [World War II, WWII], they were separated.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And then my father, when he was assigned to Madagascar, he met his next wife who was the then the former--she was still then the wife of another individual who was a [U.S.] Foreign Service officer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that was somewhat traumatic then--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --for the whole family, right?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your mother's here.  Then, really, then do your [maternal] grandmother [Mary Pratt Hicks] and your mother then take, you know, become the care (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it's my, my, our mother.
Speaker 1: Your mother, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So was she having then to work and raise both--that's why you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yes, and, but my father did provide the financial support--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --but she also wanted to, to provide her own.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  So how old were you when that happened?
Speaker 2: I was in college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: You were in--okay, okay.  But your brothers were probably still in high school.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, high school, okay, okay.
Story_ID: 535978
Speaker 1: We were talking about Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you know, how you chose that.
Speaker 2: Oh, Harvard, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, yes, because you said your mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, what happened--
Speaker 1: --wanted--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother--she wanted me to go to Harvard.  But in those days, you could only apply to three schools at the same time.  And you had to indicate your preference.  So you had to make one--your first choice, your second choice, and your third choice.  So, and that used to worry, we, the students applying.  Will the schools feel negative for being second or third choice.  So, but at any rate, so my mother said--well, I wanted to go to Bowdoin [Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine].  She said, well, at least what you should do is choose Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] because your mother and father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] are both graduates and alumni.  So I made them, as I recall, I made Boston University third choice.  I made Bowdoin the second choice and Harvard the first choice, okay.  But I got admitted to all three (laughter).  But, so I went to Harvard, yeah.
Story_ID: 535979
Speaker 1: So let's talk about then your experience there [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Was it an easy transition because of, you know, Boston Latin [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts] or was it a different experience in some respects (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really, no--yes and no.  The, I had, I wanted to follow in my father's [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] footsteps to be a diplomat.  And I decided that the best major to prepare myself for the [U.S.] Foreign Service exams was history, which was the right choice.  But it was a very tough field for me, largely because I had not been trained to take notes, class notes for lectures.  If you think about it, at Boston Latin, people didn't lecture you and took notes, you know.  And that's when you did it, in college.  You know, you sat in a classroom and you took notes, you know.  And the notes related to the subject.  Well, that's not the way it happened at Boston Latin, not in the same degree.  So I had to learn how to take notes which was really tough in history.  It took me about a year, year and a half to kind of get straightened out on how to, how to really work taking lecture notes.  I struggled, I struggled.  It was not easy.  The--however, my mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] suggested that I should take Spanish as a failsafe to get at least some good averages.  And I had a wonderful, humorous experience because the, the course was a freshman course in Spanish.  And the man who taught the course, wonderful man, great teacher, he was an American, but he looked just like a Spaniard.  And during the class, he would tell jokes sometimes and sometimes, they were off-colored jokes.  And one day he told a terrible off-colored joke, and I was the only person in the class who laughed.  And he said, "Mr. Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], may I see you after class?"  (Laughter) And so I went up to him.  And he said, he said, "Where did you prepare?"  I said, "Oh, Boston Latin."  He said, "But did you take any intensive language training?"  And I looked at him, and then I said to him in Spanish, "I know what you wanna know."  I said, "I learned Spanish in the Canary Islands [Spain]." I said, "But I've never studied it.  I've never studied the language, and I don't know anything about the grammar or anything else."  And I said, "And I think that's why I need to take the course.  It's just like English, you know, you have to study English."  He said, "You're right."  He said, "You really should."  So I took the course and he and I became good friends and all.  But the, and in the final that year, just before the exam was to be taken, they distributed the blue books, and I had the blue book, and, my textbook, and I suddenly remembered, I suddenly remembered a highly irregular Spanish verb.  So I turned the blue book over, and I wrote this irregular verb in the back of the blue book, and the invigilator saw me doing this with my open book.  So he rushed down, and he picked up the open book, he picked up my blue book.  Then he moved to the, he moved to the front.  He still let me took the--take the exam, but he knew I had cheated.  He thought I had copied something out of the textbook.  So during the whole exam, he was going through the book, page after page, trying to find this.  Then when the exam was over and the teacher came in to pick up the exams, he said to him, he said, "This young man was cheating."  (Laughter) And the teacher, "He was cheating?"  He said, "Yes."  So he said, he told him what had happened.  And the teacher looked at him and said, "You didn't find this in the textbook, did you?"  (Laughter) And he said, "No."  So then he said, he said, "This young man," he said, "he doesn't have to cheat."  So then he said to me in Spanish, the teacher did, he said, "I should have put that on the exam and then you really would have been in trouble."  And he and I started talking and the invigilator looked at the two of us going back and forth, and that was it.  But I learned a lesson, don't even look like you're cheating.  But, but it was, it was an interesting experience. I had--I eventually caught on and did quite well.  I was able to get scholarships and things like that.  And I graduated cum laude.
Story_ID: 535980
Speaker 1: But it was--it was an interesting experience because the, there were only four of us, blacks, in the school [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in my class (simultaneous) .
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who, who were they?  Do you remember?
Speaker 1: Bill Jackson [William Jackson] from Chicago [Illinois] who was a graduate of Andover [Phillips Academy Andover, Andover, Massachusetts]; Ernie Howell [Ernest M. Howell] from Iowa; my roommate, Harold May from Poughkeepsie [New York], whose father was a minister, and myself.  There may have been one other who came sort of mid-year.  But it's--and then I was at home the first year, and then my mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] wanted me to move into the dorms.  She thought that was something I should do.  And--but I was admitted to the dorms, to Adams House, and my first roommate was Harold May.  But it was a three-bedroom dorm, and we didn't get a third person.  And so I kind of thought I knew why.  So I went to the person in charge of the assignments in the dorm, and I said, I said, I really don't understand why there's nobody assigned to our room because during the war, the World War II [WWII], there was a shortage of rooms for the students because the--they had commandeered certain dorms for the young men who were in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] and all and V-12 [V-12 Navy College Training Program].  And so she kind of, you know, mumbled, and I said, look, I said, you know, I said, I'm bilingual.  I said, I'd love to have a Spanish roommate, you know.  And I could tell she was kind of surprised.  Well, it turned out that she did assign a Spanish roommate, who--Carlos Blanco, who, who became one of my good friends.  I've been in touch with him all that time.  And he tells the story--I told, he told this story many years later, that he was asked at the time because he was a scholarship student from Mexico, originally from Spain, would he mind being in a room with blacks.  And he said, no, I prefer it.  And, but we had a great room, great room.  And then a few years later, Bill Ellis, who was the older brother of Court Ellis [Courtland Ellis], who had run track with me and been in my grade six class, he became my roommate, and Bill came back from the war.  And Bill was at Boston Latin [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts], very successful.  He's a lawyer here in New York [New York] now.  But, but Harvard was an exposure to a different slice of American society.

Speaker 1: And I became very heavily involved in the radio station [WHRV Radio; WHRB Radio, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I was, I was the first black to become a member of the student radio station.  I continued in track until I had a hamstring.  I then was in the--involved in the founding of the [U.S.] National Student Association which is another huge story about the creation of it.  And I became the first--the national secretary of the founding convention.  And--
Speaker 2: What year was, that you were--
Speaker 1: Nineteen--well, the first preliminary session was in December, 1946.  But the constitutional convention was in August, 1947.
Speaker 2: That was your second year or was that your--
Speaker 1: In '47 [1947], that was when I graduated [from Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Graduated, okay.  I'm sorry, okay.  Right, right, right, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: But the, and the National Student Association still exists today.  And we have just issued--a couple of years ago, we issued a huge volume of reminiscences of all the people who were involved in that activity.  And that was a phenomenal activity because most of us were veterans.  Many of the battles that we had in the fight to create it were echoes of what happened later in society.  For example, the--we almost lost because of a breakup between the historically black colleges [HBCUs] and the white southern college.  They almost erupted in terms of what we wanted to put into the constitutional convention.  And I was involved in working it out.  We had students from all over the United--most of the universities in the United States represented there.  And from that group, in the founding group, we have--we've had four university presidents, at least three members of White House staff.  We've had corporate CEOs.  We've had judges.  Paul Simon, the senator from Illinois, he was there.  For example, when I had my confirming, confirmation hearing in the [U.S.] Senate, Paul Simon was on the committee.  So when it came his turn to question me, he said, "Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.]," he says, "can you still do the lion hunt (laughter)?" And during the convention, it was tremendous tension.  And the tension was over whether to include or not include student organizations or just those who are elected by the campuses.  The student organizations ranged all the way from the young Catholic league to the Students for a Democratic Society and Young Communist League.  So there was a real tension.  And I decided that they needed to loosen up a bit.  So I stopped the sessions.  I said, I said, let's take a break, said I wanna show you--I want you to do a lion hunt with me.  They all looked at me, and I said--now, this is a huge auditorium.  It's about, this is about eight hundred delegates.  And I said, "Now, I want you to do everything that I do."  So I said, "We're gonna go on a lion hunt."  And they go, "We're going on a--," you say what I did and you do what I do.  So you go through a whole series of things where you, you go through the belt and then you go through the jungle, and then you might go into a cave and you see some eyes, and then you run backwards, doing everything you did, getting into the tunnel because you think that's a lion, and you're gonna--and, of course, when they run, they carry on, doing it backyards, they just break up.  And it just broke the ice, you see.  So Paul Simon, he remembered this.  He said, "Do you still do the lion hunt?"  Now, (laughter) here's a senator from Illinois, here talking to me.  But it was an incredible group, incredible group.
Story_ID: 535982
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you tell me why the group [U.S. National Student Association] came into existence?
Speaker 2: Because--
Speaker 1: And what the purpose was?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the--a group of young people in the United States, primarily from certain student organizations, were invited to go to the International Union of Students, which was holding its annual meeting in Europe, in Czechoslovakia [Czech Republic and Slovakia], as I recall.  And they came back, and it, surprised that the United States was the only country, major country in the world that did not have a national student organization to represent and reflect the interests and needs of students.  So they decided that they should explore whether or not to have one.  There'd been previous attempts which had not been successful.  So we had a meeting in, at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] in December.  And in preparation for that, we had--each campus had a certain number of delegates based upon the population of students.  And they held elections, and then those delegates went to Chicago [Illinois], and that was to decide whether there should or should not be a student organization.  And they had different issues about students and student life.  They had different issues about, issues about the status of students, to student aid, all sorts of things.  And at the meeting in--I was elected one of the three delegates from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], four if you include the graduate student.  And then at that meeting, I was elected secretary of the committee to prepare for the constitutional convention.  And the head of the committee was James, Jim Smith [James Wesley Smith] from Texas, who became a labor organizer in Texas, a vice president, a treasurer from the Catholic--from Fordham University [New York, New York], myself, as secretary.  Then at Wisconsin, we had a fantastic meeting, fascinating meeting.  And I nominated the person who became the first president, who was Jim Smith, who became head of the Democratic National Committee for many years in Washington [D.C.]; graduate of Berea [Berea College, Berea, Kentucky], wonderful guy.
Story_ID: 535983
Speaker 1: Why did you say that this, the [U.S.] National Student Association--that there was discussion about the HBCU [historically black colleges and universities] community, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because there was a question of, what does the, what would, what would we have in the statement about its purpose, was.  Well, one of them is the question about equal opp- equal access, equal--questions about what are the--are they gonna work against discrimination, you know.  These are all very important issues, and the, the--at the meeting, the Communists were encouraging the black students to take on more radical positions.  And it was a, it was fascinating--I've written this all up.  It's very long and very involved in how they were going at it.  But it was a--it was my first exposure to student politics in a meaningful way, which was very helpful to me when I got to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].
Speaker 1: So really, is this the beginning of student associations on campuses?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, that's where it came from.
Speaker 1: Okay, up to that point, what were students doing?
Speaker 2: They had different organizations, but it was not--
Speaker 1: I got you.
Speaker 2: --but these were, this was--very often if there was an existing one, then that became the base.  But they would send their delegates to it, to (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it--the organization has changed over time, it's not nearly the same.  One of the characteristics of the group in the early years was there's hardly a member of that organization, or active in that organization, who does not have in their vitae, in their career path, some element of public service and involvement in the, to wider society.  They all do.  It's amazing how many that--if you look at--well, Ralph Dungan [sic. Ralph A. Dungan] was in the White House with Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy].  He became ambassador to Chile.  He then became chancellor of higher education in New Jersey.  Doug Cater [Douglass Cater], he was editor of The Reporter magazine.  He then became a president of a university.  And, but then he became a member of the White House, who helped write the higher education bill.  I could go down--they're all over.  I mean it's just an, just a phenomenal group.  The, Kurt Fara [ph.] from Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  He became active in The Asia Foundation, the agency for international development.  They're all in a full range of it, but the numbers are just phenomenal.  And they all have that component of trying to build a better world in life.  For example, Francis [HistoryMaker Norman Francis], the president of Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], he was at NSA.  The president of Jackson State College [Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi], when they had the riots down there, and the boy was killed, he was NSA.  I mean I could just go on and on and on.  It was just a--if you look at the list of people--Representative Al Lowenstein [Allard K. Lowenstein], he was NSA.  I mean they just--one after the other after the other.  It reads like a 'Who's Who.'  And you wouldn't realize that that activity was a central component in the way in which--when we came back after the war [World War II, WWII], we felt that we had a opportunity to make a contribution to building a better society, a better world.  And it was a very positive feeling that we all had.
Story_ID: 535984
Speaker 1: So that was when you got back from Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When you got involved with that [U.S. National Student Association].  So let's, so your first two years--wait.  Were you there two years and then went off to the Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: I went to Tuskegee in 1945.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And so you were drafted?  How was--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You weren't?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, then explain then (laughter)? Why did you, okay, why did you go--?
Speaker 2: In my day, you could either be drafted or you could volunteer.  And--
Speaker 1: Most times you didn't hear people volunteer--okay, I know people volunteer, but--
Speaker 2: And if you volunteered, you had a better chance to volunteer for a particular service.  And I wanted--I knew from all of my friends who had gone before me, that if you were drafted, you had very little chance of getting anything significant.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So--and I heard about the Tuskegee program.  I said, well, I wanna see if I can get into that.  So I volunteered to hopefully get into the Tuskegee program.  And so, so then what I did was I, I volunteered and went into that.  And that was (laughter), in terms of experience, that was in its own way--I think I was only in for eight, ten months.  I went through pre-flight, lower and upper.  I went through primary, lower and upper.  I was in basic and almost through basic when the war [World War II, WWII] ended, and we could get out.  My instructor wanted me to stay in, and I said, no.  I would have had to volunteer to stay in for another three years.  And I said, no, I'm gonna go back to college.  I loved flying.  The environment at Tuskegee was, from a racial standpoint, a very telling one.  The majority of the officers were white, very often white southerners, many quite prejudiced, racists, and, but once again, it was a situation where, as I said before, you had top people, top blacks there.  In my class, we had a very unusual group.  We had a young man who was a graduate of Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] at the age of nineteen with Phi Beta Kappa [Phi Beta Kappa Society] and magna--summa cum laude in math, and another chap from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and another one from--trying to think of the school.  I've forgotten right now.  But they used to call us the Warm Ws 'cause our last names all began with W.  And this is where my cousin comes in.  We were in lower preflight, which there is bracing in the Tuskegee--you can, like they do at West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York], you can brace the class below you.  Well, that bottom class gets braced by everybody, okay.  And somehow, some of the upperclassmen who lived in dormitories right near the, the dining hall, discovered that we were in the class.  So they would try to identify us to have us get out of line and go up to their rooms and help them with their home--with their groundwork (laughter).  And for the first days, after they identified us, I hardly got lunch or dinner (laughter) because they would have us doing their work.  And so my cousin, Murdock Wharton, was there.  He'd, he had flunked out for reasons, nothing to do with his performance.  But he, he had landed his plane on top of another plane, but that's another issue.  That's the one who became a physician.  But Murdoch, who went to Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] was big, strong, he was--he played, he was a boxer at Dartmouth as well.  And I was really, I'm, I said, I don't get a chance to eat.  So I told my cousin, Murdoch, this.  So he goes over to this guy and he says, "This is my cousin."  And that was it.  But I mean it was--but in a more serious vein, the experience of being treated by racist officers was a new thing for me.
Story_ID: 535985
Speaker 1: Being in the South was a new thing too, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  I mean I--there are many stories that I, I have written about.  One was, we were registered before we went to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama] at Biloxi, Mississippi, and we were processed in a segregated style, so the whites would go through processing.  And the blacks would go through processing.  And there would be the officer--the sergeants and the corporals would be sitting behind a table.  And the--our forms were always sealed in a sealed envelope, which only they would open.  And then they would pass it down.  And we didn't know what was on our forms.  And I was in line, just above my buddy, Williams [Edgar Williams], who was the one from Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And when it got to one man, he looked at this, and he said, "How did this get in here?"  And he looked up at me.  He said, "Where did you have this filled out?"  And I said, "In Fort Devens, Massachusetts."  He said, "Well, you can be court martialed for falsifying your form."  So I said, "Well, what's, what's wrong?"  What's--I didn't know.  I didn't even have any insignia.  I mean I'd just, I'd been in the [U.S.] Army, what, less than three days, something like that.  And so there was an officer sitting in the well, in back of (unclear).  And he saw this commotion, and he came over.  And he said, "What's the matter?"  He said, "Well, this recruit here has falsified his form."  So the officer took the form and he looked at it.  He said, "I see you--."  He said, "Well, what's the problem?"  And the man said, "Well," he says, "his form says he speaks all these languages.  He's been to all these countries, and he's had three and a half years of university.  And he's only eighteen years old."  And so the officer took the form.  He looked at it, and he said, he said, "I see you went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]."  I said, "Yes."  He said, "Did you live in the dorms?"  I said, "Yes."  "Which one?"  I said, I said, "Adams House."  He said, "How is Dr. Little these days?"  That was the headmaster at Adams House.  So the officer said, "I think this is all right."  The man threw it on the floor.  So I said to Edgar, I said, "Wait 'til he sees yours," (laughter).  But that was a kind of, you know, getting a dose of cold water in your face when you first go down there.  I mean it was, I mean I, I was--what was wrong?  You know, I couldn't figure it out.  But he--the, the person who was handling my form could not believe that I spoke these languages, had been to all these countries, and at my age, and almost ready to graduate from Harvard.  I mean just didn't wanna accept it.  But I had other experiences too which were like that.
Speaker 1: Now, was there the ability to let the curtain down with this group of black men, like in Atwater [Camp Atwater, North Brookfield, Massachusetts] or not?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or was it because--
Speaker 2: --you're alone, sure.
Speaker 1: When you're alone, but--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, if you were aware of it, and you were aware of the impact.  I mean I had--
Speaker 1: It was intense.
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of the, one of the--sometimes.  One of the stories that I have written about is the first test pilot when I was flying in primary.  And he was really something.  And he, he flunked out classmates of mine whom I knew were superb pilots.  And--but it was all because he used racial epithets against them while they were flying.  And he did it with me.  And I had to make up my mind, I'm just not gonna respond.  I'm just not gonna react.  So when I got back down--the others, he didn't even finish with them.  They'd make a few things and come right back down.  You're washed out, you know, like that.  And he told me I'd passed.  But it--one of the things that I learned from that experience was that I was able to have the discipline and the control to deal with that kind of racism.  And you're not always sure that you can, but I--that was a, quite a testing ground.  And it was, it was quite something.  I mean I--and particularly, when there were people who, whom you knew that in real life, couldn't even begin to touch what you were or would accomplish.  But that was, that was very much so.  But among the, those of us who were there, there was, we had--we had a good time together, lots of fun together.  But it was all in preparation, we're ready to go, you know.  But it was--a few of them stayed in.
Story_ID: 535986
Speaker 1: So the war [World War II, WWII] en- the war ends and then you go back to Boston [Massachusetts], but in many ways, there was sort of a juxtaposition because was there sort of a double standard in terms of expectations or--?
Speaker 2: Where?
Speaker 1: At Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Were--did you find--
Speaker 2: No we (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, not at all?  What about negatives?  I hear, see here a commentary about negative expectations.
Speaker 2: Well, the negative expectations, largely were--you would never know in--and this is more broadly than just Harvard.  The, the--and I had to learn this over time that--there's a story I tell about one time I was at the, in the dining hall at Adams [Adams House], and there was a young man from another dorm there having dinner with a young lady.  And he was talking about how he wanted to go in the [U.S.] Foreign Service.  I said, "Oh," I said, "I'm interested to go in the Foreign Services and so on," you know.  And the more I talked, the more angry he got.  And then I realized I was not supposed to have that kind of expectation.  Or I had a classmate who would--if I, if I said to him--well, this one, (laughter) in the Spanish class, whenever he made a mistake, that Spanish teacher would call on me to correct him.  And, oh, boy, he was from Florida.  He just had a fit.  I mean, but if, it's sort of the, an attitude that by definition, because you're black, you're not supposed to have these capabilities or you're not supposed to be able to do these things.  I learned to deal with it a long time ago.  But it's just, it's there.  It's a negative expectation.
Story_ID: 535987
Speaker 1: At, at the radio station [WHRV Radio; WHRB Radio, Cambridge, Massachusetts] where I was the first, I don't think--I can never recall anybody mentioning it or asking me the question about, you know, being the first or being black.  As a matter of fact, when The New York Times did a matter in the news piece on me when I went to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], they interviewed somebody, I don't who, one of my classmates, and they said that, I was on the radio station, but you would have known whether he was black or not, being an announcer.  They didn't know.  I mean, it was not, it was not the thing.  And even--I've even had some of those who were involved who never thought about it.  But that was--I didn't have that as a problem in my sports.  So it was not in that environment, but individually there were people who you could tell had a, what I would call the negative expectation.  Now the other side of it was, which I find fascinating, we were not special admits.  None of the blacks who there were special admits.  And so, we had to be there because we had some abilities.  And it was very interesting, the reaction that we got because of that.  They could not point to us and say, "Well, you're here on sufferance because we would like to have you."  No, no, no.  "You're here because you fought (unclear), and you have the ability."  So, that also had a positive effect.  I would say that my one aspect of my racial experience was in some ways more acute initially at SIS [School of Advanced International Studies; Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies] at Johns Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland].  Now, there I was the first black admitted.  The school did not want to admit me.  The dean of the school had a fit over my admission, and I discovered many years later that it was a huge debate.  They had trouble because they had been asked by the board of education would they ever admit a black.  And they eventually said, "Well, yes, if someone is qualified."  My father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] was a diplomat, I had a [U.S.] Foreign Service scholarship, partial.  I majored in U.S. diplomatic history at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and got an honors graduate.  They would not admit me.  And so they finally admitted me.  And Washington, D.C., was segregated and I had to live in the dormitory right in the heart of Washington.  Now, the dean of the school used to have a group of students to lunch with him whenever he was there in the building.  In the entire year, I was never invited to have lunch with him.  At the beginning for the first month or so, there were some students where if I sat down at their dinner table, they'd get up.  This was Washington.  So it's not--it's not a case of sort of saying, "Well, you know."  It's variety of negativism that is experienced.  Now, when I graduated, the secretary of the board whispered to me, she said, "You graduated second in this class."  And I was the second youngest graduate.  It's okay, you know.  I did my best because I said at the time that I did not want to be responsible--I wanted to be responsible for having done something in such a way that they could not say that they should not admit any blacks in the future.  And it's a very--it's a very interesting aspect of it.  And I also--I've learned some other things since then about the experience.  Now, in saying that, I've been on the advisory council of the school for years (laughter), and I'm probably one of their more distinguished alumni in my generation.  That's okay, you know.  But I know.  I know what it was like when I first went there.  And--but my classmates, interestingly some of them, when they discovered that I would not be served in some of the restaurants in the immediate neighborhood of the school, boycotted those restaurants.  So it's, as I say, you can't look at it as a monolithic element.  It was quite varied.
Speaker 2: Or even in sometimes, time periods, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --because you think, you know, things get better as they go along sometimes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 535988
Speaker 1: I wanna ask, back at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], about your honors thesis.  You know, what your thesis--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was on Argentine beef and aftosa [fiebre aftosa], which is the hoof and mouth disease.  It's actually foot and mouth disease.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you choose as a history thesis?
Speaker 2: Because it was an important area of American diplomacy in terms of the refusal to allow Argentine beef to be imported into the United States.  And there was an issue about whether or not it was a deliberate prohibition which was not based upon the reality of the disease of aftosa being able to be taken care of by the beef being cooked as opposed to being imported raw, and so, I did this thesis.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a thesis advisor?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And that was fine, no problems?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: The one problem I had, I was told later, which I don't know if it is true or not--in order to be--receive my degree, my honors, I think the thesis had to be read by three professors.  And two of the professors were prepared to give me a magna [magna cum laude].  One professor whose book I had not mentioned in my footnotes (laughter), did not.  Whether that was the reason or not, I don't know.  But, yeah.
Story_ID: 535989
Speaker 1: By the time your, you graduate [from Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], this is what is amazing.  You still kept your, you know, your standing, but, but even though you have been through the trauma of your parents' [Harriette Banks Wharton and Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] divorce.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Standing of what?
Speaker 1: I mean your academic standing.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, sometimes people go through trauma (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean that.
Speaker 2: No, no. It was--oh, it was very traumatic, but, no, I performed quite well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, you're still wanting though to go into the [U.S.] Foreign Service even though you had--because that--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I--the thing is there are two alternative explanations.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For many years, when people asked me why I did not go in the Foreign Service, I would say that, my father took me to the state department [U.S. Department of State] and I met several of his friends, all of whom said, "Oh, you're Cliff's son.  When are you going to come in?"  And I said, "I don't want to go into it because I will never know if I will be my father's son or I plan to do it on my own."  That's one story.  The other story which I've thought about a great deal is, that I was perhaps also motivated by the fact of the divorce and my desire to prove myself totally independent of my father.  That may have been one of the elements.  And I don't know which of those--I know that the first story is true, that is in term of meeting the individuals, but I'm not sure whether or not it's not the other as well.  It may have been both.  I know that my father pushed me a lot to go in the Foreign Service.  He didn't give up on my going into the Foreign Service, I would say, until I came back from Southeast Asia and then became president of Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], you know.
Speaker 1: Because he wanted you to follow in his legacy in a big way (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker 1: Do you remember graduation day though from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  Do you remember the day?  Can you describe your graduation?  Do you remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure.  The--it was attended by my grandfather, my paternal grandfather [William Bowman Wharton]; my mother [Harriette Banks Wharton], my cousin Marie [Marie Wharton], my father's first cousin; and the young lady I was dating at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And anything about the ceremony or anything that you remember or--you know, okay?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a very--Harvard has a very unusual ceremony in that the faculty are lined up along the pathway facing inward, and the graduates move between them on the pathway.  And every once in a while, a faculty member will reach out and shake hands with somebody who's done very well in their course or their major and so on.  And then in the audience when they're conferring their degrees, one of the other practices they have is to say, "The graduates of X class please draw nigh."  And you all stand up and you sort of, almost figuratively, move forward.  It's a very moving kind of ceremony.  The most moving one--dramatic one for me, was my receiving the honorary doctorate, though, because at Harvard they do not announce who are the honorary doctorate recipients until the actual ceremony.  And my class was celebrating its forty-fifth anniversary, I think, and I was there with all my classmates and so on.  And one member of my class, who was on the Board of Overseers, he knew that I was getting an honorary doctorate, and he was the only one who knew.  And I couldn't tell anybody (laughter).  And then came the day.  And my classmate, one of my classmates told me, they were looking around, you know, "Where's Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.]?" you know.  And then they sat down in the audience, and then out comes the people who are going to get honorary doctorates and here I am.  And it was (unclear), one, well the musician, Isaac Stern, they had a famous economist from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  It was really quite a group and when we came out, and my class went wild, you know, because they saw that I was getting an honorary doctorate.  And it was, it was very moving for me because as I stood there, I kept saying to myself, you know, if I had been sitting in the audience, when I was sitting in the audience, I never dreamed that I'd be some day standing there to get an honorary doctorate from Harvard.  And there are other classmates of mine who were far more worthy.  I mean, Jack Lemmon was a classmate, and John Knowles who later be--he was dead by that time, who became president of the Rockefeller Foundation.  And you know, a whole slew of them.  Arthur Hartman [Arthur A. Hartman], who was ambassador to Russia.  And, you know, they never got an honorary doctorate.  I mean, here I am, I'm getting an honorary doctorate, which is very nice.
Story_ID: 535991
Speaker 1: Now, what was--you think, you know, because I think in many ways, college is a way of growing up, you know.  So when you look back at your, you know, experience at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], what do you consider, you know, how did you change, what was, you know, really important about the experience, whether it's academic or social?  Or the growth of you as a person?  I mean, I'm just trying to--
Speaker 2: I guess I would say that--that's hard.  One thing is true that, after the Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama] experience, I was determined to do even more strongly a strong job in my academics.  But that was not Harvard, it was Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: And why was that because you felt that, you know--
Speaker 2: I was--I felt more strongly about the issue of the need for that base to overcome the obstacles.  I had it before, but not to the same degree.  I would say that Johns Hopkins [School of Advanced International Studies; Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.] instilled in me a discipline to eliminate all of the external activities.  I was a very (laughter)--I was always involved in a lot of activities at Harvard, whether it was the radio station or track and so on.  And, at Johns Hopkins, I'm doing nothing but the academics because I want to be sure that I do the utmost that I could.  But the place that intellectually was the most dramatic impact was Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  But it was not--it was not a case of where I felt that Chicago did that, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I want to understand--now, why did you choose Johns--to go in to get your master's [degree] at Johns Hopkins?
Speaker 2: Because I knew it's preparation for going into the [U.S.] Foreign Service.
Speaker 1: So you were still in your father's [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] mindset, okay--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --at this point?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You were under--
Speaker 2: And it was during that year I decided not to, and I became interested in--I took--I was interviewed for a variety of positions, and that's another experience.  But the--.  And then one of my professors there--
Speaker 1: At Johns Hopkins?
Speaker 2: --at Johns Hopkins, said that he thought I should try--he would try to get me an interview with one of the people at the Rockefeller group [Rockefeller Foundation], which he did.  And then there's a whole long story on that.  It was a very interesting one though.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I'm sort of interested in that story.  I know that--you know, I was interested in knowing that the program that you went into was about five years old at Johns Hopkins when you went into it, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was there--were there many programs like that around the United States?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There's Fletcher [The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Medford, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Fletcher, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Why didn't you choose Fletcher since it was--
Speaker 2: They wouldn't take me.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: So you had to get--and then Johns Hopkins you got in, but then they didn't want--okay.  I understand.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because Fletcher is an older program, right, isn't it?
Speaker 2: And the dean of SIS [School of Advanced International Studies; Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies] came from Fletcher.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And there's a whole story about that.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it--now, it's--it's--a lot of people don't--
Speaker 1: Go on, go on.
Speaker 2: --what I was going to say, you know, the people after that would say, "Well, you know, you've never had failure."  I say, "No, that's not true."  I say, but you, you know, say okay, keep going.  You know, you don't sit down and moan and groan and carry on.  I don't, yeah.
Story_ID: 535992
Speaker 1: Now, because you were coming out of your, with your master's [degree] at the time, you know, at twenty-one, I think you would have been, and that the--was the time when a lot of people are finishing, you know, college.  And you had that break there.  I want to ask--so this professor who introduced you to the Rockefellers, because I really was wondering when I was looking at your background had you come across the Rockefellers, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, no.  No.
Speaker 1: --in any, you know, in any other way.  And, you know, but tell me who was that professor and, you know, and how that introduction really sort of happened.
Speaker 2: Sure.  Well, his name was Simon Hanson.  He was an adjunct professor at SIS [School of Advanced International Studies; Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.].  His primary occupation was as an economic consultant, and he also was the editor of a professional journal called Inter-American Economic Affairs.  He wrote a newsletter which was, which he sold, which was very successful.  He was a very irascible, difficult, demanding professor.  To give you one example: he had a practice where he would come into class with copies of a news story from The Washington Post or The New York Times, and he would give it to one or two people in the class.  He said, "Now, give me--you are today the national security advisor in the White House to the president.  Give me a verbal memo on how this issue should be dealt with."  Like that.  And you hadn't read the paper that morning.  You didn't even have a clue as to what you would come out with.  He would give you a set of data on imports and exports for Uruguay, and something else in (unclear), and say, "Now, would you please juxtapose this for me in a verbal memo."  I mean, he would--and it was the kind of exposure that you were given that was very similar to what would happen in the real world.  But it was very much like that.  I liked him, and I got along, I mean, very well with him in terms of--I would, you know, I'd have fun tussling with him in class and so on.  And then he talked one day about--and this was the time when Point Four and Marshall Plan [European Recovery Program] were coming along.  And keep in mind that the commencement speaker at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] when I graduated was George Marshall.  That's when he announced the Marshall Plan.  And I was fascinated by this as an adjunct to foreign policy.  And it was during that time when I said to my father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.], I think it was either in verbal or either in mail, that I was interested in foreign--the technical assistance and economic development as a new aspect of U.S. foreign policy.  And he thought this was ridiculous, you know.  But, Hanson said, "Well," he said, "if you're interested in that," he said, "let me see if I can get you an appointment with somebody in the Rockefeller organization [Rockefeller Foundation]," because Nelson [Nelson Rockefeller] had been the coordinator of inter-American affairs, had gone back to New York, and he had created two organizations, one profit making, one nonprofit, to work and carry forward his interest in Latin America.  The nonprofit one was AIA, which I eventually joined; and the other one was IBEC, International Basic Economy Corporation.
Speaker 1: And AIA stood for?
Speaker 2: American International Association for Economic and Social Development.
Story_ID: 535993
Speaker 1: Now, when I went up for my interview, I was supposed to be interviewed by Frank Jamieson, who was the top public relations person for the Rockefeller family.  And Frank Jamieson had won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the Lindbergh kidnapping which, by the way, my father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] and mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] hosted the Lindberghs [Anne Morrow Lindbergh and Charles Lindbergh] in the Canary Islands [Spain] after the child [Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr.] was kidnapped and died.  And Mrs. Lindbergh, when she visited our home in Las Palmas [Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain], wanted to hold my brother William [William Wharton] who was about the same age as the baby.  Very interesting.  Anyway, so, I went up to be interviewed, and here I was, I was, 1940, I was twenty-one, go to the Rockefeller--30 Rockefeller Plaza [New York, New York], fifty-sixth floor.   And I got to tell you, that was quite an experience because one side of the floor was the father's [John D. Rockefeller, Jr.] side, which was very conventional office space, and the other side was the brothers', Nelson [Nelson Rockefeller] and John [John D. Rockefeller III]; very modern, curving, you know, lots of art, deep-carpeted carpets.  But Frank Jamieson was ill, so they had me be interviewed by a man by the name of Larry Levy [Lawrence Levy], who was one of the advisors and lawyer.  Bright guy.  Bright as heck.  So I go in to see him, and he says, "Mr. Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], I understand you're looking for a job."  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "What can you do?" (Laughter) And I sat there and my mind just twirled.  I said, after Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Johns Hopkins [School of Advanced International Studies; Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.], what can you do, you know.  I couldn't think of anything.  So I looked at him, I said, "Well, sir," I said, "I can think."  And he smiled and he said, "Well," he said, "there'll be a job for you in public relations in June, but I wouldn't advise you to take it because it won't go anywhere."  I said, "Well, thank you very much."  I get up to leave.  "No, sit down.  We'll talk."  Well, a few weeks later, two things happened, one of which I did not know was that, Nelson decided that he wanted to have a few executive trainees in his organizations.  The other was that a wonderful man was made the new head of AIA [American International Association for Economic and Social Development].  And my bio came across his table, his desk.  So he was interested in me because I spoke Spanish, I'd worked in Latin America.  So he had me come up to be interviewed.  So I came up and I was interviewed by him.  And he eventually hired me as the executive trainee in AIA.  Was one of the most wonderful opportunities that I would ever have had, because for the first year, I was able to visit any area that I wanted in the companies, learn about them; I could learn about accounting, I could learn about public relations, I could learn about whatever it was.  And also I did work for the AIA for Mr.--Pete Hudgens [Robert Watts Hudgens], the head of the AIA.  And he was a wonderful, wonderful nurturing man.  He was from North Carolina--South Carolina, North Carolina.  He was a former administrator of the Farm Security Administration [Resettlement Administration], married to a Furman [Eleanor Furman Hudgens] of the Furman college [Furman University, Greenville, South Carolina] family.  But he was just great.  There are a number stories I could tell about him, but one of them I always go back to which is that, one day he asked me to draft--he used to ask me to draft memos for him for different things; for the meetings, board meetings and so on.  And sometimes I'd get to go.  If you can imagine a twenty-one year old going to the board of directors meeting.  And I drafted something and he asked me, he didn't know.  So he said, "Well, Cliff," he said, "this has got all the points that I wanted in it," he said, "but, you know," he said, he says, "this sounds like Harvard.  This doesn't sound like North Carolina."  And I just died, you know.  But he was right.  I had to write for him, you know.  I mean, there are things like that that he did that were just wonderful.  And then his number two came in, James Maddox [James G. Maddox] from Arkansas.  Wonderful man that had a Ph.D. from Harvard.  And--at various--after I had became the head of their reports center, I developed all the reports and analyses for the organization, traveled in Latin America, learned about the programs, and then I realized that I needed more training.
Story_ID: 535994
Speaker 1: So, I decided I really should go and get my doctorate.  And Maddox [James G. Maddox] was the one who said, "Well," he said, "you can go to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]," he said, "but you'd be just going back to the same university."  And he said, "You could go to the other petition--possibility is Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin], and they have an institutionalist approach to economics."  He said, "But the exciting place today in economics is the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]."  So I said, "Really?"  He said, "Yes."  And he said, "You know, here's a new mag- new journal called Economic Development and Cultural Change.  It's being produced by Bert Hoselitz [Bert F. Hoselitz] at Chicago."  So I (unclear).  He said, "Read this article by somebody named T.W. Schultz [Theodore W. Schultz]."  So I read this article and it was in the very first issue, I couldn't understand a thing he was saying.  And a couple of days later I was in the office, and Maddox called me, said, "Hey, Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.].  I want you to meet somebody."  So I see this tall man in there, and it was Schultz.  And I said to Schultz, I said, "Oh, I just tried to read your article.  I couldn't understand a word of it."  He said, "I've been told that before," you know.  And, obviously, Jim was telling him about me, and he had me apply for admission to Chicago.  And Schultz found me an assistantship, a research assistantship so I could get income, go to school part-time, and work for his project because he was heading up a new project to evaluate U.S. technical assistance in Latin America.  Okay.  What have I been working on?  U.S. technical assistance in Latin America.  I'm bilingual.  And so, the next four years I was a research assistant, then a research associate with T.W. Schultz.  Fantastic experience.  Fantastic experience.
Speaker 2: So this was really the Rockefeller situation, which really that led you to Johns Hopkins [School of Advanced International Studies; Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.] and that experience (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Indirectly.
Speaker 2: --turned to be--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --a really--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --it was all the right things--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --in many ways.
Speaker 1: I've been very lucky.  I had that.  I had Hudgens [Robert Watts Hudgens], I had Maddox, then I had Schultz, apply with Schultz; then came Mosher.  The person--one of the key people on the project at Chicago working on agriculture was Arthur Mosher [Arthur T. Mosher].  So who became the head of ADC [Agricultural Development Council]?  Arthur Mosher.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Amazing.
Speaker 1: It was--and it was a logical sequence.  (Unclear) logical.
Story_ID: 535995
Speaker 1: So let me ask you, because this is your first job really.  I mean you had jobs before--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --but it's your first real job.  And you're in New York [New York] and you haven't really been in New York.  Before you had Boston [Massachusetts], D.C. [Washington, D.C.], New York.  What are you finding out about this community, and what is the community that you're engaging in here, and this is where you also met your wife?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no.  Not where I met her, no, no.  I met her before.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Oh, you met her in Boston?
Speaker 2: Her cousin, two cousins, two girls were young women that I interacted with in Boston.  The girls' mother is a good friend of my mother's [Harriette Banks Wharton], and the oldest cousin had a party in a home in Brooklyn [New York] where Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], who was then a young girl in Danbury, Connecticut, came.  And then when I was a sophomore at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], this cousin was a freshman at Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and she had me as Dolores' date for a party or dance at Radcliffe.  And she was sort of my first blind date.  I didn't believe in blind dates.  And so, I took her to the date.  But that's where we met.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I didn't date her again until 1949, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, so there was that gap then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were in New York.  Now what was it--what was your social experience, you know, here?
Speaker 2: Social?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in New York?  Who were your--were you--who were you living with, were you living in Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I lived in the Dunbar [Dunbar Apartments, New York, New York] until I started dating Dolores.  Then after we were married in 1950, then we had an apartment in Riverton [Riverton Houses, New York, New York], and had a very interesting social life there.  That was until we went out to Chicago [Illinois] in '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: And why would you say interesting social life?
Speaker 2: It was normal.  It was nice.
Speaker 1: It was nice?
Speaker 2: Yeah (unclear).
Speaker 1: Lots of people?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There were, you know, young people who had strong career experience, desires, aspirations.  We were all in the same age group, and it was very nice, yeah (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 535996
Speaker 1: I'd like to ask you a little bit about the Rockefeller Foundation, and I know you know the history since you were head of the Rockefeller Foundation at one point.  But, what--can you tell me where in that historical context the work that was being done in South--you know, Latin America, where it fit?  Was it fitting within the whole area of technical assistance?  You know, remember how, you know, you spoke about--so I'm just trying to figure out in the lifespan of the foundation and the work that you working on in Latin America.  Where did that fit within the context of sort of foreign policy?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, you have to realize that there are several different Rockefeller family philanthropic organizations.
Speaker 1: But this was formed by--?
Speaker 2: There's the Rockefeller Foundation, which was started by J.D. Jr. [John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]
Speaker 1: Right.  Isn't that the (unclear)?  Okay.  So isn't that this foundation?
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Okay, we're ready.
Speaker 2: The brothers, John [John D. Rockefeller III], Nelson [Nelson Rockefeller], David [David Rockefeller], Laurance [Laurance Rockefeller], they formed first the Rockefeller Brothers Fund [New York, New York].  Then there are the individual organizations.  So it's much broader than just the foundation.  The involvement of the family with the Rockefeller Foundation, except for the father, Jr., the son of J.D. Sr. [John D. Rockefeller], was only chairman of their foundation.  He was not the president.  His son Jay [Jay Rockefeller], who is now the senator, was a member of the board for a few years, but not for very long.  So the relationship of the family to the foundation is, I won't say tenuous, it's indirect.  The Rockefeller Brothers Fund is really controlled by them.  The other organizations they created.  So, John D. III is the one who founded the Agricultural Development Council, as well as The Asia Society, the Japan Society, and the Population Council [Population Council, Inc., New York, New York], okay.  So that's where it was.  Now, Nelson had his own activities.
Story_ID: 535997
Speaker 1: The work that you were doing with AIA [American International Association for Economic and Social Development]--
Speaker 2: All right.  Now--
Speaker 1: --that work was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was--
Speaker 1: --was that more technical assistance?
Speaker 2: That was--no.  With AIA was technical assistance.  And that was Nelson [Nelson Rockefeller].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in many ways, there's at least one doctoral dissertation that I know of, which makes the case that Nelson, in his activity in that area, was way ahead of his time, which is probably true.  He thought two things.  One was that corporations--we would call it today corporate social responsibility.  But what he talked about was, if corporations could make money, and at the same time do good, that was IBEC [International Basic Economy Corporation].  AIA was the non-profit arm.  And the activities AIA engaged in were activities that did such things as a special program of farm-to-market roads or supervised credit for poor farmers or health programs--nutrition and health programs.  So those are things that AIA did.  We did them primarily in Venezuela and in Brazil.  That was the technical assistance part in the work of AIA.
Speaker 1: And the countries that you visited there--were they, was that Brazil and Venezuela--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --is that where you--?  Okay.  Never Argentina?  You had done your (unclear).
Speaker 2: That was later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 535998
Speaker 1: During this time, you get married, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and what are your plans at this point?  Are you discussing with your wife that, you know, you do want to go, you know, that you sort of want to go and do this, this doctoral program, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I mean your master's [degree] program--you have another--
Speaker 2: Doctoral.
Speaker 1: Doctoral.  Okay.
Speaker 2: The master's was on the way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I see, I see.  Okay.  I see, okay.  Do you want to do this doctoral program and this, you know, and who's talking to you at this--who's influencing you on--
Speaker 2: Maddox [James G. Maddox].
Speaker 1: Maddox.  Okay, right.  So you're--at this point, the time that you get accepted is, is it 1950--?
Speaker 2: Fifty-three [1953].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, and to back up, we were married in 1950.  We were married in Marian Anderson's studio in Danbury [Connecticut].  Marian Anderson, Miss Anderson was a good friend of Dolores' mother [Josephine Bradford Owens].
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: They both are from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Keep in mind, Dolores' [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] family is a multigenerational group of high-achieving, affluent blacks.  Her great-great-grandfather [sic. great-grandfather, James T. Bradford] was a very successful greengrocer in Philadelphia and Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Did you say greengrocer?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, the regular grocers.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But caterer as well.  And he was extremely well done--well-off.  But Dolores' mother grew up in Philadelphia and so did Miss Anderson, okay.  In Danbury where Dolores lives, her mother and stepfather's home was just about a mile away from Miss Anderson's home up there.  Okay.  So it was a close relationship.  So when Dolores and I were going to get married, Miss Anderson offered to have the marriage at her studio there.  A little footnote, Miss Anderson is deceased, the farm has been sold, but the studio was moved to the museum in Danbury.  And a year or two ago, Dolores and I went to Danbury visiting some friends, so we went to the museum and walked into Miss Anderson's studio where we were married.  And it's still out there (laughter).  But, so that is a bit of background.  Now, after we were married, and I was still working with AIA [American International Association for Economic and Social Development] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have a large wedding?
Speaker 2: It was a huge wedding.  I mean it was huge in the sense that we couldn't get everybody there.  It was--sounds strange.  At the time, it was viewed as one of the big social events of the season up and down the eastern seaboard.  Our son, Clifton [Clifton R. Wharton III], was born in 1952.
Story_ID: 535999
Speaker 1: And then when I discussed with Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and we talked about my future, I said, "Well, you know, we talked about my going to Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]."  It was--we both felt that it was such a natural, I mean.  It was--I could not have--I could not have invented anything that would be such a good match.  To show you what a good match it was, when I was ready to do my Ph.D. dissertation, my doctoral dissertation was on Brazil, and also, particularly on the work of one of the AIA [American International Association for Economic and Social Development] programs.  But it was--it was a natural fit.  Now, but, so we went to Chicago [Illinois] with Clifton [Clifton R. Wharton III] who was just a little over a year old.  He wasn't even walking at the time when we went there.  It was one of the most meaningful, dramatic, challenging experiences in my life.  First of all, we had a weekly food budget of twelve dollars a week.  Dolores did it, how, I don't know.  We lived in an old prefab.  There was a whole, huge community of prefabs on the Midway [Midway Plaisance], if you know Chicago.  And this is right where the Chicago Law School [University of Chicago Law School, Chicago, Illinois] is now, okay.  And we had one oil heater in the middle of the prefab.  It was--it was quite--it was wonderful.  And yet, we had--we formed some wonderful friendships, developed friendships with people there.  The faculty were tremendous, very demanding.  And the environment was so massively intellectual in terms of the subject matter that it was out of this world, I mean, in terms of what they did.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And your mind took naturally to economics?  You know, because remember how you were saying, you know, they said, "Read this article," and you we like, you know, "I don't understand," (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's--
Speaker 2: Did it take (unclear)?
Speaker 1: No, no.  It was not that so much as it is--.  First of all, economics in Chicago in those days was, many people think of it as being the fountainhead of Milton Friedman and free market.  It really was the fountainhead of the--of econometrics, mathematical statistics, economics.  So that, for example, my first year I took no economics.  I took nothing but math and statistics.  I had to go all the way through calculus before I started taking any economics courses.  And it is--the approach in Chicago is empirically based.  You have to get the facts, and analyze the facts, first and foremost, within the theory.  And it was unbelievable.  And I had classmates who were fantastic.  We challenged each other, we worked together in small study groups.  And it was not until years later that I realized that I had the benefit of being there at a time when that department was the number one department in the United States.  And working with Schultz [Theodore W. Schultz], in particular, was phenomenal.  So, it was--and here I was working with a man who later became a Nobel laureate in economics [Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel].  And one of the teachers that I had became a Nobel laureate.  They were all--they were there.  And they were your mentors, they were your friends, they were your teachers, advisors.  It was--you could not have found a more dramatic place.

Speaker 1: What I'm sort of curious about is, and maybe this is, you know, doesn't seem--but there, that you hear right brain, left brain, but I mean, people--you're a history major.  So it would--and I keep thinking about your whole thing with numbers, you know.  Like you were saying (laughter) you saw numbers and that.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, it sort of surprises me, you mean--and you said that the focus at, you know, University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] was for mathematical, economics (unclear).  So, my question is, how did your mind, you know, sort of grab on to this, and you did, in fact--and the other--on the other side was in particularly challenging in a way that--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.  But this sounds a little strange.  But, in order to study economics in Chicago, I had to learn the math all the way up to calculus, all right.  I had to learn the statistics.  My basic statistics course in Chicago was taught by Allen Wallis [W. Allen Wallis], who was the dean of the business school in Chicago [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois].  Phenomenal teacher.  I learned statistics.  I had to learn it in order to do it, so I did.  You know, it was that simple.  And it was, as I say, it was just--I could not have chosen more wisely as for my purposes in terms of my experience.
Speaker 1: So in many ways this was your time of charting your own path in many ways, this decision to go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  It was--well, it's always--to me in a way looking at it retrospectively, it's a combination of opportunity and a general sense of go-in-direction.  For example--
Speaker 1: The convergence of those.
Speaker 2: Right.  When I--when I was writing my autobiography, I ran across the essay which I wrote and was supposed--asked to write in connection with my application to Chicago to be admitted to the Department of Economics.  And one of the questions was, "Why do you want to study economics?  What is your career goal?"  The description of what I wrote was almost a perfect fit for the Agricultural Development Council.  It didn't even exist at the time.  But it--there it was.  I mean, that was--it came about, and bingo, there it was, the opportunity.  So, it's a combination really of things.
Speaker 1: So, now what, what were the different types of economic theory that you studied and once--or were there at that point in time different economic theories being sort of bantered around?  No?  Yes?
Speaker 2: No.  You took different fields.  You took economic theory, price theory, macro theory, money and banking.  You know, there was a whole series of fields.  Then you get tested in them for your prelims and so on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 536001
Speaker 1: You decide to focus on agricultural economics?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was wondering--okay, okay.
Speaker 2: At Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], there were only two ag- well, maybe three, but really two agriculture economists.  One was Schultz [Theodore W. Schultz] and the other one was D. Gale Johnson, who later became dean of the college and later became provost of Chicago.  Very good man.  He's dead now, as well as Ted Schultz.  There were only two, maybe three courses that were taught in agricultural economics, and they were both--all of them were taught from an economic perspective.  I could have majored in a then new field called economic development, but I didn't want to do that.  I wanted to get the basics.  So my degree is in economics.  It is not in agricultural economics, it's not in developmental economics.  I took courses in economic development, but I was a--I'm a general economist.  That meant that when I finished, I was trained and prepared to be an economist.  I had areas of interest at specialization, but they were not dominant.  I had a course in labor economics, a couple of them.  That doesn't mean I'm a labor economist, okay.  Now, however, because I was interested in economic development, development in the developing world, and the developing world by in large in those days was at least three-fourths agriculture, they got to deal with agriculture.  So as a result, I became known of a--as a member of a very small organization--I don't know if I mentioned this before--which we created, a few of us.  There are only about six of us.  We're just called the CBCBCREA [sic. CBCBCRAEA].  That's the city-born, city-bred, city-raised agricultural economics association.  In order to belong, you must have been born on a farm, raised on a farm or studied agriculture or practiced.  But you're an agriculture economist.  Now, in the field, I'm known as an agriculture economist.  I've never even been on a farm, studied it--but, that's my discipline because I'm known as that.  I was even elected fellow at the Agricultural Economic Association [American Agricultural Economics Association; Agricultural and Applied Economics Association], preceded by Mosher [Arthur T. Mosher] (laughter), and Schultz.  But it's amusing in that sense.  But it was a case of where the areas that I concentrated on which related to agriculture were not primary in terms of agriculture preparation, agricultural preparation.  It was not that way.  So, it was in my area of primary interest when I joined ADC [Agricultural Development Council] eventually, was poverty, and the economics of subsistence farmers.  And that's why my book is on subsistence agriculture and economic development.  So, that's how it, how it fits.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: Don't ask me how I got from subsistence agriculture to running one of the major corporations [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York] in the United States.  That's another issue (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right.  That's absolutely right--
Story_ID: 536002
Speaker 1: What about the black community in Chicago [Illinois]?  What did you--?
Speaker 2: Oh.  Well, our social life in Chicago within the university [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] existed to a degree that you had the time.  We had a few families with whom we became friendly, most of whom were related in some way to Dolores' [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] family or friends.  People who were there when we were there, one of my old friends, [HistoryMaker] Chuck Stone, was there.  I've known Chuck since he was at Wesleyan [Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut] and I was at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And we've been friends for years.  But it was not a case of where you were in or out in terms of the black community in Chicago.  It was just--most of us were just absolutely up to here in getting, getting our studies done.  It was just not that sort of way.
Speaker 1: And then you were young parents, too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, that's right.
Story_ID: 536003
Speaker 1: Now, what about the NPA [National Planning Association] study?  NPA study.
Speaker 2: Oh, the national--that's the technical assistance program--
Speaker 1: Oh, that--
Speaker 2: --that Schultz [Theodore W. Schultz] headed up.
Speaker 1: I see, and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The National Planning Association.  They received a grant from the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] to conduct an evaluation of all U.S. technical assistance in Latin America, and Schultz was the head of it.  And he brought together top experts in different fields.  He had people--experts in labor, public administration, et cetera, and agriculture.  The person for agriculture that he brought in was Arthur Mosher [Arthur T. Mosher], whose previous experience had not been in Latin America, but India.  Okay.  But, because when we went on our field trip, well, one trip to Brazil and I went, I spent most of my time with Mosher on field trips in studying agriculture in Brazil because I knew Brazil, and so on.
Speaker 1: And what--so the experience that you had had at AI--
Speaker 2: AIA [American International Association for Economic and Social Development].
Speaker 1: --helped with the experience (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely.  Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I knew the work that Nelson [Nelson Rockefeller] had done in Brazil and Venezuela, and I had studied in Latin America with Hanson [Simon Hanson], so it was a natural thing.
Speaker 1: Now, on your thesis that you did at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] was on Argen- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Argentina.
Speaker 1: Did that tie in at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No tie-in at all, okay.  Okay, but why was there this focus on Latin America?  That's why I guess I'm trying to--
Speaker 2: By me?
Speaker 1: Pur- I mean, it seemed from a foundation's, you know, from an organizational side, from a technical assistance side, was there an interest in, you know, in Latin America and then another organization had interest in Asia?  I mean, were these--all these things going on simultaneously from--
Speaker 2: From whose standpoint?
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know from--when foundations, when people are funding things, there typically is some desire, you know, it may be business related, you know, it may be overall foreign policy related, it may be arts--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --and culture related.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  The foundation--
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to understand.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because while those decisions in the studies affected, you know, years going forward.  That's why I'm trying--
Speaker 2: Well, the--most foundations today have both within their mission statement a set of fields in which they are primarily going to devote their resources.  They can't cover everything that's needed.  And--but, in the old days, they had this, but to a different degree.  In this particular case, I have no way of knowing this, I suspect that the Ford Foundation was approached by the National Planning Association which had a very powerful board in those days that felt that, probably two things, one, Latin America had been neglected; number two, there had been a substantial number of years of experience of U.S. technical assistance in Latin America, and there might be value in doing a survey of all of Latin America work by the U.S. to see were there any lessons to be learned from successes and failures in these different disciplines.  And this was a national organization to do it, and if that got Schultz to do it, that would be even better.  I think that's what happened.  I don't know.  I was--I don't think--I'm trying to think.  I don't think, I know I didn't have any contacts at the Ford Foundation then as I did later.  So I don't know that to be the case.  But there's no question but what it was an important area of experience.  The--there had been--there are other areas of technical assistance that might have been looked at in other parts of the world.  But that was one which was a particular universe that they could look at.
Speaker 1: And then just for a point of clarification, National Planning Association was formed when?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know when (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It had been much ol-
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's been--it was in existence for a long time.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And it was stopped about four years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 536004
Speaker 1: Now, what was your doctoral thesis on?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Brazil.
Speaker 1: Brazil.  Okay.  Brazil.  But didn't--why--okay.  Why do I see here the siren call of Asia?  What does that mean?
Speaker 2: Because I got an offer to go work for the ADC [Agricultural Development Council].
Speaker 1: I see (laughter), right, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, I mean, I feel up until that point, up until that point my field had been Latin America.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: Starting with SIS [School of Advanced International Studies; Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.], Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], AIA [American International Association for Economic and Social Development], you know.  All of that is Latin America.  Now, suddenly I'm shifting from Latin America to Asia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--okay.  So let's, so, so--talk about that.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay. We'll talk.  I'm going to have to stop.  Okay.  So can you talk about how that opportunity, you know, came?
Speaker 1: Well, I was at Chicago and I was finishing up--I was working on my doctorate.  In the meantime, Mosher [Arthur T. Mosher] had finished his work.
Speaker 2: And this is 1958, right?
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 2: Fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 1: And Mosher had finished up his work, and he had joined the faculty at Cornell University [Ithaca, New York].  When he was asked to head up the Agricultural Development Council--I won't go through the first names because that confuses things--and this was an organization that John [John D. Rockefeller III] had founded.  John was interested in two things: population and food, and the race between the two.  And so, he had organized this organization, which eventually was called the Agricultural Development Council. And Mosher was hired to be the new head of the organization.  The previous head was a man by the name of Buck [John Lossing Buck], who was Pearl Buck's husband.  But he was near retirement.  And so, they hired Art Mosher.  So Art Mosher says, calls me, he says, "I want you to come to work for me for ADC."  And I had not finished my doctorate, my dissertation.  He said, "I'll see to it that you get a chance to finish your dissertation, but I need you now."  So I was his first hire.  And I discovered later that there were some board members who had raised questions about his hiring me because I had no agricultural background, but he insisted that he wanted me.  So I did.   And I was intrigued by a couple of things.  One was that I felt that working with Mosher would prove to be, and it was eventually, a phenomenal opportunity.  He was an incredible man in many, many ways.  He and I got along fabulously.  He--among the things that attracted me was, he believed in hiring the best possible people, putting them in a situation where the need existed, and then let them develop the approach within the broad parameters, rather than somebody sitting in headquarters telling him what to do, because regions in countries are different.  Situations are different.  You don't do that.  That was just one of the things he was like.  He was extremely articulate, wrote beautifully, read well, and I was fascinated.  Going to Asia, okay.  That's a different part of the world.  I also had questions about whether I should go back to the Latin American field, particularly with the Rockefellers.  AIA was in a process of transition, it was unsettling, it was unsettled at the time.  I felt, no, no, I'm going to go.  I shifted from Nelson [Nelson Rockefeller] to John, III.  They were very wise moves, very wise moves.
Story_ID: 536005
Speaker 1: Now, we were talking about Art Mosher [Arthur T. Mosher].
Speaker 2: And Asia.
Speaker 1: And Asia.  So talk about what you did there, where you went and what you did, and that was a year--it was a year, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Your time in Asia was a year or two?  Associate, 1957, 1958, that's what I've got.  Wrong?
Speaker 2: Wrong.
Speaker 1: I see here. Hold on; what---what--I see--
Speaker 2: No wonder you had problems in your little website on me.
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.  So you're saying you stayed there a lot--so you were an associate, then you moved to--
Speaker 2: Let me explain.  I'll explain to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then you moved to--
Speaker 2: Let me--I'll explain.
Speaker 1: And you received your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: I'll explain it to you.  Let me explain it to you, first of all.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay.  You moved.
Speaker 2: Right.  I will explain it to you.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.  I see.  Okay.  Thank you, okay.
Speaker 2: The people who were hired as permanent employees of ADC [Agricultural Development Council], who went to the field, most of them, were called associates.  They were--once in a while, we would have one or two associates in the New York City [New York, New York] office who actually covered regions in Asia.  For example, one associate based in New York covered Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.  Another associate for a number of years covered India and Pakistan from New York.  I was an associate.  I was an associate in New York for a year, but then I was assigned to Southeast Asia.  And I covered Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and also Indonesia for the first two years, until an associate was assigned to Indonesia.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So, we were in Southeast Asia for six years.  Now, when I went out, Dolores [Wharton's wife, HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I went out, I created my first headquarters in Singapore for a variety of reasons.
Speaker 1: What are they?
Speaker 2: It was one of the few countries that I knew of in anywhere in the developing world where you could get and receive cable by telephone.  You could drink the water (laughter).  It was a British colony.  Now, my responsibility was to develop a program for ADC in those countries.  The goal of the program was to develop the world's social scientists in these countries, concentrating largely on the human capital.  Why?  Most of these countries were former colonies, and the colonial powers would try to resist or prevent the development of the policy sciences which were the areas where the greatest number of revolutionaries had developed.  So the result was, when I did my ship-board tour and I went to the countries, there were no Ph.D.'s in economics or agricultural economics in Thailand.  There were no Ph.D.'s in economics or agricultural economics in Malaysia.  There were two Ph.D.'s in economics in Singapore.  There were no Ph.D.'s in economics or agricultural economics in Indonesia.  There were none in Vietnam, okay.  Never mind about Cambodia and Laos, okay.  That's the starting point.  What did we have?  We had programs of making research grants, library grants, fellowships for graduate study to get the caliber of people trained up, and any other activities that would help to nurture and develop.
Story_ID: 536006
Speaker 1: One of the key programs [of the Agricultural Development Council] was the fellowship program to give doctorates to these individuals.  Now, we also had a program of visiting professors who came out for two years to particular universities.  So I had a visiting professor in Thailand, different ones at different times.  I negotiated a contract for a visiting professor in agricultural economics at a brand new college of agriculture in Vietnam, in (unclear).  I negotiated a contract for a visiting professor in Medan in Sumatra [Indonesia]. I had a visiting professor at the University of Malaya in Singapore [National University of Singapore, Singapore] while I was there, okay.  Those are the visiting professors.  I then, also, had a--I was involved in teaching at the University of Malaya in Singapore, and I also was involved when we moved the headquarters to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia at the new University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur.  Yeah.  What did I do?  I had--I had the first regional conference in Southeast Asia of all the people that I had known of and heard about or involved in economics and agricultural economics in universities and particularly, also, ministries in agriculture and so on.  They came to Kuala Lumpur and had a big conference.  They all presented their papers.  Okay.  That became a focal point when many of them had never had a chance to meet and talk.  This is how few were there, okay.  Now--then I had to get fellowships.  I would go to see the deputy prime minister in Kuala Lumpur, Tun Razak, [Abdul Razak Hussein] and I would say, "I have identified five bright young men that I believe you need to give a chance to go to the United States to get their Ph.D.'s."  He would say, "They're very bright.  I know them all.  But we cannot afford to lose them.  All the British are leaving.  We can't afford it."  I said, "But, you've got to get your own people.  You cannot rely upon the UN [United Nations] and the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] and--but you need your own people."  "Oh, no."  Okay.  I kept going and going and going, and finally, finally, he said, "Okay.  I'll let Argos go."  His name was Argos Sallin [ph.].  Now, Argos Sallin was then working for the government.  I gave him a fellowship to go and get a doctorate at the University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin].  He had done an undergraduate thesis on land reform.  We sent him to Wisconsin to work with Kenneth Parsons, who was one of their leading people on land tenure, land reform.  He got the fellowship.  We then gave him a grant to come back to Malaysia to collect data for his doctorate.  When he finished his Ph.D., he came back to go to work for the top ministry, which the deputy ministry headed, became one of his key people.  We then gave him grants to go to regional international conferences.  We gave him grants to do research projects.  We did all kinds of things.  The relationship was an extended, longitudal relationship.  It wasn't just, give me the money.  Now, he subsequently became head of two different ministries that I can recall.  He became chairman of the committee which created a brand-new university in Malaysia.  He did all kinds of things.  He's retired now.  Now, this was my first person from Malaysia.  I actually elected people from Thailand, I had one or two from Vietnam.
Story_ID: 536007
Speaker 1: These individuals, to give you one little vignette to show you what it's like.  When I was deputy secretary of state, Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I went on a visit out to Southeast Asia.  Our first stop was Thailand.  The ambassador wanted to host a dinner for us the day we arrived in Bangkok [Thailand], and I said, "Look, I have a rule.  Don't do any work for twenty-four hours."  "Oh," back and forth, back and forth.  Finally, he said, "Well, we're having a very small group of only five Thais."  I said, "Fine.  We'll do it."  We arrived at the dinner, and the ambassador starts to introduce us to these five people.  The immediate reaction, "Oh, we know Dr. and Mrs. Wharton."  The president of the university, I had given him his doctorate in the states, the deputy director the central bank.  I mean three out of five.  Okay.  These were people I had, you know, worked with for years.  And one of them in the ministry was very funny.  During the dinner he said, he said, "You may not realize it," he said, "but, there was an op-ed piece that you did."  Now, mind you, this is in 1993.  He's talking about something that happened--it would have been probably in 1961 or '60 [1960].  He said, "You did a piece called 'Monocultural Perennial Export Dominance' ["Monocultural Perennial Export Dominance: The Inelasticity of Southeast Asian Agricultural Trade," Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.]."  And I said, "Yes."  He said, "That caused the ministry to spend months trying to figure out how we could answer your question."  What it was was very simple.  I had done some research which concentrated on perennials: rubber, oil palm and also rice.  They were exporting it.  But these crops are subject to high degrees of price fluctuation.  And this was their major source of foreign currency.  I said, "You've got to diversify your economies, not just agriculturally, but generally, to reduce the level of volatility in your--." Okay.  That's what the article is about.  He still remembered it, okay.  He--I broke up. I didn't realize he remembered it.  The former head of Taiwan, T.H. Lee [Lee Teng-Hui], ADC [Agricultural Development Council] fellow of Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].  I could go on and on.  Now--
Speaker 2: So you fundamentally--the work that you did fundamentally changed the nature of those countries in many ways.
Speaker 1: I wouldn't claim that.  What I would claim is this: that one of the things that we did was, at a time when it was desperately needed, we helped to develop the human capital which could work on these problems.  Not us working on them, but they could work on the problems, and they had the skills and competencies to do so.  And we nurtured them in the process to help develop those skills.  Now, the other story I can tell you, which I think is very emblematic, there was a regional conference held--I think it was, probably in South Korea--and we had, one of our visiting professors was there.  And the head--the person who was convening the conference asked everybody in the room to stand sequentially to introduce themselves.  Our visiting professor stands up and he says, "I'm the visiting professor from Such and Such organization, and Such and Such university."  And he said, "I never heard of that organization."  He said, "Who is this organization?"  And our professor looked around the room, he said, "Will all the people who received ADC fellowships or ADC grants please stand."  Two-thirds of the group rose.  And this man was dumbfounded.  Now, we didn't do this for self- aggrandizement.  They knew that we were there to work with them, not to take advantage of them or exploit them.  But we did lay the foundations for many, many areas in these countries, of the people with the skills and talent who were nationals of that country who could make these contributions.  Okay.  And this was the genius of the way Art Mosher [Arthur T. Mosher] approached and operated.
Story_ID: 536008
Speaker 1: I stayed out there [Southeast Asia] for six years.  And then, Art [Arthur T. Mosher] had started a new program for ADC [Agricultural Development Council], and I had promised that I would go out for ten years.  And he said, "Well, I really need you to come back and run this program."  So we cut it short and we came back to the states to run this new program.  The new program was the following: if you are--if you have never--if you are a faculty member in a U.S. university and you have never had overseas experience, and you applied for a grant to do work overseas, you get turned down.  You have no experience.  How do you get the experience?  If you are a young faculty--how do you get the experience?  So, I said, "Well, let's develop a program that is for the people who have not had the experience."  Okay.  So we developed--he and I developed this program which involved workshops, seminars for people who had not had the experience to meet with people who had had the experience, then we had the grants program for them to go overseas.  And I ran that for the next, what, four years, three or four years.  Now, the thing was that, those individuals went overseas and then became experts in their field, and had the experience, and could then do the work.  In the meantime, then when Art was made president of ADC, I was made vice president.  And it was clear that I was being designated in succession to succeed him.  And that's where Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] came along.  But the conference on subsistence led to the book; was a great event.
Story_ID: 536009
Speaker 1: Let me ask this--some questions here, Dr. Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.].  First of all, if you look back, the work that was done--and I'm asking this, what were the student bodies, the populations looking at, at, you know, the U.S. colleges and universities?  Did they have--what's the word?  Maybe I should ask this question.  Was the work that you did, was it increasing in numbers, I mean in, you know, in presence in those Ph.D. programs, in the master's [degree] program?
Speaker 2: Here in the U.S.?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, but the numbers are not that great.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean it was not a case of where we had large numbers of Asian students.  Now, I did do a study when I first came to ADC [Agricultural Development Council]--I've forgotten how many universities I visited, something like twelve or sixteen--to interview the Asian students studying there, the faculty who worked with them, to find out what the problems were.  I then went to Asia and did the same thing in reverse, and that became a little of a monograph, which became quite well known.
Speaker 1: What did your study show?  What did it show?
Speaker 2: Oh, it showed that there were problems in terms of the experience base of the U.S. faculty, some of the personal problems of adjustment, all kinds of things.  But I categorized them and so on.  And it--it's very interesting because you have to understand what life was like both in the U.S. universities and abroad at that time.  I could go to so many of these universities over there if they had them, where just getting the basics for certain things was very critical.  And it was--also, it was a matter of getting their confidence and trust.  Now, for example, at the University of Malaya [National University of Singapore, Singapore], all the time I was being quote, a foundation official, I was also teaching.  And I taught sixteen hours a week, which was the regular workload.  And one of my most interesting experiences was in developing an experimental course in the teaching of economics, which was an approach which is totally different from the way it's taught regularly.  And the students just loved it.  And then, when I sent the students from my classes with an ADC fellowship to go to the states, in those days they were required to attend a special program for foreign students in economics held at Boulder, Colorado.  And at the end of the program they took tests.  It really was to test them to see how well prepared they were to study economics in the United States, because they knew coming from all over the world that they were highly uneven in qualification.  And the chap who ran the program for many years said that, one of my students just topped the class.  He said, "How much economics did you teach him?"  I said, "He only had two courses."  He said, "You're kidding?"  I said, "No."  My course and one other one.  It was the basic first-year course that I taught, and he had learned it like--but then again, like two prior students in Singapore.  One of them became a professor at the university, was elected to parliament in Singapore, became Lee Kuan Yew, the president's economic advisor, was a consultant with the World Bank.  He's now provost of the university.  And he was one of my crack students.  I mean I had him.  I mean, I had another student and a female student.  They both became top officers in the Overseas Chinese Bank [Overseas Chinese Bank Corporation] of the region.  She became the highest ranking female banker.  They were all mine.  I gave them--I had them work for me doing research and so on.  I mean, it's--.  But again, it's the human capital that we try to develop, not to sort of say, "I did such and such" or "I--," you know, "I created this new adventure."  It was not that at all.  And it is a question of where we wanted to see to it that what was left behind could have a positive impact and be beneficial.  And, by in large, I would say it was accomplished.

Speaker 1: How did that experience in Asia, I mean those six years, how did it influence you, and what--I know your one--your second--
Speaker 2: Son.
Speaker 1: --son was born then.  I hear that it was sort of life without the racism for, you know, of a respite at the time when, you know, there's social activity, you know, I mean, there is activism, Civil Rights Movement going on.  So, I just want you to explain to me, because I'm wondering did you have a sense of the problems with Vietnam, you know, around that--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --it was early, but you know, I--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is.  Really, those are big subjects.  I would say that as far as the people of Southeast Asia were concerned, I really had a sense that race played a part in my effectiveness in being able to work there.  With the Americans, yes and no, or the British, there were a limited number of instances that I could really think about that were that way.  There was one which was kind of amusing which was--to a certain extent.  The club in Kuala Lumpur [Malaysia] had a, what you call it, a dressy--not dress party where you get dressed up, a ball--and one group came in in blackface.  And they had a picture of this in the local newspaper.  And Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] (laughter) wrote them a blasting letter talking about it's about time we're released from this white man's burden (laughter).  And all of the Malayans cheered.  And that was very interesting.  We had--but there were very few instances like that.  It was--it was not something that you sort of spent time thinking about while you were working.  That said, we were increasingly aware of what was happening back in the states.  All of the issues of the Civil Rights Movement which was taking--beginning to really catch hold then.  And that was very much there in terms of your awareness of what was happening in the states.  The--there were--the--I think.  One of the instances that was--brought this home, and I'll mention this one.  When Dolores and I were married, as I said, in Miss Anderson's [Marian Anderson] studio, the priest from our church in Boston [Massachusetts] officiated as did the priest from St. Philip's Church here in New York City [New York, New York], Father Bishop [Shelton Hale Bishop].  And Father Bishop succeeded his father [Hutchens Chew Bishop] as head of the church, and the church was the largest Episcopal Church here in New York City.  Wonderful man, wonderful man.  And he had married Dolores' mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] and father [V. Kenneth Duncan], he had baptized her brother and her, he had baptized our son Clifton [Clifton R. Wharton III].  And so, when we were flying back to the states, we stopped in Hawaii so he could baptize our son Bruce [Bruce Wharton].  He had retired to Hawaii, and he had been given, in his retirement, a church that was about two-thirds the size of this room, open sides and a thatch roof.  And here's a man who had the largest parish in New York City, and he was officiating.  And one day, the main church invited him to give a sermon, true story.  He came to the church to give the sermon and instead of him getting up in the pulpit, he sat in the main, turned around, kneeled down, and he gave a sermon asking that that parish which engaged in horrific discrimination against blacks and Hawaiians would be forgiven.  You know, they removed him from the church, and he still loved the church.  I tell you, it was really--I mean, this was a man.  I mean, he's had--the courage that this man had to do that.  And the interest--and he was doing it from the standpoint of his religion and their religion.  It was unbelievable, okay.  That was racism in terms of (unclear).  And, you talk about hitting it, it hits you when you do that.  But, but he, as I say, they, we were aware of it.
Story_ID: 536011
Speaker 1: The other question was about Vietnam, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) and what the--
Speaker 2: Well (laughter), oh, boy.  I--on my first visit to Vietnam--one thing I should explain.  Whenever I went to a new country, I would always pay a courtesy call on the U.S. ambassador, because many of them knew my father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.], and I was being courteous.  Plus it gives you entree to the people in the embassy.  On my first trip to Vietnam, there was an insurgency, but not overly.  I mean, you had to watch where you were going and be protected, but not badly.  And when I finished my tour, I came back and visited with the ambassador, and then he brought into the room a couple of people from the Agency for International Development, U.S. [United States Agency for International Development], and then one of his aides from the embassy.  And we talked and chatted, and I said it was a good visit and so on.  So he says, "Well, is there anything that you've learned that you think we should know about?"  So I said, "Yes."  I said, "There's one thing," I said, "which I really think is very important and that is, the Vietnamese government--."  Vietnam was exporting rice, it was a net exporter.  I said, "But the government buys the rice from the farmers at a price that is below the world market price, and that is to keep the price low, particularly in the capital city.  Then they export the rice and they get the world market price and it's a tax, because they don't pay the farmer anything except an inside price that they set."  I said, "The farmers are very unhappy about it."  The response I got was, "Oh, well, we can't afford to do that.  We might have riots in the city, and besides, you know, these are illiterate peasants."  And I said, "I'll tell you something."  I said, "They may be illiterate, but they're not stupid."  But they wouldn't do anything about it, okay.  Fast forward.  I'd been going back and forth to Vietnam.  I had not had a vacation for almost six years.  My wife [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] insisted that I take one, which was wonderful.  If she hadn't done it, I never would have had one.  Anyway, we took a boat trip up to Japan, two weeks up to Japan, two weeks in Japan, then two weeks back.  I get up to Japan, two weeks, I came back--I get back on the ship.  I get a phone call from the embassy in Japan.  "The embassy in Vietnam wants you to fly down to Vietnam."  "Why?"  "They want to talk to you about rice price policy."  So I said, "Look, I'm on a vacation.  I promised my wife and I'm going to keep my word."  So I didn't go up until I'd gotten back to Kuala Lumpur [Malaysia].  I go up to Kuala Lumpur, I look at the situation.  By this time the price is, you know, blowing up.  And I said, "You really need to look at the rice price policy."  "No, no, no."  Did they do anything?  No.  Get the picture?  Nineteen sixty-six [1966], President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] decides that we need to fight the rice roots of Asia and Vietnam.  So he organizes with the secretary of agriculture, Freeman [Orville Freeman], a topnotch mission to go to Vietnam to help them in agriculture.  I'm one of the members.  We get over there, I see quite a few of my friends.  I was worried that they might think I was, you know, gone over to the enemies.  Anyway, I go over there and the problem is worse than ever.  Why?  The Vietcong and the sympathizers at night would go in, commandeer the rice and say, "We will be back in a day or two, and we will pay you the world market price."  Then they'd come back and pay them.  Who do you think they liked?  So, get to Washington [D.C.], I talk to the people there.  I said, "Look, I've talked to you people about this twice before."  "Oh, we can't do that.  They'll overthrow the government."  That's my--one of my Vietnam stories.  We had, I would say--we were absolutely not only inept, but we had no--we did not have enough people who knew Vietnam and understood Vietnam.  And that was a big failing on our part.  This goes into another issue that I had dealt with when I was in the state department [U.S. Department of State] about the, what I call the excessive rotation of our officers.  But, this was a case in my mind where if something had been done about it before, I don't know that that would have stopped it, but they would have--at the time I first recommended it, it would have been a blip and not a major one.  They wouldn't do it.  And also, the intelligence services over there, the non-U.S. intelligence, that is the British and the French, they knew what was going on.  They knew what was going on.  But it was--it's very strange.  We just don't bring forth, and we don't have the people, we really don't.  And we didn't in those days.  We had some, but not a lot.  And there was so much that could be just picked up with a ship-board tour. You don't have to go very far to find out. If people believe that you, well, are interested and really want to know what they think, they'll tell you.   You know, you don't have to push them awfully hard to find out what's going on.  On the side, what's going on today about Walter Reed [Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Washington, D.C.]?  People been raising Cain like this for a long time, a long time.  Nobody was paying attention.  It's just, you know, mindset, block it out.  So, I don't know.

Speaker 1: --Julieanna Richardson, I'm the interviewer, and Matthew Hickey is the videographer, and we have Alyce Emory as the observer.  And I'd like to have you start out.  We're going to start out slating again.  So, I just need to have you state your name and spell it for us and give us today's date and our location.
Speaker 2: Clifton Reginald Wharton, Jr. [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], C-L-I-F-T-O-N, R middle initial, W-H-A-R-T-O-N, Jr., and we are on May 15, 2007, and at the offices of TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund], in New York City, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We had talked about your, you know, really the role--.  Where we ended was you talking about being part of, or advising LBJ [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] or the administration, on rice, the price of rice?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, the--well, first there was the various times when I had been called upon to provide--
Speaker 1: Analysis.
Speaker 2: --advice on the problems of agriculture in Vietnam and, particularly, the question that was raised regarded rice.  Then in 1966 I was named to a special agricultural mission to Vietnam by President Johnson, and the mission was headed by the then Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what's--that's in 1966.  Now, is that still with the time that you were working with the [U.S.] Department of State, you know, under advisory panels?  Was that part of that from '66 [1966] through '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: By that time, I think the panel was probably--I'm not certain if it was still meeting.  It met very frequently.  I was still working for the Agricultural Development Council in New York City [New York, New York], and I'm not certain whether the committee was still meeting.  It probably was.
Story_ID: 536013
Speaker 1: Let me ask this: you were still working with the Rockefeller administra- you know, foundation [Rockefeller Foundation], this whole period, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And we had already established that a lot of the research had been done in South America, but this was sort of, you know, the results of this work focused on East Asia at this time period during the Vietnam War, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  The Agricultural Development Council was created in 1953, and it was entirely devoted to the problems of agricultural development in Asia.  The--my earlier work had been with Nelson Rockefeller in Latin America.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Right.  And that was from 1948 to--.  Yeah, '48 [1948] to 1953.  But now, this was the period of time when I--.  For thirteen years I was working for the Agricultural Development Council.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me ask you, Dr. Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], what else would you consider as significant about your work during those thirteen--that thirteen year period?  Again, you had spoken of, you know, really the time that you spent in each stage and how it was a very productive time with--in terms of, you know, well, a learning curve, but also the family life and the friendships that you developed there.
Speaker 2: Well, the significance of the period of where we worked, when we lived in Southeast Asia for six years, Mrs. Wharton [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], our son Clifton [Clifton R. Wharton III], and our son Bruce [Bruce Wharton] was born in Singapore--was a very important period in our lives family wise, because I covered the different countries of Southeast Asia.  It was a time when many of those countries were becoming independent or recently had become independent.  They were in a sense seeking their own identity.  There were very few persons who were--had doctorates in the fields that I was concerned with, in terms of both making grants to them, and also in terms of providing them with fellowships to go and study for their doctorates.  So it almost like virgin territory for my work.  And it was also a very important period of time because, during those entire six years I taught.  I taught an average of twelve to sixteen hours a week, which is the normal in a university, plus operated in the region as a foundation official.  So it was a very busy time, but it was also a very rewarding time.  One of the important aspects of this for me, after the fact, is to--the ability to watch many of my former students and my former grantees blossom in the region.  Many of them had become outstanding leaders in their countries.  And it's been great to see this happen and watch what occurred as a result of the opportunity that I had to work with them and provide them with an exposure to economics and to the problems of the region, et cetera.  But, then coming back, it also meant that I was able to--I was seen to a great extent as a person who had a deep understanding of the problems of Southeast Asia.  And that was the reason why I was tapped, for example, for that committee in the [U.S.] Department of State, to serve on the committee to advise on East Asia in the Pacific.  And there were other things that occurred, and I began to be asked to serve on different kinds of nonprofit organizations, and so I was drawn in, in that fashion.  And then that, in turn, led to my eventually being offered to become a member of the board of directors of Equitable life insurance company [Equitable Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial].  But all of that was part of that total exposure because I had come back.  I was seen as an expert on the region.  I was then tapped for a variety of activities.  And so you broadened--at least I was able to be involved in a more broad sphere than just the narrow foundation field.
Story_ID: 536014
Speaker 1: I want to ask a couple of questions, and this is sort of a hindsight question.  Given the work--first of all, what was the United States' thought about East Asia during that time period from a, you know, a larger perspective?
Speaker 2: The overwhelming--.  The overwhelming foreign policy concern was over the threat of communism, and the fact that there was a domino theory; that is, if Vietnam became Communist, then the other countries of Southeast Asia would be thrown over and they'll become Communist.  And that was a very--.  That was almost the overwhelming foreign policy goal in terms of what we were trying to achieve.  I would say that to--from a personal standpoint, I was very conscious of the fact that the work that I was doing and that the Agricultural Development Council was doing, the foundation [Rockefeller Foundation] was doing, was a long-term process.  I was concentrating on building human capital in the region, national human capital.  And amazingly, during that was something which, in fact, had the desired result, not the short-term set of issues.  Also, because Vietnam was one of the countries in my region, I became familiar with some of the leaders in Vietnam in the academic community and some of them in the government.  This is in South Vietnam.  I quickly became aware of the fact that we grossly misread the situation in terms of Vietnam, South Vietnam, and North Vietnam.  I knew at the time after investigating and studying it, that Tito [Josip Broz Tito] really was much more--.  I'm sorry, not Tito, but Ho Chi Minh was very much like Tito in Yugoslavia.  He was a patriot, he was a nationalist.  The issue was then who was going to lead that country in a unified fashion.  And we were supporting Diem [Ngo Dinh Diem].  We were not supporting Ho Chi Minh` because he was a Communist.  We were fearful of that as a Communist.  So it was a very interesting time to be there.  I was not working on foreign policy at that time.  But I was able to see what was taking place.  But also, that was a period of time when I was, in a sense when I was living there, was working on the periphery at times of foreign policy issues or becoming aware of them.  Then when I came back to the states, that's when I was drawn in to work with the committee.  I was also drawn in to the work of The Asia Society.  Then I went on the board of The Asia Society which had been created also by John D. Rockefeller III.  So there was a shift in focus, but also, based upon the foundation of what had been learned and accomplished and done while I was living in Southeast Asia.
Story_ID: 536015
Speaker 1: And do you think or can you speak to the, to John D. Rockefeller [John D. Rockefeller III] and his focus also, was his focus on the development of human capital?  Did you think that was the overall running (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His--well, that's an interesting question.  His primary focus--.  As you may know, he was viewed--within the brother generation, he was the oldest.  He was viewed as the philanthropist.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: There was Nelson [Nelson Rockefeller] the politician, and Laurance [Laurance Rockefeller] the businessman, and David [David Rockefeller] was the banker; but John was the philanthropist.  And he was at that time, chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation.  And what he did was, he created--he was interested in Asia, so there was The Asia Society which he's created.  He renewed the Japan Society.  He was interested in the problems of food, and population, and the race between the two.  So he created the Population Council.  He then created an organization which eventually became the Agricultural Development Council.  So it was food and population that he was interested in.  The reason why we concentrated on the world social scientists and human capital was that was the most neglected area in terms of the development process in the region.  So it was an indirect concern, and he eventually came to understand the significance of it, but it was not because he said, "I want to invest in human capital."  There's some more to it, but that's enough to give a flavor of what was happening.  Now, coming back to the states then, with a sense--in a sense, a broader sense of activities, I was heading up a new program in the council which was to encourage young scholars at U.S. universities, who were interested in acquiring competency in research on foreign issues in Asia, the opportunity to engage in that research.  If you stop and think about it, one of the problems is that, if you have not done it before and you don't have the experience and you apply for a grant to do research, they say, well, how can you do it, you haven't had the experience.  So how do you get the experience?  So we developed a program which was specifically designed for young people to get that preliminary experience.  And we also, as part of the program developed workshops and seminars on major problem areas of development, and we hosted them all over the United States.  We also visited various universities to hold these conferences and seminars.  We made grants to the various universities, and it was during that time that I regularly visited major universities all over the United States.  Now, if you stop and think about it, to a certain extent that gave me exposure in higher education.  I wasn't thinking of it in those terms.  But I also came back with a body of research work of my own, which had been published and was well-known.  Then my book came out on 'Subsistence Agriculture and Economic Development,' [ed. Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], based upon the conference.  So within the higher education community, in many quarters I was a known quantity.  And so, that was the way in which this all happened.
Story_ID: 536016
Speaker 1: In an earlier conversation with your colleague, one of the things that I was asked was how did these things happen to me.  And I said a good deal of it was serendipity and a combination of being ready, of your being ready and the institution or setting being ready.  And what happened in this particular case, which I think in retrospect was very fascinating, is that when the preliminary inquiries were made to me early on, I was asked about whether I would be interested in two department chairmanships at universities.  And I said no.
Speaker 2: When you came back?
Speaker 1: When I came back, yeah, yeah.  And then--
Speaker 2: Which ones were they?
Speaker 1: I won't mention it because it's always embarrassing to them to say, "Well, you turned it down."  But--so I said no.  And they were major universities.  And one was in the field of consumer economics, the other one was in agricultural economics.  I said, "No, no.  I'm very happy."  By that time, I was--had become vice president of the Agricultural Development Council.  And then, this one I can tell, then I was asked whether I'd be willing to be--have my name submitted for the presidency of the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And I said that's interesting.  So, I went out, met some of the people, but nothing came of it.  Subsequently, after that--
Speaker 2: You mean in Ann Arbor [Michigan] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I--In Ann Arbor, right.  Right.  After that, I was approached about the Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] presidency.  Now, I knew the university.  I said, "Aha!"  I said, "Now that one is one that fits."  They had the strongest and most outstanding international program of any state university in the country.  Many of the individuals in the Department of Agricultural Economics [Department of Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics] were friends, colleagues, professionals.  They were very committed in the earliest stages of work with regard to underprivileged youths, black youths from the inner city of Detroit [Michigan].  They were interested in being a people's university, which appealed to me.   They had all of the different elements.  I said, "Boy, now, that's one where I think I could--really find attractive."  But I had not thought about being the university president at all until these queries began to come.  Even before Michigan there was another university in this part of the country which approached me, too, would I be a candidate, and I said no.  But this one, I said, "Okay, go ahead."  And that's how the Michigan State development took place.
Story_ID: 536017
Speaker 1: I want to ask you because you serving on the board of Equitable [Equitable Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial] came before, right, did it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right at about the same time.
Speaker 1: It came right at the same time.
Speaker 2: Before I was offered the job, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, huh.  Now, tell me how that came about before we get to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], because that's at that time there, you know, this is a very new thing for--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --African Americans.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'll back up.  When I came back to the United States, to New York [New York], I had been back a couple of years, John D. Rockefeller III asked me did I belong to any clubs in New York, and I said no.  So, as a result of his interest, because he wanted to break the barrier at the University Club [University Club of New York, New York, New York] which did not have any blacks, I think it only had two or three Jews.  And his brother, Nelson [Nelson Rockefeller], had resigned over the issue.  He wanted to put me forward as a candidate for the membership of the University Club.
Speaker 1: Now, you saying Nelson had resigned his issue of the limited in terms of what they have in terms of their membership?
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.  He was against the fact that they were discriminating and he resigned in protest.  John D. Rockefeller III says, "I stayed because I want to fight it from within."  And then he called upon me to see if I would be willing to be put forward, and I said yes.  Now, what happened was, you have to know John D. III's personality.  Very quiet, very thoughtful, he reflects on things for quite a while.  But when he makes up his mind, he's a tiger.  And so, he had decided he was going to do this.  Now, he was a former, I believe a former president of the club.  He then put together a list of seconders for my nomination that included the former secretary of the army, former founder of the legal law firm of Debevoise, Plimpton and McLean [Debevoise and Plimpton LLP], the--you get the picture.  The head of the--then CEO of--Harold Helm, head of Chemical Bank; and also, the chairman of the board of Equitable Life, who was one of the best seconders.  And so, I had to go around and meet them, and then they would submit their letters supporting my nomination, okay.  Now, the club, I am told, had a fit.  They did not know what to do with my nomination.  And then a few weeks before they were to act on my nomination, this was in 1969, I was appointed president of Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  And the chairman of the club's nominating committee called John D. Rockefeller III and said, "We don't have to operate--act on this at all.  He now has--Dr. Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] now has automatic privileges, club privileges."  And John, in typical fashion, he said, "What does that mean?"  And he said, "Well, he gets to use the club just like a regular member."  He said, "But that's not a regular membership."  "No."  He said, "Well, what happens when he's no longer president?"  He said, "Well, he'll have to apply all over."  John said, "We've gone this far, let's go all the way," (laughter).  And so, I'm the only president that I know of who's become a member of the club, not as a result of being a university president, but being elected normally.  Now, having met these people and met Jim Oates [James F. Oates, Jr.], who was then the head of Equitable, they were interested in me.  So, and this is probably more than you want to know.  Jim Oates and his number two at that time, Henry Smith [J. Henry Smith], had developed one of the most incredible internal plans for the development and the promotion of blacks within Equitable.  He had numbers by year and level of what they had hoped to achieve, so that they would bring them all the way through the company, up to the highest levels.  One of the people that they had in that plan when they showed it to me, when they were speaking to me about joining, possibly joining the board, one of the people was Darwin Davis [HistoryMaker Darwin N. Davis, Sr.].  I knew Darwin from Detroit [Michigan], and he was at that point, low down, but he would--.  It was scheduled for him and others that they had identified to move up through the ranks of the company.  And I was very impressed.  I said, this is something where this company is a real--has a really strong commitment to action that will increase the diversity at the upper levels of their company.  And it was real.  It was not window dressing, you know.  This was back in 1969, okay.  So, when they asked me to join, I said I would be honored.  Now--and that meant that I was the third black in the entire country to go on a corporate board, because the others were Weaver [Robert C. Weaver] and Sam Pierce [Samuel Pierce].
Speaker 1: Reginald Weaver [sic.], right--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Clifton Weaver, yeah.
Speaker 1: Reginald?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Sam Pierce.  And so, it was--that was Cliff Weaver, the former secretary.
Speaker 1: Cliff.  I'm sorry.  Cliff.  That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the former secretary.  And both of them had been secretary at that particular time.  As a matter of fact, I was the third.  And so, that's how I went on the Equitable board (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, what boards were they serving on?
Speaker 2: They were also both on insurance company boards, which is very interesting.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: There were three insurance companies, um-hm, yeah.
Story_ID: 536018
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you.  I want you to just comment in, in context before we get to Michigan [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] because it is 1969.  I want you to sort of explain, what was driving, you know, what were the factors driving these issues, you know, because we were--.  The country had been in turmoil, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But I'm just, you know, because you're looking at, you know, there're different ways to look at the 1969 period, you know.  You're looking at the highest echelon, you know, of society.  So that's what I'm trying to get.  We don't have that perspective a lot in our archive.
Speaker 2: It would be hard for me to be definitive.  I can only surmise as to what was happening.  I think that there have always been individuals--I'm speaking of white individuals--in our society who have been concerned and bothered by the issues of discrimination, a concern over civil rights.  Some are vocal, some are not.  But they have this in their--in their DNA.  And I think that in--it happened that in the instances of many of these firms, the early ones that placed blacks on their board, it was not--I don't believe it was really just window dressing in that--in those cases.  I think what was happening was, the country had been in turmoil; there were the various riots if you remember, Detroit [Michigan] and so on, and they said, "This is terrible.  We've got to do something.  We have to do something."  And they also, I think, wanted to have the opportunity for an individual or individuals who could provide them with an insight into doing what they wanted to do the right way.  So, for example, at Equitable [Equitable Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial] it was very interesting when they met with me, the two men, the chairman and the CEO, they stressed that they were not asking me because I was black.  They said that's an important factor, but that's not the main--only factor.  They said, "You bring a tremendous international background.  You bring a background that is intellectual in terms of the field."  They went through the whole list with me.  They knew who I was.  And they said, "But that's something we need on the board."  And sure, black was important, but it was not the sole reason, because you can't be a single-issue director and be successful.  And I watched them over the period of time.  Now, a side anecdote was when I was elected to the board, I said to Jim Oates [James F. Oates, Jr.], I said--and to Henry [J. Henry Smith], I said, "I'm going to take off a week from my regular work, and I want to come over to the offices for five days during a week, and I want you to set up meetings for me with each of the major divisions of Equitable and their leadership of those divisions, and I want to be briefed on their work in the company." They had never had a director do this before.  So every morning I'd go to my office and at ADC [Agricultural Development Council], and then I'd walk over to 6th Avenue into the Equitable building [New York, New York], which is where they were at the time.  And every day I was briefed by the major areas of the company by their leaders.  And then I went to my first board meeting, and they had a good sense of humor, and Jim Oates says, "I want you to meet Cliff Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.]," he said.  "He just has spent a week in the company learning about the company.  He probably knows more about the company now than any of you are around the company."  Now, I used to do that with any new board I went on.  Why?  Well, go back to my earlier going about, you know, my shipboard tours.  But I wanted to find out.  I wanted to be in position--understand.  I wasn't just going to sit there in the board meeting and try to really understand what was happening.  No.  Go out and get educated, become educated.  So I did.  It was a--it was a wonderful experience.  I learned about boards, I learned a lot about activities, I met some fascinating people.  Some nice, not so nice, you know.  But just like anything else.  But it was a--it was a very wonderful first step in terms of entry into the corporate world (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 536019
Speaker 1: Just one oth- last question about that.  What did you learn about boards at that point [at Equitable Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial]?
Speaker 2: A number of things.  First, that you have a fundamental responsibility to your shareholders, and your role is one which is critical in terms of defining the goals, the mission, the activities of the organization; and above all, selecting the leadership.  You cannot be a one-issue director, you have to have a multiple set of abilities to contribute to the process, you do not--you have to work together; you can disagree, but whatever takes place in the boardroom is kept within the boardroom.  You can have an impact.  They are willing to accept your views and recommendations, particularly if they have confidence in you and your judgment as well as in your competencies.  For example, as you know, my wife, Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], went on a lot of corporate boards.  On two of the boards that she was on, she was the person who pushed for the creation of committees of the board on corporate social responsibility, and she chaired eventually both of them.  People frequently ask, "Well, how did she get on all these boards?"  Well, she went on the first one and she was very, very good.  Okay.  She goes on the boards, then another board, she became chairman of the competition committee.  Now, it's--you have to have the abilities.  You can't just say, "Well, I'm here because I'm going to help somebody get a job."  No, that's not what you do.  But, the other thing is, you do have the chance to gain an indirect insight into what is happening in the different sectors.  It differs depending upon the board, but you do because you have people from all walks of Corporate America, as well as business, and higher education, and law, and banking.  It's a very interesting mix.  And you really begin to get a much better sense of what is happening at those levels in the United States.
Speaker 1: And the board--would you say the boards of today, how do they differ from the boards back then? Do--I mean in 1969, trememndoous (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, there are a lot of differences.  First of all--
Speaker 1: Boards are all, I think, part of a private club though, too, in a way.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  There is that element.  There was that element.  But that's inevitable and I'll tell you why.
Story_ID: 536020
Speaker 1: I would say that, first of all, there is no question about what the boards have become through time more diverse both in terms of race, ethnicity, and gender.  And also in a strange way, they've become more less attractive to many people because of the increased legal vulnerability in being a director.  There was a time when there was a legal action the primary focus was on the president, chief executive officer, and his top leadership.  And there was a secondary vulnerability to the board because you were not expected to have the same of knowledge as the CEO executives did.  As a result of various pieces of litigation, the court decision, that has been blurred now so that you're just as vulnerable as the operating officers are.  Secondly, with Sarbanes-Oxley [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002], the amount of time that is required to bring everything up to snuff, and to be concerned about knowing everything, has increased tremendously.  So, many people say, I don't need this.  That's not worth my--putting myself in that situation. Another criticism which I had made and published on is that, there--many other companies have reduced the frequency of their board meetings.  When I went on Equitable [Equitable Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial], we met eleven times a year.  When I was on the Ford Motor Company board, we met ten times a year.  Many of the corporations began to go back and now they will meet, let's say, twice--three times a year, something like that.  At the same time that the corporations are becoming larger and more complex.  And I argue, you can't remember from three months what happened at the last board meeting.  It is just not--believe me, you're not there full time.  And I believe that they should not have moved in that direction.  Now, also, the stress and strain on CEOs is increased, particularly when they're publicly held, due to the pressure to meet the targets and quarterly targets.  It's horrendous.  And that has a very unwanted effect upon the long term operation of many of the companies.  But I can go into great length on it, but those are some of the major changes that have taken place.  It is--it does have--it's still needed, it's very important.  When I was head of TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York], we had a very strong corporate governance unit and activity.  I changed what had been an ad hoc committee into a permanent committee on the board level.  We did a lot of things in the corporate governance area, whether it was South Africa or shareholder vote, split votes, and things like that.  We did all sorts of things connected with that.  But that was the main goal, to change it.
Story_ID: 536021
Speaker 1: Now, to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], I--what is curious to me, you know, you said that you had had, prior to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and Michigan State, you know, two universities talk about, you know, being a dean.  But--
Speaker 2: Department chairman.
Speaker 1: Department chairman, sorry.  Which is different from dean.  So, but this is a quantum leap, you know, in many ways to be, you know, I mean this is a major state university to be a university president.  What had they done in the search?  I mean, who was your predecessor and how did they go about, you know, what--why did this even come about?  I mean, you're in the East, this is the Midwest, I mean, you know.  You had gone around touring these places, but that's a whole different--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, ballgame.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And it's the Midwest too.  That's the other thing I find.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Well, I don't--I can only give you what I know in my perspective, okay.  First of all, when I was with ADC [Agricultural Development Council], particularly in Southeast Asia, my role in many ways was very much like a department chairman.  I had visited professors in Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, okay.  I was teaching, I was engaging in research, I was even dealing with--I was giving graduate training to some students.  So, I was really an academic.  I was a foundation official, but I also had the academic dimension.  So, in a way, it was like becoming--being a department chairman who was attractive, okay.  Now, but I also had this other aspect of being in the philan- philanthropic world.  So to a certain extent, that elevated me, might say, to the dean or provost level, in terms of administration.  Number two, my involvement internationally was very strong, and so is Michigan State's.
Story_ID: 536022
Speaker 1: So when my name was submitted along with many others, I think they had three or four hundred nominations, there were certain people on the Michigan State campus who pushed for me.  The chairman of the search committee was somebody I knew professionally--no, not from that, but professionally I knew him.  He knew me professionally.  There were many others like that in the campus.  Now, the interesting part of the story begins when--you have to understand the governance of Michigan State and the politics of Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], Michigan State and Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] universities had boards of trustees or governors or regents who are nominated in state party conventions, and they run on a ticket statewide, okay.  So that, once they have--when they--and they campaign around the state.  And the persons who are selected by the parties to run may or may not have any understanding or connection whatsoever with higher education.  They're in a political process.  Now, it so happens that, at the time when the search was underway, the board at Michigan State had five Democrats and three Republicans.  And three of the Democrats wanted to have as the next president Soapy Williams [G. Mennen Williams], the former governor of Michigan, who had just finished a tour of duty as ambassador to the Philippines.  However, the board had agreed from the very beginning that they would never consider anybody who did not pass and get the approval of the search committee.  So the search committee went about their task, and it was made up of faculty and students, and they selected I think it was five names to be submitted to the board, and I was one of the five.  Meanwhile, the three persons who were very interested in promoting Soapy Williams for a variety of reasons, were very angry because the committee would not put Soapy Williams on the list.   There's a lot of chicanery that went on about all of this.  It was really incredible.  It was one of the most interesting--it's almost like a Shakespearean play what went on.  But anyway, the outcome of this was that they did, the three, did everything they could to block any action to be taken by the board.  And when it came up--it became clear that, that I was the preferred choice, they leaked the names of all the member--the candidates to the press.  And this was done so that people would stop being candidates.  I think two people withdrew their names.  I didn't, which is stated.  They did all sorts of things like that.  Now, so, it came the time for me to be selected.  And even up to the last minute, they tried everything they could, these three, to stop my appointment.  Even when they had the official open board meeting, they tried various tricks to stop it from happening.  So I was elected on a five to three vote, two Democrats and three Republicans versus three Democrats.  Okay.  So that's how I became president of Michigan State.  And my name was submitted by one of the blacks, who is a Democrat.  He nominated me for the position.  Now, for the next sev- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was his name?  Do you remember?
Speaker 1: Blanche Martin, doctor.  He was a physician, dentist.
Story_ID: 536023
Speaker 1: For the next several years, those three, I call them the troika, did everything they could at every single board meeting to get me dismissed, every single meeting.  It was incredible.  And when I met--before I even took office, I met with all of the trustees individually, and I've written about this in my book, and asked each of them, I said, "Now that I've been selected, I think we should close ranks and, you know, try to work for the university, and would you tell me what you think we need to do and what your priorities are, and so on."  The three refused to meet with me separately.  They met with me together.  And I have to tell you that for that next hour and a half, two hours, I was--I had never in my life been treated to such vituperation, language, it was horrific, and the thrust of it was, "Don't unpack because by December where after the next election you're going to be gone."  And I said, "Fine."  I said, "I'll tell you what.  I'm going to do the best I can as long as I'm here."  Period.  Okay.  Now, so that was my baptism into presidency in higher education.  Now, there were lots of problems at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] that I had to deal with.  I had my first student riot six weeks after we arrived.  It was--and the head of campus police came to the president's house, which is on the campus, and it was February and there were--the students were demonstrating against the Chicago Seven trial.  It was sleeting, sleet, rain, snow, and the head of police came and he said, "President Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], I think you should go out and talk to the crowd and see if you can get them to calm down."  I said, "Okay."  He said, "We'll go over to the student union."  And I said, "Where's that?"  It was about two hundred yards away from the president's home.  I didn't even know where it was, okay.  That's how new we were.  So my wife [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I went over, and so, we're standing on the steps of the student union, and this crowd is out there and they're yelling and carrying on, and I was given a megaphone, and I'd never used a megaphone before, and they had to show me how to use it.  So then I said, "Students of Michigan State, these activities are highly counterproductive" (laughter).  And pardon me, but some kid in the back yelled, "Up yours, Wharton."  And there was, I discovered later, there was a young black in the crowd, a big guy, who played football.  He told the kids to shut up and let me talk.  So I did, and then they went right back and started continuing to demonstrate and riot.  And, that was my baptism (laughter), you know, into student riots.  We had huge riots later after Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio] and Cambodia.  During that period, we would have crowds that ranged from 2,000, 3,000 to 5,000 students demonstrating on the campus.  I averaged for that six week period, I averaged about four hours of sleep a night.  I went from 185 pounds down to 150.  And you have to understand that this was happening all over the United States.  And none of us as presidents had a manual.  You had to use your intelligence, gut instinct; a whole series of things to be able to deal with it.  And my wife and I, we would go out and talk to the mobs and to the crowds; for example, I would always insist that the police not be around us, just get away, so that--so I would be prepared to stand up--we would be prepared to stand up in front of them and speak.  And it was a--we had those riots in 1970.  We had them again in 1972.  Meanwhile, I'm still trying to run a university (laughter) while all of this is going on.
Story_ID: 536024
Speaker 1: What is the university you come to?  How many students?
Speaker 2: Forty-six thousand.
Speaker 1: Forty-six--
Speaker 2: The second largest university in the country at that time.
Speaker 1: And how many--what's the minority enrollment because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't remember the exact number.  I can get it for you.  We had a--John Hannah [John A. Hannah], my predecessor, had been president of the university for twenty-eight years.  He had built Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] into what it became.  He also was the chairman of the civil rights commission [U.S. Commission on Civil Rights].  Interesting man.  He was also very much involved in technical assistance. He was one of the first presidents to respond to the President Truman's [President Harry S. Truman] Point Four--there were a whole series of related issues.  Now, what we did at Michigan State was, in my first year, I knew that one of the major issues that I was going to have to deal with was the issue of minority enrollment, and the issue of perceptions as to, or questions, big questions about what I was going to do, behave.  There were black students who said, "Are you going to bend over backwards and sort of show that you're not paying attention to us."  Others, the whites who said, "Are you going to bend over the other way and going to be, you know, overly--."  Okay.  There was a lot of that going on.  So, I created a Commission on Admissions and Student Body Composition, which included trustees, faculty, deans and administrators, alumni, leaders from education in the state; it was a huge variety.  And we thrashed out an incredible report.  And this report did a number of things.  Among them was, it differentiated between economically disadvantaged students and educationally disadvantaged students.  It also recommended to me that, which I agreed with completely, that we do not set targets, but the goal of constantly increasing the enrollment.  And above all, that what we admit, we work hard to keep and get and have graduate.  Now, I did a number of things internally in terms of reorganizing the units that would be dealing with these issues.  For example, I'd created the position of the assistant provost for special programs.  And I was lucky to have headed up a young black, James Hamilton, who was a black professor of chemistry, who had already developed his own program of increasing blacks majoring in chemistry.  And he took over and he, with my help and direction, we developed a special program for entering minority students, who were educationally disadvantaged, during the summer before their freshman year, to give them a head start on getting ready for the enrollment and what was going to happen to them in school.  I also had to deal with the issue of--there was a program of black student aides in the dormitory, which, quite frankly, had been taken over and dominated by the more politically, extremist-oriented black students, was not part of the university.  They were funded by the university, but I changed that in such a way that I put in charge a young man, who may come up later in our discussions, who also was one of my first presidential fellows, and he changed that program around so that they were really aiding the students, not politicizing the issues, but not ignoring them, but saying, "You're here, study this, work on that."  Did a great job with that.  But, the outcome was--
Speaker 1: His name?
Speaker 2: Carl Taylor [Carl S. Taylor].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The interesting part of this was that, after the program was underway, this whole program, many of our sister institutions, trying to meet goals, were admitting and dropping.  It was a revolving door.  The numbers going through that door kept increasing, but they weren't graduating.  After a few years, the graduation rate for all of those students that we brought in was virtually identical to the rest of the student body.  Nobody said a word.  Nobody.  Blacks were happy, the whites were pleased.  Nobody--they couldn't say, you know, I was doing something wrong or unethical or immoral.  Our goal is education, we're here to provide the education, and I'm going to see to it that everybody gets the education.  That's what we did.  And so, it had--but, I knew that this was going to be an issue, I just knew it.  So, put it in place to have a program that really meant something, not in terms of public relations, not in terms of PR [public relations], not to satisfy some notion of how you get this done.  I knew how to get it done.  That's what I did.
Story_ID: 536025
Speaker 1: Dr. Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], what I wannna--is--there are a lot of things sort of happening.  I mean, I have questions about. One is that, this is sort of a--this is a first that a black person is in charge of a major white institution, university, so there's that.  You talked about a board, I mean, there are three people out of how many on the board?
Speaker 2: Eight.
Speaker 1: Eight--that were some constant pains in the behind, and--
Speaker 2: More than that.  This was serious.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they would do things to try to get rid of me.
Speaker 1: But the other thing is that this is a time of tremendous turmoil--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the United States--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and it's not like you came up through the Michigan State University system [East Lansing, Michigan].
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So, this is--what I'm trying to understand within the context of that and, you know, you were also trying to work methodically.  I mean, how does one manage, you know, even to do anything in the midst of sort of chaos, and what I also had read is that, there were fiscal problems, right?
Speaker 2: Sure, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And this was a time of fiscal problems in the state or fiscal problems in the--?
Speaker 2: Well, there were always fiscal problems, but go ahead, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and wasn't there also some issue with the football team?
Speaker 2: That's later.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's later.
Speaker 2: That's later, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's later.  Okay.  So, but I'm just trying to understand within how, like even how are you building a team around you, is it because there's so much excitement, that people are gravitating to you or how?  Because you have to have a team or you can even function within a--you know-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --even learn the system that you're managing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So I'm trying to understand what steps, you know, sort of steps you took, because at that--I'm just trying to--I know, okay, all these things happened within the six weeks, but--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  It's more than that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, it's--the--
Speaker 1: Or how you--what were you trying to attack as priorities even on terms of that, like--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but there--there were several priorities.  This is not a good analogy, but you have several balls in the air at the same time, okay.  I had to deal with so many of them.  You asked about personnel.  I have a, as you probably have surmised by now, I am not a person who easily leaps into something without having it being well-grounded in what the situation is and what the facts are, okay.  So, for example--
Speaker 1: So did you do your shipboard tour?
Speaker 2: --before I even--correct--before I even moved--before Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I even moved to East Lansing [Michigan], I went out, I think it was twice, and I met with every single one of the vice presidents and all of the deans.  I--and some time--most of the time it was individually, to find out what their problems were, what their priorities were, what their concerns were, okay.  So I had that all done.  Then there were vacancies I had in the top team, but I had--have an approach which I've always followed.  I don't begin by assuming that the people who are there already are not any good.  I begin by assuming that they are there and let's see how they do.  For example, the chief financial officer, Roger Wilkinson, was acting chief financial officer.  He had been the assistant chief financial officer when the chief financial officer left.  And during the interim, there had been no action taken to replace him.  He was very young.  And I checked and I checked.  I looked at what he was doing.  I said, "He deserves a chance."  So, I appointed him as chief financial officer, okay.  And he'll tell you to this day, he became probably one of the longest-serving chief financial officers at Michigan State.  And he was very good.
Story_ID: 536026
Speaker 1: I created a position, it was another position which I did not feel was quite structured the way it needed to be.  And so, I interviewed, and there were about three positions I had to fill--I interviewed people for the job.  We had a search, and I brought in these people.  Now, who did I bring in?  Well, one of them, Bob Perrin [Robert Perrin], he became my vice president for external relations, and he also had under him affirmative action.  Bob worked with me at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], at SUNY [State University of New York System] and TIAA [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York].  I inherited an assistant who had been hired by Hannah [John A. Hannah], my immediate--I had--at one time or another I three executives, and he was the most senior.  He was there, Al Ballard [Elliott Ballard].  Al Ballard worked with me at Michigan State, SUNY; he followed me.  He was good, okay.  You know, I don't just come in and say, "Oh, you know, let's clean house," you know.  No, no, no.  Take what's there and put--you need to change--you can change, but don't just automatically assume that a person's all right.  I have written about the fact that I think there's a--one of the good sides of the student riots was that the group became very solidified, unified, under the fact of the impact of the student riots, because I would meet with them regularly.  I was not saying, "I know what to do" or "I'm going to do it by myself."  No.  We all meet and develop policies and issues and so on.  So that did it.
Speaker 2: You're talking about the administration?
Speaker 1: The top administration, yeah.  Yeah.  Similarly, I created a--I was concerned about the ability of the student leadership to have input.  So I created a Student Advisory Group.  They never had one before at the university.  I created a Student Advisory Group, and they were individuals who represented the fraternities, the dormitories, et cetera, et cetera, okay.  And I met with them regularly.  And I even went so far as to share with them the preliminary proposed budget for the university to get their comments and input or at best, discussing issues, but in no way compromising their independence and their position on issues.  I didn't want them to feel that they had to approve something and then people could criticize them for it.  But it was sharing information and getting communication back and forth.  I did that.  When the riots started in May and June of 1970, believe me, that Student Advisory Group--council was absolutely wonderful, because I was able to meet with them and say, "Look, I'll tell you, this is what I'm trying to do."  Okay.  And we talked about it.  Another thing which I did was, Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I began the practice of going out to all of the dorms two and three times a week and having dinner with the students in the dorm.  And after the dinner, I would have a lounge dialogue with the students.  Any student in that dorm could come to that lounge and they could ask me any question they wanted to, okay.  Dolores went and lived in the dorms a couple of times, two or three times.  Why?  To be accessible, to be visible, to have them feel they can communicate, all right.  Now, quite frankly, I would say right now 90 percent of the questions they asked me I already knew their issues and problems.  But that's all right.  If they think, if you say, "Well, I've heard that."  No, no, no.  They want to communi- they say--you want to understand their feeling about the--fine. Once in a while it was something I hadn't heard before.  But again, reaching out.  It was--all of it was designed to reach, to reach, to communicate back and forth with them.  There were so many different things that we did.  I mean, I can't begin.  We had a system of what we called a, I've forgotten the term we used, but we would go around the whole state and visit the major community centers, cities mainly, and we had not just alumni but local leaders come.  And I would speak, Dolores would speak, and then we would take questions about what was going on.  So we'd go to, you know, the Upper Peninsula [Michigan] and they'd say, "Why aren't you stopping those rioting students?"  Well, I'd explain to them what was the problem.  I mean, again, it was communicating, trying to get across what's happening.  But it was a situation, where as I said, we did not have a manual as to how to deal with things.  And it was in retrospect, you say to yourself, "Boy, that was scary," but at the time, you are going, you're just trying to keep it going.  Then you had the problems of dealing with the state legislature.  During the riots, there were resolutions that they tried to pass to remove all three presidents, including me.  It failed, but they were trying, you know.  We had--it was (laughter), we had--I never will forget this.  One time during the riots, the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] called the office and said, "There are three bomber types that we've been following.  They're coming up the highway north towards Michigan State."  And then they lost them on the outskirts of the campus.  They had been following them to keep track of them and they lost them.  And I said, I sweat, I said, "Good Lord."  We didn't know where they were in that mob.  Now mind you, three or four thousand students, you know.  How are you going to find them--
Story_ID: 536027
Speaker 1: --who had been there for a long time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure, oh sure.
Speaker 1: I mean I'm --
Speaker 2: But that's--for the riots, he never had riots.
Speaker 1: No, he didn't know.  No one--
Speaker 2: No, no.  None, no.
Speaker 1: --had a textbook on that.
Speaker 2: But it was--and quite frankly, you have to judge whether what's being said to you is, you feel is intelligent, workable to talk. But, no, I, I, no, I believe, I've always believed that there is a, there is value in collective wisdom.  If the individuals are genuinely committed to what is a non-egocentric goal, but one which is related to the institution and its mission.  And if it's there, they're trying to make it better, as you are.  And they're not trying--it's--now, sometimes, there are the individuals who have their own little--and you can recognize that in a minute.  That's--but the other, no, no, I, I just--and I have always felt it's very powerful, very powerful.  When we get into TIAA-CREFF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York], one of the most frequent questions I would be asked after I left CREFF was: "How did you do it?"  And it's a very simple answer.  I used the commitment and intelligence and the energy of the people in the company, already there.  You don't--I don't know a single institution, where there's some reasonably, dedicated, intelligent people, you go and ask them, "What needs to be done?"  They'll tell you.  We did that here at TIAA-CREF.  I had men and a team go and ask inside the company, what were the major changes that were needed to improve communications among the different units and then improve communications between them and our customer base.  They came back, I've forgotten the number, with an incredible number of recommendations.  They put those together into different categories, put together what might be done about them.  And you know what we then did?  And it was a sample of people we interviewed.  I then with them went and had a meeting with all the people who had participated in the survey and told them what the results were and what we were going to do about it.  You know what happened?  When we started moving into effect, it took off like a skyrocket.  Now, I wasn't dictating to them.  I was telling them what they all had already said to us, what they knew needed to be done.  And they were pleased, I mean, because somebody was finally doing something that was going to respond to what they knew was, quote, a problem or an issue or something.  But that was the internal collective wisdom.  It wasn't Cliff Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] sitting up there saying, "I'm the king and I know what's right."  No. No. So, okay.

Speaker 1: Michigan [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] was managing under chaos.
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Michigan was managing under chaos. That's--
Speaker 2: Under, under a certain kind of chaos.  Keep in mind, the irony is that many was a time I would be in the police headquarters on the southern end of the campus looking out of the window, and here were maybe a thousand students in the fields playing football, basketball, baseball, whatever, playing frisbee; when at the northern end of the campus they were demonstrating and rioting and breaking windows.  You know, if it's four thousand out of forty-six thousand, you know, but it's that kind of juxtaposition that you're dealing with.  There were students who wanted to go to class, the ones who didn't want to go.  I mean, it was not a situation where everything was erupting.  It was--but it was very, very serious, very serious stuff.  While I was saying this story, this story about the bombers.  Three weeks after that particular riot and demonstration, we found unexploded pipe bombs next to the chemistry building.  And I was very lucky they did not explode.  If they had, I probably would have been gone.  It's--you cannot--you can't control certain things.  You can't.  Some of it is humorous.  One of my favorite stories of all times at Michigan State, you have to understand, if I were not there, Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] would just go out and talk to the students too.  And they would come to the president's house.  And she also encouraged them in groups to come into the house and talk, because we would always say, we lived in Southeast Asia.  We know when you talk.  And one night, we had a group of students and the student union, same one where we stood on the steps, and they were having a meeting, and during the meeting, three or four students would leave the group, go out of the building in the dark of night, go to some other building, break the windows, and when the police came after them, they'd scatter so the police couldn't chase them.  And then they'd slip back into the building.  And a different three or four would then go out of the building and go someplace else and do it.  They were doing it all during that first early hour for about three or four hours at night, before the building was supposed to close at ten o'clock.  The topic of discussion during the meeting was problems of racism in America.  There were only two blacks in the whole crowd.  So, when the hour approached a delegation of the students came across from the student union over to Cowles House [Alice B. Cowles House], the president's home, and they wanted to speak to me and I wasn't there.  Dolores goes out on the front steps, and it so happens she was wearing a long gingham dress.  And the gingham dress had a pocket with a little bandana, neckerchief in it.  And so, the leader, it was a young lady, and she said, "Mrs. Wharton, you must tell President Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] he must not close this building.  We're talking about something that's very important.  We're talking about something he really should care about.  We're talking about racism in America."  And Dolores took out the bandana and put it over her head and around her neck, and she said, "Lawd, it's me.  My people been in this country 150 years, and tonight's my night."  And the girl screamed and the crowd laughed.  And she ran off, you know (laughter).  But that's what Dolores did, you know.  I came home, I said, "You did not."  She said, "I sure did," (laughter).  But now, she was fearless on that.  I mean, she really was.  And, well, we had other nights when our oldest son, Clifton [Clifton R. Wharton III] came home and the students (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, how old was he at that point?
Speaker 2: He was in New York [New York] finishing up his high school, the last year.  And he--the peaceful demonstrators came, the leadership came, and they were going to have a vigil, a peace vigil.  And they wanted to march the peace vigil through the town of East Lansing [Michigan] and then on to the campus.  And we told them, "Look, not--we will not join you going into the village.  We will join you here on the campus.  That's our place, it's not over there."  So that night as they went through the village, they came back on the campus and everybody was carrying candles and singing 'Give Peace a Chance.'  And Dolores said, "I'm not going to have you go on this march."  Said, "You're exhausted.  Go upstairs to bed."  So, Dolores goes down with our son, Clifton.  Now, you have to understand, Clifton was 6'4", he was dressed like all the other kids, you know, with his peace march buttons and his long hair and all.  And she said, "President Wharton is exhausted fighting for all these issues that you really care about," she says, "but will you take us instead?"  And they all said, "Yes."  So, Clifton and Dolores get with the crowd at the very beginning and they march to the campus, all carrying candles and singing, 'Give Peace a Chance.'  The march ends at the front of the student auditorium where there was a rock concert going on.  And just as they got there, the doors opened up and the kids start spilling out.  Half of them are stoned (laughter).  But picture that Dolores described of them, "Here these kids singing 'Give Peace a Chance,' and the other kids come out, 'What's going on?'" (Laughter) I mean, that was the university.  I mean, it was, boy.  There were incidents that were sad, there were incidents that were happy.  I mean, it was just--there was so much that I could tell you about what was going on.  But, the one thing I will say is I'm very glad I was quite young.  I could not imagine doing that years later.  I mean, the energy required, the focus that was required was incredible.
Story_ID: 536029
Speaker 1: Now, Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] was very helpful.  It sounds like she was--she played a very, very important role as the president's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, all the time.  All the time.  All the time.  Anything.  I mean it was--she helped develop the fundraising program which they'd never had before.  This is why they named the center--the performing arts center there for the two of us.  She was as much a part of what was happening in that university as I was.
Speaker 1: What do you mean they had never had a fundraising?
Speaker 2: They had not.  Hannah [John A. Hannah] did not believe in it.
Speaker 1: So how did they raise money?
Speaker 2: State.  They were state funded.
Speaker 1: So totally 100 percent from the state?
Speaker 2: Almost 100 percent.  They had a program where they had a president's club, which I think they gave ten thousand dollars.  I've forgotten, it was like only about thirty members or something like that.  And we energized that.  Dolores said, we both said, "Let's get this going."  So we started to increase it.  We provided activities for them.  We invited them to campus.  We had them over to the house, the president's house and, boy, we exploded the number of members.  Then we decided to have the president--the fundraising drive.  And we organized that.  And there were components in that drive.  There were endowed professorships, there was a program for the arts, there was the performing arts center; all of that was in that proposal for a drive.  And Dolores was key to that.
Speaker 1: And how much were you wanting to raise?
Speaker 2: At that time, 22 million.  You know what they just finished--
Speaker 1: That was huge compared--at that time.
Speaker 2: You know what they just finished?  They finished a year ahead of schedule, a drive for 2.1 billion.  Billion.  And you know what?  The sitting president, the current president right now said, "The person who started all of this and laid the groundwork was Clifton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] and Dolores Wharton."  I mean, that's--but again--
Speaker 1: But did you have that sensibility?  I mean, once because you had spent time in the, you know, in the foundation world?  I'm just--
Speaker 2: I mean, you just know what they do.  I knew what they did.  I introduced fundraising, major fundraising at State University of New York [State University of New York System].
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you're saying, so there just wasn't that--so even though there were some fiscal issues, you know, there wasn't that thought that you could do it differently for a state university is what I'm trying to understand.
Speaker 2: It's just that he had not--
Speaker 1: He had--
Speaker 2: He had felt, and I understood it, that if you raise private funds, the state would not give them that same amount, you see.  So, it was a loss-loss.  See.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It was--was that the case actually?
Speaker 2: I don't know because he didn't do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But in your case was it the case?
Speaker 2: In our case, they had been cutting anyway.  But I'm saying is that I understood.  The universities, the major state universities were raising funds.  All universities were raising funds except, you know, Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  And we were gradually catching up.  I mean, it's been quite a battle.  But it's not--it's not something that--it's not rocket science.  I mean, it's not a--knowing how to do it, yes.
Story_ID: 536030
Speaker 1: Once again, I just want to sort--you--when you were appointed [as president of Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], it was 1969, right?
Speaker 2: Right, and took the office in January of 1970.
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970], and then '70 [1970] you get a lot of honors, so you become--you're Man of the Year, I think, and you're on the--you become--you join the board of trustees for Rockefeller Foundation right, yeah?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was--
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970].
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970]--it was '70 [1970]--
Speaker 1: It was '70 [1970]--
Speaker 2: --but, yeah.
Speaker 1: You got Latin School [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts], Man of the Year.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were awarded an honorary doctorate from Johns Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So that's happening, but all this turmoil is happening.
Speaker 2: Oh sure.
Speaker 1: And you have--okay.
Speaker 2: My first honorary degree was at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  When I finished my commencement speech, I left the stage to fly--drive quickly back up to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] because I had to deal with the riots (laughter).  I know it sounds strange, but--
Speaker 1: Well, it just sounds like managing in chaos.  I mean, that's what--but, the other thing I want to know, you--your inaugural speech, what had you said in that inaugural speech that you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: And was it that, like, was it, you know, in hindsight, was that speech naive given what you didn't know was going to be happening?
Speaker 2: No.  Quite the reverse.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Quite the reverse.  When I arrived at Michigan State, I'll tell you two stories.  One is, the press kept pressing me, the student press and the other press, "What are you going to do?  What is your plan for the Michigan State University?"  Now, quite frankly, it would have been absolutely stupid and idiotic for me to try to answer that question.  That's even before I even set foot on the campus.  I'm supposed to come up with the grand plan, the great strategy.  And I knew that no matter what I said--if I had said something, I would have been blasted, no question about it.  Secondly, I felt that it was very important for me to set out what were my values as a human being, who I am as Cliff Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], okay.  So that's the speech that I gave.  Now, fast forward.  The woman who is president of Michigan State today at this time was provost when--I'm talking about now.  They held a special celebration at Michigan State to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and my having gone to Michigan State.  They had a luncheon, they had an afternoon panel which was chaired by one of my former assistants who was then, by then was the dean of communication arts; faculty members who had worked with the two of us to discuss what it was like in the Wharton years.  They then had a dinner for us after the panel in the afternoon, and that night they had a concert by [HistoryMaker] Billy Taylor which they had commissioned; and one of the pieces he dedicated to our late son Clifton [Clifton R. Wharton III].  This is thirty years after we left, after we had been presided.  Now, during that panel, the provost, the woman, Lou Anna Simon [Lou Anna K. Simon], got up and in her speech she said, "In preparation for this event, I went back and read the first speech that President Wharton ever gave," she said.  "And everything that he did while he was here is in that speech."  I had not said anything specific, but she understood what I was saying in terms of what I was trying to achieve.  Now--
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that speech, what you said?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'd have to get it for you, but it was--but as I say, it was an attempt to set forth my values, what I felt was important for the university to know about me, and what I would be--what would direct me in terms of how I would proceed.  Now, similarly, the student newspaper, after I gave this speech, blasted me for giving them a bunch of pap. Okay.  And I totally addressed that.  I said, "Yeah, if I had given you some specifics, you would have said, 'How dare I do so without having set foot on the campus'."  You know.  Then one of the reporters interviewed Dolores and (laughter) and asked her, "How is President Wharton going to deal with riots and demonstrations?"  You know what she said?  "Intelligently" (laughter).  You know, it's one of those things where--it's not that you're playing games, but you're trying to develop and maintain a direction in such a fashion that it has an effect and is long lasting, and can really produce something, you see.  It's not something where you try to twist with the wind and sort of play to the polls or--I mean, it can't.  And when you do, ultimately, it just has a tremendous effect, I find.  I mean, I may be wrong.
Story_ID: 536031
Speaker 1: And you're saying in the area of minority and black issues, was that--also, would you say, women's issues were tied into that at the same ti- (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.  I had a women's issue, and I dealt with that, too [at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].
Speaker 1: And what was that?
Speaker 2: That was the difference--the gap in compensation.  And I had set a price--said, put it said, I committed, I created a committee of women to look at this issue and support--to provide me with their recommendations, and I then proceeded to implement them.  And I did it over a two year period and virtually eliminated the difference between the two.
Speaker 1: From what year to what year?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the years.  It was in the very beginning, in the early stages.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  But then, how many in the area of minority issues, because you were saying, you know, you couldn't bend too far this way, you know.
Speaker 2: No, they thought that, you know.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: I didn't worry.  That's what they thought.
Speaker 1: But was it Taylor [Carl S. Taylor] or Hannah [John A. Hannah]--who was it that was--
Speaker 2: There were a lot of people who worked on it--no, no, but, I--you can't say--look--
Speaker 1: Carl Taylor did the one program.
Speaker 2: He handled one program.
Speaker 1: The science program.
Speaker 2: Jim Taylor--Jim Hamilton [James Hamilton] handled another.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had a lot of different people.  I mean, it was not--it's not a case of choosing certain individuals.  They were very important.  But I had--to me to describe all of the issues, including minority issues, would take much longer than a single interview in an hour.
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: Because I had black student activists to deal with.  I had serious problems with some of the students, not towards me, but just generally.  I also had problems where--
Speaker 1: Now when you say problems, were they safety problems, you know--?
Speaker 2: Everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In general--you're dealing with a situation where--well, I'll back up.  One of my strategies was beginning with the very first summer after the first riot, I began a practice which I followed for all eight years that I was there.  During the summer, we used to have an orientation session for all of the incoming students, for the students and their parents.  It usually was a two day program.  Every summer I would meet with every one of those incoming groups.  I'd meet with the students and with the parents.  I'd meet with the students first and then I'd meet with the parents and tell the parents what I told the students.  One of the things that I had in there--now, the reason I did this was, I believed that that was the best time to say something to the students that might stick, such as, "I will defend your right to free speech, but not to your violation of law."  And I used some examples.  One of the things that I would tell the parents is, and the students was that, on this campus, which is highly diverse and multicultural, you will meet, for some of you the first time, students from different backgrounds and different cultures.  There'll be students who like rap, and those who like Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart].  There will be students will like chitterlings, and there're students who like, you know, Italian sausage.  I mean, it's a whole new world.  There were students who would take their boom boxes and push out into the hall up and down, while somebody else is trying to study.  I mean, there were a whole series--and that can instantly lead to a lot of conflict.  And what I would say to them was, "You may not like or agree, but I want you to understand and respect the differences."  And I would say, "And if there are problems, that's when you have to begin to go to your RAs [resident assistant], try to talk it out, the differences, and how you accommodate it."  And I will never forget the first time this happened.  A group of black students in one of the dorms decided to have a dinner honoring their parents for their support of their coming to the university.  And Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I were invited to come and we went.  It was one of the most moving things to see these young men and women and their parents, and most of them, for their children, was the first member of the family to ever to go to college.  And there they were dressed to the nines and just as proud as they could be for their children and themselves and those young people there.  And the white students in the dorm, "What is this?  What's happening?"  And so, I wrote in one of my presidential columns, and I said, I explained what was happening with that.  But why did I do that?  Well, I did it because it's important for the other students to understand what's going on.  It's--again, it's not--and I was telling them, you know, I said--and also told them sometime, I said, "You know," I said, "some of you will have the wonderful opportunity to make friendships that can last for a lifetime and really be influential in your lives in a variety of ways."  And then I would use some examples out of my own case and so on.  But all of this was designed to reach them before they began to hit the campus, okay.  But there's a lot--there are so many strategies that we followed.  I mean, it was just a constant process.
Story_ID: 536032
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk also about the issue of--this is nine--nineteen s-.  The whole issue of athletics and the Big Ten [Big Ten Conference] and the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association], you know, on the issues you dealt with.  You know, there--. Let me ask, the riots of Detroit [Michigan], what impact did they have on Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Oh, great.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Didn't--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because, well, it happened before I was there.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  Now, that was nineteen sixty--?
Speaker 2: And it led to a special fund that was appropriated for minority issues at Michigan State.  And I won't go through all of that because that created some problems I had to correct.  But it certainly did lead to the whole upsurge in the requirements for--or the pressure for a greater admission of minority students across the board, not just Michigan State.  And also, it meant that there were many students who came onto campus, who were not prepared for that, not in terms of intelligence, but not prepared--and the white students weren't prepared either.  You know, that's why I say I had to kind of, you know, work on this, tell them that there would be some reasonable accommodation.  Now, on the athletics, the--well, I guess I'll talk about Sam Riddle.  Sam Riddle was one of the black leaders on campus, bright guy wearing a big Afro.  And there were black administrators and faculty who had written a letter to the Big Ten commissioner objecting to the lack of black coaches and black officials.  And this created some consternation on the part of the trustees of the board.  I supported the issue that there was an issue, but the concern on the board's part was that this was done outside of the channels of the university system for dealing with athletic issues.  Be that as it may, it encouraged the black students to engage in activism.  And so what they did one night was, led by Sam, they stopped the basketball game for a period of about fifteen minutes.  I got a call at home, and so we rushed over.  By the time we got there the campus police had come in and cleared it and the game is on.  So, I issued a statement to go into the newspaper the next day in which I pointed out that the basketball game is an official state educational activity under the state educational law, and anybody who disrupts it is subject to arrest.  It's not an issue of free speech, it's just a matter of what you're doing.  And so, the next day Sam came to see me, and he said, "You drew a line in the sand."  I said, "No, Sam.  You ought to go to law school.  I know you don't want to get arrested" (laughter).  And, but he respected that.  So the next basketball game, the police had sort of a ring around the basketball court, and my wife and I were sitting upstairs on the high seats.  And Sam came in with his coterie and he marched in.  Now all of the students looking to see what Sam was doing, looking see what I was doing; and they went and sat down.  The game went on.  And at the break, at the half, Sam's cohorts get up and they go up, one goes up to one balcony, unfurls a banner which says, "Big Ten, open it up or close it down."  And the guy puts up the other banner which said, "MSU Uncle Cliff's Cabin" (laughter).  The police started to run up to tear the banners down and I stopped them.  I said, "No."  I said, "That's free speech."  And all the kids clapped in the audience, okay.  "It's all right.  He made his point."  But it was free speech, that's fine, you know.  All right.  But, Sam, oh boy, he turned up so frequently in many ways.  He graduated, went to the University of Michigan Law School [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  One night, Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I were sitting having dinner, news comes on.  "Students have taken over the office of President Fleming [Robben Wright Fleming] in Michigan" (laughter).  I said, "Oh, I know exactly who it was."  Next day I called up the president.  I said, "Robben," I said, "I hear you--." He said, "Yes, it's one of your students" (laughter).  And it was Sam.  Years after that, fast forward, my wife, Dolores gets a letter.  "Dear Mrs. Wharton," it said, "I used to believe in standing on soapboxes, but now I'm in the company that makes them."  You know who it was?  He was a lawyer with Phillips Petroleum [Phillips Petroleum Company; Phillips 66], when Dolores was on the board of directors (laughter).  Fast forward.  He was the campaign manager for Jesse Jackson's [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] first campaign.  I mean, he always was turning up.  I mean, that was Sam.  But anyway, that--I'm diverting.  But it's--there were so many issues that one had to deal with.
Story_ID: 536033
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're dealing now with the question of the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] issue.
Speaker 2: NCAA, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Now, and this is, again, a long, long problem.  The NCAA has a set of rules and regulations--
Speaker 2: This is all tied to blacks in the Big Ten [Big Ten Conference]?
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's not?
Speaker 1: Nothing to do with blacks.  No, no. no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is dealing with football.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: And violations of rules and--
Speaker 2: Of rules.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  Nothing with blacks, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The--there had been allegations made that the football program at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] had made certain rules violations and infractions.  And under the system then in existence, the university was so--the NCAA submitted those allegations to you and then you, as a university, had to investigate them to see whether they were true or not, and then submit a report on your findings to the NCAA, and then there would be a hearing.  Now, one of the problems, which I objected to at the time, was the allegations were not given the source.  In other words, somebody had said this, but you don't know who.  So how are you going to know where to go to find out if it's true or not.  Moreover, somebody had said that it wasn't true just to kind of get you in trouble.  But you go ahead and you do it.  So, I created a special committee with two trustees, some distinguished faculty, et cetera, to work with me on conducting the investigation of whether the allegations were true or not.  I won't go through the whole thing.  The press was very upset, angry at me because they said I had put a gag order on all the members of the athletic department on revealing anything about the allegations.  And what made it even more angry, the press, was it stuck.
Story_ID: 536034
Speaker 1: What happened was that when I was conducting the investigation, I was concerned that since they were unproven, to release them would subject the university to potential lawsuits.  If, if, if the allegation said that, that you had contributed ten thousand dollars illegally to the program, and it's not true--but that's the allegation.  The press picks it up and they say, "Oh, you--." I said, "No, no, no," because then you are, you are liable and the university if liable for false--presenting false information to the press.  No.  So I worked it so that we really put a clamp on them releasing it.  I also was concerned that the process was such that when you went to the hearing, the person who conducted the investigation for the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] was there with the committee and then served as a staff member for the committee after you left.  It's very strange the way that worked.  They have changed it since that part, and largely because of the comments that I made.  But, in any event, the allegations were serious in the sense that it was established that there probably was an illegal pool of money that was being used.  The amount is not that great, but there were special bank accounts and things like that that were carrying on.  And, but we conducted a very thorough investigation.
Speaker 2: Now, how did this--so who was the head coach at the time at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]?
Speaker 1: Well, there was a--I'm blocking everything.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Denny Stolz.  And I had appointed him when Duffy Daugherty stepped down.  And he eventually, in negotiating the penalties with the NCAA and with the Big Ten [Big Ten Conference], many of the individual, the coach and the assistant coaches had to be released, not all of them.  And we had to go through that, and we had to go through all kinds of other sanctions in terms of the university.  But, the striking thing for me was, one of them was, that when we finally had our first press conference revealing what we had found and what the allegations were, we had one of our major conference rooms packed to the gills with reporters.  And Bob Perrin [Robert Perrin], my PR [public relations] man, when he was introducing me said, he said, "You know," he said, "for the past several years I've been trying to get just half of this number to be interested in the fact that, since President Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] has been here, we've had more Rhodes scholars than before."  You never played--football, oh boy, everybody was there.  But it was a very, very difficult period, again, to deal with it.
Speaker 2: Now, it was a difficult period that started in 19--was it 1974, is it when it started?
Speaker 1: Seventy-four [1974], yeah, '74 [1974], '75 [1975].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And this was--was it related to the Red Letter?  I had read something about the NCAA Red Letter in--
Speaker 1: No.  That's just the letters that go back and forth on.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But this was--someone had found these--they had been investigating.
Speaker 1: They investigated--the people had made allegations to them.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Of impropriety.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: Of things, in terms of recruitment or things that were being done.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  They were done wrong.  And so they, you know, and the thing is, you still don't know who did it, who said these things (cough).  You just didn't know.  There was some strong supposition and subsequently admission by one of the football coaches, elsewhere.  But, it, as I say, it was one of those kind of horrible processes to go through.
Speaker 2: Well, what did he say was--what did the coach say?
Speaker 1: Well, he admitted that he had done some of this.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: But that was quite a bit later.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What coach (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I won't go through that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  So, so but you got through that.
Story_ID: 536035
Speaker 1: What is this about recruiting Magic Johnson?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  He was recruited while I was there.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: As a player?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. I didn't know he was--
Speaker 2: See, he was--one of the things is that, the recruitment was taken--took place right after we had just gone through the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] investigation.  And he was, as you can imagine, was very heavily recruited, and he lived in Lansing [Michigan].  And it was clear that he probably had been--he probably had narrowed to his choice between Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] and Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And I told the head--the basketball coach, "This is going to be the cleanest recruit you've ever seen.  I don't want any question whatsoever about how he's being recruited."  And that was because I made it very clear that if we did something wrong in that area, then we might lose our position in the Big Ten [Big Ten Conference], whole series of things.  I said, "No, no, no."  And he chose Michigan State.  And the interesting sideline to that is that I called his home afterwards, and you have to realize that his father held down two full time jobs, mother worked; wonderful family, great family.  And I said, "Mrs. Johnson [Christine Johnson], I'm very pleased that your son is coming to Michigan State."  She just said, "Yes."  And I said, "And I assure you that he's going to be very useful--he's going to be great for us to have him here."  "Yes."  And I'm saying to myself, "Uh-huh."  And I said, "Well," I said, "I don't know how long he'll be here, but I assure you that as long as he's here we're going to work hard to see to it that he gets a good education."  She said, "Now you're talking" (laughter).  That was his mother.  Quite a family.  Right now, Magic looks just like his father.  He was very thin in those days, but he looks just like his father now.  Wonderful man, great guy.  And he was a wonderful man, wonderful family.  And he did a lot for the university by just being who he was.  But, so yeah, that was a positive in terms of what happened (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 536036
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, let me ask you your thoughts about sports and its role within academia intercollegiate.  What--because you had not--your training had not been in an environment where it had, you know, where sports was such a dominant factor, you know, within that institution.  I mean, like, big, big with, you know, for recruitment for, you know, for the visibility of institutions.  I'm just wondering your--
Speaker 2: Well, in the Ivy League for the the visibility, that's still there, but different issue, different issue.  Although it's getting more (unclear), but to try to answer that, I have to go through all my work with the Knight Commission, which, as you know, I'm co-chairman of.  This is the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics group [Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics].
Speaker 1: Right.  But I need to ask--okay.
Speaker 2: What you asking, a question prior.  I will tell you with an anecdote.  We at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] and Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], annually rotate who hosts the game.  And for the game, we always invite the state legislature and the governor.  And the governor, at the half, walks between the two sides.  So, the year I was president, the first year was our day, our year to host.  So I picked up the phone and I called up Robben Fleming [Robben Wright Fleming], my counterpart at the University of Michigan.  And I said, "Robben, Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I would love to have you and Sally [Aldyth Quixley Fleming] sit in the president's box with us for the game."  And there was silence.  And then he said, "I think that'll be nice."  So, a few days later I'm having my meeting with my top executive (unclear), and I said, "Oh, by the way," I said, "we've invited President and Mrs. Fleming to sit in the box with us."  "You what?"  I said, "We invited them to be in the box."  He said, "You can't do that."  I said, "What do you mean?" I said.  "You can't do that."  I said, "Ah," I said, "listen, he'll cheer for Michigan and I'll cheer for Michigan State."  He said, "President Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], you don't understand.  You're Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  This is the Big Ten [Big Ten Conference]."  I always remember that because--true, it's true.  And the first awareness that I had of this was when the famous day, on the first of, I guess it was the second weekend that Dolores and I went out to Michigan State after I was elected.  We went to a football game, and they escorted Dolores and me down on to the field at the fifty yard line, and the announcer announced and introduced us to this crowd of seventy-six thousand people.  And we walked out into the middle of the field, and everybody stood and they cheered.  And I had to tell you, I said to myself, "This is really something when you get a crowd that big cheering you," you know, for being elected president.  So I began to realize it's Big Ten.  It's the Big Ten all right, yeah.  But, you know, there are some very important issues connected with athletics, no question about it, particularly today.  Commercialization, the escalation in terms of the salaries of the power coaches.  There are a lot of different things that are going on.  There's the envy, increased commercialization, and pressure that's going all the way down to the junior high school level now.  There're a lot of different things there that are happening.
Story_ID: 536037
Speaker 1: But do you think the presence of athletics at that level is a positive for a university and its academics?  It's, I guess, it's what I'm trying to--
Speaker 2: It could--it could be if it is properly handled.  At the commission, we had a study done of all the various studies that have been made.
Speaker 1: You're talking about the Knight Commission [Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics]?
Speaker 2: The Knight Commission, right, which shows that--
Speaker 1: That's recent, right, that's--
Speaker 2: Fifteen years.
Speaker 1: Fifteen.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And our research shows that it does not increase giving, it does not increase applications except once in a while it's a blip when there's a championship.  Another thing which is very significant is that most people believe that college big time athletics makes money.  I just came from my Knight Commission meeting with the recent data.  There are only, in the last two years, there were only twenty-two universities that broke even.  It doesn't make money.  It's all subsidized, heavily.  There's a lot that's going on that the public refuses to accept.  They assume that it gives them the big brand name.  That's all.  It's very interesting how it works.  But, and I don't want to go into all of it because you have--I'd have to give it to you in the totality.  But, that is not to say that there are not positives, there can be positives.  But when you have a situation where coaches may be very well be exploiting players or when the university is doing so, you have to stop and ask yourself the question: the number of young athletes who graduate and are eligible to enter either football or basketball in the draft never exceeds 2 percent.  What happens to the rest of the students, athletes?  Are they ready to go out in the world?  If they had been taking, you know, basket weaving(laughter)?  You know, it's serious.  And I believe that that is a block when it is happening badly on universities, because it's not higher education.  It's entertainment.  So it's a--there's a whole series of issues that have to do with that.
Speaker 1: Well, that's, that's why I wanted you to address that.
Story_ID: 536038
Speaker 1: There are two questions before I leave Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  One is: what are you proud of that you accomplished--?  Well, first, let me understand something of the timing.  The three board trustees that were sort of the pains, when was the last, when did the last--?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I don't remember it.
Speaker 1: You don't remember, okay.  Okay.  Well, let me ask this.  In terms of what you were able to do in terms of the academics of the institution, can you address that?
Speaker 2: Oh, there were a lot of things.  I mean, the one--let me deal with the, the one regret that I have is that I had created, with a lot of work, I had created a College of Urban Development [Urban Affairs Program], composed of two departments, the Department of Urban and Metropolitan Studies and the Department of Sociological Studies.  And after I left it was disbanded.  I still believe that if it had continued it could have become one of the major academic institutions in that area, no question about it.  That happened after I left, but, you know.  But in terms of the impact that we had academically, probably one of the most significant was the impact that Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I had on giving a greater visibility and importance to the arts on the campus.  That had been a neglected, to a certain extent, part of the university.  And to be a true university you have to have balance, not just all athletics.  You've got to have the other as well.  And so, for example, one of the things Dolores did was, she rotated the art of the faculty in our home.  Not the students', but faculty work.  She was the one who pushed for the creation of a performing arts center, which today is viewed as one of the jewels of the university.  And they're getting ready to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the performing arts center.  And once again, they have commissioned a choral symphony, which is going to be dedicated to the two of us next year.  They're having a big celebration in October and inviting back the Chicago Symphony [Chicago Symphony Orchestra], which performed at the dedication when it was first founded twenty-five years ago.  And everybody will tell you that it is not only a jewel for the campuses for the State of Michigan.  Last year, the attendance at that center, the Wharton Center [Clifton and Dolores Wharton Center for the Performing Arts, East Lansing, Michigan], was in the top five of all such centers at, including Radio City Music Hall [New York, New York].  Top five in attendance.  Incredible.  And it is a beautiful, beautiful facility.  That's one.  Another is, I would say, the fact that I was able to energize the academic quality of the institution in a variety of areas.  You always work on that.  It's not just a one-shot proposition.  And whether it was encouraging the Rhodes Scholarship program or applications or the building of the best cyclotron in the United States, there are all different kinds of things that you do.
Story_ID: 536039
Speaker 1: Which is probably not as fully appreciated now because it's so common, that I began at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], was the creation of a program of lifelong learning.  We were one of the first campuses to develop that in the United States.  It's all over the place now.  But we started it.  And we also started a major program of--an M.B.A. program for current corporate executives in--north of Detroit [Michigan].  There were a lot of different things we did in the academic arena which I'm quite proud of.  And people worked with me.  I mean, it wasn't that I did it, you know, we encouraged it, or we suggested it or worked on it.  Lifelong education I pushed, and that had a big impact on the university.
Speaker 2: Now, why did you push that?
Speaker 1: Because I knew that that was what was coming.  Simply put, the rate of growth in knowledge in most fields is moving exponentially.  So that, for example, for engineers, if you graduated fifteen years ago, half of what you learned is obsolete today.  So how do you get upgraded?  You have to go back in some fashion to school to acquire the new knowledge.  That's true in most of the fields.  So what is required?  Lifelong education (laughter).  And when I coauthored a book ['Patterns for Lifelong Learning'] with Father Hesburgh [Theodore Hesburgh] on it, but we put into effect in Michigan State.  Education for women, older women.  I developed a program with a leader, a head, specifically designed for older women returning to the university.  Again, that was before all of the increase in the employment of wives and women.  But I knew that this was coming, so, put it in.  One of the more humorous stories about that is that, at Michigan State they had a program of giving prizes to the highest ranked male and highest ranked female, and the second ranked male and second ranked female.  And they would come to the president's office, and I would greet them and I would give them a check and so on.  And then I'd use the practice at commencements of introducing them to the whole crowd as the winners.  And one day, the four came into my office and there was an older woman in the group.  And I was giving her the check and so on.  She said, "You know, you're the reason that I'm here."  I said, "I am?"  She said, "Yes."  She said, "I was a freshman at Michigan State when I married, and I dropped out of school because I was having children.  When my children were ready to go to college, and some of them are in college and some weren't going, they kept insisting that I should go back to school.  And they finally persuaded me to come.  So, I said, 'Okay, I'll go'."  She said, "I came on to the campus and I went over to the IM building [IM Sports Circle], which is where they used to do the enrollment, and it's mobbed."  You could imagine what a crowd of students of forty-six thousand, what it looks like.  And she said, "But young, crowded, all these youngsters are going into the building and I'm standing outside and I'm saying to myself, 'You fool.  You think you're going to go back to school after all these years and compete with these youngsters.'  And I was afraid to go home because I promised them that I would go in, but I was afraid not to go in because I would have to enroll."  She said, "And I didn't know you."  And said, "And you came along and you walked into the building."  Now, it happened that every time there was an enrollment session, I would, unannounced, I would walk through just to see how things are going.  "And you walked in the building.  And I said to myself, 'If that old geezer can do it, I can too'," (laughter).  And she--she graduated with a straight 4.0 [grade point average].  I said, "Well, good."  But, there's a lot of those kind of things which are not high visibility bragging points.  It's not that.  It's the fact that there are times when you leave something behind that you know has provided a good foundation.  And sometimes it may have visibility, but sometimes it doesn't.
Story_ID: 536040
Speaker 1: My Presidential Fellows Program, small number, fifteen, thirteen, young people.  But when you look at where they are today, whoosh!  It's absolutely--that gives me great satisfaction because, I don't know if I mentioned--did I mention the program to you before?  I probably hadn't.
Speaker 2: No, you didn't.
Speaker 1: No.  I developed a program soon after I arrived where they would select--the trustees did this, they selected them.  They selected one of the graduate student, one graduate student and one assistant professor.  And then they would spend approximately an academic year in my office where they had special projects and activities, but also they were my shadows.  They went wherever I went, they went to all the meetings that I went to except personnel, all my speeches they went to.  And then every other week I would meet with them and with my--one of my assistants, and they could ask me any question they wanted to, and providing that they maintained confidentiality, I would give them the best answer that I could.  So they would watch me at the board meeting handling the dissidents, let's say, or dealing with them.  And at the meeting with me they'd say, "Why did you let him say that?"  Or, "Why did you say so and so to him?"  I wanted them to see what it was like to run a major university.  Why?  I'd had that opportunity in my very first job working for Nelson Rockefeller.  I had learned an enormous amount being right there at the top as a young person.  So I did that with them.  And there were thirteen of them that came back, oh, in 1996, I guess, for a reunion at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  We met for two-and-a-half days.  Phenomenal meeting.  Just incredible.  In this group, four university presidents; two vice presidents; one provost of the University of Texas system who is now the provost at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]; Carl Taylor [Carl S. Taylor], professor of Michigan State; two went into state government, including one young black.  I just had an e-mail from him yesterday.  He's--you know what he's doing?  He's been working in the government.  He decided that his best way to give back is to make a collection of life stories of the people that he knew in his classes, class at Michigan State on what Michigan State did for them and what it's meant for them in their lives and careers.  And he's going to do it as a book (laughter).  I'm floored, you know.  He was writing and he said, "Would you like to forward this?"  I said, "Sure."  But to watch those young people and see what they have done, you know, that's great.  Now, they're not walking around with a sign on their head, you know.  That's not what I did it for.  I did it because I could help them get that kind of exposure.  And they will tell me, some of them would, at the meeting they said, "You may not remember this, but I remember when you said so and so."  And then I'd say, "I did?"  They'd say, "Yep.  And I remember that."  But it's a way of giving them that type of exposure and opportunity.  And you don't often get that.  And it's similar to Dolores' [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] program of the Young Executives Program.  The same kind of thing where you give them that opportunity of exposure, so.
Story_ID: 536041
Speaker 1: Now, SUNY [State University of New York System], how did that come about then?
Speaker 2: Well, they came after me (laughter).
Speaker 1: You were at--were you at Michigan [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was at Michigan State.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So do you think you would have stayed at Michigan State longer if--?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Because college presidents, what is their average tenure sort of like?
Speaker 2: Four-and-a-half to five years.
Speaker 1: I thought so.  That's what--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  The--Michigan State has a very, very special culture to it, quality.  Leaving aside the board of trustees which is separate, it is one of the most populous type of institutions that I know of.  And they are--the alumni body are so strongly committed to that school, because for most of them it was their first chance to get an education; a good education, a solid education, first class education.  And that's why they completed their $2 billion, $2.1 billion drive a year ahead of schedule in today's environment.  And they don't forget.  They don't forget.  And we had a--we were--by the time we left, we were in, you know, it was great.  And we had--and they still--what I have been amazed at is that they continually remember us.  I mean, it was--I was floored when the drive was wrapping up, the fund-raising drive, was being wrapped up at the last--
Speaker 1: This is the $22 million drive?
Speaker 2: Two billion.
Speaker 1: Oh, the recent drive?
Speaker 2: The 2 billion drive, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  That's fine.
Speaker 2: They have giving categories which they developed, named for some of the presidents, the dead presidents at different levels.  And at this last meeting, they announced they were creating a Clifton R. Wharton giving society [Clifton R. Wharton Society] at 2.0--$2.5 million.  And I said, "But I'm not dead yet" (laughter).  And Lou Anna Simon [Lou Anna K. Simon] said, "No, that's okay, but we (unclear)."  Then that night at dinner, she and her husband joined that club, giving $2.5 million.  And she said, "Because, Ted--my husband and I, Roy [Roy Simon], we wanted to be associated with you."  That is a--I really, I was floored.  Just floored.  But it's that kind of place.  I mean, they have that, that feeling about the institution, is very strong.
Speaker 1: You were saying you weren't sure that you would have stayed longer.  Is that case (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't.  It was a very--
Speaker 1: It was the time to move on or it was--
Speaker 2: Well, I would--it was the opportunity that came with SUNY was a different kind of a challenge.
Speaker 1: So talk about--would you just introduce the subject?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, it's the largest system in the United States.  It had every conceivable kind of type of institution.  It had thirty community colleges; it had six, two year ag [agriculture] and techs; it had, I think, it was twenty-five four year campuses; it had university centers; it had five statutory colleges and private universities, including four at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York]; it had medical schools; it had hospitals.  I mean, it was enormous.  It had--in my day there were 280,000 students.  I mean, it was a big operation.  And it also had problems.  One of the problems was that it had a major difficulty in dealing with private universities, because the Northeast is not accustomed to public--state universities.  And so, they were being pummeled by the private universities.  It also did not have a coherent sense of unity like the California system does.  There were different aspects of it, and I said, "This is an interesting challenge.  It's a very interesting challenge."  The other thing was, they, I didn't know it at the time quite, but, boy, I sure did afterwards, soon after I got there.  They had a phenomenal board of trustees, and they were an absolute joy to work with, okay.  But it was a different kind of a job.  I didn't have a campus.  I didn't have that interaction.  I was dealing with a bureaucracy in dealing with the campuses.  I had sixty-four presidents.  And in the nine years that I was there, I recruited fifty-seven presidents.  I learned a lot about presidency and so on.  It was a lot that I learned in the process there too.  So it was a new challenge.  It was a different kind of challenge for me.
Story_ID: 536042
Speaker 1: My name is Julieanna Richardson.  I'm the interviewer and Matthew Hickey is the videographer, and I'd like you to start out by stating your name and spelling it for us, and then we'll continue.
Speaker 2: I'm [HistoryMaker] Clifton R. Wharton, Jr., C-L-I-F-T-O-N, W-H-A-R-T-O-N, and we are at the offices of TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund], New York City, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I want to start with SUNY [State University of New York System] because that's where we, you know, sort of ended and you were talking about, you know, the big difference and all that.  This was actually fifty-seven--no.  You talked about how many campuses?
Speaker 2: Sixty-four campuses.
Speaker 1: Sixty-four campuses and then you actually, I think, brought in fifty-seven new presidents.
Speaker 2: Over the nine years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Over the nine years, that's right.  What I want to talk about, the--because this is what year?  This is 19--
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978] when you come in.  And who is governor of New York at the time?  Is it--
Speaker 2: Carey [Hugh Carey].
Speaker 1: Carey.  Carey is governor, okay.  So, I just want to have you talk about what this opportunity presented.  Now, you had already said that you had taken ten months to go and visit each of--
Speaker 2: That was before I--after I was in like the--but when I first started off that first ten months in office, first ten months in office, I visited all of--every single campus in the system.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about what would you do on those?  I know this is part of your shipboard tour, which we're very familiar with now.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But what did you do, because it's what--that's a lot of campuses--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, how did you really sort of conduct that and who was the team going along with you on these tours?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, there were--I had several assistants and people in my office, plus other officers in the executive administration.  And one of them, he and one of his colleagues worked with me to select the campuses to visit, and then one of them would prepare a briefing book on the campus, and then we would go and visit the campus.  I would say that probably my wife Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] went with me on at least a third to 40 percent of the campuses.  There were some interesting sort of guidelines that we followed.  One was that we only told the campus president that we were interested in having an opportunity to meet with the faculty, to meet with the students, and to meet with the campus council members, and/or any leaders in the community.  And it was very interesting because they--the presidents then organized the meetings, and there were some interesting sidelines to this.  One was that, why would--we would come out to the campus and I could always tell on the campus whether they had spruced it up for the visit or not.  I could tell whether it was cut--regularly well maintained or not.  I could tell when the campus president had probably debated on whether to feed me well or not.  If they fed me well, then I might assume that they had a lot of money.  If they didn't feed me well, I might be insulted.  It was some presidents who had--either they or one of their top aides would go with us to the various meetings.  There were some presidents who set it up and let us do it all by ourselves, which was a sign of their level of confidence in what was going to happen.  But it gave me an opportunity during the visits, based upon the briefing books plus my contacts and interaction with the group, to get a very good sense of each of the campuses.  Now, I know that that sounds presumptuous.  But one of the things which I learned from it was the fact that having been a campus president at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], I could tell when things were right, wrong or what was involved.  I mean, I didn't have to spend a lot of time doing that.  The most important thing to begin with was the fact that, as a result of the visits, I knew each one of the sixty-four campuses.  And whenever, thereafter, a local elected state legislator, county executive, mayor, who would ask me, they would come to me or talk about something or I would see them somewhere, and I'd see them and I would say, "Yes, we are working on your building in such and such college campus."  I knew the campuses.  I knew what it was and what it was like.  That was first.
Story_ID: 536043
Speaker 1: The second thing was, because of those visits, I was able to develop a set of priority actions that I thought were important for my tenure at the university.  For example, I quickly discovered that the campuses by in large were not engaging in what is traditional at state universities elsewhere, which is a significant public service or extension activity.  They had teaching, at the graduate university they had research; no extension, no public service.  And yet, the public service is delivering the resources of the university to the wider public.  And this is a critically important part of the university.  So, I was able to say, "This has to be an important thrust."  And within that, I developed some additional initiatives.  If you'd like, I can get into those.
Speaker 2: What were they?
Speaker 1: Oh, such things as trying to develop a network of business development centers at the various campuses, with a central location which, wherein, an individual who required assistance would go to the local campus center, and if he or she could not find the resource that they needed to answer their problems of issues, then through the network they could identify a person on another campus.  So, if you were a small businessperson, let's say in Poughkeepsie [New York], and you went to New Paltz [New York] and you didn't find the person you needed at New Paltz, through the network you might find the person at the SUNY Albany campus [State University of New York at Albany, Albany, New York] or might find the person somewhere in Long Island [New York].  But that was a way of building a network so that you could provide them the resources.  I also, of course, learned that there was a very significant lack of important private fundraising.  There was also a question in my mind about whether or not there was enough of a coherent sense of unity in the total system.  And in each of these areas I developed a series of initiatives.  But that was an important result from that activity.  Then I also quickly discovered one which eventually became a very significant part of whatever I left--the legacy which I left at SUNY [State University of New York System].  It was--SUNY I quickly realized was probably one of the most over regulated and over controlled universities in the entire country.  To have a--you could have an item approved in the budget, but you had to go through twelve to fifteen different steps of approval before you could spend the money.  There were times when the approval took so long that it exceeded the academic year or the fiscal year.  And by then, you had to re-appropriate.  I mean, it was horrific.  Okay.  And I'll come to that later.  But all of that initially began, came from my visiting the campuses, seeing what they--hearing from the individuals what the problems were, what was happening, et cetera.  And so, I was able to use that as the initial base for my development of the priorities.

Speaker 1: How many students were in the whole SUNY [State University of New York System] system (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At that time, it was about, I think 380,000.
Speaker 1: And did you see anything that surprised you?
Speaker 2: Well, some of these things that I'm talking about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The over regulation.  Okay.
Speaker 2: That and the fundraising--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --and the lack of.  All of that is part of the system.
Speaker 1: Did you--were--because you ended up replacing so many presidents for--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  That was--it was not that I replaced them.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was early retirement?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Forced retirement?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Let me explain what's involved.  First of all, the average tenured president is between four and five years.  I was there for nine years.  It was sixty-four campuses.  So, you're almost always in a constant search mode.  That's the first thing.  Secondly, there were presidents and campuses--but presidents where I soon felt that a change was needed.  And my style was to go to the individual one on one and have a discussion.  And then I would say, "I think it's time for you to step down, but it is at your initiative.  You take the lead.  You would explain it in any way you want, and you'll never hear from me whether I asked you to leave or not," because that enables them to leave with their own respect and dignity.  Another thing which I introduced was a program--I introduced two programs.  One was a program where whenever a president stepped down, he or she would be eligible to have a faculty position in any other SUNY campus [State University of New York System] that was willing to take them.  Secondly, I also introduced a system of a mini-sabbatical for presidents to take a break, a three to four month break to go and do certain things to recharge their batteries.  Both of those had some interesting consequences.  For example, on the mini-sabbatical, I cannot tell you the number of times when I would go to a president and I would say, "I know, I can tell.  I've been a president.  I can tell.  You are at a stage where the stress is beginning to affect you."  And too, a person, would always say, "I can't, I can't.  I've got this to do.  I've got to get it done."  I'd say, "You got to do it."  And they would do it.  I only had one president who really fought me on it.  But, you cannot imagine the number of spouses who came to me afterwards and said, "Thank you.  It was so important that So and So, my husband or my wife, had a chance to get a break.  It helped them immensely.  They came back reenergized."  And those who did it, they would come up to me privately and they'd say, "I really appreciated it."  And it was true because I know.  I know what it's like. So, I did that.  So that helped.  But all of that, again, was the result of my previous experience [at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] and knowing what was involved.  But, so of the fifty-seven presidents, I know how many I asked to step down.  There were not very many.  But I also learned that there were others who had changed during turnover.  It was not that I made a big fuss of it.  And I don't believe that anybody to this day can tell you what--who I did or didn't.
Speaker 1: Good (laughter).  Good management, there.  Okay.
Story_ID: 536045
Speaker 1: I want to step back a little bit.  And if you could take some time to talk about SUNY [State University of New York System] and its history and Nelson Rockefeller's role.  Can we do that just to sort of set the stage?
Speaker 2: Nelson was very interested in education.  SUNY was a strange collection primarily of teachers colleges.  And during his governorship, it was converted into what it virtually is today, made up of these different components.  And he was very creative in developing a new bond program for construction of facilities.  And he used that to build whenever they needed new campuses, so that a campus like Purchase [Purchase College, Purchase, New York] is brand new.  The university (unclear) research university at Stony Brook [Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York], brand new.  That was done.  The campus at the College of Technology [New York City College of Technology] in New York [Brooklyn, New York].  I mean, I could go on and list them.  But these were done under Rockefeller's regime.  He also poured a lot of money into the university.  He was interested in building the university into a great university.  And he made an important start in terms of laying the foundation.  What happened also was that, at that time, there was an explosion in the number of students who wanted to get an education at the higher education level.  And quite frankly, many of them were Jewish students.  And the private colleges and universities in New York State were not expanding dramatically enough to accommodate all of them.  And so, the parents kept pressing the politicians and saying, "Why should our children have to go to Wisconsin or Michigan?  We should have the university here."  That enabled Nelson to be responsive and build the university.  And that's why the enrollment level skyrocketed and the campuses grew, all right.
Story_ID: 536046
Speaker 1: However, there was another factor, and that is, that there was not a tradition of public higher education in the Northeast, not a very strong one like there is in the rest of the country.  And the result was that, the privates I always felt that they could do a better job of education and they could do it more cheaply.  So they would say to the state, "If you give us the money, we already have the campus, et cetera, and we will do the instruction, and we don't have to worry about the public institutions."  That became an important--I would use the word battle, not scrimmage but a battle, for me in my leadership of the State University of New York [State University of New York System].  Several of the private institutions, through their organizations, would regularly use SUNY as kind of a whipping boy for them to get more money.  And they would denigrate what we doing or they would misrepresent what we were doing and not doing.  And I regularly would say to them, "We both are important.  And it does not help if you attack us or we attack you.  We both have an appropriate role."  And I kept pressing this.  And it was very interesting because I would be able to say to them, "I'm a product of a public secondary school system, I went to Johns Hopkins [School of Advanced International Studies; Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.] which is private, I went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] which is private, I went to Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] which is private, and I was a president of a public university [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  So I know both.  I know both sectors.  And I think you're doing a great disservice to yourselves and to the higher education."  I did that privately with them.  And we had a lot of that.  Eventually, it's very interesting, eventually, several of the leaders within private higher education came around to my view and we calmed it down and we were able to move ahead appropriately.
Speaker 2: So you calmed it down in what way?  How were you able--
Speaker 1: Just they gradually began to agree with what I was saying, and they stopped a lot of that nonsense.
Speaker 2: The back and f-.  Okay.
Speaker 1: All the attacks and so on, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 536047
Speaker 1: Now, how much money did Nelson Rockefeller--
Speaker 2: Oh, I have no idea.  I'd have to go look it up (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  But how--then the other question: when did he get involved with--
Speaker 2: From the beginning.
Speaker 1: From the very beginning.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, why six--all of them were teachers?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no.  They were community colleges--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were ag [agriculture] and techs, there were statutory and then there were the university centers.  It's a very--I would say one of the great things about SUNY [State University of New York System] which I used to boast about, there is not a single field of human knowledge that is not taught somewhere in the SUNY System.  And there's a campus within fifty miles of every resident of the state.
Speaker 1: But when you said it started out, you're saying at the beginning it started out as teacher colleges.
Speaker 2: Many of them, many of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Not all of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now you--let's also talk a little bit about--so he had been sort of the head leader sort of setting policy--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was the--he's often referred to as sort of the godfather of SUNY.  And he often bragged that that was his greatest legacy as the governor of New York State.  Now, it's interesting because when I became head, of course, I went to see him.  And he was delighted, but he was not involved in my selection at all, and because the board is an independent board, even though they are appointed by the government.  And so, he did not know I was a candidate, and he didn't know until I was elected.  And that's another story.  One of the issues which I was concerned about was that there needed to be a center relating to government affairs and public policy, specifically at the state level.  Most higher education centers and institutes relate to federal issues, not state issues.  And I'm looking around the field, I said, "This is something that needs--could be very successful."  And at that time, Nelson was no longer governor.  And I went to see him, and I said to him--I wanted to talk to him about this issue because I felt that SUNY was ideally equipped to create an institute on government, particularly state government, located in Albany [New York], and be--not only SUNY, but also include the privates.  Okay.  Now, what happened was, and Nelson was interested, and he said, he said, "Well, where would--what would you--?"  I said, "Well, we might consider putting--placing the institute in a building that was on 411 State Street in Albany which was an old turn of the century mansion, which was owned by the State University of New York, and which initially had housed the SUNY Research Foundation [Research Foundation for the State University of New York, Albany, New York].  And now that we were creating a headquarters building in downtown Albany, the building was going to be vacant and then we could put it in there.  He knew the building and so on.  So we thought this was a very interesting idea.  So I said, "Well, I'll build--let's talk about it in the future."  Now, quite frankly, and he knew and I knew, I was thinking about possibly the family putting--providing some funding for it.  Okay.
Story_ID: 536048
Speaker 1: Nelson [Nelson Rockefeller] died tragically.  The State University [State University of New York System]--I and the State University board of trustees wanted to memorialize Nelson.  And so, I asked the campuses to recommend possible programs, projects, and so on.  Of those that came in, one of them that I found very attractive came from the university center at Albany [State University of New York at Albany, Albany, New York] to place two of the major units dealing with public policy into a single unit, and named it the College of--Nelson Rockefeller College of Public Affairs [Nelson Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy, Albany, New York].  And then I put into it a package separately of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, to be housed in this building at 411 State Street [Albany, New York].  Then I created a structure for the operation of the college with the consent of the university and the institute, because the institute was SUNY central.  We then proceeded to take the building, and we decided that it was important to make the building effectively usable for this purpose.  And, interestingly, it was a building that had been suggested to Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and me as a possible home (laughter) for the chancellor.  I said that was just out of the question.  However, in looking at it, Dolores said, "You know, this building could be brought back to its original state because they had built up partitions and walls and so on."  And so we hired a firm in Albany [New York], which was the one that had redone Blair House in Washington [D.C.], very famous firm.  And they began the process.  Serendipitously, it turned out that the Albany Institute of History and Art [Albany, New York], when Dolores was on that board, had the original plans of that building.  The architects who we hired then began to operate on the building, they plumbed--they discovered what the original wallpaper was like.  As they took down walls, for example, they discovered that the carriageway was along the side of the house, had been covered over and offices built on top of the carriageway.  But underneath was all of the rocks, the sidewalks.  They took down a wall and there were green marble columns in the wall, and the finials was underneath the ground.  They brought that--they took--it was amazing.  That whole building was transformed into this beautiful conference center. And it was named for Nelson Rockefeller.  Now, to show you how things worked, at first, the state and the legislature would not provide me with the funds for the Rockefeller Institute.  So okay.  We went ahead, we did it anyway.  Today, today, the Nelson Rockefeller Institute is in three buildings up there and is probably one of the most well-known national institutes on state government in the country.  It is a phenomenal operation, and it just celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary (laughter).  Now, but, again, there are things that happen when you work and know and so on.  Now, the family, they have contributed to it.  They came to the opening, and there were different things that take to--I just tell you that one as a kind of an example of what would--happens when you try to get things done.  Now, unfortunately, the private universities were reluctant to participate.  I thought it was too bad.  I mean, we weren't trying to hoard the wealth and all.  We just--you know, it was a good opportunity for everybody to participate.
Speaker 2: So this is a training center for--
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  It's a research center.
Speaker 2: Research center.  Okay.  Support for the legislate?
Speaker 1: Now it's supported, oh yeah.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And it does private fundraising and so on, yeah.
Story_ID: 536049
Speaker 1: Now, let's--since we're talking about sort of state issues, can we look at the issue of the funding, you know, that--how complicated it was and how you worked through that?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Because, well, did--
Speaker 2: It--
Speaker 1: And wasn't Cuomo [Mario Cuomo]--didn't Cuomo play a role, a minor role?  Is he--you have to--you had this--you said to do anything (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to get anything through--
Speaker 2: There were rules.
Speaker 1: --there was this regulatory structure that was--
Speaker 2: The controls exercised by the bureau of the budget in New York State or division of budget, is incredible, very powerful.  And, then the question was, how to bring about a liberation of the university.  Not to do what it wanted, but at least to be able to use the funds effectively.  And, quite frankly, I knew that this would take time.  I could not--.  I knew what needed to be done.  But I knew it should not--it could not be immediate.  After several years when I felt that the time was ripe, by that time, Carey [Hugh Carey] was no longer governor and Cuomo was governor.  And I proposed to the board of trustees of SUNY [State University of New York System] that we create an independent commission.  And this independent commission was made up of outstanding national and state people.  It was chaired by the head of Time [Time Inc.]--co-chaired by the head of Time.  And the--what we did was--we had also the former president of Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].  We had the head of--the president of the University of North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina].  We had John Whitehead [John C. Whitehead], Goldman Sachs [Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.] and the former deputy secretary of state.  We had Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel].  We had the head of one of the major labor unions.  It was an incredible--and we had Don Marrin [sic. Donald M. Blinken]--
Speaker 1: Was (Unclear) in this?
Speaker 2: No, he was not.
Speaker 1: He was not.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So I put together this group.  I would say that I probably knew personally only about a third of them.  The others were people whose reputation I knew, people like Mike Blumenthal [W. Michael Blumenthal], who was the former secretary of treasury.  That's the people, the kind of people I had on this, you know.  And I then secured private funding for the commission, gave it an independent staff.  And at the very first meeting, talked to the group.  And I said, "I know--I want you to look at the State University and help us improve the university."  I said, "I only have one request and that is, I would very much appreciate it if each of you would choose two or three campuses to visit on your own.  Nobody from central administration will be with you.  Just go and visit the campuses."  They did.  And they all came back to the next meeting.  They were aghast.  Absolutely aghast.  They did not believe what they had seen in terms of the level of oversight.  As one person said, "They treat the university like it's the prisons or like any other state bureaucracy."  And I smiled, and they said, "You knew."  I said, "Yeah."  I said, "If I had told you, you would not have believed it."  Okay.  That was the incentive and they did a phenomenal job.
Story_ID: 536050
Speaker 1: I met with the governor [Mario Cuomo] and his staff and told them, "As long as the chairman of the board told them that this was what we were interested in doing."  I met with the chairman of the two education committees in the senate [New York State Senate] and the legislature.  We were doing this, and if they were interested, et cetera.  There was a whole series of preparation that was done.  The report, when it was finished, I believe it was finished in January or February, and I was told it's going to take at least a year to get this accepted.  And I said, "No.  We're going to get it done this year or it won't happen."  We had tremendous press on the report all over the state.  All over the state.  There's a member of the governor's entourage who very--questioning me, "How did you do this?"  And what I never told him was that, I regularly every year met with the editorial board to the major newspapers all over the state.  I've been doing that regularly.  Not for any press coverage, but just to explain to them what was happening in the university.  I did that every year.  So I would go to the--.  It ranged from The New York Times to The Buffalo News to--you name it.  Everywhere.  The Binghamton [Binghamton Press].   I was all over the state.  Regularly.  Just talk.  Now, the coverage is enormous, huge.  I then--I had the presidents involved, I had the president, the campus councils involved.  So it was a huge effort, all right.  Now, then, the leadership in the legislature held hearings, two or three hearings around the state about the issue.  Great.  And then we went to work.  And we did not get everything that was in the report, but we got a lot.  And the result was a freeing up of the university, so that the president could have some degree of flexibility to be able to take unused money from this pot to put it where it suddenly was needed during the middle of the year.  They didn't have to wait.  There were examples in the report that came from the members of the commission about how a small leak in a gymnasium, because they couldn't get it done within a year, turned into a huge requirement for a whole new roof for the gym.  I mean, things of that nature had been going on.  That was what happened.  And so, it was referred to as the flexibility legislation.  And in my day, everybody in the whole SUNY System [State University of New York System] knew about the flexibility legislation and what it meant for their ability to do a better job with the existing resources that they had.
Speaker 2: Can you tell me what that flexibility legislation allowed that wasn't allowed before?
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, I have to go through--
Speaker 2: Oh.  Wait, okay.
Speaker 1: It's very complex.  It's just that they were able to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: Overcome a lot of the bureaucratic mishmash that they had to go through in order to be able to do it.  And they had some authority to do certain things that they didn't have before.
Story_ID: 536051
Speaker 1: Now, the other thing you said was an asset [in the State University of New York System] because you had come from a system at MSU [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] where, you know, you had to fight the board or part of the board for, you know, a part of your time as president.  But here you--I read that you had a good appointed board of--a government board.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, what was good about that?  I mean--
Speaker 2: They were very good.  They were very good people.  If they were still in place and I took you into the room and you watched them discuss issues, I would defy you to tell me which one--who--which of the group were Republicans and which were Democrats or which governor appointed them.  You wouldn't have known.  They cared about the university and they did their work.  And, again, I happen to have a philosophy that the board is there to work, and they chose me.  It's their responsibility to make me look good and help me do my job.  And they plowed in.  I mean, it was wonderful.  They were a great group.
Speaker 1: How many?
Speaker 2: Twelve I think, yeah.  But it was a very--it was a situation where I always knew that they would deliberate, and consider, and study the issues, and come forward with thoughts and ideas.  I mean, it was really--and they also, very rarely would I ever find that they would step over the line between policy and execution, which is another problem in some places.  But it was very--it was a joy to work with them.
Story_ID: 536052
Speaker 1: Now, the other thing which, of course, helped was Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I lived in the building.  We developed a triplex apartment in the administration building.  The building is in downtown Albany [New York] at the foot of the--just below the state legislature [New York State Legislature] right along the river, and it's a Flemish Gothic building.  And it originally, the main piece of the building was the headquarters of the Delaware Hudson railroad [Delaware and Hudson Railway], and the end piece was the headquarters of the Albany newspaper.  And it had fallen into disrepair and they were going to tear it down.  But, they were persuaded to turn it over to the State University [State University of New York System] for their headquarters.  And this had begun by my predecessor.  And by the time I got there, they were in the process of remodeling, and rebuilding it, et cetera.  And they converted that building into the headquarters office of the State University of New York.  And when I arrived, they had promised us that they would find housing for the chancellor, like they do for all presidents.  Well, we had great difficulty in finding the right kind of space because if it had the right space for entertaining, it had too many rooms.  And there were just three of us.  If it was (unclear) enough for us, it wouldn't have enough space for entertaining.  And so, Dolores took a look at the south tower, the smaller tower, and thought maybe this can be converted.  And it's a hexagonal tower and it's circular.  And so, we got architects, et cetera, and we developed that into our house or our apartment there.  All the furnishings were paid for out of my fees, my corporate fees.  And, by the way, this is a side issue.  When I was at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], all of my corporate director's fees went to the university.  I didn't receive a cent.  When I left Michigan State, I had left behind a quarter of a million dollars with the university.  For the first several years at SUNY, all of my corporate fees went to the State University in New York.  Okay.  Now, the apartment was wonderful because we were the first people to live in downtown Albany.   There were some areas there that were really not very nice and so on.  And when we left SUNY, the mayor and the city council gave us a wonderful plaque with a picture of Albany, downtown Albany, and celebrated the fact that we were the first people to begin the process of rejuvenation in downtown Albany by going down there and living there.  But we did, and it was wonderful.
Speaker 2: It seems like it was a stunningly beautiful place; two years that was (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it was the way it was built, and also the way that Dolores decorated it.  It was spectacular.  And we entertained there.  We entertained members of the community of the City of Albany, entertained legislators.  All of that's part of the, part of the process.
Story_ID: 536053
Speaker 1: If you look at those nine years that you were there, would you divide it into key periods, those nine years, in terms of what was done?
Speaker 2: No.  Not really.  No.  It would be major things that happened.  I mean, it was like the flexibility of legislation would be.  But it's just--each of those are different.  Not--there weren't eras or periods--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.  It was just the whole period.
Speaker 1: Now, what role did--was Mario Cuomo's role, was it strictly with the flexibility of legislation or did he have more of a role--
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no.  It just I--he was the governor and I had to get his approval.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I mean, he certainly--he could have tried to block it, and so on, to go through, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were there, you know, were there other things in terms of the, you know, budget cuts and, you know, this is the time--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  That's--well, the most memorable one for most people in SUNY [State University of New York System] was, there was time under Carey [Hugh Carey] when what happened was that, in those days, the budget and the governor, they would give to us would be insufficient.  And amazingly, the gap very often represented a certain level of increase in tuition.  So then we would go to the legislature [New York State Legislature] and they would give us a little bit more, but they would still have something left over, and then the board of trustees would provide the additional by increasing tuition.  That got changed later, but that's not the point.  This particular year, it was a tough year, and the governor gave us a budget--the legislature increased the budget significantly, and the governor vetoed the increases.  After consulting with the campuses and all, it was very clear that by rejecting the increases that the legislature had provided, it would be a major, negative impact on the university.  I understood the governor's reason, but that was it.  I argued that a university, it has a very interesting structure in that it takes years to build up a department, a group of people who will be there to carry out.  You can destroy it in a snap of the finger by cutting the budgets, and then they leave.  And then you have to start all over again.  It takes ten to fifteen years to build a solid, top quality institution.  That would have done serious damage.  It's one thing to reduce it and try, you know, adjustments.  To really make major cuts was a problem.  So, I met with the board and we talked about it, and we decided that we would fight the veto and try to have the veto overridden by the legislature.  And the governor, a governor's veto in New York had not been overridden for twenty-five years.  But I met with the board, they agreed that we should try it.  I met with the presidents and we said, okay, we are going to go to work.  And we overrode the governor's veto for the first time in twenty-five years.  Carey was very unhappy.  And the local newspaper, the Times Union cartoonist, Hy Rosen, did a cartoon.  This was the year of the Olympics.  And he had his cartoon where Carey was in his Olympic track suit and I was in my Olympic track suit, and I was carrying a box which said, "SUNY Budget," and I was giving Carey a hot foot (laughter).  Officers of SUNY gave me the original of the cartoon.  But that was a very significant event because it had not been done in twenty-five years.  About four or five years ago, it was overridden again recently, and they said it had not been done since--but they never mentioned my name or whoever it was, but I knew--everybody knew who it was and what had happened.  But, but that was a big one, yeah.
Story_ID: 536054
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, the other thing that you played a role in was a private funding.  Remember you--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: --you said that there was, that there had been--
Speaker 2: Right.  Limited.  Very limited private fundraising [for the State University of New York System], yeah.  And I came in and it took, I don't know, about three or four years to finally persuade the state to give us positions which will be specifically for private fundraising.  And that enabled the campuses to then go ahead and to do it.  And that continues to this day.  But it was--it was a big fight.  It was a big fight.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So the fight, what was the issue there about--
Speaker 2: Have to--how are you going to do it if you don't have the people to do it with?  And you can't hire the people if you don't have the lines for them, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's so it's, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I understand.
Story_ID: 536055
Speaker 1: Were you also, at this time, was your wife [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] getting involved with corporate boards or was this a separate time?
Speaker 2: Well, she was on corporate boards in Michigan.
Speaker 1: In Michigan.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But the Fund for Corporate Initiatives [Fund for Corporate Interns, Inc.; Fund for Corporate Initiatives, Inc.], is that a--
Speaker 2: That started then.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, she started while you--she was the, okay, the chancellor's wife.  Now, why did it start then?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Because she, on her corporate boards, and she was on several, found that women and minorities--this was before the use of the term glass ceiling--she found that they were hiring but they were not moving up rapidly or moving into the upper levels.
Speaker 1: So this was in the early '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, it was in 1978, '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So that's when--okay.
Speaker 2: And so, and then she visited with some of her colleagues from the boards and other corporate CEOs and said, "Why aren't they moving?  Why aren't they--?"  And they gave her some thoughts about what was--what they were missing, what the individuals were missing.  So she created, with her own money, this private operation foundation from her corporate fees and developed this program.  She developed two programs.  One was a program for college youth, which is still, as far as I know, being run by the business council in Albany [New York].  But the other one was the Young Executives Program, which she ran for, oh, fifteen years with the Aspen Institute [Washington, D.C.].  And that was designed for mid-level, current corporate young executives to get this tremendous exposure to the areas that would enhance and enrich their opportunities for upward mobility, the missing elements (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 536056
Speaker 1: So that was the Fund for Corporate Initiatives [Fund for Corporate Interns, Inc.; Fund for Corporate Initiatives, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so, it was--was it a mentoring program or a how to program?  You know--
Speaker 2: It's not like anything you've ever seen.  What was done was this: first of all, the corporations nominated the individuals as high potential, upwardly mobile young men and women (cough).  It was primarily women and minorities, but not exclusively.  Then the program itself, each day there were four different resource guests, different each day (cough).  That meant over five days you'd have twenty different people.  The program was divided into four tracks, if you want.  The first track was humanities, the second track was upward mobility, the third track was executive dialogue, and the fourth track was cultural connections.  In the humanities track, one day would be devoted to the Greek philosophers, Plato, et cetera.  The next day might be the issue of Chinese religions.  The next day might be African values.  The next day--okay.  And each time it was a different leader.
Story_ID: 536057
Speaker 1: Upward mobility was the opportunity to have individuals, primarily women and minorities, who had already moved up the corporate ladder and were right below the top or the up, almost to the top of the ladder.  And they would explain--they would talk to the young men and women about what it was like, what did they do, what were the problems, and their difference in age from the mid-young (unclear) executive was not that great.  Now, many of the people who came at that time you would not have known them.  Today you would.  Dick Parsons [HistoryMaker Richard Parsons], Todd Davis [ph.], Barry Rand.  These were people who we brought in.  Okay.  We knew them, okay.  And they shared what it was like, how they moved up.  The third unit was executive dialogue, and there we brought in sitting CEOs or former CEOs, current corporate directors primarily.  They could choose any subject they wanted to share with the young executives and they would have a chance to dialogue with them.  The fourth unit was cultural connections.  It had a full range:  politicians, lobbyists, musicians, athletes.  We had Arthur Ashe, we had [HistoryMaker] Billy Taylor; you name it, we had them, okay.  Now, we also had it so that the luncheons and dinners, it was structured in a fashion they all had different opportunities to interact with the resource guests.  And we saw to it that they never had more than four individuals from any one corporation.  There they were in that environment, constant environment, etcetera.  And the impact was incredible.  We could always watch the mood of the group, and we could just tell when they were taking off.  They--at the end of the program, the last unit usually was I would speak to them and give them a talk about, "So you want to be a CEO?"  And tell them, "Look, what it is that helps you get to be a CEO, talk."  They soaked it up.  I mean it was--it was phenomenal.  It was a wonderful experience for us as well as for them, just to be a part of this.  Now, it required an enormous amount of work which is not visible.  We met with every one of the resource guests months ahead of time.  We talked to them about the program.  We talked to them about what--how they might be helpful or what might be useful for them.  What they were interested in talking to them about, getting a sense of what the participants were like.  All of that.  We worked with them in advance so when they arrived they had a good sense of where they were going.  I'll give you one example.  We had one of the most outstanding lobbyists, political lobbyist in Washington [D.C.], woman, tremendous woman.  She arrived.  She had the list of the participants.  She'd looked up them, and we had the list and their corporations.  She went around the room.  When she sat down, and she would say to somebody from a chemical company, "Your company is trying to promote foreign legislation, bang, bang, bang.  And your company's doing this--."  And she went on the whole--she--and then she said, "This is why we're lobbyists."  And the young people sat there and they were transfixed that this woman knew exactly what their corporations were trying to achieve in Washington.  We had--Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] came.  He came three or four times.  And he would talk about his experiences as a corporate director.  It was--you cannot imagine the effect that that had these young people.  And we always had several whites in the group.  And the impact on them was tremendous.  They often would say, "This is the first time I've been a minority in a group."  But it had a wonderful impact on it.  Now, Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] turned the program over completely to Aspen [Aspen Institute, Washington, D.C.].  They tried to run it for a while, but it did not click the same way.  And it was partially because more and more corporations were already doing this themselves, either internally or collectively.  And the situations have changed.  It's not no longer quite the same issue of getting up to the top.  They were already doing that, but then there are other kinds of needs.  So, you know, Dolores and I said--we talked about it.  I said, "Now, let's just stop it.  Just stop.  We don't have to keep going.  It's done what it was designed to do; we can take care of it."
Speaker 2: Well, that was an amazing program to do at that time, you know, given that that was still, you know, a wave, and those people actually are now in positions.  But that was the wave that started in the '70s [1970].
Story_ID: 536058
Speaker 1: I want to go to TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York].  We're actually here right now in the offices.  But I want to go back a little bit because, when you left MSU [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], you had some other opportunities.  We didn't, you know, some other offers like--you had offers that sort of came calling to, you know, people said, "Would you be interested in this," or "Would you be interested in that."  That wasn't--did you have, like, between MSU, you know, around that when you were at MSU, wasn't there a presidential offer or I mean, was it offered from one of the--
Speaker 2: Oh, well.  Yeah.  Presidents Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] and Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], um-hm.  Yeah.  And I said no.
Speaker 1: And was--there's--now, you said--now, let's talk about, you--I mean you had spent time really in the foundation, you know, community and higher education, and you have been, you know, with the government previously, but you--
Speaker 2: No.  But I hadn't been paid by the government that way, in a job, yeah.
Speaker 1: You hadn't been paid by the government.  Okay.  Okay.  So was your philosophy that--what was your philosophy about government, and why would those--you didn't think that was the best use of your talents?
Speaker 2: Well, in the first place, in the Carter case, I knew that if I even went to the first session, where there were several other people who had been invited by Carter, who eventually all of them went into the cabinet, it would be public knowledge.  And that would have been, if I had not gone, that would have been devastating for my effectiveness in the State of Michigan.  I would have been labeled.  I always operated in both Michigan and New York in a non-partisan way, regardless of my political affiliations.  That was number one.  Number two, I had always felt that Washington [D.C.] was a bit of a snake pit, and I just didn't feel that it was the right thing that I should get into, so I didn't.  With Reagan, that particular one was education.
Speaker 1: To head up the [U.S.] Department of Education?
Speaker 2: Yes, secretary of education.  But, quite frankly, in all candor, at that time, I did not feel that I could take that position and agree with the positions that Reagan had on the issue.  I cannot be an advocate.  To me, to be an advocate about something you don't really believe, you're a hypocrite.  And I just--I can't, I can't do that.  And I also, again, I didn't want to get into the snake pit.
Story_ID: 536059
Speaker 1: You had been nine years with SUNY [State University of New York System], which is, you know, once again, longer than the average term--
Speaker 2: It was the longest of anybody in SUNY's history, yeah.
Speaker 1: In SUNY's--okay.  And you had made tremendous changes in that.  And including, and I don't think we touched upon that, you really put in place minorities in--
Speaker 2: In positions, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, as females.
Speaker 2: In presidencies, and women, and so on, um-hm.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Would we know any of those people now, or are they--?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: With some of the people that you did put in place, in positions?
Speaker 2: I don't know of any.  Most of them are people in the academic world.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The--and, it's--well, for example, right now, there's a not so young man who is stepping down after twelve years as president in Pennsylvania-- university.  I mean, there are a lot, but I mean it's not--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have always operated on the basis that you are able to--it is possible to find first class people, period, regardless of race and gender.  If you look for good people, you will find good people, okay.  And in this case, you know, I had women presidents, I had minority presidents, I had people on the central administration staff that's on with me.  I had a woman provost who became president of the University of Massachusetts in Boston [University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, Massachusetts].  I mean, I can go on, but it's best not--it's a--it's sort of talking about it in these terms always sounds to me at times as though you're putting in notches in your belt.  And that's not for me.  For me it is get it going, get it moving, and I've always said--.  People ask me about what's it like being the first.  I keep saying, "I'm interested in two, three, four, and five," (laughter).  And that to me is where you really are going to make an impact, so.
Story_ID: 536060
Speaker 1: So you're sort of at the end of your SUNY [State University of New York System] tenure, other things come calling and one was the Rockefeller Foundation that was--
Speaker 2: Oh, that happened at the very beginning.
Speaker 1: Oh, was that the beginning?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: They offered the presidency?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  First year I was SUNY it came out.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.  Oh, so you had offers all throughout the whole time span.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  It depends.
Speaker 1: So, Rockefeller, Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: No, not Ford.  No.  But the--what happened was that man who was the head of the Rockefeller Foundation, who was a classmate of mine from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], became ill.  I think he had cancer of the liver or something like that.  He died just like that.  And I was--I was on the search committee, and we did a tremendous amount of work on the search committee.  We got it down to finalists and so on.  And at the board meeting where we were going to boil it down to the group to interview, they had--the chairman of the board was Father Hesburgh [Theodore Hesburgh].  And Father Hesburgh said, "Well, we're going to two stage this."  He said, "First, we're going to discuss the outside candidates, and then we're going to discuss the inside candidates."  So I said, "Um-hm," and everybody says, "Yeah," so.  Then he says, "Now, we're going to do the inside candidates."  So he said, "Will the following people please leave the room," you know, including me, and I didn't want to leave the room.  I said, "Look, I'm not," you know--.  "Leave the room, Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.]."  "Okay."  So I go out of the room, a few minutes later, come back, they said they wanted me to be president.  And I will confess that it was an incredible thing for me because of my long association with the Rockefellers, my long association in the foundation world, my long association in development.  I mean it was a very logical thing.  And I probably agonized over that offer longer than any of the others I've ever received.  But, ultimately, what happened was I concluded that there were people leaving Michigan to come to be with me.  My executive vice chancellor already announced that he was leaving Oakland University [Rochester, Michigan] and coming to be with me at (unclear).  The chap [Robert Perrin] that had been my person in charge of external affairs was leaving Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] and was coming to be with me.  There were four people coming to be with me.  And I could walk away.  I mean, I'd just thought that was unconscionable.  I just couldn't do that.  And also, I felt that it was somehow unseemly to take this job, and then a year later you're saying bye.  You know, I just--I just couldn't do it.  I just said no.  I just couldn't do it.  And it was one of those things, it was the wrong time and, you know.
Story_ID: 536061
Speaker 1: Let's talk about how TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York] came, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You wanna go now or--
Speaker 1: We're ready.
Speaker 2: Okay, great.
Speaker 1: How it came into, you know, into being--there was someone retiring that--right?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, he was stepping down.
Speaker 1: Oh, he was stepping--isn't that retire--oh, he was stepping down, not retiring, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There's a difference.
Speaker 2: It was not a retirement due to age.  He just decided he--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Okay.  How long had he been president?
Speaker 2: He'd been--his whole career was here.  Let me back up.  TIAA-CREF is a, in higher education, is an incredible brand.  It was started by Andrew Carnegie.  I will not go through all the details.  But it was started in order to provide retirement for the professors at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], and he was going to do it personally.  It quickly turned out he didn't have enough money to do all that.  And that's how TIAA was invented or created.
Speaker 1: And this was under the theory that people needed retirement (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, he--
Speaker 1: --you know--
Speaker 2: --he found--
Speaker 1: --to maintain--
Speaker 2: He was on the board at Cornell and he discovered that faculty would not retire because they didn't have enough money.  They were staying on.  Okay.  Now, the TIAA as an organization, one of its biggest changes was when it created CREF, which is the equity portion of the activity.  And that was the result of the work of one of my predecessors named William Greenough [William C. Greenough], who invented the concept of a variable annuity based upon fluctuations in the stock market.  And so, it was TIAA dash CREF.  It's actually two organizations with two separate boards.  Right above them is a board of overseers who see to it that the company is operating in consonance with the original mission.  Now, as things turned out, there was a time when they only had two offered--two choices for the participants.  They could choose to invest their money in TIAA, which was fixed income or they could operate by choosing CREF or both or a mix.  They only had two choices.  And once the money went in, they could not get it out except as an annuity.  Fast forward, we get to the '80s [1980s] and there are--there's unhappiness among some of the participants and some of the universities.  "Why is it we can't get our money out if we want to?  Why is it we only have these two choices?  I can go to Fidelity [Fidelity Investments], I can go to--," you name, all these mutual funds--, "and I can get all these funds, and you only offer me two choices."  Okay.  So the company was being, in a sense, attacked on this issue.  The board was concerned, the universities were concerned.  So it was at this point the man who was then CEO, who had been CEO, I think, three years, he'd been here as an officer, but he was wise enough and smart enough to realize that he felt that a major change was needed, but he was not the person to do it, because he came up through the system.  And that's when they decided to do a search to get an outsider.  They hired a search firm.  The search firm came forward with some names.  One of the board members here at TIAA-CREF was Andy Brimmer [HistoryMaker Andrew F. Brimmer]. Andy was on the board with me at Equitable [Equitable Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial].  Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] had seen to it he went on the board of (unclear) with him.  We know each other, okay.  One of the interesting aspects of this, which is sort of a not a well described story, is the extent to which blacks on corporate boards have been quite effective in working to see to it not only that blacks are not prevented from moving up in the corporation, but also seeing to it that others who are really good get opportunities to serve on various boards.  I mean, it's a--it's a very interesting process.  I mean, it's done in the regular white world anyway.  I mean, it's done--and it's done by just the same kind of skill, okay.  So, what happened was that, Andy said there were no minorities.  So he said, "Why don't you go take a look at Cliff Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.]?"  When he said that at the board meeting--he told me this later--he said, "There were a huge number of people on the board here, all knew me."  They said, "That's a great idea."  Okay.  So that's how the man then came to see me and so on.  And then I came and I was interviewed, and bingo, I was, I was there.
Story_ID: 536062
Speaker 1: Why did I leave TI--SUNY [State University of New York System]?  Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I were very happy, the place was running smoothly, I had a great board, we had--it was very nice, okay.  This was a kind of a different kind of challenge, okay.  Both of us had general corporate boards, we knew the corporate world, I had served on Equitable life and insurance company [Equitable Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial], and technically, this is an insurance company.  So I knew what it was like, what it was doing.  I'm an economist.  So it's--it all had a nice fit to it, okay.  And I would be the first CEO of this company who came out of an academic area, and that's the customer base, the primary customer base.  So as Tom Jones [Thomas W. Jones] used to say, he said--he said, "I was the first customer they put in charge."  You know, it was that kind of thing.  So, I came here--I decided it was really a great--a great opportunity.  Not--financially, yes, but it really the excitement of the way in which I would be able to do things, okay.  So, I came and it was great fun.  I had a ball.  I really did.  Now that sounds strange, but first of all, in terms of personnel, it was the smallest thing I'd run into in a long time.  Secondly, I had run much larger institutions.  Now, we were big in terms of assets, but not in terms--and we were big in terms of customer base, but not in terms of the people who make it work.  And in keeping with, again, my shipboard tours, soon after I arrived, I walked every single floor in all three buildings.  We used to be in three buildings here.  And I met virtually all of the employees.  It took about a day and a half to do it.  And when I finished, I said to the chap, the man in charge of the buildings, I said, "I bet you I can tell you which units are giving us the greatest problems."  He said, "Really?"  I said, "Yeah."  I said--I gave him a list of names.  He said, "You're right."  He said, "How did you know that?"  I said, "I just looked."  And the place was--it had grown like top seed.  There were areas which were tremendously overcrowded.  I said, "I wouldn't want to come to work here."  And they were all--there're all different kinds of aspects in terms of a problem.  So I went to the board and I said, "One of the first things I really want to do is to get your approval to reconfigure the building over, maybe, a couple of years, move some of the units around and then refurbish all of the facility."  I said, "It needs to be a place where people want to come, enjoy coming to work, and it'll change then."  I then asked the human resource people, I said, "What's our turnover rate?"  Our turnover rate was 25 percent.  You stop and think what that means in terms of the company [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York].  So once I started the process of refurbishing and changing, every time I did it, the unit's turnover rate stopped dropping.  By the time I finished all the remodeling, it was down to 8 percent.  And somebody said, "How did you do--?"  I said, "It's not rocket science."  I said, "It was the fact that what--."  We--I'm not going to go through all the stuff, but it was very much involved.
Story_ID: 536063
Speaker 1: But the major thing they did was, I created a committee of the board with top staff people as the staff in the major problem areas and worked on the future agenda for what kind of changes we needed in the company [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York].  And they still talk about it in the company, this future agenda.  We worked on it over the summer, came up with ideas about providing for more options, the ability to remove money if you wanted to, transferability; all kinds of things was in this agenda.  And it was very interesting.  I said to the board, "I want to take this draft report and make it available to the universities."  And it was quite a hullabaloo because they said, "But you're revealing to them but also to our competition what you're planning on doing.  You don't do that."  I said, "Yes, we do.  In the field of higher education they want to participate.  They want some transparency."  And I did it.  And sure enough, it made a tremendous difference in terms of our relationships.  One of the other issues was, there was concern about the fact that if we opened up transferability on being able to take money out, we would have huge losses because all of the other companies was salivating to try to get ahold of this money, this big pool of money that we were.  And I looked at the--being an ex-Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] economist, I looked at the research that we regularly did on the attitude of our customer base.  We had numbers of customer satisfaction that most companies would die for.  I said, "If you don't believe these numbers," I said, "it is not that people want to take the money out, they want to be able to if they need to or want to."  Sure enough, the first two years I think we had a net loss of something like four-tenths of 1 percent.  Okay.  It happened.  There were a number of other things that happened while I was here which were great in terms of trying to bring the company forward.  The board worked very well with me.  Again, it--I changed some of the governing structures, I changed the committee to have a corporate social responsibility committee to deal with issues like ranging all the way from South Africa to milk products and, you know, the whole range.  But all of these things, I'd had a lot of activities going on.  But it was, it was fun.
Story_ID: 536064
Speaker 1: Let me ask this question just so I understand.  With the--who were the competitors of TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York]?  Because it seemed to me that it had sort of a lock hold, or has a lock hold on the university--
Speaker 2: Well, oh no.  We had--we had--we had state plans, but they still had their own pension plan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: People like Fidelity [Fidelity Investments] all the mutual--all the mutual funds were out there, you know.  Even Equitable [Equitable Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial], you know.  I mean, they--they're--they're all there.  Now, the situation there is quite different.  And I won't go into that, but when I left I had doubled the assets in the six years I was there.  I mean, it was, you know, it was a great run.  Now, the board--
Speaker 1: Now, how--how had you doubled the assets?  How were you able to do that?
Speaker 2: It was because--
Speaker 1: You offered op- you offered--
Speaker 2: We offered the option, but also we opened up new parts of the market.  And people were happy.  They were satisfied with what we were doing.
Speaker 1: But this is--we also need to understand the in the larger context in that the financial services industry was going through a revolution in terms of there were lots--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of entities doing lots--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --of different things.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we were in the middle--
Speaker 1: Makes me wonder--
Speaker 2: --of it.
Speaker 1: Right, just that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And it was--there is no question about it.  But, there were some of the competitors who came to me--
Speaker 1: Who?
Speaker 2: --two of them in fact, different--separately, and they were, you know, they were sort of grumbling and, you know, "Boy, you sure move fast."  But sure.  You're damn right I move fast.  I wasn't going to sit on it and sort of mull all over and wait for them to chew us apart, no.  Now, we had other problems which connected with registration with the SEC [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission], because CREF had never been registered with the SEC.  And in order to issue our first new fund, which was a money market fund, we had to register with the SEC, and it was the largest registration that they had ever done.  But our opposition in the university world and our competitors tried to use that as a way of blocking us from doing certain things.  And I had to get into that and fight on that.  But it was--and then I (sighs) I reorgan- oh boy, I--we had to change the whole technology within the company.  There were so many different things that I able to do.
Story_ID: 536065
Speaker 1: How many people are on the board here?  The board of trustees.
Speaker 2: I think there were--when I was here, I think it was twenty-four, twenty-eight.  There were two different boards, so I think it was in that number (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how many of those were African American or minorities (unclear)?
Speaker 2: When I came?  Probably only one or two.  But when I'd got here I brought on quite a few women, minorities.  I brought on the first Asians, first Hispanics, you know.  And then, and within the company, the person I had appointed as secretary of the board was black.  I hired Tom Jones [Thomas W. Jones] as chief financial officer.  That's an interesting story.
Speaker 1: Can you tell that story?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tom Jones, his names comes up (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, I had--I needed to have a chief financial officer, and I gave one of the internal officers an opportunity to try.  Didn't work.  And he knew it and I knew it, and so we put him in another area.  But I still needed a chief financial officer.  And I called some of my friends in the insurance industry and I said, "Who are the best people in the field?"  And this name Tom Jones kept coming up.  Then I discovered he was black and he was the number two chief financial officer at Hart- at--blocking out the name.  The--
Speaker 1: Insurance?
Speaker 2: The, the insurance company in Boston [John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, Boston, Massachusetts].  It'll come to me in a minute.  Anyway, so (laughter) I call him on up on the phone and I said, "Mr. Jones," I said, "I've heard a great deal about you.  I don't know if you know me."  He said, "Yes, I know who you are."  I said, "Well," I said, "your name has been suggested to me as somebody that I should talk to about a position that I have here at Teachers [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York]."  And I said, "Would you be willing to come down and chat?"  And he said, very interesting, he said, "You know," he said, "I am regularly approached by headhunting firms and I never respond."  He said, "But you're first CEO to call me directly."  So he came.  We had a great talk.  Bright guy.  God, he was good.  And near the end of the conversation he said, "Do you know who I am?"  And I said, "No."  He said, "Willard Straight Hall."  And I said, "Really."  Now, if you remember at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] there were the black students who took over Willard Straight Hall.  He was the leader.  And he said, "Would that make any difference?"  I said, "No."  I said, "I'll tell you, though."  I said, "Perkins [James A. Perkins] is a very dear friend of mine because he and I are on different commissions and boards and committees together, and he had been a trustee here at TIAA-CREF."  And then he said, "You know," he said, "I really would like to have the chance to talk to him."  I said, "I'm sure he would want to talk to you."  So I hired him.  And it was no question in mind he was the best of the lot that was available that was out there.  So I called up Perkins and I said, "Jim, I have to tell you something."  I said, "I've hired Tom Jones to be chief financial officer."  And he said, "I think that's wonderful."  And I said, "I--he would like to have a chance to talk with you."  He said, "I would.  I'd like to do it."  So I had a luncheon.  And my one regret is that I did not have it tape recorded.    The meeting between the two of them was phenomenal because they were talking sort of past each other, but from the perspective of where they were back then in terms of what they were thinking, doing, and so on.  It was wonderful.  And remember, Perkins lost his presidency as a result of what had happened.  But it was a great meeting.  Now, a couple of years later, Tom Jones becomes a trustee of Cornell, okay.  Jim Perkins dies.  Tom Jones endows at Cornell an annual prize to be awarded for any person or activity in Cornell, who has contributed to racial amity and named for Jim Perkins.  That tells you something, okay.  And inside the company, there was absolutely no question whatsoever, Tom Jones was fantastic.  He was superb.  Wasn't that he was black.  He was great, okay.  Now, when I left, my immediate executive under me, chief operating officer, became CEO.  Tom Jones became the number two in the company.  And then he went over to Citibank [Citibank, N.A.].  But, you know, it was--it was a great hire.  But again, you know, it's--I've had this--always had this feeling, one does it and you do it.  You don't sort of say, "Well, naw, I'm going to--," you know.  You go out and get it the best you can.

Speaker 1: So let me ask one other thing.  You had created the special assistants program?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You want to talk about that?
Speaker 2: Okay.  If you remember, at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], I had the Presidential Fellows Program.  So I did something similar here.  Every year I would select a certain number of what we called rotating special assistants, who would have special projects.  I would take them with me to various meetings, board meetings, etcetera; everything except personnel again. And they all had special projects, but the projects had to be in an area other than the area in which they normally worked.  When they finished their tour, I would have them come to the full board meetings and at lunch make presentations about the work that they did and their experience with the program.  And then they would go back to their regular jobs.  Again, it was an opportunity for them to see what it's like at the top level of the corporation.  Very often when they got back they could explain to their colleagues why things were what--were deemed--being done, the reason why they were.  For some it was a little hard to readjust.  But, the interesting thing about it was that I think--I used to have the numbers but I won't try, but I had a substantial number of women, a substantial number of minorities in the group.  And, again, they had the chance to meet with me privately with my assistance, ask me any question they wanted about what was going on and why had we did things that I did and so on.  Again, it was the same process that I thought would be useful to them and helpful to them in their own careers.  So, it was--it was a good--for me it was a good program.  My successor, John Biggs [John H. Biggs], continued it.  I don't know if it's being done now, but John did it.
Speaker 1: Now, did you also create the 2000 task force, TIAA-CREF 2000 task force?  Or was that afterwards, and were you looking forward to have--
Speaker 2: No, I'm not sure that that's the one.  We had--we had others.  I had another one that related to customer service, which was a big one, yeah.  But no.  I don't--I may have.  I'm trying to remember if I did one.  I had so many of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So basically what you were trying to--you were trying to make this organization [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York] current and relevant going forward--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and you were able to allow to not--to not allow it to lose its space, but to increase it basically.
Speaker 2: And to become--
Speaker 1: Relevant.
Speaker 2: --relevant to--in the current environment, yeah.  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's fine.  So what are the challenges facing it today?  What were you--
Speaker 2: I--no.  I won't get into that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I never comment on my successes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's fine.  That's fine.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 536067
Speaker 1: Remember you had said you would never serve--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: --in, you know, you got too political--
Speaker 2: No.  I just thought it was a snake pit.
Speaker 1: A snake pit.
Speaker 2: I was right (laughter).
Speaker 1: You were right (laughter).  Okay.  So, can we talk about this?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Basically, you were given, I don't if Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] played a role or--okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'll tell you the story very briefly.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) a place, okay.
Speaker 2: I was--the TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York] board had asked me to stay on beyond my normal retirement, and I agree to it.  And I was about to start my last year, and that was when Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] was--not Carter--Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was elected.  Then I, purely by--serendipitously had met Vernon in Washington [D.C.] at an event.  And he asked me, he said--he said, "You know," he said, "Clinton is going to need some gray-haired people around to really help him, you know."  He said, "Would you be interested?"  I said, "It depends on what, you know, what it is."  That's all I said.  Then when Clinton held his economic summit in Little Rock [Arkansas], where he invited outstanding people from different fields, I was one that he invited.  Now, I had met him before and so on.  And also, he had held one of his debates at the Wharton Center [Clifton and Dolores Wharton Center for the Performing Arts] in Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] and Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] and I were there.  And I would have to say, I was absolutely amazed at his performance.  He and Gore [Al Gore] sat up there at the head table, at the head table and never once consulted their briefing books, very thick ones.  And Bill Clinton, president elect--designated--President Elect Clinton understood and discussed and debated issues in depth with experts all over that--for that--for two days.  And some friends of mine, particularly some corporate types and I were standing around one afternoon and we said, "This is the most incredible tour de force I've ever seen in my life than the president (unclear)."  He was brilliant.  And I said to myself, I said, "Boy," I said, "this chap can--might be able to really do something helpful."  So then I got a phone call and they wanted me to come down and talk to him.  And I said to--I talked to Dolores about it as I do with all of these things, and I said, "Well," I said, "you know," I said, "if I can be helpful to them in this kind of," I said, "it's a great chance to be helpful."  So I go to see him, and Clinton wants to know if I want to become ambassador to the UN [United Nations].  I said, "No," I said, "not really."  I said, you know, "My father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] was an ambassador and I'm not--and that's not what I want to do."  So he said--then he later called me again and he said, "Well, how about being deputy secretary of state?"  Now that happened to be usually an administrative role, not a policy--foreign policy role.  And there were some major problems of reorganization in the [U.S.] Department of State, and major problems with regard to the foreign assistance.  Both of these are my meat and potatoes.  So I said, "Well, if you think I can be helpful, I'll be glad to come down."  So I did.  Now, one of the issues that--and I did both things.  I was doing both things regularly, working on them, accomplishing things.  I was hardly ever involved in foreign policy matters.  So, then what happened was, these leaks started in newspapers, in these magazines and so on, that the White House is unhappy with me and that after all I'm just an educator and I don't know anything about foreign policy, and I'm responsible for the failures of foreign policy in Bosnia.  And I couldn't understand where they were coming from.  I mean, it didn't--didn't make a bit of sense.  I had not been involved in foreign policy.  I had not been involved in Bosnia.  So when I went to see Christopher, and I used to see him every day practically, and he had never said anything like this.
Speaker 1: This is Warren Christopher?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He said, "Well, blah, blah."  I said, "What the devil is this," you know.  So, when I didn't get the kind of--clear kind statement out of him, I said, "That's it."  I said, "I'm not staying."  I said, "I'm gone."  I said, "I don't--I didn't come down here to make money.  I didn't come down here to make a reputation, I already had it."  I said, "I came down here to help, and I know how this game is played."  I said, "Unh-uh, no."  So I submitted my resignation on Monday.  The following Monday, Dolores and I were back in New York [New York] in our apartment.  That was it.  Gone.
Story_ID: 536068
Speaker 1: But, one thing I will say about it is that, one of the gratifying things for me personally was, that the outpouring of editorials and op-ed pieces and letters was huge.  And all of them were condemning Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] and Christopher [Warren Christopher] for what they were doing, what they had done.  They said I was being a scape- being used as a scapegoat for their own failures in terms of foreign policy.  Because the people who spoke out on my behalf recognized and talked about my huge foreign policy experience.  They said they weren't even using it, but they were accusing me of--.  So they said, "No, this doesn't make sense."  So that's what happened, yeah.
Story_ID: 536069
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you--I have three questions.  One, where are you in your life right now?
Speaker 2: I'm fine (laughter).
Speaker 1: Not how are you.  I said, where are you?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm retired.
Speaker 1: Retired (laughter).  Okay.  Good.  Well, let me ask this question.  What do you want your--Dr. Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I'm not the person to talk about that.  I don't think it's fair for me to do it.  I mean, no.  I won't do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then, let's go back to--do you--let me ask another question I asked you before that, what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Same thing.  The same thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, then --
Speaker 2: I'm not--to me there's a quality of egocentricism in this kind of thing; that is, you are ascribing to yourself certain qualities that you want other people to remember you for.  I won't do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, let's just put it this way.  Let's look then in terms of your father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your family background.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And even your wife's [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] family background, which were all sort of equally yoked.  What--when you look at things in the context of that continuum, and I really believe legacy is a sum of the parts, really, in many ways.  Either what would your father say, had he lived to see your everything?
Speaker 2: What he said to me when I became president of Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] and it's the same thing.  He said, "You've gone further than I ever thought you would do, and I'm so glad that you didn't go into [U.S.] Foreign Service," period.  That's it.
Story_ID: 536070
Speaker 1: Dr. Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.], when you look at--because you had been--and made a way for lots of people, you know, minorities and females throughout your career.  And, my--this last question is really, what are your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  That would take a whole another session, really.  No, I'm very serious.  That's--no.  Because it involves the question of my perceptions, my thoughts, my philosophies, my values; and it's a whole series of things.  In terms of the basic question that you're trying to get at, I would say that I have been extremely fortunate in that, I had--I had a wonderful family rearing, nurturing environment; I had the opportunity of getting some great educational experiences and teachers; I had a--I was quite fortunate in getting opportunities that matched my talents at the time that they occurred; and I was fortunate enough to be in various positions where I could break barriers and pioneer which, hopefully, will help others.  That's what I, I did not consciously say I'm going to do it this way.  That was not it at all.  I was lucky enough to do it that way.  And finally, and most important, I was superbly lucky and fortunate in having a wife [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] who has been an incredible helpmate, an incredible partner and, if--I could never have done it without her.  And that has made a marvelous life.  I've been very, very lucky, and very fortunate; and I'm very happy.  And people out there ask me, "Well, how can you be eighty-one years old and look like you do?"  I say, "Well, my wife takes wonderful care of me.  She loves me, I love her, and we have a--we've had a great life together."  And that to me is it.  Now, to say, "Well, my legacy is--."  No, that's for somebody else to do.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Well, I appreciate that, Dr. Wharton.  And all I can say is that our community is better off for people like yourself.
Speaker 2: Well, we'll see.  Okay.  Historians, we'll see what they say.  Who knows?
