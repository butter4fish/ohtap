Speaker 1: Now, I ask five questions of everyone. They're a little "People Magazine"-ish, so just short answers.  I'd like to know what your favorite food is.
Speaker 2: My favorite food.  That's a real problem for me, because--oh, gosh.  Favorite food.  You know, I don't know.

Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: "If I didn't know better, I'd think I had right, good sense."
Speaker 1: That I haven't heard.  That's a good one.  Okay.  I wouldn't haven't heard that one before.  Okay.
Story_ID: 93931
Speaker 1: We're going to get started.  And I'd like--we're just going to have a conversation.  I'd like you to first talk about your mother.  If you can give her name and, you know, talk about where she was from, and her--you know, her background.
Speaker 2: My mother's first name was Alberta.  Her maiden name was Watson.  She and I were born in the same room, not at the same time, in a house in Lawrence, Kansas, which means neither one of us were born in a hospital.  Alberta was quite a lady.  She did one year of college at the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas], married my dad [George Brown].  We lived on a farm right outside of Lawrence.  And since she got pregnant with me, she had to drop out of school.  She worked at the university for a number of years.  She worked at the--as a cook in fraternity houses and then she had her own restaurant at the local Elks Club.  Everything I ever know or knew came through my mother.  She taught me to read before I was two, so I was home taught.  I lived in an area where they had no schools for black kids, because there weren't enough of us for a school at that time for the class that I was in.  So I did not go to kindergarten, or first nor second.  I started school in the third grade.  And I remember--I don't remember, but my mother tells me that when she took me to school to enter me into the third grade, she was told that I had to go to kindergarten because it was my first year in school.  And, if you knew Alberta, you'd know that Alberta said no way.  And she demanded that they test me.  They took me to the University of Kansas, and I managed to pass tests at the level of a kid at the twelfth grade, even though I was going into the third grade.  So she got her wish.  And I came into public school at the proper level, at the third rather than the kindergarten.  She was a church woman.  She was very loyal to her friends.  She raised the three of us with my dad, of course.  I was lucky that I had both parents.  And just a wonderful lady in all those words.  She was--I can remember she was a member of an organization called the "Queen--" now I've forgotten the name again--but anyway, I always thought of Mom as being a queen.
Story_ID: 93932
Speaker 1: So did she [Alberta Watson Brown] ever talk about her growing up at all?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Mom was--right after she was born, her mother died, and she was raised by an older sister in Lawrence, Kansas.  And her older sister really took care of her, made sure that Mom didn't want for anything, although she started working menial type jobs around Lawrence at a very early age, but she was--she stayed in school; my aunt insisted.  And as a result, when she finished high school, like I said, she went on to college, which was unusual for young black girls at that stage back in 1925.  She--if she had it hard, she never shared that with us.  She always talked to us about the good things.  In fact, my mom is the one that gave me the four philosophies that I have in life today, and the first one is: "don't look back."  Mom said, "Don't ever look back.  There's nothing back there that's going to hurt you now, and if it's gaining, who cares."  The second was "to reach back and pull somebody forward," just as she said she was pulled forward, and certainly there's a lot of people who did that with me.  And the third one was "to give back."  She never had a lot of money, but she gave back a lot of time.  She worked in a lot of different kinds of things.  We were at a university town [University of Kansas]--we lived in a university town, and the university, black students at the university had little or no outlets for any kind of activities.  They would come to our house on Sunday afternoons, particularly the students in the fine arts, the musicians and the vocalists and the like.  And on Sunday afternoon, we'd have--she'd always have a big meal, and the students would come and we'd have concerts right there in our living room.  So there was [HM] Etta Moten [Barnett], Langston Hughes; people like that.  So I had that rich part of my life, too, as a result of her being that kind of lady in the neighborhood.  And a lot of students, obviously many of them, are now dead, but they used to come to me as adults and talk to me about how they had enjoyed coming to our house on Sundays.
Speaker 1: What was the fourth?  Did I miss it?
Speaker 2: The fourth one is that "there's nothing in the morning that I can't do if I just ask God and let him know that I'm willing to also help."
Speaker 1: Now, tell me, was she from Lawrence, Kansas, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: She was born in, like I said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the same house (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Same house.
Speaker 2: --same room.  We were both birthed in the same (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So it was the family home?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your--do you know how the family got towards Kansas?  Do you know that?
Speaker 2: Her family came from--they were slaves in Louisiana.  Watson, a Senator Watson, was the slave master or the owner or whatever.  And Mom's people were in the big house.  They were not field slaves, but they worked in the big house.  And before Senator Watson died, he gave the members in the big house his last name, a little money, and their freedom.  My grandmother--I'm--my grandfather, I am told, took his money and went to St. Louis [Missouri], and he was at the auction block and he saw this black woman and bought her.  And they got married that same day and knew that if they stayed in Missouri, that they could be enslaved again, even though he had his freedom and had bought hers.  In those days (unclear), no matter what kind of papers you had, if somebody wanted to enslave you, you would be.  And they fled in the middle of the night, and they went to Kansas; Kansas being a free state, and they settled in the area of Lawrence.  And, as a result, her sisters and her and her brothers were all born in that area.
Story_ID: 93933
Speaker 1: Your father, can you talk about him?
Speaker 2: My dad was born in a place called Reno, Kansas.  It's about twenty miles away from Lawrence, Kansas.  His mother was a full bred Cherokee Indian.  His father was a mixture of white and a little black; mostly white, apparently, from what I remember of Grandpa, and German.  He--we don't know where he came from, but he went through that wonderful bit of seeing this Indian lady, and she was a very pretty lady, and they fell in love and got married and moved to Reno, and I have no idea how she came up from Oklahoma, but that she did make the march at the Trail of Tears [sic, she would not have been old enough to march in the Trail of Tears] that they forced the Cherokee Indians to come across, and she was just a little baby and she--a little girl--she wasn't a baby.  And she used to tell me the stories of how when they started out her family had a horse.  And she was able to ride the horse for two whole days, and the soldiers decided this was a luxury that an Indian shouldn't have.  They took the horse away from them so that the soldiers could ride the horse, and she walked the rest of the way to Oklahoma.  I have some relatives that came up on that side, stayed in, obviously, on the Reservation.  But she left the Reservation, and my grandmother and they--came to Kansas.  My dad had--was one of twelve children total.  And he just, again, a wonderful man.  He worked as a farmer.  In one stage of his life, he decided he wanted to be a mortician, and he went to the School of Mortuary in Kansas City [Kansas] and started a mortuary business in Kansas City.  My two sisters [Harriet Brown and Laura Brown] were born in Kansas City in '28 [1928] and 1930.  We--I can remember the house.  We--our funeral home was in the front of our home and we lived upstairs and in the back, we had the smell of the embalming fluid all day long and finally you get used to it.  But my mom [Alberta Watson Brown] never did, so she insisted that we moved back to the farm with my grandparents, and we moved back to Lawrence.  He was the kind of man that if that's what his wife wanted to do, he would do that.  So he gave up that profession and went back to farming.  And he, too, worked at the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] as a houseman at a couple of fraternities.  He worked at the--on the campus.  I know people who tell me how much they--I know when he died, I was just amazed at the people that came to his funeral who knew him at the university and admired and loved him.  One fella who was a famous basketball coach came, Dean Smith, who was from North Carolina.  My dad was just a wonderful guy.
Story_ID: 93934
Speaker 1: I can tell you some stories of how when I first knew that he [George Brown] loved me.  Can I tell it?  We had a wood yard, and on Saturdays we'd get there early in the morning, and Dad would cut wood and I would help him.  And then people would come to buy wood.  They'd come with trucks and wagons, and some people even came with baby buggies to buy enough wood to take home.  And on this particular morning, this man came in and he wanted wood and he had a piece of wood that is the exact size that he wanted all of the pieces to be.  They fit right in his stove, according to his story.  And so my dad said to me, you know, "Fill the order."  And he had a pickup truck.  And so I would go and try to find a piece of wood that was that exact size, and I would throw it in the truck.  Well, a few pieces might have been a little big or a little small, and he would call me some sort of name other than my own, which was not all that nice, but that's the way he was, I guess, wanted to impress me that I'd better do right.  And I remember my dad had always told me, you know, "the customer is always right."  And I knew that, so I was trying my darndest to fill the orders.  And must have picked up a piece of wood that really had no--and maybe I did it deliberately, I was a pretty headstrong little fella--and I threw it in, and he called me a "black nigger" and he said that, "I'm gonna"--and he started after me with this piece wood.  The next thing I knew is that my dad was between the two of us.  It just seemed right now that that man went flying through the air.  My dad picked him up, out to the gate, and tossed him out into the street, came back, got in his truck and drove it out in the street where the man was still standing; came back in and he said to me, he says, "Okay.  Get the next."  And he says, "You know, Junior," he says, "the customer is always right, sometimes."  And I never forgot that, and I knew then that my dad really loved me.  But I guess the next thing I remember, I never hugged my dad.  We never had that kind of--we had a real close relationship.  And they told me later when I went into the service that every night my dad would sit out on the back steps to the porch and look up to the moon for an hour or two at a time waiting for me to come back.  And when I came back, he didn't do it anymore as soon as I came out of the service.  And there are many, many, many things that we used to do together; football games, basketball games, baseball games.  He had quite an influence on me, obviously.
Story_ID: 93935
Speaker 1: What kind of person was he [Brown's father, George Brown]?  Can you describe him a little bit more?  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Very strong physically, mentally, spiritually.  He--very loyal.  He didn't drink and he didn't smoke, which obviously influenced my life, 'cause I don't do either.  He--only one time did he come home a little drunk.  It was on a Christmas Eve.  I'll never forget.  And Dad would always have to--he would buy presents for us kids and pay on them.  And then on Christmas Eve, they'd go and make--he'd go in and make the last payment so he could bring the presents home so we'd have them for Christmas morning.  And I can remember we had a--the house--we're still living in the same house that I was born in and that my mom [Alberta Watson Brown] was born in, and it had an upstairs.  And we were upstairs, my sisters and I, and we heard the front door open and my dad's voice sounded a little slurred.  And I learned--later learned from Mom that he was--he'd had something to drink, and they say Indians can't drink; my Dad being half Indian--whatever it was, he was apparently a little drunk.  And the next thing we heard was this crash.  And so we yell, "What happened?  What happened?"  And she said, "Santa Clause just knocked over the Christmas tree."  My mom had pushed him into the tree and knocked it down.  We later found that they had to spend the rest of the night putting that tree back together.  But he was just a wonderful guy.  And when he died, like I said, I was just amazed that the people came for him, a lot of young blacks, who were obviously older than me, and when he died, they were no longer young, but they came to talk about how they would be out of money and my dad would give them money to get by.  And then we had--he had a ball team, and the guys that played on the ball team--that's quite an--quite an accomplishment, too; it was obviously an all-black ball team.  And we played in towns around Lawrence [Kansas] against the--around Kansas against teams that were predominantly white--well, all white.  And we'd go into a town and we'd play and win.  Obviously we were pretty good.  But a lot of the guys talked about the influence that he had on their lives during that time.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the team?
Speaker 2: Just the "Lawrence-- " (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The Lawrence (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --yeah.  I can't remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Is it a farm--what they call farm team?
Speaker 2: No.  No, no.  No, no.
Story_ID: 93936
Speaker 1: Now, how did your parents [Alberta Watson Brown and George Brown] meet?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: In school.  In high school.  My mom (unclear) tells me of their first date, a movie.  And she said all through (unclear) during the movie that he kept putting his hands in his pockets and eating something.  And so she said to herself, "This is one fella, this is the last date I'll have with him because he is so selfish, you know, he's eating candy out of his pocket and he hasn't offered to buy me anything at all, just a ticket to the movies."  And she, a couple of days later, ran across his sister, my aunt Ethel, and she was telling me, said, "You set up that date for us, but, you know, your brother is very selfish.  You know, he, all during the movies, he kept eating."  And she laughed and she said, of course, I remember she used to talk about it later on, my dad loved cornbread, and he had a pocket full of cornbread, and he was eating his crumpled up cornbread, and was--and he later told me he was ashamed that (unclear) offer her any, and he couldn't buy her any popcorn or anything.  And so he was getting carried away at the movie and he'd eat a little bit of pop--of cornbread.  And Mom thought--and then after my aunt Ethel explained, then she said, "Well, maybe it's not all that bad," and that was their first date, and they went on and married.
Story_ID: 93937
Speaker 1: So now, you--did your father [George Brown] ever talk about the day you were born?  Did he ever share that with you?
Speaker 2: My dad, when on the day I was born, he brought a dog home, Spotty.  And Spotty and I grew up together until we were sixteen.  My dad brought that just so I'd have something--somebody, as he used to put it, to be with all the time.  And I can remember even when after I went to school, Spotty would go to school and wait for me to come out and come home.  He--it was like I said, I was born at home, and my dad tells the story as to how he sat out on the front porch, hot in the summer in [Lawrence] Kansas on July 1st, wondering whether or not it's going to be a boy or a girl.  And wondering what he had to do and what he should be doing.  But as he said, the thing that worried him most was that here came this bundle that they talked of joy, he say it as a bundle of work because that meant that he's going to have to work a lot harder to make sure that I got fed and whatever else I needed.
Story_ID: 93938
Speaker 1: Now, did--do you remember what your earliest memory is of growing--you know, of growing up is?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory of growing up, I guess around four--three or five--well, I do remember around--knowing to how to read, two and three; and my mother's sister, my aunt Mae, came to live with us.  And the two of them sat up on Thursday nights.  Every Thursday night, the family would read and--together.  You know, one family member would choose something they wanted to read, and that lasted throughout the--oh, until I was sixteen, when Aunt Mae moved away.  And I can remember those.  And when I wanted to read something pretty difficult, you know, obviously I couldn't, but I could read something really simple.  I always felt inadequate on those Thursday nights, but I can remember those.  I must have been between two and three.  So it goes back a ways.  They tell me a little further than I ought to be able to remember.  But the things I remember more distinctly is when I was about four, on the farm.  I can remember going out into the fields with my mother [Alberta Watson Brown], and the hot sun which I hated, and the dirt and the dust.  I hated farms, by the way.  I can remember my sisters [Harriet Brown and Laura Brown].  When I was four, they were--one was two and the other was just born.  I can remember that I had to push her in the--the baby in the buggy.  'Cause she cried a lot, so they had me pushing her up and down the road to keep her from crying.  But I guess maybe that's about the earliest I can go back.
Story_ID: 93939
Speaker 1: When you think back around that time, are there other sights, smells, or sounds that remind you of growing up, you know, in Lawrence [Kansas]
Speaker 2: No, not really.  It was a happy period, so that anytime I run across anything happy or anybody happy, I sometimes think about lucky I was to have such an upbringing.  But, no, I can't think of--the only thing I can say I remembered about the farms I didn't like, I wanted out as soon as I could; and yet I respected my father [George Brown] because that's the kind of work that he did, that he had to do, I guess is the best way of putting it.  But, I (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Now you were on the farm until what age?  Two (unclear)?
Speaker 2: We moved into the city when I was--we went to the farm school when I was in the third grade.  We moved into the city two years later.  So I was in the fifth grade.
Speaker 1: Give your sisters' names.
Speaker 2: My older sister is Harriet.  My younger sister is Laura.
Speaker 1: You're the oldest?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: You're the oldest.  So did they look up to you like a typical--I mean, you were--were you the king of the household since you were the appointed son?
Speaker 2: Yes, definitely.  And--although my younger sister was spoiled, I was not spoiled.  She was the spoiled one in the family.  My middle--my sister, the middle child, was--she was the one that just had to push along on her own, and I realize this now.  But, yeah, I was--all the family sort of kowtowed to my--to me.  And my family had more women than men, by the way.  It was my dad and me and my uncle Sam.
Speaker 1: And I noticed you have four girls, too.  Right?  Did you--do you have four girls?
Speaker 2: I have four daughters.
Speaker 1: Four daughters.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 93940
Speaker 1: I want to ask, what--of that growing up, are there other stories you would like to share about sort of that period of time, you know, still before you moved in--you know, into town?  Are there other memories?  Or was it--when you moved into town, did people, like, [HM] Etta Moten [Barnett] and things were coming in?  Or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's--after we moved back into the--into town, and we definitely moved.  We moved away from the family home, where we were born, to the farm where my grandparents lived; and then we moved back to the same house.  And I can remember when we--I was in the third grade and admitted into the school, and it was a black school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Can you give the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Lincoln [Elementary School].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember the teacher, Mrs. Newman (sp), had a procedure every morning.  We were in one room, rows.  Sixth grade was run with fifth grade right down to kindergarten.  And Harriet was in kindergarten, and I was in the third grade.  And so Mrs. Newman would call the row.  And she'd start at the bottom, kindergarten; and she'd call the kid's name, and I remember was Henry Allen [ph].  She'd call Henry Allen.  And you were supposed to stand up and say, "I am here."  You know, the thing she would say, "Henry Allen," and you'd stand up and say, "I'm here."  Well, poor Henry was probably retarded, but a nice kid, I guess.  And he would stand up and he stuttered horribly, and he would say "ah, ah, ah, ah, ah"--and then wet on himself, every morning without fail and would have to be immediately excused.  The next person was Harriet Brown.  She'd say, "Harriet Mae Brown."  And Harriet would just sit there.  And she'd say, "Harriet Mae Brown."  And she'd do it three times, and say, "Well, I guess Harriet's--I got no response."  Then she'd go on to the next kid, and then she'd come up the rows.  So I--I remember going home and telling my mother [Alberta Watson Brown], I said, "Mom, it's so embarrassing.  My sister just sits there.  First Henry wets on himself, and then she doesn't say anything at all."  I said, "It's just embarrassing."  And so Mom said, "Harriet, come in here."  I can remember this so vividly.  And she says, "Harriet, why is it that you don't answer Miss Newman when she calls the roll?"  And Harriet had a deep voice, and she said, "She's sees me."  And that's the way she would--goes through life.  "You see me, and then there's no need for any further--or what the heck, I'm here, you see me.  I don't have to say anything." And--well, then, I became very protective of my sister then, because I knew she--I saw her, too.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--did you like school immediately?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I--being taught at home made me like learning, and I wanted to learned I wanted the opportunity to go into school, since I wasn't--hadn't be able to go. Probably also one of the most disappointing things in my life was the fact that there so little that I was taught.  There were--I wanted to learn a lot more than they put on the table for the third grade or the fourth grade or the fifth grade or whatever.  I always felt like I wanted to know more than what was (unclear).  So I did a lot of studying outside of school, which meant that I almost always the head of my class scholastically, and I enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: Did you mother know that--did she talk later about seeing something in our or knowing that you were smart?
Speaker 2: Oh, they oft told me I was smart probably, And sometimes they used it in--not all that positive way.  But -- yeah, she tells me the stories without how when I was growing up that they went to--for breakfast.   I was just a youngster then, just a toddler, I guess and they didn't to give me bacon or anything like that.  And so they would give me a piece of bread.  And they told me that was bacon without the rest of the family was eating.  And one day, Mom said she had the plate of bacon a little close, and then without her knowing it, I had reached and got a piece.  And she said from that day, there was no way they were going to fool me with anything other than the real bacon.  But--no, I was--they--everybody in the family thought I was kind of smart."
Story_ID: 93693
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little--a little bit more about sort of life on the farm, the things that were your sort of favorite activities and things that you didn't like.
Speaker 2: Well, I tell people that I was a slave.  And you define a slave as somebody who works from sun up to sundown, they don't get paid but they get fed; you get clothing, no shoes in the summer because there's no need for shoes; and they let you go to school only because there's no way to take care of you otherwise until you're old enough that you can stay on the--out in the field for twenty-four hours a day.  So my dad [George Brown] was a slave master, but obviously, he was a good one.  I can remember we would--we'd start--during harvest season, they would draw--the owners of the farms in the area would draw as to what the order that they would harvest the crops.  And they would go from one farm to the next so that everybody got their crops harvested with a full crew coming from each family.  And I can remember the noon period, the women at the--each farm tried to outdo the others for the lunch, the wonderful lunches that they would fix.  I can remember-- I hate snakes.  I can remember snakes in Kansas being I'd pick up what I thought was a potato vine and it would start wriggling and it was one of those snakes.  So I can remember pitching hay, and when you pitch hay from below up on a wagon, the heavy--the lightest hay goes onto the wagon; the heavier things fall down, and snakes were the heavier things and they're caught coming down on top of you.  But mostly I remember the sun. I'm allergic.  I was always allergic.  I can remember sneezing most of the summer.  I can remember the sun, and I suffered from heat.  I remember, though, that the food was something that I loved.  I always can remember I ate--one of my chores was to feed the animals, and we had pigs, we raised pigs to take to the market; we raised chickens; we had horses; we a couple of cows.  I can remember the slaughter days when we would slaughter the pigs.  And I would have fed them up to that point, and I'd give them names, so it was like friends of mine, even though they were root around me.  And so I couldn't eat meat for a long time because it was like eating one of your relatives if you had already named the pig (unclear), you know.  And I can remember what I call the evolution of my farm life.  I started out--it's the potato field that I remember most.  My dad had a-- an oxen, a very slow oxen, which would pull the plow and he'd walk on behind it.  And we'd come along behind him and we would pick the potatoes.  And then he got a mule, and then he got two mules, and he got a horse.  And each time, you know, that meant that the plow was moving a little faster.  Then he got a tractor.  And first, the tractor was a side digger, and it would throw the dirt up, but only partially, so that you had to dig for the potatoes.  It didn't really pull them all up on top.  Then he got a digger that would pull the dirt through on some sort of tray, band or something; and the potatoes would be on top.  It was a lot easier picking.  And then one day, my dad came driving into the yard with a new trailer--a new tractor and it had headlights.  And I said, "This man intends to work me until midnight now since he can see with those headlights, obviously."  Then--but I can remember that was the first reaction. (Unclear)  He can really plow all day and all night now with that darn headlights.  Shortly thereafter, I went into the service, but--and I don't think that was the reason, but I like to kid and say that was the reason I decided I was going to get off the farm for life.  And, of course, when I came out of the service, they were no longer on the farm.

Speaker 1: Now, what--what was the young George like?  What were you?  An introspective person?  Were you mischievous?  Were you...?
Speaker 2: I read a lot, and I was very good in sports.  I was in high school, I was all-state in basketball; in track; I was good in football.  But I loved to read.  I used to like to listen to the radio.  I can remember those radio programs in those days.  Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy; the Mysteries (unclear); and The Green Hornet, and all that stuff.  I guess I read, maybe, to live some of the fantasies that, you know, that I thought I'd never probably get to and to get them through books.  I still read a lot, and I love to read.  I--yeah, I did it, little devilish things.  I don't remember them all, but I'm sure I did quite a few.  And having the flexibility and the freedom as the only boy, I would get my chores done and then disappear.  And I would do that deliberately.  I'd go somewhere--usually I'd go off and read, go out into the field and sit and read.  And my sisters [Harriet Brown and Laura Brown] had the inside duties.  I used to laugh, and a little later on in life and I said, "My mom [Alberta Watson Brown] was a--she didn't have all the modern conveniences of--that the ladies have today, but she did have two dishwashers," and those were my sisters, of course.  But, yeah, I'm sure I did a lot of things that were not all that nice.  I was not bad.  Don't get me wrong.  I didn't do evil things.  I didn't want to hurt anybody.  I can remember one time when I thought about hurting someone.  My dad [George Brown] would take me hunting, but I wouldn't shoot because I didn't want to kill anything.  And, yet, I'd go with him because I wanted to.  And he was a great hunter, and a good hunter.  But one time, two friends and I, we were out and we had our guns, and we didn't (unclear).  We were looking for rabbits, and I think they got a couple of rabbits or something.  We came back to town, there was a farmer who lived on the other side of town, who came in and told my dad that we had shot through his house.  We hadn't.  We weren't even in the area.  I remember my dad taking my gun and saying, you know, "That's just something you can't do."  Well, I didn't mind him taking the gun.  He didn't know that wasn't--for me that wasn't punishment, you know, that was like throwing the rabbit in the rye bush.  He could have that darn gun.  But I always had--well, not always, but for a while, you know, I had this little feeling in my heart of evilness for this man who decided that we were the three kids, and he knew we weren't, that had shot through his house.  We had to figure a way to get even.  And we eventually did.  A few years later, we worked out a pulley system, and in the middle of the night, we hoisted his horse up to the top of the roof of his barn, and then took the pulley away.  And when he got up the next morning, there was his horse up there.  And actually, he-- the horse was in loft and the wagon was up on top.  And he--they never knew who did that.  And I'm probably now making my confession, but I'm sure there's nobody alive that age who would do anything or remember anything about it.
Speaker 1: That poor horse must have been traumatized.
Speaker 2: I think the horse was happy there.
Speaker 1: (Laughs,)
Speaker 2: We left hay up there, and he probably didn't have to work that day 'til they figured a way to get him down (laughs).
Speaker 1: What did you like to read, though?
Speaker 2: Everything.
Speaker 1: Everything.
Speaker 2: If it was good, I read everything.  I read comic books to [William] Shakespeare.   If it was good, I--a lot of westerns; a lot of short, short stories.  I'd want to read things and get through them, so I read a lot of short things.  And I might be reading two or three books at the same time.
Story_ID: 93695
Speaker 1: Now you just--chronologically, you went to Lincoln Elementary [Lawrence, Kansas].  Right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And then to McAlister [Grade School in Lawrence Kansas].   When we moved into the city, I went to McAlister.
Speaker 1: McAlister was what?
Speaker 2: Was the elementary school.
Speaker 1: Was there any (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Went there until the sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Sixth grade.
Speaker 2: And then we had a junior high, and I went there for the seventh, eighth and ninth grades; and then to Liberty Memorial High School [now Lawrence High School in Lawrence, Kansas] for the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth; and I was just inducted in my high school Hall of Fame last year.  So I feel very good about that.
Story_ID: 93696
Speaker 1: Now, were you--did you--I know you read.  Were you writing at all during any of this?
Speaker 2: I was not.  No.  In fact, getting into writing was quite a, quite an accident.  When I came out of the service [U.S. Army], I was--wanted to be an aeronautical engineer.  I only knew how to do one thing and that was fly an airplane.  And the war [World War II] was over, and, of course, I wanted out and they didn't want us.  And if you wanted to continue flying, you could join the Air Force in South Africa or South America.  I don't remember the countries.  Or you would do a lot of, you know, private kinds of flying, which was not all that safe or good.  So I decided to go to the School of Engineering, and I started in the [University of Kansas] School of Engineering [Lawrence, Kansas] and my grades were very high.  And I was called in by my counselor and told that I should look for another school of study, because in those days they had a, as he explained it to me, they had a quota at the schools of engineering, because everybody who came back from the service--not everybody but most of the guys--wanted to be engineers and they were going to schools of engineering, and only so many were going to graduate because they didn't want to dilute the industry or the profession, rather, with a bunch of engineers.  And if I had stayed and kept my grades up, and just, we'll say for numbers--and they were to be ten to be graduated from that School of Engineering, that meant that a white boy would have to be dropped off as the eleventh if I stayed on the list; and yet, as he explained to me, I couldn't get a job as an engineer.  I could go to the post office as a lot of guys did who came out of the service with me and went to the post office and the like.  And as I was sitting there, I said to him, I said, "What can I do to get out of this place, you know, sure as I'd been in school two years?"  And he said, "Well, here's a list of studies where you can get a degree, a bachelor of science or whatever."  And journalism just popped out.  And I--Gail was a baby, and I knew that I had to do something if I couldn't do--so I said, "I'll take that."  I said, "How--" and he said, "Another semester."  So I went through four years and two and a half years I went to summer also.  And I got my degree as a Bachelor of Science in Journalism [in 1950].  It was the first time that I had thought about writing anything at all.  And, well, I guess I must have been very good.  But I also came at a time when there weren't a lot of us coming out, and, yet, Jackie Robinson was coming out in sports.  It was a sort of general feeling that the profession of journalism, newspapers ought to cover blacks.
Story_ID: 93697
Speaker 1: I had sixteen different job offers.  Many of my classmates had none or very few.  But they were strange offers.  Like, one newspaper said that I could cover the black community, and I could, on Thursdays, I'd have two pages, which all the black news would be run; another one on Sunday or so forth.  The one that sounded intriguing was the "Denver Post."  And, yet, their response to me was that they wanted me to come out for an interview.  And I'd put that aside immediately and then wrote them a short little letter saying, "Thank you, but that I couldn't afford to just run around the country on interviews.  I had to have a definite offer."  And I got a wire back--telegram back almost immediately as soon as they received it saying that, they're sorry that they had really meant that they were going to pay my way out.  And so I went out to Denver [Colorado] for an interview, and I got there--it's another story.  I get--took the train out, and I got to Denver, stayed at the "Y," and I went over to the newspaper the first thing in the--the next morning.  And I go up to the second floor, which is where the editor's department was.  And the editor and publisher was a guy named [Edwin] Palmer Hoyt, whom I was supposed to go see; and [Edmund] Ed Dooley was the city editor.  And so there was this lady at the reception desk as you get off the elevator, and I said, "I'd like to see Mr. Palmer Hoyt."  And she said, "Who are you?"  And I gave her my name, and she says, "What do you want?"  I says, "Well, I here to see about a job."  And she says, "Well, I know we're not hiring anybody."  And I said, "Oh?"  And she says, "And I don't have any note that you have an interview scheduled."  You can just-- I was devastated.  So I went back down to the first floor and standing in the lobby, and the "Denver Post" had just opened a new building, and they had tours and I saw this tour forming and they were going to take them through the plants so they could see how newspaper was made.  And since I didn't know how newspaper was made, I said, "Well, I guess I may as well do that and figure out when I'm going to go back home."  So I joined the tour, and we went through.  And when we got up to the second floor, we came through the back door, and I was right in the middle of the newsroom and, of course, I recognized the newsroom from my short stint at the--on the college paper at the university.  And so I saw a fellow, and so I went up to him and I said, "I need to talk to Mr. Hoyt or Mr. Dooley."  He says, "Well, I'm Mr. Dooley."  He said that, "Who are you?"  I said, "George Brown."  He said, "Where have you been?"  He says, "We've been expecting you.  You were supposed to be here this morning."  I said, "Well, I've been trying to get in here to see and Mr. Hoyt."  So they said, "Well, we're off to lunch."  And they took me to the press club for lunch and we talked.  And by 1:30, we had decided that I was going to come to work for the "Denver Post."  They were going to treat me like any other reporter, which is what I wanted.  I didn't want any special treatment.  I was going to sign as a cub reporter.  They did give me a little more pay than they gave most cubs that came on at that time.  And that was the beginning of my journalistic career.
Speaker 2: That's a pretty amazing story.
Story_ID: 93698
Speaker 1: I want to go back to your being in high school [Liberty Memorial High School, now Lawrence High School, in Lawrence, Kansas], and I'm wondering, were you someone who was fascinated when flying, or planes?
Speaker 2: No.  I was very good in math.  I had no desire to do any flying.  And I thought about driving a truck.  I never thought about flying airplanes. I can see an airplane, but it was an airplane.  I had never been close enough to touch an airplane, let alone fly one.  When I decided--and a friend and I, we had--we went to a movie, and we'd double-dated.  And we--this movie was about fighter pilots, guy named John Payne was the star.  Nobody--I never heard of John Payne as a movie star.  And they were shooting down the enemy planes, you know.  I was nice.  And so afterwards, we get in the car, and he had the car--he had his parents' car--and the girl I was with, we took the backseat and we're riding along.  He said, "You know," he says to the girl in front, and he says, "George and I are going to enlist.  We're going to be pilots.  We're going to go fight the war."  And so I'm sitting--it's a girl behind me says, "Really?"  I said, "Oh, yeah.  You know, what the heck."  Anything to make her think that I was a great guy, you know, I'm a little different.  And so we had our double date that night and he took me home after we took the girls home and I went to bed, and the next morning, he comes up to the door, you know, and he says, "You know, we're going to join the Air Force."  I said, "No.  What you talking about?"  He said, "Remember, we said we were gonna fight the war?"  I said, "Well, okay.  If that's what you think we have to do."  You had to go to Kansas City [Kansas] to join the service.  And I was eighteen years old, I'll never forget.  I was--in fact, we had gone on my birthday on the date, which was July 1st [1944].   And so we went to Kansas City, went to the Recruiting.  He knew all--he had done all the--his homework, so he knew exactly where to go.  We went in and they gave us some exam.  And when the exam was over, they brought us both in, and the recruiting officer said, "Well, you understand that you cannot enter the Aviation Program, Cadet Program if you've been drafted or if you've received your draft notice.  You have to volunteer, clearly volunteer."  And he said, "Have you received your draft notice?"  The other fella said, "No," and I said, "Yes.  I got it in the mail yesterday.  He said, "Well," he said, "No.  You scored one of the highest scores that's ever been made of anybody trying to recruit into the Aviation Cadet."  He says, "I'll tell you again."  He says, "If you've received your draft notice, you cannot volunteer for the program."  He says, "Have you received your draft notice?"  I said, "Yes.  I received it yesterday."  He says, "Should I try it again?"  I'm saying, "Well, you know, I'm telling the truth.  I received it yesterday," and actually I wasn't all that gung ho about going to fly anywhere anyway.  Maybe the war would be over by the time they got to me on the draft side.  And he says, "I'll you what."  He said, "You were here on June the 30th."  And I said, "Uh-huh."  So he dated our papers June 30.  And we went back home to Lawrence [Kansas], and we were greeted as heroes among our friends and the girls.   We were off to be pilots, and I began to get a little, you know, nicer.  I thought about this.  I thought this might be a pretty good way to be a hero of some sort.
Story_ID: 93699
Speaker 1: And then or maybe a couple weeks or so later, we were--everybody came to the buses station to see us off to [Fort] Leavenworth [Kansas].  You had to go to Leavenworth for the-- were you were inducted. And he and I went to Leavenworth, and they put us through the line, we got our clothing, and when we got to the end of the line and the guy said--the other guy, and I'd rather not use his name now--he said to me, 'cause he didn't go any further, but he said--says, "You take the bus over there and they'll take you to the center," and he says, "And you, I don't know what to do with."  "What do you mean you don't know what to do with me?"  He said, "Well, you're the first colored fella to come through here."  The other guy was white, obviously.  And so he was saying, "No, wait a minute.  We're here together.  We're gonna fight this war together."  And the guy says, "I don't know what you two young boys think, but you can't--you won't train together.  You'll train separately."  Well, that was my first knowledge that that would be something, and I had--I knew nothing about Tuskegee [Airmen in Tuskegee, Alabama].  I'd read a little bit, but it wasn't anything that (unclear) I didn't really much about it.  And it hadn't been that much anyway about black pilots in particular in the papers that I would see there in Lawrence and Kansas City.  And so I spent the first day--they finally found a place and they put me in a barracks where everybody in there could not read or write except me, and they were young, "colored" in those days, negro boys from Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma.  And so I--I'm saying "Mama, will you help--can't you come get me?  You know, whatever I've done, where is my mama?"  And so I decide to write a letter to Fern, who was my girlfriend, and I sat down to write a letter, and one of the guys came over and he said, "Can you write?"  I said, "Yes."  He said, "Can you read?"  I said, "Yes."  He said, "Will you do me a favor?"  He says, "Got a letter from my girlfriend," and he says, "I can't read or write."  And he said, "Will you read to me?"  So read him a letter that she was writing about their last night together and the things in it were just, you know, about how intimate they were.  And then he says, "Well, would you write a letter back for me?"  And so I took the letter.  Well, then I look up and there's a line of guys all wanting the same thing.  So I spent two days reading and writing letters to young black soldiers who couldn't read or write until finally my orders came through that I was to go to Biloxi, Mississippi, where we took preflight training.  But, I--and I can remember that evening when, I said, "Mama, where are you?  Can't you come get your son?  I have made a big mistake.  I don't want to fly.  I don't want to fight, and all I want to do is go home.  I'll even work on the farm."  We were no longer living on the farm, but I'd do anything.  And so I know I didn't grow up wanting to be a pilot.  That came later in life.  But after I got into it, oh, it's a love that I'll never ever give up.
Story_ID: 93700
Speaker 1: Now, what were your favorite sports in high school--you said you were all-around (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Football, basketball and track.  I did not play ball--hardball with my dad's [George Brown] team because he felt like (laughs) he couldn't show favoritism.  So I'd get the worst position, you know, and they'd sit me on the bench, even though I was better than some of the guys that were playing.  So I didn't--that was one of my favorite sports, but I went from the seasons.  In those days, the seasons were separate.  You played football in the fall.  You played basketball in the winter, and you had track in the spring; unlike now where they overlap, you know, and you're playing basketball year round and football that goes into the basketball season and the like.
Story_ID: 93701
Speaker 1: Now, when it came--you know, when you're thinking about--well, you got--you got drafted--right.  You got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I enlisted (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: You said you enlisted.
Speaker 2: --I was never drafted.  I was not drafted to see the--he accepted me.  He predated my papers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which meant that I was then enlisting in the service [United States Army] as opposed to being drafted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was really your first time away.  Right?
Speaker 2: First real time away from home.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I had been at that stage--my dad [George Brown] and I had gone to baseball games in St. Louis [Missouri].  That was the Kansas City--the black baseball league [Negro League Baseball].  We'd go to games.  One of his sisters lived in Chicago [Illinois], and he and I have driven to Chicago.  But most of the thing--the only thing I knew about was Chicago, Kansas City, St. Louis and Lawrence.  I had been nowhere else.  I read about the rest of the country, but nowhere else.
Speaker 1: And you said you were--where was your--you were (unclear)--you went to Tuskegee.  Right?
Speaker 2: Went first to Biloxi (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: To Biloxi.
Speaker 2: --Mississippi.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Wonderful Biloxi, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that was another experience.
Speaker 1: Well, that's what I wanted to (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I arrived (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: How long (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --well, I arrived late at night.  And I get off the train, I'm by myself.  I'm the only one that came in that direction.  I'd had an experience in Indiana.  I had a Pullman reservations from the [U.S] Army, orders, from Leavenworth up to some place in Indiana, and then south to Biloxi.  When we got to the place in Indiana, the porter came and told me that I had to move up to the first car.  And so I get my bag and I into the first car, and it's a chair car, you know, and it's open windows.  And I said, "No.  They made a mistake."  So I go back and I tell him, you know, "I--my orders say that I got, you know, the Pullman space that I rode from Leavenworth to here in, and that's what I'm supposed to be in."  He said, "No, young man."  He said, "You're supposed to ride where I told you to go."  I said, "But, no.  You know, I've got these orders that say I gotta ride in the--back here."  And he says, "Well," he says, "you can do one of two things."  He said, "You can go up front and ride or you can stand out there on the platform."  So I said, "Okay."  So the train took off and I'm standing on the platform.  And it was the first I had ever seen "Colored" waiting signs for the rooms that--the waiting areas.  I had enough sense to know that I wasn't supposed to go in the white's, but--so I went in the "Colored" and I sat down.  And I guess I was quite a problem for that little town because the colored people come and look through the window at this crazy guy sitting in there.  The white people would come to the window that's between the two sections, they'd look in at this guy sitting in there.  Nobody wouldn't even talk to me.  And finally some MPs showed up and they told me, they said, "Look," he said, "if you don't want to go to the brig, you'd better get on the next train and travel."  I realized that I had no choice.  So the next train came through, I rode in the Jim Crow car south, which was a wonderful experience.  I was raised as to being a gentleman, so that--black people in those days rode the train like you ride a streetcar today, you know.  They get on and they'd ride two or three miles or maybe five miles, and they'd get off.  So we started out, and they'd all--fill up the cars.  I saw a woman get on, I'd stand up and let her have my seat.  Well, after a half a day of standing, I'm getting a little tired of this, so I started to play the game of pretend--when that train would start to slowing down to stop, I'd go to sleep, you know, I'd shut my eyes like I was sleep so I didn't see women getting on until I was down the road a piece.  And I remember at one point I heard this woman say, "Would you mind holding these for me, soldier."  It was--and flopped in my lap was a box of baby chickens.  And in those days, you bought baby chickens, and they took them home and raised them.  And, of course, the box was covered with chicken crap on the bottom.  And so she got off down the road, she said, "Thank you."  And she picked it up.  Well, now, I've got a khaki outfit on, and it's the (unclear) coming through; and now I've got a lapful of chicken crap.  And so when I got in Biloxi that night, I must have looked like I don't know what. I get off the train, I'm standing by myself with a duffel bag, and now what do I do?  And once again, I called for Mama [Alberta Watson Brown] and she wasn't there.  And this guy walks up and he's got these PFC [Private First Class] stripes that have been tacked on, so I knew they weren't permanent.  And he said, "Who are you?  Cadet Brown?"  I said, "Yes."  And he said, "Soldier, are you Cadet Brown?"  I said, "Yes."  He said, "Soldier."  Oh, and then I--I said, "Yes, sir."  He says, "All right."  He says, "Well, got to go back to the base."  And he said, "Forward. March."  I'm saying, "What's this fool talking about, 'forward, march.'  I--just me.  So I--he says, "You can come."  I says, "What?"  He said, "Pick it up."  So we--he marches me back out to Biloxi, to the airbase, which was not right there.  And the next morning, I get up, I go out and I sit on the steps in front of the barracks, and all young black guys who there and had been there before me.  And they were looking.  One says, "There goes a B-24."  And I looked in the air, "Yeah.  What's a B-24?"  I didn't have the slightest idea what--you know, some of them had had some flight experience.  And then I knew I was in the wrong place.  I said, "I don't know nothing about flying.  All these young black guys are sharp, you know, and maybe they--whatever they didn't know they pretended to know, and they made a show of knowing it."  I didn't know nothing.  I knew then I'd made another mistake.  Now, here I am in Biloxi.  Didn't even know where Biloxi was.
Story_ID: 93941
Speaker 1: So you end up going on to Tuskegee [Moten Field, the Tuskegee Army Air Field, in Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: And tell me, what--and there's-there're--how many are leaving from--are there 70 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Class of 72.
Speaker 1: Two.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there's 72 of you going on to Tuskegee.
Speaker 2: Going in for--actually it was preflight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was basic; preflight; primary; basic, and basic training, which is different than basic in flying; and then advanced and then graduation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so who were some of the people that were there with you?
Speaker 2: Wendell Pruitt.  I remember he was, of course, killed after he came back.  All of the first group that went over, like, Benjamin Davis and the like, they would combat returnees--they were back.  The--well, all the guys who'd gone earlier were back home, and then the ones that had left and gone on to replace them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever come across--let's see.  There's a [HM] Colonel [William R.] Bill Thompson.  Do you know that name?
Speaker 2: The name's familiar.
Speaker 1: Or [HM] John Rogers, Sr.
Speaker 2: John Rogers out of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: --Chicago?
Speaker 1: Mmhm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And there's another fella out of--gosh.  Name some, I have senior moments on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The names used a long suit for me and I now have to think about it.  But there were several guys in Chicago.
Story_ID: 93942
Speaker 1: But can we talk about your math prowess, you know, because, you know, how that came--
Speaker 2: Just came natural.  I don't know what it was, but--well, I--when I went to high school [Liberty Memorial High School, now Lawrence High School, in Lawrence, Kansas] from junior high, they had courses that went two different ways; vocational and college prep.  At that point, almost all of the black and the farm and the poor white and the Hispanic kids were put automatically in the vocational.  And white kids with influence, middle class and up, were put in the college prep classes.  I was in woodwork, metalwork, and printing.  And so I was flunking woodwork because you had to make a windmill and also a matchbox.  Well, the matchbox was all out of shape, and the windmill didn't work.  The tin cut that I made in metalwork never--it leaked from the beginning.  And in the printing class, my, you know, handset--I wasn't doing all that well.  And so there was a professor who decided that he had known what I was doing in junior high and that I'd shown some sort of ability in math, 'cause I can remember that one day he was putting a plant--a problem on the blackboard, and he was working it from memory.  You know, math is a lot by rote, if you're not careful.  And he was working when he forgotten how to get to the bottom line.  Well, I had gotten there before he did, and I was feeling very proud of myself, and I knew that I could beat him to the bottom line on that particular problem.  And so he apparently--and I don't know how true this is--but I've heard later from one of the teachers that I had who taught me German in high school, that he had gone to the principal and said, "Look, there's this kid over there in the vocational class who has no business there.  I know he's good.  I know he's--he reads and he's-- ought to be over in the college prep side."  And my mom [Alberta Watson Brown] was feeling the same way, although my mom wanted me to be in fine arts.  I had a pretty good voice, and I sang in the choir at church and I sang during that summer before in nightclubs outside of Kansas City [Kansas] making a little extra money.  And my--like I said, nothing worked in those classes where I was doing things with my hands.  So they transferred me and put me in the college prep, and I never looked back.  My dad [George Brown] told me years later, he said he wondered when they told him that I wasn't doing well, he says, "There's something wrong, 'cause he works perfect."  We used to help a house, we'd put on additions at the house, and I could do a lot of things.  But, apparently, subconsciously or deliberately--I'll never know which--I didn't want to succeed.  And I didn't.  I wouldn't have.  But I got in the college prep, and then I did--in my--between my--in my junior year and part of my senior year in college [sic, high school], I went to classes at the university [University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas] --they had that program--but they were fine arts classes.  My mom had a great desire for me to become an opera singer or something like that.  And I guess if I hadn't gone into the service, I would have been dead long ago because I would have starved to death by not making enough money trying to sing somewhere.  But--
Story_ID: 93943
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna also go back on the [HM] Etta Moten [Barnett] because you talked about that and Langston Hughes.  And I want to know who was coming through your place and what your memory is.
Speaker 2: I don't remember too many names, but they were all fine art students for the most part.  That was the most line of study you were going to teach, and in the fine arts you're in the college; for liberal arts, there were very few blacks at that stage going into the other kinds of professions.  There were some obviously looking into medicine, but not there at the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas], or med schools that they were going to like Howard [University in Washington, D.C.] and the like.  But so that most of my association with college people were with those who were in the fine arts field.  And like I said, they would come, and I guess they felt like they'd entertain for their dinner because they put on quite a--I mean, Sunday afternoons were quite a delight, some of the best artists that I'm sure ever lived were there as fine arts students.  And they would come and play the violins and the cellos and pianos and sing and read poetry; and it was quite a--quite an education in itself for a young guy.
Speaker 1: Now University of Kansas--was it integrated or was it black?  (unclear)
Speaker 2: It was integrated.
Speaker 1: Because I think I remember her [HM Etta Moten Barnett] talking about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: She had to find a place off campus.
Speaker 2: That's right.  They could not live in--there was no--most of the dormitories--most of the campus living were fraternities and sororities; and, of course, blacks didn't belong to those.  The Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi] had one and Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta]--in fact, my mother was a Delta mother.  And the Deltas had a home on the campus, and the Alphas [Alpha Kappa Alpha] had a home so that some students could stay in those two places.  But most of the rest of the students stayed with the families.
Story_ID: 93944
Speaker 1: Now back when you're in Tuskegee [Moten Field, the Tuskegee Army Air Field, in Tuskegee, Alabama], you were there how long?
Speaker 2: Well, I have to count it up.  There were ten weeks for each one; preflight, primary, a full forty weeks, and then the war [World War II] was winding down, so they were getting rid of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--so you, at this point, return home.
Speaker 2: Went back home, and I immediately joined the Fifty-Two Twenty Club, 'cause I went down to get a job and the lady said--very nice lady--she says, you know, "Well, what do you do?"  I said, "I fly an airplane."  She says, "We're not going to find a job for you.  You better make sure you get in the Fifty-Two Twenty."  That was 52 weeks at $20 a week while they tried to find a job for you.  And so I signed up for the Fifty-One, and you had to go in each week and sign up.  And so when--and see if there was a job for you.  But she was a nice lady.  I remember that.  She said to me, she says, "Don't accept a job."  Says, "Once you accept a job, then you are then no longer restricted just to what you know how to do, because then you got to take any other job that they offer you."  I said, "Okay."  So I was determined to get my fifty-two.  In the meantime, the school started, so I decided I just might as well go back to school and so I can get the G.I. Bill.  And so I enrolled at the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] and dropped the Fifty-Two Twenty sessions and started living then on the G.I. Bill for the next two and a half, three years, 'til I got out of school.
Speaker 1: Now, what made you--this is--I know you said that you just happened--not happened, but you didn't know you were going to write, but you majored in journalism.  Right?
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: So how did that come about?
Speaker 2: That came about when I went through the experience at the engineering school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then that--right.
Speaker 2: And then that started my journalistic career.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  And did you find--but you could have chosen English (unclear).  Was there an English major?
Speaker 2: Teaching, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I didn't want to be a teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And so really journalism at that time was a burgeoning field, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: Not quite.
Speaker 2: --and maybe, yeah, it was maybe.  It was because--and mostly sports.  I mean they were directing us into sports.  I was just lucky that I found the opportunity, and that's been the story of my life.  I'm not one of those guys who set out to be a pilot.  I was not one of those guys who set out to be a journalist.  I was not one of those guys who set out to be a politician.  Things just happened, and I was very lucky and was there at the right time with the right skills or abilities to learn.  But, no, it was--and most of the kids, like I say, they were--were going to be teachers or going into medicine and, you know, or something like that.  Law.  I thought of law.  I started out--I took some prelaw classes, but those would have taken a lot longer than the four years that I got in two and a half years for journalism.
Speaker 1: Now, you--were there other things about experience at the university that were important in terms of your maturation in your experience or--?
Speaker 2: University.  Well, like I say, I went into journalism, and after that first two years of taking pre-engineering classes.  And then after that, then there was the--next was the half a year of getting out of school so I could get a job.  And, like I said, we had a baby.  Gail was already born and I needed to get out and--so I spent my time getting out of school.
Speaker 1: Now, you had--let's talk about getting--you got married when?  When--
Speaker 2: I got married--now I got to think about the year, 1949, I guess it was.
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-nine.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Your wife's named Modeen.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: This is my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: First.  Okay.
Speaker 2: --second marriage.  My first wife was Carolyn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 93945
Speaker 1: And so you're--so what are your thoughts about what you want to do?  Was that--and how did you end up in Denver [Colorado]?  See this is what I'm--
Speaker 2: That's when--you remember I had all the job offers.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And Denver [the "Denver Post"] was the one that was the most appealing.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was the one that said that they would--you know, I would not get any special privileges; that I'd have to come and be--and work my way in.  All the others had--certain (unclear) you know, it's going to be special to cover the black boys.  They're all covering-- are sports.  And I didn't want to really write sports.  I wanted to participate in sports.  I didn't want to write about them.  And, like I say, the Denver one sounded appealing, and so I really wanted to go there.  And when they said to come on, I went.  And like I said, over lunch I decided this is where I wanted to be.  And they decided I was the person they wanted, and I never looked back.
Speaker 1: You know, with--did--you know, a lot of blacks went to Denver, because they--it was the new type of place.
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: Or that's what I'm finding, that they were leaving to go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --some other place to be there.  And, I'm just wondering--but it sounded like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I only went because that's where the job was.
Speaker 1: --it sounded like Kansas was a decent place to live and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: There were no job opportunities.  When I was in--they had classes in journalism during that one semester where you could go work for the "Topeka Daily Capital" [sic, Topeka Capital-Journal] in Topeka [Kansas] or the "Kansas City Post" in Kansas City [Kansas] as a student.  And I--they didn't even offer, even though they saw me and saw my writing, like--I didn't get any job offers from either of those.  So I had no job offers in Kansas.  I had them in Connecticut, New York, Chicago [Illinois], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], St. Louis [Missouri], Denver [Colorado]; but, you know, it was nothing--like, Kansas was not a place that was going to stay; plus, Kansas was where I was born, and I was--somebody once said "how could you live in Kansas and expect anything to change," and that's probably true.
Story_ID: 93946
Speaker 1: How was your ex--Did you-- you--was it like a fish finding water when you first start writing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, working?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Definitely.  I immediately enjoyed it when I went into the School of Journalism, the William Allen White School of Journalism [and Mass Communications at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas].  It was something that I knew that I was going to be good at and something that I knew I'd like.  And then when I went to the newspaper ["Denver Post"], I started as a cub reporter on the police beat.  And it was fun competing against another paper in the city.  And then I moved up.  I became an aviation editor and then night city editor, then assistant city editor; and then is when I moved into politics, or actually I moved into politics while I was still night city editor, and--which was a very unusual move, by the way, because most newspapers would not have a politician unless you owned the paper.  And, yet the "Post" gave me a special permission to become a--to run for office and to serve as an elected official.  As a State-elected official, though, you were--in those days, the Colorado Legislature met in January, February, and part of March; and then it was over.  And if you didn't have some other means of livelihood, why, you couldn't live on being a--unless you were a farmer or a rancher or lawyer.  Now, why did they meet?  Historically, you just see why because there's no harvesting, no crop; nothing like that in January, February, and March so the Legislature guys from the farm and from the ranch could come and they could serve without having to do any--difficulty to what they were doing as far as their livelihood was concerned.  And I didn't fit into those particular--I was not a lawyer, so I couldn't--or a doctor--I couldn't get money that way.  I had to keep my day job in addition to it, so they put me on--they made me become night city editor.  And I swear, the whole time I was in the legislature, I also worked full-time at the "Post."  And I worked part time as a--first as a salesman and as a bookkeeper for a liquor store.
Speaker 1: Is--was that around the--were you hosting a radio show, too (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --around that time?
Speaker 2: --did that about the same time, and a TV show part of the time.
Speaker 1: Now, what--
Speaker 2: I should say that the first time I had in my life, except when I was in the Service--even when I was on the farm, I did part--the first time I ever had one job was when I became lieutenant lovernor.  I always had more than one job.  It seems that my dad [George Brown] always had more than one.  It was something that was just natural for me.
Story_ID: 93947
Speaker 1: What made you decide to be interested in, you know, I mean to get involved with politics?  Was this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's another story.
Speaker 1: --well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's a guy named Ralph Brady, who was quite an athlete, who went to Washburn [University] in Topeka [Kansas].  And he moved to Denver [Colorado] to become the executive director of the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  I was a writer for the "Post," and I had done a series of articles on Jim Crowism.  And, of course, Ralph, from Kansas we got together.  He came by one Sunday and I was sitting on the porch reading, and he said, "Look, we're having a meeting, community meeting."  Says, "We need to elect a black to the City Council in this city.  There's never been a black who served in our City Council.  What are you doing?"  I said, "Nothing."  So I went along.  Went to the meeting, and I sat in the back and they talked about this young guy, who's older than me but young fella, (unclear) that he was a member of the Legislature, to run for the [Denver] City Council, named Elvin Caldwell.  And so there were people (unclear) what can--I said, "Well, look.  I know what I can do.  I can write speeches and I can do papers and things on subjects."  And so I volunteered to do that.  Part way through the campaign--and City Council was city-wide, so that meant that you might have--the candidate might have three, four meetings in one night in different parts of the city.  So I agreed to serve on the speakers' committee.  So then I go and I would speak to the crowd until Elvin got there.  And if he didn't get there, then they were stuck with whatever I had to say.  And it was a lot of fun.  And I enjoyed writing and the like.  And we got Elvin elected [1955], which meant that now there was a year left on his term in the House of Representatives, and that was going to be filled by the Democratic Committee, county committee.  And there was one black member of that committee who was the one black guy who had led the way of getting the movement started to get someone into City Council.  And so Ralph came by again Sunday afternoon.  He says, "We're meeting to find out who we're going to push to replace Elvin in the Legislature."  I said, "Okay."  So I went--and again, I sat in the back.  In fact, that afternoon I was a little sleepy, maybe, and I started dozing off and I hear, "Dr. Lawson," who was a pharmacist, standing up talking about the kind of person that we need to fill Elvin's seat, because that person we're going to have to push, because they'd been other blacks in the House, but never been a black in the Senate, because that person is going to be the person we're going to push to become the first black State senator in Colorado.  First black State Senator west of the Mississippi.  He made this nice, long talk, and he says, "And this is the kind of person we need."  And he was talking on, I'm saying, "Yes.  Wonderful, (unclear) have that kind of person."  And he turned, he says, "There's the man, George, right there.  That's our candidate."  I said, "Oh, no.  No way."  You know, once again, there was no mama to save me.  But I was thinking about, you know, when Mama [Alberta Watson Brown] was in Kansas.  "What were they talking about?"  Well, they did what I used to do afterwards.  Appeal to my ego.  And it sounded so good.  You know, I'm--if I can be all that, he said, "You know, why not?"  So I decided I will do for that.  And so I campaigned for the vacancy.
Story_ID: 93948
Speaker 1: It was a campaign of dealing with--in district captains; and they had twenty-six of them in the City of Denver.  And you had to get a majority of those twenty-six in order to get elected.  You then were automatically selected for--to fill the vacancy.  And there was this one white guy who decided he wanted it, so he ran too.  There were two of us, and then a third guy ran. And he used to go around the--one white guy was the strongest competition for me.  He said, "Well, you know what," he says, "I grew up right over here in West Denver [Colorado]."  Turned out, though, he didn't, like, "I grew up right here in East Denver.  I grew up"--.  I said, "Damn, he's growing up all over this damn place."  And so one evening I was sitting there, and she was talking about-- "I knew he had to be lying."  And so when it came my turn, I said, "You know what?"  I said, "I would love to have been born in Denver."  I said, "It would have been the most wonderful thing--most wonderful experience that I could talk about."  So, but on July 1st, 1926, on my birthdate, my mother was in Lawrence, Kansas, and I thought it made better sense to be with her at that time.  And that went around the city.  So he was no longer able to use that, and I beat him, and served a year in the House of Representatives.
Story_ID: 93949
Speaker 1: And then we immediately started the campaign for the State Senate.  And I got elected to the [Colorado] State Senate.  Wonderful--I had--and there were 230-some-odd-thousand votes to cast in that election, and I won by thirteen against--
Speaker 2: Thirteen.
Speaker 1: Thirteen votes from a white guy.  On election night, I was ahead by seventy-some-odd votes, and he challenged the results and they had a recount.  And so the Election Commission stated to recount, and they found some errors that put him ahead by thirty-three votes or something like that, and they stopped counting.  I said, "Hey, wait a minute.  You know, if you're going to a recount, you got to go all the way.  You don't stop as soon as he gets in front."  And so they were forced to go all the way.  And at the end, I was ahead by 13.  And so 13 has been my lucky number ever since.
Speaker 2: That is pretty amazing.  Now, do you remember when you won, how you felt?
Speaker 1: Which--well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The first time.
Speaker 1: --the first time when I won, which was probably the toughest, because then you were dealing with twenty-six people only.  And I'd have--I'd go visit with them at home, on their jobs, you know, and the like.  It was a real tough election, and I--well, I had fun doing it.  And I had--by working with Elvin [Caldwell], I had realize that I--well, I didn't have lengthy speeches.  I could speak pretty well.  I could get to the subject matter.  And I--I just felt like, you know, this is just another game for me to win.  And so when I won it, it was a great experience, something I knew I was going to do.  And the same way for the State Senate when I ran for that seat.  And it's sort of amusing.  I look back.  On election day, I got up that morning, had breakfast, and now, what do I do on election day?  I make sure I vote, so I know I got one vote.  I'm not even sure my wife gonna vote for me, but I know I got one vote.  And so I had gone to the phonebook and there were sixteen George Browns in the Denver [Colorado] phone directory.  So I spent the day going to those sixteen homes and found George Brown wasn't in each home, he was at work or something else.  I'd tell the people in there who I am.  "George Brown's name on the ballot," you know.  "Well, I am that George Brown, and this is what I stand for, and I'd appreciate your vote."  Well, maybe I didn't get all sixteen, but I probably did, so they--probably some of that thirteen that submit the last day might have been the--push me over.  I'll never know, obviously, but--
Speaker 2: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Maybe none of the sixteen voted (laughs) for me.
Speaker 2: (Laughs).  But I--I mean that's amazing about winning by thirteen votes.  That was--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, what--so you obviously had--what was your campaign strategy?  Let me ask you that.
Speaker 1: Well, I needed to show that I was caring; that I had knowledge; I had the handles of the various issues; that I knew how to deal in legislative kinds of situations; and I had to look good.  I had to be a, you know, make people--people had to like me, and I knew that.  And so that was the good part of just making people like you and look at me, not as a black man running for office, but as a man running for office; although I know that a lot of--during the election, a lot of people would come up to me and say, "You know, we're supporting you, but you're different.  You know, you're not like a typical black person."  Rather than get into an argument, I--later I'd get into arguments after I was in office, but no, I'd just accept that let them go on merry way, hoping they'll remember when they got in the polling booth that they would vote for me.  But it was a challenge, and I always enjoyed a challenge.  And I guess when I look back at it, that the whole aviation thing was a challenge that I pushed in there.  School was a challenge.
Story_ID: 93711
Speaker 1: Do you--how large was Denver's [Colorado] popu--black population?
Speaker 2: About three percent of the total.
Speaker 1: Three percent.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Three percent of the state total.
Speaker 1: State.  That's what I meant, the State.  Okay.  So you had to really put up-pull in a significant number--
Speaker 2: I had to work.  I had to work hard.  And I had to overcome the fact that the party would say, you know, "He's"--I had to make sure I got as much of that black vote as I could, even though, you know, it was just a part of the--when I ran for the state-wide office as Lieutenant Governor [1974].  But--I lost my thought.
Story_ID: 93712
Speaker 1: You get elected to the [Colorado] State Senate [1957], and that was the first.  Is that touted as a first?  You know, even though--what you (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It was a first--a first in the state of Colorado--actually, first State Senator west of the Mississippi.
Speaker 1: West of the Mississippi.  So now--but you're saying (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But they had been elected in New York and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and some other places.
Speaker 1: Could you repeat what you were saying about how the ballots were?  You know, how they pointed, sort of, to you?  'Cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: During the run for the State Senate, they handed out these sample ballots.  It was part of the procedure in the campaigns in Denver, is that they would hand out sample ballots so that people, when they got in the polling booth, it would not be unfamiliar to them.  They would be able to mark them, and they can know easily to pull the lever for that particular person or persons.  And in the west side of Denver, there was a group of folks who put out ballots which had marked with arrows, so, this is the negro, and a big arrow down to my name so that nobody accidently would pull that lever without knowing that.  And it was also--it also would have a lever for--or you could vote for the entire party, and I was a Democrat.  They wanted to make sure that nobody got in there and pulled that party for the all the Democrats, and as a result, would be voting for me.  They wanted me to make sure that that lever was not a part of a party vote.
Story_ID: 93713
Speaker 1: And were you, at this time, building some important coalitions or you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I started in the legislature [Colorado Senate] because I became first an authority on the rules and regulations.  I got elected by the group--by my party to the finance committee, which is called the Joint Budget Committee, made up of three members from each House; three Senators and three Representatives.  And that committee handled the Legislation for all the appropriations for the State of Colorado.  And during that time, I became--while the universities--I was the one that supported the colleges and universities, so I developed a coalition portion.  The farmers and ranchers always considered me as a farmer.  I came from a farm, so I got a slight there.  I was involved in a number of--I spoke at student meetings and the like at the campuses; spoke at high schools.  So I got a young coalition, part of my coalition.  I worked a lot of legislation for senior citizens, so I had the old folks.  So I, without even thinking about it, by just doing--working on causes that I believed in; like, we were the first state to do anything about equal rights for women, and it was my bill.  We were the first state to have an all-inclusive fair housing law; it was my bill.  Fair Employment Practices Law, my bill.  We had a ridiculous law when I became a State Senator [1957] that said that if you lived south of the Pueblo, that you--that you could intermarry; but if you lived north, you couldn't.  The reason why the south--it came from the Mexico Purchase.  There was a restriction that they couldn't have laws against intermarriage.  And I pushed that through.  And so I built these coalitions without really thinking about it, so that when I ran for state-wide office [lieutenant governor], many times people would come to me saying, "You know, you were for us and we're now for you," without me having consciously worked that way.  Well, I did not consciously think about running for state office when I got elected as State Senator, and to serve that twenty-some-odd years; I never thought I'd ever be there that long, so I wasn't thinking about building to become a higher official.  And went in--decided that what I should run for.  And the party met, and we talked about it.  The party wanted me because of the natural coalition that I would bring to a state ticket.  But there was a discussion about what should I run for.  I could have gotten elected Governor.  I think I could have gotten elected to the United States Senator, because I was leading the ticket.  I was the oldest person on the ticket.  Gary Hart was running for the United States Senate and got elected.  And while you may not remember, I'm the one that helped get him over the hump.  But it just--the coalition, I hadn't really consciously gone after, and, yet, there it was--its causes and issues that I believed in and worked for.
Speaker 1: Now, when you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And the Labor Movement was a good portion of mine.
Speaker 1: I wanna (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh.  I should point out, too, there was another part of my development.  When I got to the point where it was decided that I needed to get--make more money and I needed to get away from the paper business [Denver Post].  So I became assistant director of Denver's Housing Authority.  And then, after the [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] assignation [1968], I became head of the Urban Coalition, Metra-Denver Urban Coalition.  And that was another part of the coalition, my personal coalition, because I'd developed the--I had to build it, and I had Labor, Education; people--various groups, you know, as a part of the Metro-Denver coalition.  That coalition naturally became a part of the same coalition that was put together when I ran for state-wide office.
Story_ID: 93714
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the other question I have--just--is, I'd like you to put this sort of in historical context about what Denver and Colorado was like?  What was happening, you know, at that time, in the '50s'[1950s]?  What was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: When I first got into the [Colorado] legislature, if you went south of Denver, it's like going south of the Mason-Dixon Line.  Colorado Springs [Colorado], very prejudice.  Other places were prejudiced more against the Mexicans only because they outnumbered--there weren't that many blacks in the area.  It was a State that really knows where it was or where it was going.  There had been some history of blacks.  A guy named Barney Ford, who made quite an impact upon the state of Colorado.  When Colorado wanted to become a state, they wrote a constitution, which said the right of voting should be extended to all white males.  They left out white women; of course, they left out all other men of any other background.  Barney Ford had come into Denver [in the 1860s] and had built a hotel, restaurant, and was very popular and politicians from the East would come back.  And there was a guy named Johnson who came back and became a part of it, of that Barney Ford whatever.  And so Barney went back to Washington [D.C.] with the committee from Colorado seeking statehood.  When he went to Senator Johnson, he said, "Look"--he said, "You know, they've got a constitution that they want to put forth that says that only white men can vote.  That's not right."  While statehood was held up for Colorado until they changed that so that from the very beginning [1876], Colorado had a constitution as a state that extended the right to vote to all men; not just all white men; again, not women.  Barney Ford, obviously, wasn't concerned about putting the effort in to get women the right to vote.  But--so Colorado had that kind of impact then.  Again, it was a guy who had been a slave, you know, and was in the restaurant business and hotel business.  They say, and I don't know how true the story is, that when Barney first came to the West, he went into the mountains seeking gold like everybody else did.  And at day, he would work in a part of the river, where there was obviously no gold.  And the whites going by, who, if he had had anything, they would have robbed him, and maybe even killed him.  They'd say, "Oh, look at that fool panning for gold.  There's no gold."  At night, he would climb up into the little mountain area right behind where he was panning, and he was mining gold, digging gold.   And according to the story, he brought enough gold back to Denver to start the business.  He beat the system.  But--and then, like I say, there was not any great, liberal movement in Colorado.
Story_ID: 93715
Speaker 1: Is Colorado a Democratic or Republican state?
Speaker 2: It was a-- Republican for a long--we were the first-time that the Democrats won that many state-wide seats ever before.  That was in '74' [1974].
Speaker 1: So you--the--you're constituency--who were the--their concerns were around 'cause you--as you said, you worked with seniors and housing and you didn't mention youth (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I did mention it. I spoke to youth groups.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, that's right.  (simultaneous) (unclear), and construction (unclear)?
Speaker 2: The whole labor movement I had worked with.
Speaker 1: Now, there was also a discussion of, I read, about you had developed the concept that enabled--
Speaker 2: Excuse me.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)?
Speaker 2: That's fine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Neighborhood versus project.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's when I was the assistant and executive director of the Denver [Colorado] Housing Authority.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that was--I didn't know where that fit.
Speaker 2: I was a [Colorado] State Senator, and my main day job was the Housing Authority.  And I became sort of a national expert in the area, because I--housing authority was under the PHA, Public Housing Administration this was before HUD [Housing and Urban Development].  And there are all kinds of complications as to whether or not we were a federal agency, which, if we were, then I couldn't serve in the senate.  So they challenged me on that.  That was one of the reasons I got out of the senate and started--well, actually it's the reason I left the housing authority and went in with the Urban Coalition. I didn't leave the Senate, I left the Housing Authority and went in with the Urban Coalition.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was the newspaper [The Denver Post]--I'm just trying to go parallel track.  Okay.  So it was the newspaper to the Housing coalition?
Speaker 2: To the Housing Authority.
Speaker 1: Housing Authority to the (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Urban Coalition.
Speaker 1: Coalition.  Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And then Lieutenant Governor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But in the meantime, while I was--after I left the Housing Authority, I also taught urban sociology at the Universities of Denver and Colorado and Metro State College [Metropolitan State University of Denver].  Like I said, I always had more than one gig going for me.
Speaker 1: So--but that's, you know, 'cause there are a lot of states where they have--like, Texas has a very shortened state--.  I think they even now still have a shortened session.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what--but--see, we're talking about a period of really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Before the Senate, it was extended.  The sessions were going into July and after.
Speaker 1: But we're talking--okay.  But then, I'm trying to get the--did--okay.  When were you a King Fellow?
Speaker 2: I was a King Fellow while I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to get (unclear).
Speaker 2: --while I was with the Housing Authority (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was a King Fellow.
Speaker 1: And that's when--and then you also toured--you did a tour a part of that?
Speaker 2: I did a tour of Africa (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Of Africa and Europe?
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's with the Housing Authority (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Okay.  But basically (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Actually, though, I was still a journalist when I did the State Department tour.  That's how I got on it, by being a journalist.
Story_ID: 93716
Speaker 1: But what we're talking about is a career in--really in politics that began in 1955 and--right?
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-five (1955). And so you had really served in the State of--the [Colorado] State Legislature for nineteen years.  Right?
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what were--how were you sort of changing as a person and, you know, and maturing as a politician and all of that?  That's what I....
Speaker 2: How was I changing as a person.  I don't know.  I learned to speak a lot longer.  When I first got elected, I'd get up and make a speech in five minutes and say everything I knew.  I learned to become a politician and speak for an hour.  Those kinds of changes.  I guess the change came about as I worked on different issues, and as I realized that there was a need for me to become effective as a politician and I began to look at ways that I could become as effective as possible; ways that I wanted to be and to work at.  I didn't wanna to become effective in any kind of negative ways.  And I think I can tell a quick story about how, my first day in the State Senate, I arrived on the scene just fat, dumb and happy; and I had worked on an issue the night before that I knew was going to be coming up in the Senate.  I'd read about it and taken a position.  As I came in, a lobbyist met me and he said, "You know," he says, "we want your vote, and we know that you got limited resources."  The legislature was paying $50 a month, and the "Denver Post" wasn't paying that much money either as a newspaper writer.  And he says, "We'd like your vote," and implied, you know, that "and there'll be some money that would come with the vote."  My dilemma was that I'd already decided that's the way I wanted to vote.  So as I sat there and they called the roll, I passed when they first came to my name in alphabetic order, I said, "Pass."  I'm saying now, "What am I going to do.  Now, if I vote the way I said I wanted to vote, everybody else out there who's gotten a bribe will consider me as being a part of that movement, including people on the other side who knew this guy, was his favorite lobbying tactic was to pay for votes."  So I took the mic and said I need to explain that I'd made up my mind to vote this way and I'm going to vote that way and this way.  I was offered a bribe as I came in this morning, and this has nothing--I did not accept.  It has nothing to do with my vote."  Well, the word went out that this fool, if you try to bribe him, he's going to get up and talk about it, so that I spent nineteen years in the legislature never ever being offered another bribe.  I might have accepted one later on if it had been big enough.  Just kidding, of course.  But that was the way I wanted to serve.  I wanted to serve as best I could with as much knowledge as I could.  I wanted to have as much influence as I could.  But I wanted that in positive ways.  I didn't want to become a--and I did that I think of my upbringing as a kid.  I mean, that's the way I was raised.  I did it because I had a sense of pride about being black, and I knew that there were very honorable black people in this nation and in the world, and that it's very often you--if there were something negative, we'd come to--the brush we'd all repainted with as opposed to being looked at as individuals or as a group without--and that was one of the rights I used to work for.  I said, "I want to have the right to have wrongdoers in my midst and not be called a wrongdoer because of it.  And that's one of the basic rights that even today that black Americans have, you know, with somebody ever do something wrong and automatically the word goes out, you know, that it's a--it's as a group that we've done it.  And yet a white person can rape and do whatever else, and they don't say all white men do this.  It's that one individual.
Story_ID: 93717
Speaker 1: Now, what were your other, sort of--now, people that you identified with, you know, in the Senate, and you know, (unclear) what you were concerned about some of the same issues?
Speaker 2: Before I left, one guy that I give a lot of credit to was Doctor Lawson, who was a pharmacist.  He never served in an elected office, never ran for anything; but I'd spend hours at his drugstore sitting and talking with him.  And there was a fella, a dentist named Doctor Holmes [ph.], who was a Republican by the way, and he said that I made him a Democrat.  But I'd sit and talk with him.  Within the Senate there were--there was a guy named Herrick Roth, who was a labor leader; a guy named Dale Tersey [ph.], who was an Italian lawyer from Pueblo [Colorado]; there was a [Robert] Bob Allen, who was a--he had gone to law school and we became very close friends.  Bob and I ran together on a lot of issues, and we worked together on a lot of things.  There were--the Women's League of Voters, I spoke at many of their sessions and worked with some of their leaders on various issues, and maybe that's one of the reasons that I was pushing so hard for equal rights for women.  Just things, you know, just seemed to fall in place.  Like I said earlier, I didn't set out to be a politician.  I just fell there, and once there, decided maybe I'd better do the best I could.
Story_ID: 93718
Speaker 1: And did you find that you liked--did you like running for office or that was something you learned (unclear)--the speech that you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I did not like running for office.  In fact, a couple of times, nobody ran against me or I would have dropped out; I would have quit, you know, because it wasn't--it wasn't something I liked doing.  And as time went by, after Watergate [1972], I definitely didn't like it.  People you, you know, you have a high profile or a low profile.  You hear some politicians say, "I keep a low profile."  I had a "no-profile," and I was very happy with it and very successful with it.  And so--no, I didn't like campaigning.  I was good (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --at it.  Don't get me wrong.  And I could give as good a speech as anybody else.  I used to write speeches for--I won't tell you who--but for some of the better people or politicians--black leaders--who used my speeches as their speeches.
Speaker 1: But you liked--you liked the issues.  You liked serving.  You liked the service part.
Speaker 2: I liked the service, and I liked trying to make a change.  And in those days, you could.  I can remember days when I'd walk in the [Colorado State] Senate with an issue, with a bill that was on the calendar, and I knew I didn't have enough votes when I started, that I was going to have to convince 18--17 of those guys to vote with me--guys there with me.  And start to debate with the opposition and see the changes as people, whose minds hadn't been entirely made up, would switch over and I'd get my 18 votes.  At the end, you could walk in there with 17 votes.  When the vote was taken, you had 17 votes.  Nobody changed their minds.  Their minds were made up before they got there.  They were either--I don't know what.  I won't say everybody was bribed, that they were party-wise or whatever.  They were there and they weren't moving or there was pressure to keep them there.  And that was not the kind of political atmosphere that I was happy in.  I was much happier, maybe it was my ego, being able to know that I was good and could explain my issue, that I could make somebody sitting there decide (unclear) "That makes sense and I'll vote that way."  But it changed at the end.  It was nowhere near that.
Story_ID: 93719
Speaker 1: Now, the other thing.  I'd like you tell some anecdotes also about things that you think sort of stand out in your mind about the time of, you know, in this nineteen years before you're Lieutenant Governor [of Colorado].  I want to know some other--just other things that happened or stories around your service.
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the fact that I became "the parliamentarian" without the title, so I knew the rules.  So there're many times when I, by using the rules, I could get my way.  I have to admit though, you're talking did I ever have a devilish streak  There were days when I'd get up and I would say that, you know, the  Rule 17A, page 63; that wasn't right at all (laughs).  If they'd ever gone and looked at it, no telling what it was.  But they believed me, you know.  I was the Bible.  And I became the financial expert, and I worked hard at that.  I knew the figures, and I would really study to try to make sure that our revenues were divided properly in the State as best that we could for whatever there was for need.  State budgets are pretty limited, and so when you look at--I was in the federal in some cities.  But as a member of a six-member committee, we were six--out of a hundred members of the legislature, we were the powerful ones.  And I used that to fill out that.  There was a--I remember one occasion that one of my Bills that I really wanted bad--it was the Fair Employment Practices Bill--and I needed some votes.  And I was chairman of the Finance Committee, and this Senator had a Bill for a tri-semester call at first at a college, and he wanted it bad.  And with the rules and my knowledge, the rules finding with it, I put it on the table, it was going to pass.  It was going to be gone.  But as long as I kept it in my pocket, which we call a pocket veto, it would never get out there for any kind of vote unless the committee would, call me or something.  And he would come in the morning and he'd say, "You know," he'd say, "what about my bill?"  And I said, "Fine, but how you voting on fair employment practices?"  He said, "Well, you know, I don't believe in that.  I think, you know, people ought to have a--work."  I think he offered some weird excuse.  I said, "Well, okay."  I said, "I guess my committee's not going to have enough time today to consider your bill."  I said, "You know, it's at the bottom of the agenda."  And so one day he got the message.  He came in and he said, "You know, he says, "I kind of like that fair employment practices thought."  And I said, "Well, it's on the calendar today.  We'll see how you vote."  He said, "Well, you gonna take my bill out of committee today?"  I said, "No."  I said, "The committee's not going to meet today.  But they are going to vote on the fair employment practices.  You can decide whatever you want to do."  He voted for me.  His bill came out the next day.  It was a good bill.  I would not have killed it.  Eventually, if he had held out long enough to where I couldn't get enough votes, I would have gone on the floor and talked my way through it, I think.  But--and now was that form of bribing?  Maybe so.  I don't know.  Probably wasn't as nice, but I was beginning to get into that mode, and I began to think that's not what I want to do either.  That's not what I wanna be.  But pocket veto is a very important legislative maneuver anywhere in the United States today, including Congress.  You just don't put it out there.
Story_ID: 93950
Speaker 1: That was common.  That was a common.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  They called it gerrymandering.
Speaker 1: Gerrymandering.  Right.
Speaker 2: And so I remember fighting that and getting up, you know, and saying--pointed it out, and I shamed them to where they abandoned that and went back into the drawing room and came out and drew a district which went south of the zoo and the city park, and then went north and then east, so that I had a district that was predominantly black then with a lot of liberal whites and some Mexicans.  But it was predominantly black.
Speaker 1: And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And changed the way I had to campaign, obviously.
Speaker 1: Going forward?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You mean the issues you had?
Speaker 2: Issues that I had, where before I had to make sure that I could do it in such a way that I had to be concerned about south Denver [Colorado], too.  This way, my main concern was northeast Denver.  And while I looked, I made sure nothing happened.  I had to try to make sure that that part of the city got as good a treatment as--statewide as--from the State Legislature as the rest of the city.
Story_ID: 93951
Speaker 1: Were there--Who were the [Colorado] governors during the time that, you know, of your service?
Speaker 2: The first service was Ed--oh, gosh.  Big [Edwin] Ed Johnson was the governor when I was elected to the House [of Representatives].  And then following Ed was a guy named [Stephen] Steve McNichols.  And then following Steve was John [Arthur] Love.  And John Love resigned to take a position back here with the federal government, and a guy named [John David] Vanderhoof filled his vacancy.  And Vanderhoof is the guy that we [Brown and Richard "Dick" Lamm] defeated when we became the governor--Lieutenant Governor team [in 1975].
Speaker 1: Now, what were the important changes happening in that nineteen years, you know, in Denver [Colorado]?  There was--you had growth occurring.
Speaker 2: Growths; the water issues, always was a water issue because we didn't have enough water and wasn't getting enough water from the western slope; there were the human rights issues.  Denver was also being pushed, but it's like--then no longer could they expand.  The areas that were sort of Denver now were becoming their own little cities and own little voting areas, governmental areas.  So it was beginning to get held in and sort of restricted.  Pollution was a major problem from the automobiles, and also from changes in housing, as they built housing north of Denver all the way up towards Greeley.  When I first got in the legislature, the automobile pollution would blow out at night with it; and so the days you'd start fresh again.  Well, as that northern part became populated, the pollution would move there and then would go no further because the development didn't let it.  And so you'd start each day with pollution in Denver.  So pollution became a major issue.  And, of course, there always was the issue of housing and development, employment, education.  The schools in north and east Denver were generally regarded as--was poorer than the schools elsewhere even though we had some excellent teachers and some excellent programs.  We probably were the beginnings of the freedom schools, which now are charter schools.  But I had got the movement started where we had some freedom schools and put them within the school system.
Story_ID: 93952
Speaker 1: The federal employment practices.  You were saying that, you know, it was a pretty--it was a water--I want you just to state that, because we're on camera.  You know it was watered down and it took--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, when I first introduced the bill, it was a true fair employment practices.  We said that no employer could use discriminatory practices in hiring people.  In order to get it passed, I had to compromise.  And when it first went through, it was any employer who hired six or more people, had to come under the law.  They were going to make it 100, and I had to fight that off, and then it became six.  And then, later on I got it where it then became--it covered all employers.  But in the beginning, I had to do some compromising, which was, by the way, the hardest thing for me to learn in the legislature, was to--how to compromise.  And I finally learned to do it by drawing a line of conviction, and then a line of compromise on an issue, and make sure that my line of compromise didn't jump back and forth across my line of conviction as many politicians do.  Line of compromise doesn't mean a thing to them.  They just move back and forth on the line of conviction.  On Fair Employment Practices, I did have to move--not my line of compromise, but I did--of conviction--but I did have to go back behind it in order to make sure that someday I'd be able to go back up in front of it.  But for the most part, I would refuse to.  I'd draw my line and bring it back to my line of conviction where it would go no further.
Story_ID: 93953
Speaker 1: As the days after Watergate [Scandal in 1972], that became not practical at all if you wanted to do something, you wanted to get something passed.
Speaker 2: Why do you consider Watergate problems that--such as this (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: It was a change in the media conviction of politics.  Politicians became fodder for journalists who wanted to get their name known.  They wanted the byline and the like.  The whole area of covering politics changed.  Up until that point, you could tell a reporter something off the record, and that's where it stayed.  Afterwards, you might tell him something and he'd decide that you said something else and he'd print it the way he wanted it to be.  The editorial comment of newspapers became no longer confined to the editorial page.  But the news story most often had the whole attitude, the position of the writer or the paper built into it as a news story.  So journalism, without people realizing it, really had quite an impact on how we in government started doing business.
Speaker 2: So that--so it sounds like that really offended you, as an old newspaper person.
Speaker 1: It did.  And I'd always believed in the freedom of the press; had always felt like it was something that was sacred and that we ought to have.  But then to see it become abused (unclear).  It became, you know, I have a right to this even though it's harmful if it gets out, I've got a right to publish it; and it soon becomes published.  And even if I had to make it up--and this business--when I was night city editor, I would never let a story go through that quoted undisclosed sources and all of that.  You know, I said, if it's quotable and if a person--if you use the name--if they can't use your name, then you can't use the quote.  I also refused to let editorial comments seep into news stories.  The other thing that I had, which I really enjoyed, the "Denver Post" would have a banner headline that said, "There's good news today."  Coming on the right side of the front page was a feature story or news story that was something good about something or somebody or whatever.  The reporter that got that story would get a byline and a little bonus.  And a lot of reporters would work hard to get that.  Today, you pick up a newspaper front page, it says--there's nothing good news on there.  It's all catastrophe; it's havoc; it's war; you know, it's accidents; it's murder, rape, whatever.
Speaker 2: Did it ever happen to you that you got burned--was that because of observation, you know, that you saw things or did it actually happen to you that you got burned by a reporter?
Speaker 1: I never did have (unclear)--no.  It never did happen to me that I got burned by a reporter.
Story_ID: 93954
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I want to ask--the other question is just a real quick one.  You had mentioned you were a part of a group of six that, you know, that were the most powerful [in the Colorado legislature].  Who were they?
Speaker 2: Well, it was--we were the--the Democrats were the minority party, so that meant that there were Democrats--I mean, two Republicans and one Democrat in the Senate; two Republicans and one Democrat in the House.  As to what they were by name, I can't always remember.  Harry Locke was a member from the Senate.  I'm trying to remember who the other senator was.  Either it was Ranger Rogers part of the time.  They switch back and forth, and the House members running every two years, they had different members on there.
Speaker 1: I see.  Now (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Roy Romer, for example, who became governor.  He was a member.  Roy and I did a lot of things together.  He was the Democrat when I was the Democrat.  We were the two Democrats on the committee [Finance Committee].  A little funny story:  Roy and I--well, Roy, later after he became governor, he, when his term ran out, he out and became head of the school system in Los Angeles just a couple of years ago [2001].  But Roy and I went to Pueblo [Colorado] one time to see if we could move the State Fair to Denver [Colorado] where most people were.  The fair has always been in Pueblo.  Fewer people.  We felt like, you know, we could make more money and that more people will enjoy the fair.  We can get it up in Denver.  So we went down to meet with the City leaders of Pueblo, and they let us know in no kindly terms that there might be trouble getting back to Denver if we wanted to push that issue.  Just sort of joking with us, but they let us know that Fair was not going to be moved, and it didn't get moved.  We're in the minority party, so we couldn't just push it through, but it was sort of a fun event.
Story_ID: 93955
Speaker 1: Now, what brought you to decide to run for lieutenant governor [of Colorado]?
Speaker 2: I was pushed into it.  The Democratic leaders said they needed somebody that on the ticket would bring a coalition of voters.  And the ticket was sort of being, you know, we needed a white this and a white that.  We needed a black guy.  They never thought about--at that time, the Mexican wasn't--the population wasn't strong enough, so it wasn't a consideration.  I then had a choice to sit and decide where I wanted to go.  And at that stage, I had already reached, in my mind, I needed to get out of politics.  And I figured if I ran for the State Senate, unless--I mean the United States Senate, unless I won, that was six more years that I would have to serve; minimum of six more years.  And I'd be out of Colorado most of the time.  If I ran for Congress, that was two years, and I never ran for a two-year term in my whole political career.  In two years, you're always running for re-election.  So, governor was a four-year term.  [Richard] "Dick" Lamm was--had been pushing it for a number of years.  That's where he wanted to go.  And I realized that if I wanted out, as I did, that I could serve as a Lieutenant Governor, do some good, not a whole lot, and that could be my way out of the political field.  And that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Now, were you tired of the political, had you reached burnout, do you think?  Is that or did you want--was it financial
Speaker 2: It was some--some of a lot of things, and daughters in college, and I needed to get out and make money.  I had no other kind (unclear).  I was not like a lawyer where I could be given cases legitimately.  I mean, nobody could give me anything like that as head of the Urban Coalition or whatever.  I needed to get into an activity where I could make some good money honestly, and yet enjoy what I was doing, and maybe--and doing something a little different than what I was doing.
Speaker 1: So you were basically recruited.  Right?
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 93956
Speaker 1: And did you like--I mean, first of all, lieutenant governor, the position a lot of times has, you know, is dependent on what the governor thinks.  Right?
Speaker 2: (Nodding.)
Speaker 1: Or decides what that position wants to be.  But did you enjoy your time--you know, first of all, how did you go about winning that? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Unclear.)
Speaker 1: It's different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, we ran separately in the primary.  The governor [Richard "Dick" Lamm] ran in his race, and I ran in my race.  We only joined together after the primary for the general.  So we were not all that compatible in the beginning.
Speaker 1: Can I ask you, is that unique to Colorado or does that exist?  Because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, Colorado first had a system where you ran in the general separately, so there were occasions when we would have a governor, who was from one party; and the lieutenant governor, who was from a different party.  I thought that was absolutely ridiculous.  So I led the way to amend our constitution to make sure that, in the general they ran under one party label, so that you would always have a governor and lieutenant governor from the same party.  They may not like each other, but they'd be from the same party.  And we were the first ones to get elected under that system.  (Unclear) to your question, which (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, no.  I was asking--well, I was asking a question, you answered it.  I was asking question of clarification, because, you know, I have seen it where--basically, they may run, but sometimes I've seen the person actually appointed, and on the same ticket (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah. Sometimes when the governor would--as a candidate--would select who his running mate was.  Rarely in this nation has there been a lieutenant governor for--people tell the truth-- The governor really enjoyed or wanted and trusted his lieutenant governor, particularly under the system we had, because who did they--who's threatening to them?  It's the Lieutenant Governor.  And it's like with Dick and I.  I was loyal.  I knew how to serve and I served loyally.  I would fuss and fight with Dick in his office.  Once a decision was made, it might be his decision and not mine, but it became mine because it was the administration's position.  And I worked as hard for it as if it had been mine all along.  Dick, I don't think always believed that.  I think he always was--it was because very often there were people who would try to say, "Well, you know, George believes this, and we know he believes it.  The governor believes this, and we know he knows there is a difference."  I never, ever used that or thought that, but I think Dick thought that I was thinking in terms of it.  Because I know at one time a delegation came to the State House to tell me that "We want you to run for governor next time, and we want to--we're going to start the movement now," and I stopped them.  I said, "No, I'm not going to do that."
Speaker 1: 'Cause I--you know, I just find that system curious.  So this whole--so you--what you're saying is that, you run your campaign, he runs his campaign.  You win the general--no, the primary.
Speaker 2: Win the primary, then we run as a team.
Speaker 1: You run as a team.  So platform issues, are they--when are they--what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The governor has the top decision on the platform; however, we had a situation where we had not just the governor and lieutenant governor, but we had for the first time a fella running for the state treasurer; fella running for the attorney general.  And so we became a broader team than just the governor and the lieutenant governor, so the issues were--we'd sit down as a group and we would talk about issues and reach decisions.  The governor wasn't always happy with that, because he always considered himself as the top elected official.  But since we had come in that way, we ran as a team from the beginning.  We had a little different bit of stuff going on in our little meetings that normally wouldn't have been there.  And I don't think that after we all left office, 'cause Sam left--his name was Sam Brown, the treasurer; he left and went with ACTION.  The attorney general, he left and got out of politics like I did.  And at that point, the governor then decided while the lieutenant governor run separately in the primary, he chose his running mate, and then chose who he's going to select and was telling people, you vote for that person.  As a result, he usually got his way.  There were people who would run for the-- knowing that the governor wasn't supporting them.  But--and I'm sure it's done that way even today.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 93957
Speaker 1: So you--but this was a different experience.  And I'm wondering if your campaign was any different at this point, you know, running for lieutenant governor [of Colorado] before or did it become different during the general election as opposed to the primary.
Speaker 2: No.  We ran definitely separately in the--even though we had worked together on some issues.  So when Dick [Richard "Dick" Lamm] was in the [Colorado State] House [of Representatives] before and I was in the [Colorado State] Senate, we had--like he would carry a bill in the House, and I would take care of the Senate and vice-versa.  But there were a lot of other issues that Dick wasn't all that gung ho about; he was an environmentalist.  And I wasn't all that gung ho about environment at that time.  And he was also one who felt like the State needed to be like locked off; that we needed to stop the influx of people.  And I used to fuss and fight with him, saying, "You know, if that was true before you and I came here, you know, neither one of us would have been here, because you're from somewhere else and I'm from Kansas."  He felt very strongly about a number of things that I didn't necessarily approve of.
Speaker 1: Now--so, what was--but did--still you're playing once you--so--did the election change?  That's what I'm trying to understand between the primary and the general.  Did it change much or was it just sort of continually (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: We joined, but we ran the general as a state ticket rather than just as the governor and lieutenant governor running together alone.  But our ticket became the treasurer and the attorney general, the secretary of state; so that we all and the United States Senator and the members of Congress saw that we had a state-wide ticket, so to speak.
Speaker 1: So you--did you work out your issues at that point (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: We did. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --where you (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We worked out most of them before during the primary and then before the general; yes, we sat--now, then after election, became a different ballgame.
Speaker 1: Because he wanted to be charge.
Speaker 2: And he was.
Speaker 1: Right.  And he was.  Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 93958
Speaker 1: So what things did you learn--do you feel added to your sort of--it was a different thing.  I mean, it's different than representing one part of--you know, being lieutenant governor was different than being--representing on part of Denver [Colorado].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had a--well, you see, it was new. There had not been a lieutenant governor serving before as I did.  I was the first lieutenant governor that served as a part of a team like that.  There were some constitutional things that were designated for me, but not many.  I had to take some things and he [Colorado Governor Richard "Dick" Lamm] had to give me some things.  For example, he gave me institutions for a while until it showed that that was a pretty spot, and they were taken away from me.  We had to balance the budget, and I had the responsibility of going out and making enemies of a lot of state employees by saying we can't do this, we can't do that.  You know, we got to cut travel, we got to cut this.  And so that--and I had to carve out some--I became what I call an ombudsman; the first ombudsman that this state had ever had, because a lot of people could get nothing out of the state government, you know. They would get to a point and nothing happened.  So I set up offices around the state where people could go there, and then that ombudsman office of mine would help them or even go for them to state government and help them solve problems.  There was a new role, one that I was very happy to serve.  It meant, however, that there were many--well, I also did something that the governor didn't particularly like.  When the governor in Colorado leaves the state, the lieutenant governor becomes governor, period.  When he's on an airplane, the minute the airplane leaves the ground, he's out of office, so to speak.  There was a black man who had served in the state penitentiary wrongly put there, and one of my staff members had studied the case and came to me about it, and he was to be released, but he had that conviction hanging over his head, which would forever hinder him for employment.  And so they asked the governor to pardon him, and he wouldn't.  Came to me and they talked about it.  He left the state and I pardoned him, because it was right, you know.  Well, the governor never got over that.  He felt like, you know, I did him wrong.  When he came back, he had a public--he had a press conference to say he was going to revoke, well he couldn't.  But he was--well, I won't say dumb, but he didn't make a lot of sense that once something was done, he was gonna come in and try to revoke it, because I was governor at the time and had full authority.  It wasn't the best of things, you know.  But I talked to him about it and he wasn't going to do it.  And I just felt this was-- this guy needed the right break.  Why should he (unclear) since he'd been wrongly, and it was admitted, that he was wrongly convicted.  I mean, why should he suffer the rest of the-there was, I thought, in our system, that you could serve your time, pay your--and you are, you know, you've done what was right.  I admit that that's not necessarily true in our Democratic society, but it's a theory.
Speaker 1: So what year was that, that that happened?  Do you remember (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, it had to be '70' [1970].  Had to be '76' [1976]; something like that.
Speaker 1: Seventy-six.  So it happened (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Maybe.  It might have been '75' [1975].  We were just into our (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Year.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Early end.
Speaker 1: Early end.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that would be the second year of your term.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we had another--one of the newspapers--run an editorial, which I wish I had--tried to find it--telling the governor that he'd better start staying in the state, you know, because he'd go out and he could get killed (laughs).  Well, they never said it, but it was obviously implied.  That fool over there would become governor, you know; you got to be careful about that, you know.
Story_ID: 93959
Speaker 1: So were you--let me ask you.  Were there things that you learned about the state operation from that vantage point that you hadn't known or seen seen?
Speaker 2: No.  I--being on the [Colorado] Joint Budget Committee was a--the--I learned more there than even if I'd been governor or certainly lieutenant governor.  That was the--I knew--learned the inner workings and mechanisms of state government right there.
Speaker 1: Was there any other thing that you think--those years, 'cause that was--did you serve before you was there as lieutenant governor or not?
Speaker 2: I served four.
Speaker 1: Four years.  Okay.  Was there anything that you thought you gained out of that or, you know, that you hadn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.  I was reinforced that I wanted out.  That's one thing I learned.  I also knew that I needed another challenge.  There was not a--it wasn't that much of a challenge to be lieutenant governor, particularly when, you know, the things you want to do and you couldn't do; things you felt were right and you still couldn't do anything about it.  So I guess almost from-- since I went in there thinking that it was my way out that I served it as the way out.  And I got the job I went to two years into my term. I was talked to by this firm, and they said we want you.  And I said--eventually said, "Well, I'd like to do it."  I said, "However, I'm serving the four years, so there can't be any public announcement."  Nobody knew that I had already agreed that when those four years were up, that I was out of there.  My term was up when the new lieutenant governor was sworn in at eleven o'clock on Tuesday.  At eight o'clock the next morning, I was at that new position in New York, 'because I had to move.
Speaker 1: Now, that was with whom them?  Was that with Grum--?
Speaker 2: Grumman [Aerospace Corporation, now Northrop Grumman].
Speaker 1: Grumman.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 93960
Speaker 1: Now, you know, one other question I have for you.  Besides you, has there--and [HM] Joe Rogers-- was there anyone in between there?  Is he African-American (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Statewide in--there's never been another statewide in Colorado.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [HM Mayor] Wellington [Webb] is, as you know, a city [Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: But, Joe Rogers, who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Joe Rogers became (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --Statewide as a Republican.
Speaker 1: As a Republican.
Speaker 2: And there was a very uneasy, almost--well, very tough, between him and his governor.
Speaker 1: Right.  That's what we--you know, because we had talked to him, and he's having--it's the same thing.  That's why I was just curious about that.
Speaker 2: That's why he ran for Congress.  He didn't get elected, but he didn't run for the re-election.  The governor didn't want him.  And the governor wouldn't have wanted me, either.
Story_ID: 93731
Speaker 1: So you--so this is a whole different thing really, coming to Grumman [Aerospace Corporation, now Northrop Grumman].
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: And they are--why don't you describe what they, you know, what type of organization it was.  They're now Northrop Grumman.  Right?
Speaker 2: Northrop Grumman.  Right.  Let me start as to how I got there.  This fella named Jean Esquerry is a Tuskegee Airman, and I came back to New York to sign state bonds and to make a speech, and Jean said would I come out to Grumman where he worked.  And he was in the Human Relations Department and wanted me to speak to their officers and talk about diversity and things like that.  So I agreed.  And I went and spoke at various plants.  And towards the end of the afternoon, early evening, the CEO said he'd like to speak with me alone.  And the two of us sat and talked and had a lot in common, guy named John Bierwirth--Jack Bierwirth, wonderful guy--and he said, "You know, we'd like you to join us, like, tomorrow."  And that's when I said, "No, I want to serve out my term [as lieutenant governor of Colorado], but I'm interested if you're interested when it's over."  And we soon came to an agreement that we--that I would do that.  Grumman was a firm that had, at that point, no black officers.  I was the first and some others followed.  There were no women officers.  There was a lot of nepotism.  It was a non-union firm based in Long Island [New York], which meant that it had a high overhead because of its location competing with companies that had placed their headquarters in low cost employment areas; had good products; made outstanding airplanes during World War II, and had gotten--filled a niche in the space--in the--you know, the space vehicle, they had made most of the parts of that and the like.  So it was a good firm.  It was a good match for me, because I was expected with the CEO's support to make some changes, interior changes, within that firm; different ways of thinking; different opportunities so that minorities in the firm could look to doing something other than the lower-type jobs; and, yet, at the same time, thinking in terms of what I should help do as far as a national image in a industry image.  However, when I talked to Jack, I said, "There's some things I don't want to do.  I don't want to lobby."  I said, "That's where I was, had done before, or have anything to do with Human Services.  I don't want to be your Equal Opportunity Officer, and I don't want anything over in Public Relations."  So as I thought about it, I said, "Hell, that's all I got to offer.  That's been my history."  To his credit, and I guess his belief in me, he said, "Fine."  He said, "There are other things we can do and you can do."  And so I went with one of the subsidiaries in the beginning, the one on energy systems.  And then they sent me off to Harvard [Business School in Cambridge, Massachusetts] for that stint, and I came back and I started taking over some of the Human Services divisions.  They came under me.  And the next thing I knew, he called me in, he said, "Look.  Would you like to--" or would you, not like to, "would you go to New York--" I mean, "to Washington [D.C.] as our chief lobbyist for a period of time?"  And I said to myself, "Well, I know this is going to be a period of time until I'm out of here," but I realized I liked him and he had a need and if I can fill it, so I came and ran the Washington office and was our chief lobbyist at that time.  And--well, I saw a lot of change at Grumman: some good and some bad, mostly good.  And it was a good company.  Good company.
Story_ID: 93732
Speaker 1: So what--but this [Grumman Aerospace Corporation, now Northrop Grumman] was a new experience in many ways because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The whole corporate world is something I had no knowledge and no real knowledge of.  I've always been on the outside of that.
Speaker 1: So what was--what were the things that you experienced that were positive?  One, the money would have been much better.  Right?
Speaker 2: Definitely.
Speaker 1: And you had sort of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Also, the--I had, for the first time, you know, in a long time, I had--I might have 10-hour days; but as a politician, there were 24-hour days.  And I could go home and leave the job behind.  I'd usually take it with me, but I could leave it behind.  So politicians, there was no leave behind.  I had also experienced that as a--as the one first-of-a-kind of people who thought of me--I speak--like I spoke one time in Dallas [Texas], and a few weeks later I get this call early in the morning from a woman saying, you know, "Senator Brown, I've got a problem.  My son was arrested for drunken driving or something, and if he's not of jail by 7:30, he'll lose his job.  Will you get him out of jail for me?"  I'd say, "Well, wait, lady, you know, I'm a state senator in Colorado.  I have no power at all in Texas."  Of course, she wouldn't hear that.  "I know you can do it.  I know you--"  So I made a couple of calls and they relieved him, they released him.  He was out in time to go to work.  Well, it's like [HM Charles] Charlie Rangel.  Today, Charlie Rangel is a Congressman for the rest of the nation, not just Harlem [New York City, New York].  And so then I became a State Senator to people all over would call upon to do something in their State.  I left that behind, and I was okay, because I--in the corporate world, I was--I had enough, more than enough responsibilities within that area.  And like I say, I could leave it behind at the end of the day.
Speaker 1: The other thing is that you know what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And I also--I need to tell one other thing made me want to change.  My older daughter, who was--when I got elected [1955], I can remember we took a picture of her by the fireplace.  She's just a kid.  She came to me later and she said, you know, "Dad, I grew up without ever really knowing you."  I had most of my meals--I rarely had dinner at home.  I usually got home after the kids had gone to bed.  Gail being the oldest one, very often was called upon as our automatic babysitter for her younger sisters.  And she said, "I knew you through the newspapers, through television, I'd hear you speak."  But then she said, "There were some things I really didn't know."  And I said to myself then, I said, you know, "I don't want the younger kids to come that way."  And Nicki [ph.] was the younger one still coming along.  And that was part of another reason that I was happy in the carpet world where I was able to be home some of the time, 'cause before, every weekend I was called--I spoke for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], I did for the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi], I did for--I was all over speaking and usually it was on a Friday or a Saturday.  And when I was home in the state, there was always something somewhere else that I had to do, and I'd get up on the morning and I was off to work before they were out.  So it was--
Story_ID: 93733
Speaker 1: 'Cause I was thinking that, you know, when you went to Grumman [Aerospace Corporation, now Northrop Grumman], you were in your early fifties.  Right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So this is sort of a major change, you know, culturally and all that.  And I'm just--but, at the same time, did you 'cause I read, you started as the vice president of marketing, and then you became a senior vice president very quickly, and then you became their chief lobbyist.
Speaker 2: Vice president and chief lobbyist.
Speaker 1: So when you came to lobby, were you--did you (unclear)--did you move from Long Island [New York]?  Did you move here from Long Island to [Washington] D.C.?
Speaker 2: We moved here, immediately, into Virginia.  Our office is still at the same place in Rosslyn, Virginia.
Speaker 1: And did you--did you enjoy that?  Was it different than what you thought or was it just what you thought it might be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Just what I thought it would be.  It wasn't any different.
Speaker 1: So was that--what you said is there were some positives and there were some negatives?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Mostly positive.  But I'm still dealing with people, and that's always been my life, whether I knew it or not.  I like to a degree of dealing with people.  I also have a private me that a lot of people never know or never will know.  That's just the way I am.  I've always think that's from growing as a kid who read a lot and was alone a lot.  I still have that little private part that I don't care to let out.  And that's probably bad.
Speaker 1: It may be a way of protecting you, so (laughs).
Speaker 2: Definitely.  (laughs).
Speaker 1: It just depends on how you--  So now, when you--were-but you were meeting different types of people.
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: That's the thing.  You--I mean even--and you were playing on a-
Story_ID: 93734
Speaker 1: And they [Grumman Aerospace Corporation, now Northrop Grumman] were in the area of aerospace defense contractors, where did they fit in the, you know, the whole scheme of--?
Speaker 2: Well, actually it was a-I was getting away completely from that whole area of doing things for, you know, the environment, for the causes.  The defense industry, as quiet as it's kept, is not a peace industry, you know, and my basic philosophy is: one, I'm for peace, from the get-go.  It's--the whole lobbying thing was something where, you know, it had already become what I didn't like about it, and here I was either going to have to do it.  So I ended up doing it my way and trying to do it better.  But I also had a group of other people who are constantly lobbying, and I just stayed away from how they did and what they did.  Just, the bottom line was the thing that we needed was to get legislation to get business.  And although I admit that I concentrated on me, on the space part of our firm, we were active in the space exploration, and we were also active in the transportation field.  We build buses and trucks.  We were the world's largest producer of truck bodies.  We built the flexible bus.  We were very active in the whole area of technology when it comes to the whole computer-type things and the instrumentation.  So there're other areas in addition to the defense part of the firm that I didn't have to get too deep into.
Speaker 1: But this was clearly during [President Ronald] Reagan years.  Right?  Wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: Now, when you--let's see, 'cause it was 1979.  Yeah, in the Reagan-Bush [President George H.W. Bush] years.
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: And so what were some of your affiliations that you were, you know, needing in terms of things that had sort of stood you well, because you were--you've--I mean--I'm saying this, I don't know this, but you sort of created a new base for yourself here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?  'Cause you had done western based, and this was clearly a different group and crowd.
Speaker 2: Although I had been in and out.  You know, I'd spoken around.  I was back East speaking all the time as a [Colorado] lieutenant governor and as a state senator.  And there were people--there're politicians today who say that I'm--they consider me as their political godfather because I had been there and I could come and give them advice.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me who?
Speaker 2: Ah well.  [HM Charles] Charlie Rangel says that.  [HM] David Dinkins says that, among others.  There's a white politician, Pat Schroeder, who swears that I was her political godfather.  Just people like that.
Story_ID: 93735
Speaker 1: Okay. So you--did it just become--I mean, you left, right, in 1990, and you had been there [Grumman Aerospace Corporation, now Northrop Grumman] eleven years.  Right?
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: So had you just decided that was not what you wanted to do anymore?
Speaker 2: Well, I would have to retire the next year.  See, Grumman has a mandatory retirement for officers, and I was going to be sixty-five.  I could take that year early and could do it with some advantage, which I did.  And I also could do it in the time when I could do something else.  I can move on to something else.  I retired three whole days and decided this ain't going to do it, 'cause I'm pretty good at golf, but I don't like golf.  I couldn't play tennis all day every day, and I couldn't find enough other kinds of activities, so I came down and there was a law firm [Whitten and Diamond] down here that had been talking to me, and I joined them.  And then from--with them, I met--some things with Prudential Securities and helped them get a contract with the City of New York [New York City, New York], and then they just said, "Well, you know, you've brought us a billion dollars worth of business.  We'd like you to come in.  So I went to join them [1994] and I stayed there until they were beginning to slow down on things [1997].  And I decided I--and they wanted me to move to New York, and I didn't want to live in New York anymore, certainly not in Manhattan.  And so I came back here [Washington, D.C.] and I got affiliated with the things that I now do. So it's been just a--you know, like I said, I didn't plan any of them.  I didn't sit down, 'cause I know with the law firm in New York, I was of Counsel with a Wall Street law firm until they recently went out of business.  But I was with Prudential on Wall Street, and I went out to lunch one day and was walking down the street and here comes this guy that I knew with this law firm.  He said, "How you doing?"  I said, "Fine."  He said, "Where you going?"  I said, "Lunch."  He said, "Let's go to lunch together."  And so we did and we sat talked.  He said, "You know, we always wanted you to run our Washington [D.C.] Office with our law firm, but you went into banking instead."  I said, "Yeah, you know; by the way, I said, is that still something?"  He said, "We'd love to do it."  Right then and there, I decided I was leaving Prudential, 'cause they wanted me to go to New York.  I was coming back here, and I ran their law firm here for them, plus for a while.
Speaker 1: And which one was this?
Speaker 2: Moser and Moser.
Speaker 1: Moser and Moser.
Story_ID: 93736
Speaker 1: So, you have--you know, the thing that's sort of amazing about you, you don't seem to be slowing down anytime soon, are--have you slowed down?
Speaker 2: I hope not, although I have.  I had a horrendous accident last June [2002].  I was on the highway and a truck took the whole left side of my car, and my back has bothered me ever since.  And as a result, I've--I sometimes think I'm stumbling around like the old man that I really am.  But, not--I try not to slow down.  I hope I haven't slowed down.  I can remember when I was fifty, we lived in Denver [Colorado], and Nicki, my younger daughter, was playing out back with a neighborhood chum, and I heard her tell LeeAnn [ph.], "Today's Dad's birthday and he's half a hundred."  And I said, "Nicki?"  And I called her.  "Come in here."  And I said, "Your father is fifty.  He's not half a hundred."  And so she went back out, and I remember her--I could hear her saying, "He's not half a hundred," she was saying.  Well, on my seventy-sixth birthday, Nicki said to me, she said, "Dad, you're no longer three-quarters of a century old."  I said, "Oh?"  She said, "You're older."  So now I guess I'll be two years older than three quarters of a century come July first.  But I hope I haven't slowed down.  I try--I still try to read as much as I can, different things.  I still like to read.  I still read things that some people might consider junk.  I read westerns still.  If it's well done, I'll read it.  If I start it and it's not well done--it could be done by [William] Shakespeare--I won't read it.  I'll just put it down.  I don't want it.  I read a lot of mysteries.  I read a lot of--I'm into politics.  Obviously I read a lot of that.  I read newspapers from--I used to start reading the political section.  Then I started going first to sports.  And then I started going to the obituaries first.  And then I got to thinking, you know, if I don't find my name there, that means I'm alright.  And one day, I was looking at-- and there was this "George Brown."  I said, "Damn, well, I guess I died during the night and didn't know it."  So I just said, "Well, that's great.  So I went back to now where I read the sports, then the general news, and maybe go to the obituaries.
Speaker 1: No more politics?
Speaker 2: It's not separate.  I read that in the general news.
Speaker 1: In the general news.  Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 93737
Speaker 1: Now, you, you were successful then in your transition to make more money?
Speaker 2: I guess, although I came into the industry late in life and having to retire at that period of time, even though I got the best I could.  There were some guys who were retiring at the same time who had had lesser positions at Grumman [Grumman Aerospace Corporation, now Northrop Grumman], but were retiring at a retirement pay that was three times what I had to retire at.  And so then I'm still, you know, at that level.  And the years where I could have and should have made money, I didn't.  I--as some friends and some of my kids say, "Daddy, you were working for your peoples when you should have been working for yourself."  But there were causes and things that I wanted to do, but I think if I'd gone into--out of politics and in another line of work earlier or sooner, I might have done a lot--financially a lot better; even better off today than I am.  Might not been happier, and maybe that's a major difference.  But I would have been financially better off.
Speaker 1: And I can't help think about what your mother [Alberta Watson Brown] said: "Don't look back."
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't.
Story_ID: 93738
Speaker 1: Now, I want to ask you just some questions about your thoughts about, you know, things in general; like, let's talk about--'cause you lived a political--well, you spent a good amount of time in the political field; what do you, when you look at the state of politics today, what are your, you know, views of, you know, what it is?  You had talked a lot about, you know, the [President Ronald] Reagan--I'm sorry, [President Richard] Nixon--the whole Nixon thing [Watergate Scandal] and what that did.  But what do you see now that you find either positive or, you know, negative?  And when I say that, would you, if you were, George Brown, a young sort of strapping, you know, whatever, 20 or 30 year old, would you run for office today?
Speaker 2: I would encourage people to run for office as I still do.  There're some good politicians in the world; some caring politicians in this nation.  We need more, and I would hope and think and believe that I could be one of those.  And I think that that could cause a change in the way some things now--some way decisions are made today.  Yes, I'd probably run, but I'd probably work harder in encouraging others to do it with the similar kinds of energy and views and would work like hell for change.  It doesn't make me happy to see the way we reach decisions.  We can declare war so easy and not declare efforts for peace with the same kind of energy.  We make fiscal decisions that are absolutely ludicrous when you think of terms of who gets help and who doesn't.  Just looking at a graph in the morning paper, that the rich are richer; and as we've always known, the poor are poorer.  And there's a bigger graph--gap.  The racial gap, as quiet as it's kept, is wider than it was unfortunately.  And yet we've got good people in government.  Good people in the private sector.  I don't know if enough of them have the backbone or what.  I just don't know why, but yeah, I would do it.  I'd go after it, but I'd probably make sure I had a whole lot of others doing it, too.

Speaker 1: Now, are there people that you see as sort of rising stars or you have--or--I don't know--do you have a great deal of respect for?
Speaker 2: Today?
Speaker 1: Mmhm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I have great respect for people in different fields.  I have a lot of respect for [HM Charles] Charlie Rangel.  I think he's a wonderful guy, good politician.  He can make you laugh and yet make you think at the same time you're laughing.  There's [Kenneth] Ken Chenault with American Express.  I think he's a great young man.  Got a lot of ideas and a lot of energy.  He's got a good wife [Kathryn Chenault], and I think the sky's the limit for Ken.  There's a guy named Dr. Turnbull, [HM] Walter [J.] Turnbull, who is Director and CEO of the Boys' Choir of Harlem, has and send out into the world so many young men and women every year; 98 percent of those going to the academy are graduated--as a graduating class, which is a phenomenal figure.  There are--I like [HM] Alexis Herman.  You know, I thought she was really great in government, and I think she's got great potential to be even greater wherever she is and wherever she goes.  There're some young athletes that I think recognize that, while they're great-- out there playing a game, that there's a bigger game that they're going to have to play and have meaning.  There's a guy named Warrick that's playing for one of the teams who's--I think it was--he's helped eighty-three women, husbandless, whose children are fatherless, get homes; and he's given them that bit of something so that they got a home to raise their kids.  So there're a lot of people like that that I believe in and like to see go. Now you see, you notice they were all black?  And I think I'm, without thinking, I do that.  I feel that white Americans already have a head start.  So while I don't hold back, and obviously I'm on the board of trustees of the College of Aeronautics, the student profile is predominantly minority.  I'm on the board of board of trustees of the Elkins and Davis College [sic, Davis & Elkins] in [Elkins] West Virginia; there's almost no minority members in that school.  I just agreed to--I was honored to be selected as a Falcon, to the Falcon Foundation, which is connected with the [U.S.] Air Force Academy; predominantly white.  So it's not--I'm not in a black world, because I know that's not realistic.  But when I look to my heroes of today, they are the heroes that I think and would like to see pull up that part of the population which needs that kind of pulling and that kind of support.  Our young kids need to be--have those kinds of models to look to.

Speaker 1: What do you, Mr. Brown, what do you consider a good politician?
Speaker 2: A good politician.  Well, he's got to care--or she.  He's got to have the desire to be energetic like, you know, to--you got to go gung-ho night or day.  You can't tire, which is a hell of a responsibility to put on anybody, but it's there.  He's got to be knowledgeable, but willing to recognize that they don't know everything.  So you got to study, you got to work at it.  And by the way, [HM Charles] Charlie Rangel takes home a thing of papers every day and goes through them.  He's got to willing to change.  You can't just start out that this is the way it is and that's the way it's going to be and that's way I'm going to think.  You got to examine issues from all angles.  I know when I talked earlier about a line of conviction, I should have pointed out that my line of compromise, but every once in a while my line of conviction has moved in light of new information, things that I didn't know when I first drew that line of conviction, things that have happened in society.  At one point in my life, I was gung-ho against the death penalty.  Worked hard for it, make sure Colorado didn't get it.  There were other periods in my life where I was a little off and that it felt like there were some people who committed crimes that were so heinous that why should society keep them, and television and an easy life and maybe the death penalty is there; except that I know that the death penalty is not a deterrent to crime.  But it's a person that has to have--being willing to--flexibility to change as times change and conditions change.  But that energy level has to be high.
Story_ID: 93741
Speaker 1: You know, thinking and believing that's the way it is; they (unclear) like us and we like them.  Then the pendulum swings back over here--all the way over here, and there're people (unclear) then--be isolationists.  We have to be so distant that we don't have anything to do with the rest of the world.  That's not real either.  We cannot exist that way.  Somewhere in between as that pendulum swings, you got to figure a way to stop it at that midpoint to where you've got those different elements that are all coming together in a positive sort of way.  Will that ever happen?  I doubt it will happen in my lifetime if ever.  But we've got to keep working at it.  And it's--you get the people now who's got war--that's their solution.  It's war and you take the oil, and anybody who fights against us, we're gonna take them to court afterwards, and we're gonna convict them, you know, we'll scare them that way.  And then the pendulum swings back over this way, "No, we're gonna be over here and we're not gonna ever involve ourselves with anything else in the world.  We're gonna create our society, we're gonna going to get independent of oil; we don't need anything else that's elsewhere."  None of that--neither one of those aspects is--can happen or be real or we can grow as a people, not grow as necessary as a nation; there is a difference.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: Do you think that, given where things are going, that the United States is seeing its--will see its sort of star diminish?  Do you think we're at the--I mean, you have some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I think it's already.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --(unclear).
Speaker 1: There's a cartoon in today's paper which shows a guy--Uncle Sam--saying, you know, "You're going to follow me," and you got these two Frenchmen behind him saying, "Who?  Us?"  And up in front of them there's the picture of what happened during World War II when the French were being, obviously, whipped by the Germans saying, "Come help us."  We hesitated.  We finally got there, but we hesitated, you know, and it's quite a--but when you think about that, the different kinds of philosophies.  Now, we expect, because we went to the French at that time, that they'd come to us and it's not happening at all that way.  Plus, there's been some things in the--like you, I've traveled in France, and they don't like Americans, you know.  You're almost better to say you're not one (laughs).  And I'll never do that, but--and yet it's easier for me than a white man over there.  I can be anything from anywhere in the world, speak a language that even I don't understand and get by.
Story_ID: 93742
Speaker 1: So do you--when you look--well, let me ask you about what George Brown, what has he not done that he'd like to still do?
Speaker 2: I used to think I'd like to go to the moon, but I decided it's nothing up there.  I don't like cheese that well.  They tell is the moon made of cheese.  I don't know for sure.  What would I really like to do?  I would really like to be able to get up tomorrow morning and the world be at peace.  I'd just like to be able to experience that in my life, true peace, and that people truly cared for other people, and that opportunities were there for those who have the abilities to go to the uppermost part of that range of ability, that opportunity-maybe they wouldn't take it, but the opportunity was there if they want.  So that it's not anything I'd like to be as myself, it's something I'd like to see and witness.  I know I'm too old to ever live it, but as far as--well, you want to get it down to another way, is to how would I--what would I like to be.  Well, I'd like to be playing wide reception in the Super Bowl Sunday and catch at least twenty passes and score at least ten touchdowns.  I'd really love to do that and not be hurt, tackled or anything during the game, but just be a star.  And afterwards, go to Disneyland, Disney World.  Okay?
Story_ID: 93743
Speaker 1: I have great respect for Pat Schroeder and all the politicians you mentioned earlier, but she's a Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] alum too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughs.)
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She's a great gal.
Speaker 1: Mmhm.
Speaker 2: And that the story is that she tells the truth.  She came to me and she said, "I want to run for Congress, and there's nobody on the Democratic Party that wants to help me."  And she said, "You've got influence in this party, and we've got the county convention.  Will you help me?"  And I said, "Of course."  I'm standing on the street in front of my office in Denver [Colorado].  And the guy who seated--who was seated next to me in the Senate was--had already announced that he was going to run for Congress, which meant that I was going to support her over him, even though he sat there as a colleague.  And he was assuming, though he never asked, that I would help him.  And we went into that convention and we won [in 1972].  And Pat never forgets, and she's that kind of person.  She doesn't forget.
Story_ID: 93744
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite [HM Charles] Charlie Rangel story?
Speaker 2: Favorite Charlie Rangel story.  Let me see which one.  There's so many that Charlie and I have.  Charlie has a place in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and he and I go there sometimes.  And my favorite story is, Charlie was learning Spanish (unclear).  His district has a heavy Spanish population.  And Charlie was going to help us get served and all those things.  And Charlie was ordering some stuff that when it was brought in, you know, he says, "That's not exactly what we wanted, is it?"  You know, and the waiter said, "That's what you ordered," you know.  I said, "Oh, well.  Okay."  Charlie with his funny self.  And I've got some better ones than that, but I don't need to share them.
Speaker 1: (Laughs.)  That's okay.  (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Laughs.)
Speaker 1: But you know he's a character.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Yes, he is.  And he uses it in an effective way.  He gets things done that other people couldn't have gotten done.
Speaker 1: And when you think about it, you know, and the character he followed, too, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughs.) (Unclear) New York has had so--you know, and that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, Adam Clayton Powell and then Charlie Rangel, oh, very different.
Story_ID: 93745
Speaker 1: The other--what about [HM Mayor] David Dinkins?  Do you a favorite David Dinkins story?
Speaker 2: Favorite David Dinkins story.
Speaker 1: Or how did you first come to meet him?
Speaker 2: Well, back--going to New York, and David being a part of that foursome ["Gang of Four" or "Harlem Clubhouse"]; you know, there was Charlie [HM Charles Rangel], [HM] Basil Paterson, Percy Sutton, and David Dinkins.  David being the, quote, younger one of the group, and getting involved with various things in the community with the--then David and I got close from that.  Most of my David Dinkins' stories are pretty nice, calm, easy things.  And we--we have a lot of fun with other people.  We'll see each other across the room, and David will yell out, "governor."  And I'll yell out, "mayor."  You know, folks will look around, you know, "Who's this--where's this governor?  Where's this mayor? you know, and it's sort of fun that we recognize each other.  Then other people had to come over, you know, and sort of bow down to us, you know, after all, there's a governor, here's a mayor.
Story_ID: 93746
Speaker 1: You know what--the thing is, is that the fact that you start serving in the, you know, mid-fifties [1950s] and had this sort of long career and were able to see a lot of the people you're talking about, their career started really after, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Started after.
Speaker 1: --so you're a senior.
Speaker 2: And there were--yeah.  I'm regarded even, not so much as age, but as political experience, and the fact that in Colorado we had a statewide elected officer in '74' [1974].  New York didn't get one until [HM H.] Carl McCall [1993], you know.  So see how many years there were in between that, with all the black politicians and population.  So that--well....
Speaker 1: Well, just hopefully, it'll mature and continue and won't have to still be--being recreated, that's what I would like (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Of course, I'd like to see New York do more.  That's really our showplace when you talk about black politics and black politicians.  We don't have a statewide-elected official after, you know, after Carl now, in New York.  And that's kind of sad when you think about it.  It's also sad to recognize that when I got elected statewide, there were nine of us who were statewide elected.  I think there are fewer today.  I don't know.  We got the lieutenant governor (unclear) of Maryland [Michael Steele].  Statewide.  New York's United States Senator's no longer there.
Speaker 1: No (unclear).
Speaker 2: I don't know whether that education commissioner in New York--I mean in California--is still there or not, but he was statewide.  There was a statewide-elected official in Michigan; a secretary of state or something like that [Secretary of State Richard H. Austin].  But there aren't that many that I can think of.  So there may be fewer than in '74' [1974], which is--what does that say about us?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, the problem is, is that that exists in a lot of different areas.  Except the '70s' [1970s], it was a lot happening, and, you know, whether it was in business or law, and all those numbers don't seem to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: We had [HM Edward] Ed Brooke who was a United States Senator and statewide-elected.
Speaker 1: So what does that say?  Do you have any view on that?  I mean, what--let's just take it in the political realm.  What would--what has not been done that needs to happen to mainstream--because, really, a lot of this is mainstreaming?
Speaker 2: I think a lot of young black politicians have gotten, without realizing it, pushed into an area where supposedly they have the universal view.  And they aren't really--I mean, yeah, there was this black cause over here; but their knowledge of where it was and what had happened, the fact that they're where they are because of that is not hitting them as hard as it ought to hit and it hasn't made them have that kind of commitment.  I think it's a cycle, though.  I think it'll come back, because I think as they get around and they find themselves like [HM Joe] Rogers, isolated out there; like [Julius Caesar] J.C. Watts, you know, isolated out there at whatever party it is.  And I'm not that gung-ho about the Democratic Party, even though I've been a Democrat and will probably stay one.  I'll tell you another cute story is that, when I got elected to the [Colorado] state senate, I went back home [Lawrence, Kansas] for a family reunion.  We always had a family reunion where the folks--the older person in the family was the head of the family, so presided over that affair.  And she called me up and she pointed out to everybody, you know, that--and I'm a junior; I'm a junior.  I never had my real name--"Junior is now a state senator in Colorado."  And she said, "But I want you to know, Junior," she says, "if you'd run for office here as a Democrat, us Republicans wouldn't have voted for you."  So it's a--and then it was later pointed out that when I was lieutenant governor in Colorado, the lieutenant governor of Kansas was a native of Colorado.  I mean, even if we said we couldn't get elected in our home state, so we had to go somewhere else.  But, no, I think that that cycle will, and I think they'll begin to--I think they'll beginning to look more at the history.  And things like what you're doing is going to provide that kind of vehicle, that kind of information that'll make them look and recognize for what it's worth.  We never really--we allow other people to write our history.  As a result, it was not written the way it should have been or as it truly happened.  I see your HistoryMakers as being the vehicle of writing history as it occurred, as it really, truly was; the good and the bad.  And that kind of history can be used as a vehicle to help younger people coming along to there and get lessons from it.  And that the whole computer thing, which I'm frightened by the computer, and I used to curse it out because I couldn't work it, but it's there, if we use it right, as a resource to get information to us.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: What do I what?
Speaker 1: You want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: What do I want my legacy to be?  Well, I guess the problem with that is that, since I'm going to be the last person to turn off the light, it won't make any difference.  I'll be here forever, and when the rest of you are going and gone, I can then talk about my legacy.  In the meantime, I won't have any.

Speaker 2: (Laughs.)
Speaker 1: That's cute.
Story_ID: 93748
Speaker 1: Now, but what do you want?  Let me ask this--what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: What do I want to be remembered for?  I hope I'm remembered for someone who seriously made a change for the better, helped his people in two categories: his people, color; and his people, general.  I want to be able to be remembered that I helped all people, but that I did a particularly special job in helping black people.  I want to be remembered as, hopefully, as someone who helped a lot of young people reach a level that they might not otherwise have met.  I guess that's why I keep doing these not-for-profit things with colleges and universities and boys' choirs and the like.  I guess that's it.
Story_ID: 93749
Speaker 1: Now, what did your parents--can you tell me what age when they passed away?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My dad [George Brown] died at sixty-four.
Speaker 1: What year was that?  That was (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Let me see, 1970; something like that.
Speaker 1: Nineteen-seventy (1970).  And your mother [Alberta Watson Brown]?
Speaker 2: And my mom died at 80-something.  She died 1990, Christmas Eve.  I remember Thanksgiving she said to me, she said, "Junior, don't buy me a Christmas gift."  And I said, "Mom, I always buy you a Christmas gift.  What are you talking about?"  And she says, "Just don't buy me a Christmas gift."  And I said, "Mom, I'm sorry.  I'll buy you a Christmas gift."  I thought about it later, I said, "What's she trying to tell me?"  And then the next time I saw her, which was the first part of December, she said, "You know," she says, "I'm gonna join your father. Someday soon."  I said, "Oh, Mom, come on.  You know, you'll be here forever.  You're gonna be here after I'm gone."  They called me Christmas Eve to say she had just died.  Just went to bed and decided--I guess she said, "Well, you know, I told him not to buy anything for Christmas.  If he shows up here with nothing, I'll be mad at him, so I'd better not be here."  So she didn't make it to Christmas.  It's affected my Christmases ever since, but it's--this is 1990 when she died, Christmas Eve.
Speaker 1: And so your father never saw you elected to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --governor--elected to lieutenant governor?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He'd had a stroke and was there in a wheelchair.
Speaker 1: He was?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was there in (unclear).  Okay (unclear).
Speaker 2: So it was '76' [1976] when he died.
Speaker 1: Seventy-six.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what did your parents--what did they think that--you know, I have a--I want to tie it back, but what did they think of their son, the politician, the political movement?
Speaker 2: I guess I'll never really know.  My mom said to me one time, she said--first she said to me, she said, "You know, you--they call you 'Honorable George Brown.'"  And I said, "Yes."  She said, "You know," she said, "you had to get elected to get the title."  She said, "You never would have made it otherwise."  And she said it with a smile on her face.  So I don't know what Mom--Mom loved me and always supported me.  She--I remember I went back to Lawrence [Kansas] to speak at the university [University of Kansas], and Mom was sitting next to me.  And this professor was introducing me, had forgotten whatever he knew about me in school, 'cause he was saying some very nice things.  And Mom leaned over and she said, "Hey, Junior," I said, "What, Mom?"  She says, "Don't forget that introductions are like perfume."  I said, "What?"  She said, "You sniff, you don't swallow."  So I learned with my--whenever I'm introduced, I sit there and only sniff at them, I don't swallow everything that's being said."
Speaker 1: She had a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, she was a wonderful lady.
Speaker 1: --she had a thing for sayings.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes she did.  I'll never forget her.
Speaker 1: But in many (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And well-read, and--Alberta.  That's what I remember her as Alberta.  Mama (laughs).
Speaker 1: And if you could talk to her now, what would you say?
Speaker 2: Help (laughs).  I'll talk--those times that I used to cry and say, "Mama, where are you?  Come get me.  You know, your son's out here."  (Unclear)  I guess I'm out here now looking for help.
Speaker 1: But you have the satisfaction of knowing that you had good parents.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Definitely.  I had a tremendous upbringing.  They were there, and all--we never had all those--all that money, we had love, and my dad would make sure that we had shoes in the winter and food on the table.  And Mom would make sure that it was prepared properly and make sure that I did, what I don't now do, is eat everything on your plate.  I don't do that now, although I'm learning.  But I've secret is I don't put as much on my plate so that I can eat it all.

Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: I was going to ask about Montgomery [Alabama] and then I had passed it, 'cause I was (unclear) I was trying to get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Which Montgomery?
Speaker 2: Montgomery Boycott, when you marched?
Speaker 1: From Selma to Montgomery [1965].
Speaker 2: From Selma to Montgomery.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay.  What do you wannna--?
Speaker 2: So when you--what made you decide to that, to participate?
Speaker 1: It wasn't a matter of deciding.  I couldn't do anything else.  I knew I had to do that.  I'd been on other marches.  I'd been in--I knew [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], I was in Montgomery when, you know, when the bus boycott started.  I was there in the church that night when they were trying to decide who was going to lead the Movement, and none of the ministers really felt they wanted to do that.
Speaker 2: Can you--I didn't know that.  Can you explain that a little more (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: As a reporter for the newspaper [The Denver Post].  I was sending out news stories that I had to sneak out and get out some way.   We had white reporter on the other end, who would meet halfway in the middle of the night, and he would take the stories and get them out of there, so that I--marching was not new to me.  But I did not participate in the entire march.  I was very busy with official things in Colorado, so that I only went from outside of Montgomery two days before, and the night before and then into the capital.  I took my daughter along, who was then, I think at sixteen or something like that.  But I wanted her to have that experience, and I knew it would be safe--I thought would hoped it would be safe.  And I can remember little things that were, like, running along and one guy next to me saying, "Well, what are all those black people sitting on the porch over there?  Why aren't they out here marching with us?" and having to explain to him that they were marching with us, but that physically, since we'd be gone tomorrow, they couldn't get out here.  They'd be back--they'd be still here tomorrow.  I remember rounding the corner, and I think it was the Kiwanis--I shouldn't say Kiwanis--it was a club, and they had their lunch and they were on the balcony and they were calling us all kinds of things and spitting down at us.  So I heard negative things.  On the other hand, we were singing, and everybody was, while we were scared. we were also happy, because we were making something we thought that was going to create a great change in this nation and maybe even the world.  We all had that dream like Martin talked about later [sic, earlier].  And it was--I had my daughter and two nuns that I was-(unclear) to take care of--said I would take care of them.  I remember when the march was over, we had a school that we were supposed to go to, to catch the bus that would take us back to the airport.  Here I'm coming with my (unclear)--at the top of the hill, we looked down in a parking lot, and the bus is turning around to take off.  And so I told the nuns and Gail, I said, "Follow me, but I'm going to catch that bus."  I take off after that bus, suddenly it turns around and comes back, and this driver, white guy, he says, "Oh, I wasn't going to leave you guys," he says.  "I wouldn't do that to you."  He says, "I love you," and I'll never forget that guy saying that, you know, a Southerner; he had that Southern accent.  He took us back to the airport.  And then later that night, I had--I had been-gotten--collected something like $6000 to give to the Movement in cash.  And I hadn't been able to find anybody that I could give it to because of--and I was taking care of Gail and the like.  So I said, I can't take this money back to Colorado.  We had a state plane there.  Said I got to find either Andy [HM Andrew Young] or Martin to give it to, and then I've got Gail.  And who sat with her?  Who babysat with her?  She'll never forget.  [HM] Nancy Wilson.  Nancy Wilson (unclear).  She may never--not remember that, but I do.  She said, "I'll take care of your daughter."  So I was able to go off and leave the airport and go back into town and find Andy and give him the money.  It was quite a moving thing, and while the changes didn't really come that we thought were going to, and I think probably one of the worst things that happened to this nation was that Martin--when I say this, I got to be careful how I say it--made his "I have a dream speech" because even today there are people who'll say "I have that dream," and that's as far as they will ever go.  They're allowed to get off the hook by having Martin's dream.  Now, Martin intended to live long enough to make the dream a reality.  He was well aware that you sleep with dreams, you lived with reality.  But there are a lot of Americans, a lot of white Americans, I think, today, who like February, unless his January, and like to say, I, too, have a dream.  And that's far as you're going.  Now, if we killed him, otherwise, if he'd known that's what's going--would have happened to him--so it was, yeah, quite a moving event.

Speaker 1: So the second then is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Political Action Committees [PACs].
Speaker 1: Political Action Committees.
Speaker 2: I think they are legitimate.  I think if they're done properly, that they only answer to the other side, which is able to get them money, huge amounts of money in other ways, the politicians over here who have only Political Action Committees sort of, hopefully, balance it out some.  It's still an imbalance because, as they showed in the last election [2000] the Republican party must have to muster all kinds of money.  And now they want to put the restrictions on the Political Action Committees and let that side keep going strong.  So, I believe in Political Action Committees, if they're run properly, and then they will be.  They, too, can have the pendulum swing, the people around them can get carried away and get a lot of fraud and stuff; but generally speaking, there're only ways to try to balance out the resources that are there.  Either that or do away with both.  And you have government financing elections, which is probably the answer.
Speaker 1: Now, what about the electoral college?  Do you have views on that?
Speaker 2: (Laughs.)  So that we can select rather than elect presidents.  I don't know.  It's a--I would have a better solution.  Popular vote, I think, obviously is the way to go; but it's so hard to make sure that it's done right; and maybe that's not a worry.  Maybe I shouldn't worry.  It shouldn't keep us from doing it.  But you know, I would like to see the popular vote being the deciding factor.  I don't think it ever was an answer.
Story_ID: 93752
Speaker 1: The Denver [Colorado] capitol, when it was built, was built with forty-three niches; little areas for statutes and statuettes, and busts.  There have only been, I think, now four of those niches that have been filled, and my bust is in one of those.  And it was done by a group that got together, got the legislative permission to do it, and then they decided to find a sculptor to do my bust.  And they came to me and they said, "We don't--we want to make a nationwide, maybe an international search."  I said, "No you're not.  You're not going to do that."  I said, "There's a guy in this town named Dwight."  And I said, "I insist--" Now, he's never done a sculpture.  He was always--at that stage, he'd only done things with metal, and I said, "I want him to do it."  And they said, "Are you crazy?"  I said, "Well, maybe I'll look bad, but I want him to do it."  And he did it.  And I have a copy of it, and it sits right there in the capitol.  And it started Dwight, [HM] Ed Dwight, on his career of sculptures.  And I'll never forget.  So I--that's another one I think I started out, and I can someday look back and say, "Well, I helped make him--and all the different sculptures that he's done since, I can say, I'm a little bit of piece in there because of what I did."
Story_ID: 93753
Speaker 1: I want--I have--I talked about the diversity of people, you know, that I found in Denver [Colorado], and I say this in the context of how, you know, our history often is viewed in our urban areas or our Southern areas.  There's a focus and even sometimes the focus just on-- as black history was just the Civil Rights.
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: Why has--what happens in an area like Denver that can create sort of this diversity or freedom or allows for someone with three percent to be elected?  You know, or of, you know, a black mayor [HM Wellington Webb] to be elected in sort of three terms when--do you think there's a lesson in that?  You know, I mean, what happens there that allows that when the perception in any other place is that you have--I'm not saying you're the only--you know, I mean, it happened in Seattle (unclear).
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: But what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He [HM Norman Rice] was from Denver, by the way.
Speaker 1: He was from--
Speaker 2: Born and raised in Denver.
Speaker 1: See?  (Laughs.)
Speaker 2: (Laughs.)  You've got a picture of the two of us over there somewhere.
Speaker 1: That is--I'm just saying, what happens in a place like that that may be a lesson for other places, because--
Speaker 2: By the way, he calls his political godfather, too.  There is no set prescription that you can follow in every community and say, this is the prescription and you follow it and you'll get there.  It takes different kinds of--like Denver came--the period of Denver which stated this was a group of liberal whites, actually, who were stronger than the blacks and a group of blacks who were willing to be led and to follow.  You know, it's--if you want to follow, you got to have a leader, and you got to be able and willing to follow the leader.  A population that was willing to help blacks, young blacks, grow; was like the Dr. Lawson I talked to you about, whose dream was that Denver would be what it is at that period, and stuck in there and made sure that the little things that have to happen.  Denver didn't willingly do it.  You know, it was drug into it scratching and screaming to a degree.  If you ever get a chance to look at that in the "Denver Post" for the series of articles that I did on Jim Crowism, right before I got elected, the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] was segregated; right before that, the theatres had been segregated; the restaurants were--had discriminatory practices.  Somehow, some reason, some of those quote "evil forces," like [President George W.] Bush has that description of evil, stepped back and weren't as aggressive as they might have been.  I don't--I'll never know for what reason.  The labor union became liberal-led as opposed to being conservative-led.  That was part of that.  You had all of those--we talk about coalitions.  You had all those little things coming together as a part of a coalition that somehow came together about the same time and created an atmosphere and a feeling that turned out to be beneficial to the lesser groups.  And you had people in the upper groups who got pleasure out of helping that happen.  So it's--and would it--and you got--well, what I'm saying, I guess, is that you have to develop a prescription for each community that will fit that area to make it make that kind of growth, but you need--in order to develop that prescription, you gotta have some people with vision; some people with strength; and they got to be a diversified group to begin with.  That's another thing that I talk--that Denver [Colorado] had, you know.  It wasn't just the black community going out to do it.  It wasn't just the liberal white community doing it.  It wasn't just a group of whites--superior folks saying, "Well, we're help make this happen."  It was all of them coming together in some sort of a coalition; the better people in each group.  And people who were not necessarily concerned with the personal rewards, you know, in that was like Doctor Lawson.  Doctor Lawson could have been elected to--in my place, to the [Colorado] Legislature and the State Senate.  Wasn't where he wanted to be.  He knew he could make his contribution otherwise, and he did.
Story_ID: 93754
Speaker 1: We're moving, you know, increasingly into what people say is a "multicultural society."  Not to say that racism, will ever, disappear.  But, you know, we've--I'm not even saying the gerrymandering doesn't exist at some point.  The way they're drawing up those districts.  But even, you know, I find, like, you're in Chicago [Illinois], some of the, you know, politicians are finding the way their wards are going that they cannot rely on that same central base.  So what I'm asking is can places like Denver [Colorado] serve as a template for the African-American, you know, politician, if, you know, of the future?  Is there--if there is to be, you know, such?
Speaker 2: Can, yes.  Will happen, probably not.  One of the elements that you need to get where you're going is people who have no self-serving needs or willing to sacrifice the time and the effort just to make sure other people in other conditions happen.  And they don't necessarily have to move with it. And there aren't a whole lot of those people in the world, certainly not a whole lot of people who are black today who have that kind of thought.  And if they do have that kind of thought, the other people don't believe they have that kind of thought.  They think they're just as selfish as they are.  You have to also have a general minority population that's willing to follow and to trust that leader, you know, and to get out and to be with them, you know.  You got [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson, and there more detractors in Chicago than ever before.  If [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.] had lived, he would not have been as successful as he was in death.  And that's sad, but that's true.  And he would have been an unhappy man, you know, the--that tent city thing.  I went back and I cried when I went back to--I didn't stay in the tent because it was cold.  I grew up in cold places.  I went back to the warm hotel.  But anyway, I cried because, you know, here was a guy who was so dedicated and who was saying, you know, "I'm going to suffer here and if I suffer enough, somebody's going to see it and they're going to feel bad about it and they're going to do something."  We weren't doing a dang thing about that.  What we call the city?  What was it called [Resurrection City]?
Speaker 1: Was it the Poor People's March [sic, Poor People's Campaign]?
Speaker 2: Poor People's March (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and the tent city right there in the--below the George Washington Memorial [Washington, D.C.].  But--oh, by the way, though, I'll tell you the (further end) when I got back to the hotel and I cried, I gathered up my stuff and I went back out and I spent the night in a tent.  I loved him that much.  But he would have--he would have been devastated to know that his dream wasn't going to happen in his lifetime, that already forces were working to overthrow it and overturn it, both black and white.  So he had to die.
Speaker 1: What do you think he would say if he saw today?  I keep wondering.  What do you think about today?
Speaker 2: I have a dream (laughs).  I just--I try sometimes not to even think about it.
Story_ID: 93755
Speaker 1: It just bothers me that there are so many greedy people, politicians and otherwise, corporate leaders, nonprofit, not-for-profit people, whose own--the bottom line for them is what they get out of it.  If something else happens beneficial, okay, so be it.  But the bottom line is--and then you got people over here who have no bottom line.  The bottoms fallen out for them.  And how are you gonna make these people over here care enough.  I know, my grandmother, who was an Indian, I told you, Cherokee Indian, and she swore that her tribe had this saying, that a tear drop is colorless--I'm trying to remember the whole thought.  I used to use it in speeches.  But we all cried in the same language when we were born; in other words, you know, we all cried the same colorless tears, and we don't recognize that today.  We think some people in cry green tears 'cause they got lots of money; black tears because that's where their head is; multicolored tears because they truly believe in diversity.  And there are people who truly believe in that and want to see it.  And, you know, the majority of Americans.  And that's--and you know, if I didn't believe that that was a possibility, and I would have given up and I haven't given up, I think that basically most people have good inside.  I really believe that basically most people.  Now that doesn't mean all people.  I think basically there are some people never good within them.  But I think if somehow we can bring--you're talking about the city that could come-- somehow bring those people of goodwill together and use the goodwills to make decisions and the like, then we could start building that society that would be very healthy and helpful.  It's not going to happen in my lifetime.  Like I told--my aunt Hattie lived to be 106.  My uncle Nibbs [ph.] lived to be 114.  I'm going to beat them both.  I'm going to live to be 220.  That's what their combined years were.
