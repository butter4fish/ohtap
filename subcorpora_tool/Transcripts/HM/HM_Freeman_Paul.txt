Speaker 1: Adele Hodge is the interviewer, that's me, and the camera person is Matthew Hickey.  Dr. Freeman, can you give us your full name and spell it?
Speaker 2: Paul Douglas Freeman, P-A-U-L D-O-U-G-L-A-S F-R-E-E-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: And can you tell me where you were born and the date?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was born in Richmond, Virginia in the late '30s [1930s; born January 2, 1936].
Story_ID: 7395
Speaker 1: Give me your mother's full name, her birthday if you know it and tell me where she was born.
Speaker 2: My mother [Theola Freeman] was born in North Carolina in Fayetteville, North Carolina.  And I'm from a family of twelve siblings, I'm next to the youngest.  And so, my parents, both parents are deceased.  But I have to tell you that I don't remember her date of birth.  I know that she was eighty-seven when she died and that was about eighteen, twenty years ago.  And also you know I kind of avoid keeping track of exact dates because I have a kind of phobia thing that we're all younger than we are.  So I really don't remember her birthday but she was born in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And your father's full name?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Louis Willis, Louis--we use the name W, but--Louis W. Freeman and he was also born in the south in Richmond, Virginia where I was brought up.
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: Well there were twelve in the family.  There are nine living now and I was number eleven if you go from the top to the bottom.  I have a sister that's three years younger.  I remember the three years.
Story_ID: 7396
Speaker 1: What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color, that's very interesting.  And you know to be honest with you in all the interviews that I ever had, no one has ever asked me my favorite color.  And I have several colors that I like, black being one, white being the other and everything in between.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: You know in terms of cuisine, I would say that it's Chinese food.  I like very much to seek out Chinese restaurants in different cities and different countries.  And there are outstanding Chinese restaurants in Chicago [Illinois], but in my actually residence, I have a dual residence, Chicago and then Victoria, British Columbia.  They are a city of about three hundred thousand.  There is a Chinese restaurant that rivals even the one in Chicago.  It's amazing--there can be in small cities, so it depends upon the chef.
Speaker 1: And what is your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Home, and, and I say that with great glee because in fact I have an apartment in Chicago, in downtown Chicago on the 42nd floor, which makes it one type of environment.  And then I have a, a house in British Columbia, in Canada, where I was music director during the '80s [1980s], so we kept the home there because it's such a beautiful part of the world.  And seeing as I had to have home base, we decided this would be home base as well as any place else because I also have to commute to Prague and the Czech Republic which was stated, I am music direct of the Czech National [Symphony] Orchestra.  Now having to travel so much to those destinations plus guest conducting in other places, never had an opportunity to go home, that's my favorite vacation spot.  As a matter of fact it's interesting because we have also a timeshare in Las Vegas [Nevada] and we try to go there once, at least once a year, once or twice a year.  My hobby by the way is blackjack so I like that environment where you'll have a, a large selection in Las Vegas.  But you know for the last year, as a matter of fact maybe two years, we haven't been able to go.  And my wife says to me, "Why?  You like Las Vegas so much."  I said, "Yeah, but I like home better, to stay right there."
Speaker 1: Okay, great.  Okay, what is your favorite philosophy or saying?
Speaker 2: Well in the broad sense I try to be as--should we stop?
Speaker 1: (Interruption in tape).
Speaker 2: Okay, we're ready.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You asked me my general philosophy I think that was the question.
Speaker 1: Your favorite saying, um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Well I try to be very optimistic and sometimes that's not easy.  But I do believe that if you convert your energy into the positive approach as opposed to using or wasting time thinking in a negative way almost about anything, that it will make you not only a stronger person but you will be--accomplish much more in whatever you're trying to achieve.
Story_ID: 7397
Speaker 1: Let's start with your grandparents.  Which grandparent do you remember most?
Speaker 2: Now my grandparents would of necessity be quite aged when, when I was growing up.  But I do remember my mother's [Theola Freeman] mother.  I remember my mother's father, I'm sorry, my mother's father and my mother's grandmother which would be my great grandmother.  And I remember her only in her nineties as she was sitting on the porch in the farm in Virginia not too far from Richmond [Virginia].  And she was stating the fact that, "Billy, I will meet you soon."  So she was near the end but she was referring to her husband.  And she would tell us that she was probably in a state of dementia.  But that's what I remember about my great grandmother.  Now I remember my grandfather, the father of my mother and interestingly enough my father's [Louis Willis Freeman] parents had, had passed away by the time that I was old enough to remember.  So I really don't remember the grandparents from my father's side.  But--excuse me, but I do remember his two brothers so I mean that, that was, that was interesting.  And we called one uncle, Joe [Joseph Freeman] and the other, the other one interestingly enough I, I have forgotten his name.  I think it was Harvey [Freeman], I'm not sure.  But that's what I remember that part of the family.
Speaker 1: You had a good relationship with Uncle Joe?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I was quite small and Uncle Joe owned some kind of business.  And I remember at age six, seven, I was doing a little work there you know sweeping the floor and things like that for him in the business.  But it's all kind of vague.
Speaker 1: Did you have any interaction with your father's mother?
Speaker 2: Oh, well with my father's mother yes, but again--.
Speaker 1: Your mother's, your mother's father?
Speaker 2: With my, with my mother's father yes, but again he died when I was, before I be--well I think when I was seven or eight, something like this.  And I remember that he was very kind and very gentle and also he had a farm.  We would go there during the summers, you know.  We'd be anxious to get out of school, to go to the farm for the summer time and it was always very nice.
Story_ID: 7398
Speaker 1: Now your relationship with your mother [Theola Freeman], what was it like and what incident or illustration do you have for us that would show us what kind of relationship you had with your mom?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had a very special relationship and a very nice one.  Bearing in mind that there were twelve children, my mother tried to pass around her love and care which is really very nice.  As a matter of fact she attempted to conceal from us who were her favorite children and that was not easy to do on her part.  But she achieved that rather well though most of us knew who the favorite son was and it wasn't I.  But I'll tell you it was interesting because I always, when I think about her now and look at her photographs and so forth, I think you know she was really an amateur philosopher because she would have wonderful things to say: "Birds of a feather flock together," "Water seeks its own level."  All of these things, you know.  So I, I remember from time to time many of these things will come, I think oh, that's the amateur philosopher speaking to me.  But because there were twelve children in the family we were of two camps and that would be the older camp and six of the children were in the older camp, and five of the children were of the younger camp.  So that left one brother who had a foot in each camp and it was very interesting because the older sisters and brothers were very protective, and especially my eldest sister who in the sense when I was growing up, I remember her more taking care of the children, than I do my mother.  Because I remember my, I remember my mother as being you know the matriarch of the family and so forth, but my sister as being like the nanny in the sense, you know.  Her name is Theola [Freeman] and she passed away when she was, I think fifty-eight, fifty-nine from cancer.  And she was wonderful in, in bringing us up and being with us and taking us to church and that kind of thing.  I do remember though often she would pinch us when we started laughing in church.  So something would get us funny and we couldn't stop laughing and Theola would just pinch, you know pinch away.  She would be sitting in the middle and she would pinch on each side.  So, and I was usually at one side being next to the youngest, you see.  But see that was the interesting thing.  Now you asked me about the interaction to the parent or the family?
Speaker 1: Your mother's relationship?
Speaker 2: Oh my mother's relation, yeah that's the track that we were on.  My mother thought that I was kind of weird.  I think that's a good word.  Because all of the children in the family studied a musical instrument but not one of them decided to become a professional, you see.  And as a matter of fact, the thirteen child that I didn't mention, died when she was age seventeen before I was born.  And she was a piano major and had been accepted at the New England Conservatory [Boston, Massachusetts].  And in those days that was an accomplishment.  Her name was Carlotta [Freeman], but unfortunately she had a brain, tumor of the brain.  And at that time you know it was very difficult to solve those things or cure them so she passed away just before she went into the conservatory.  And I think that that made a profound impact on my mother even more than my father [Louis Willis Freeman].  And so she was instrumental, it seemed that we all studied musical instruments of some sort.
Story_ID: 7399
Speaker 1: I was the only one that would stay in the house and practice.  I started age six and a half, seven playing the clarinet and by age fifteen, I wanted to become a symphony orchestra conductor and I'll tell you how that came about.  It was interesting because at that time we didn't have FM radio, we had AM.  And the, the important programs which came on the radio each week were NBC [Symphony] Orchestra with [Arturo] Toscanini, the New York Philharmonic, Metropolitan Opera [New York, New York], things of that sort. And that was the music that surrounded us.  My parents [Louis Willis Freeman and Theola Freeman] really didn't like popular music that much so this was the environment in which we were raised.  And she [mother] would often say to me, "Now Paul, it's very important that you go outside sometimes and even play with your peers you know, it won't hurt."  But, but I was practicing constantly and writing music and thinking music and listening to music and she couldn't figure out you know because I was different in that respect from all of the other children.  They all practiced and then they were gone.  They were ready to play.  So she, she talked to me from time to time and asked me questions like "Why do you do that?"  And I wanted to do some rather how do you say, rather simple inventions which today I mean I'm not, I mean with the technology it's nothing today.  But I had the idea that it was maybe, be closer to the synthesizer.  You know how the synthesizer makes sounds of various instruments?  I had the idea that I could develop a clarinet that would play without a person.  So I devised a little gadget whereby you know the rubber tips that you put on your finger to turn pages, would put them on some wood as the fingers and a, a, had a pumping device and I had a bellow you know for the air to go into the clarinet and I would pump and that, it would play a little bit so I was thrilled.  But she thought that's really weird you know.  And the most fascinating as I remember because this was all an interaction with, with my parents about this as well, was when I read in the--at age twelve you see my, my family was very strict about our, earning our own money.  We didn't have any allowance we had to earn our money.  And it was not because our father couldn't give us that because he owned a fruit and vegetable retail and wholesale and they sent their fleets back and forth to Florida.  He had seven or eight large vans that would go--you know, trailers--that would go back and forth to Florida and bring the fruits and vegetables.  And that, at that time for an African American to have a business like that to sell wholesale to restaurants and department store restaurants, that was quite you know significant at that time.  And I remember because my father traveled so much a lot of our dialogue was through writing notes.  So if we wanted something, if we wanted to purchase something my mother would say "Well, write Dad," we called him Daddy, "Write Daddy a note."  And so I remember I wanted to purchase a Rhesus monkey and I saw it advertised for $17.98 in a magazine.  So I really became very excited about that and I asked my mother if I could use the money from my paper route to purchase this Rhesus monkey and she says "Well, ask your father," because she knew what my father would say.  But my father was traveling.  I left a note, it took about three days and he finally in the night you know when he came in late, he wrote the note and he answered, "If you have the money you may purchase the monkey."  By that time the monkeys had been sold and I was devastated because my plan was first to buy a female Rhesus monkey, then to buy a male to then develop a monkey band.  To have the monkeys play an instrument you see.  And so even as a child I had the idea of ensemble concept, playing together.  And, and one reason that I gravitated to the clarinet rather than the piano where I started at age five is because I felt that I wanted to play an instrument with other people, with other, you know with groups, not just alone.
Story_ID: 7400
Speaker 1: So what kind of relationship did you have with your dad if anything?
Speaker 2: That was, well I'll tell you it was a very interesting one because there were eight boys and four girls in the family.  Now mind you I was the youngest boy now so all seven of my brothers worked in my father's [Louis W. Freeman] store in some form or fashion.  It was obligatory.  They had to work and, although they were not paid very much money.  But that's why they were so upset when my father did not require me to work because he says, "Paul has to study his instruments, you see."  And it was interesting because when I started the clarinet at age seven, Tony Howard came about.  It was at Christmas time and Santa Claus brought two instruments, clarinet and trumpet.  And now my brother was, the one that's two or three years older than I am, the two of us wanted the trumpet because there were three valves.  And we thought that these were the only three notes and it would be much easier to learn the trumpet.  The clarinet has many notes and so we were lazy and we thought we both would have the trumpet.  We didn't know that in fact the trumpet was more difficult because you developed with your, you played it with the embouchure changes, not just the three valves in different combinations, you see.  So when Santa Claus brought the instruments it was very interesting because we weren't sure they were going to be there.  We didn't know which ones they were going to be.  Interestingly enough he had seniority so he got the trumpet and I had to settle for the clarinet.  Well, that was okay because in fact we both studied in public school music program and after the first year the music teacher said to my mother [Theola Freeman], "Look, your son is talented.  And I would be happy to give him private lessons."  Well she says, "But you know it's not a matter of affording the seventy five cents is what it cost for a whole hour, it's not a matter of, of satisfying that," but she said "It's not fair to the other brothers and sisters."  Now you see there is no preferential treatment, you see.  So the music director's name was Maurice Williams.  I remember so keenly because he played a strong influence in my musical life in the early years.  Maurice's major instrument was violin.  He played some of the other instruments, so for a number of years I studied with him, but then at age thirteen he says you know, "My specialty is string instruments so you should study with a professional clarinetist."  So he arranged for me to study with F. Nathaniel Gatlin at Virginia State College [now Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] which was about seventeen, eighteen miles away but he had to take the bus anyway to Petersburg.  And so each week I would take the bus to Petersburg to have specialized private instructions and after a short period of time Dr. Gatlin invited me to play in the band and then the orchestra.  But here I was thirteen, fourteen years old doing that, you know, a little kid playing in the college band and orchestra so I was very proud.  And going back to Maurice, he said to my mother, "Look, if you don't want to have preferential treatment, I will give Paul the lessons and I won't charge him.  And if he does well during the first year then the second year, someone will have to pay me."  So, she said "Well he has to work it out."  So I earned my own money by selling papers and Christmas cards, you see, to pay for my music lessons.  Now so that was his way of doing it, said, "I'll teach him the first year."  But of course things went very well and we never stopped.  We just kept going.  So it was interesting how my mother handled that situation.
Story_ID: 7401
Speaker 1: It must have been terribly interesting growing up in the Freeman household?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so.  And see, another thing is just when the older camp had some problems to discuss with my mother [Theola Freeman] or father [Louis W. Freeman], they would isolate themselves in a room.  We had two stairs in the apart--in the house and the younger kids were not allowed in discussions.  See it's not like today when you have a family council.  They had a family council but only with the older kids.  We were too young.  We were not quite clever enough to understand the problems of life you see.  So, what we would do is we would go to the radiator and put our ear down to see upstairs and listen to see what the latest developments were, what the latest developments were.  And that was interesting you know to see and then of course after a while our parents caught on, they changed the room.  So it was very interesting.  And then the one brother, Charles, what--Charles is one of the three of my brothers who has passed away also.  He died of a heart attack--he worked so hard.  He received his [doctor of] jurisprudence degree [J.D.] from Harvard [University Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  First the undergraduate work in law he did at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  And it's interesting because at first he wasn't accepted at Harvard so he went to Boston--then he went to Boston University.  He was first in his class so then he was accepted at Harvard and then he became first in his class there.  And, and that was during the time of the [President Dwight] Eisenhower administration at which time he became a member of the [U.S.] Department of Justice.  And you know at that time all of this was ground breaking so I have to say that the brothers and sisters all went to a university.  We didn't--it wasn't a thought of whether or not did we go to college.  It was just a part of your education or training and they surfaced in different areas.
Story_ID: 7402
Speaker 1: I have a brother who is Dr. Thomas F. Freeman who has been on the faculty at Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas] for a number of years.  He was also on the Rice University [Houston, Texas] faculty and he developed a debating team.  And one of his earliest debaters was Barbara Jordan and that's very interesting because he has, over the years he still has the debating team.  They are international champions.  They won first place in London [United Kingdom].  They go each year to a foreign country, London and Paris [France].  They came to Prague [Czech Republic] one year, they won there and that was interesting because it was two years ago he--they had the international debate, debating society in Czech Republic and we arranged this so that it could be at the time of one of our concerts.  As a matter of fact it was a special concert that he performed at the castle in Prague so it was very impressive.  And I invited my brother Thomas who has a Ph.D. in homiletics from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], the specialized field of preaching as his degree at the University of Chicago.  And so--.
Speaker 2: Can you tell me what kind of preaching is homiletics?
Speaker 1: Well see, he wrote a dissertation on John Brooks Phillips, I think is the correct name, a theologian and that's, that's just a fancy word really for speaking, public speaking, you see.  And that's how they classified the degree.  But it's interesting because he was, he was very much into oration and therefore the debating team that he was head of the department of philosophy at Texas Southern.  And the reason that I'm mentioning this to you is because I invited him to narrate with the Czech National [Symphony] Orchestra with me in Prague at the castle.  It was very moving because it was the first time that we had performed together and actually it would, it would have marked the only occasion that I would have performed with someone in my family because in fact I have a niece who is the daughter of Arthur Freeman, her name is Cheryl Freeman who has had quite a few roles on Broadway [New York, New York]. And see she, when she was studying at Oberlin [Conservatory of Music, Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], I remember my brother Arthur and his wife, his wife Aretha [Freeman] asked me to listen to her when I was associate conductor of the Detroit Symphony [Orchestra, Detroit, Michigan].  And she came from Oberlin to sing for me and I thought what a beautiful contralto voice she has.  And I said "At least we have a talent in the family that I can promote, you know, family!"  And but she says "Uncle Paul my problem is I want to go into music theater and my parents want me to go into operatic singing."  So I talked with them and I said "You know the way that it works usually is the person is most successful doing what he feels or she feels she needs to do."  And she felt the need to go into music theater and as a result she has appeared as the Acid Queen in the rock opera, 'Tommy' and she appeared in the Duke Ellington production on Broadway and several productions.  And recently, well you know it's not so recent, a few years back but 'Hercules', the Walt Disney [Company] production, she was one of the voiceovers for that. And so but, but we've, we've tried to perform together but it would, I've never been able to quite arrange it because if she were an operatic singer it would have been easier.  But--so therefore with the brother Thomas was the only opportunity that I performed with someone in my family and that was really a very special occasion for both of us.
Story_ID: 7403
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your elementary school years.  What kind of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Wow, you're taking me back quite a few years.  I have to try to remember that.  I went to an elementary school called Navy Hill [Elementary School, Richmond, Virginia].  Navy Hill was the name of the school just like the [U.S.] Navy, hill.  Now I think there was a Navy Hill section in Richmond but this school was close to where we lived.
Story_ID: 7404
Speaker 1: Navy Hill School [Richmond, Virginia], it made you think of a joke you heard the other day.
Speaker 2: Yes.  This couple had returned to their elementary school for the 50th anniversary.  Now I guess this, I could say really they had returned for the 70th anniversary.  I mean I'm not that old but in order to make the joke work.  So they were like the eighties, see.  And they had a wonderful time at the reunion and as they were coming, as they were walking from the reunion home a Brinks [armored] truck stopped and out fell a bag of money.  And they grabbed that bag and they ran home, counted the money they had over fifty thousand dollars in that bag.  And so the husband said "Of course we'll return it to the policemen.  We'll give it to the policemen."  And the wife said, "No way, said I'm hiding this money in my attic."  And so the, the husband said "But you know two or three days you watch, policeman is going to come around checking."  Sure enough two policemen came to their house and they were going from door to door to check to see if anyone had found the money.  And when they arrived there at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Jones then Mrs. Jones said "No, no we haven't seen the money."  And Mr. Jones said "Oh yes, we received it."  Said, "My wife hid the money in the attic."  And so Mrs. Jones said "You know said my husband is getting a little senile.  Why would I hide the money in the attic?  That's the most obvious place."  And so the policemen said "Well Mr. Jones we're going to have to speak to you alone."  So they took him to the side and they said "Now start the story from the beginning, what happened?"  And Mr. Jones said "Well three days ago when we were walking home from elementary school," and they said "Oh man you are senile."  (Laughs). So she was able to keep the money (laughs).
Speaker 1: So speaking of elementary school--.
Speaker 2: And walking home.  That reminded me of my first day in school. Excuse me. First day in school, now my younger sister--okay so she must have been like three years old if I was six.  And I, oh yeah, I remember now I was six because my, Jan--my birthday is in January so I had to, I had to wait until the next September to enter.  So I was six and a half, that made my sister then three and a half, almost four.  And I remember we were very close and the two of us walked hand in hand to school and I missed her very much.  But I figured now what must I do because she could only walk with me to school and then one of the older brothers and sisters would walk her back home and then they would go to school or whatever.  And I remembered uh-huh, now I don't have my young sister so I have to make friends.  So I remembered my first girlfriend, her name was Gloria Seefus, you know.  She was a cute little thing.  And I hadn't seen her for years and years and years.  I've seen her once since in later life in Richmond, Virginia you know, nice family and blah, blah, blah.  But I remembered when you were speaking about the very early days, now frankly other than walking to school and meeting the first girlfriend, I have no other memories of the teachers, maybe two or three teachers.  I remember Ms. Wood in the fourth grade because of the nature of her voice, a very hoarse voice you know something like Harry Belafonte's with some vocal overlay, see.  And then I, I do remember play--oh, I remember playing the clarinet in elementary school at some festivities and it was shortly after having started playing an instrument maybe a year and a half or two.  And my brother was playing alto.  See, he had to switch to saxophone because the trumpet didn't work out for him because the mouth piece that was given on the trumpet was too small and we both had large lips.  And the music teacher didn't realize that you could change mouthpieces to fit the embouchure because he was not a specialist and he didn't think about that but he just gave my mother [Theola Freeman] the saxophone.  So my brother was playing the saxophone.  I was playing the clarinet in a band for this event.  I guess I may have been nine years old or something like that and all I remember is something happened and we were on an elevation of some sort and somebody knocked over my clarinet and I was devastated, see.  And then I had that fixed and I played a recital at age twelve with tails and all that with Mr. Williams who was, he was a violinist.  He played with me and we had an organist in one of the churches.  And I don't remember too much about the elementary school except I know that Ms. Woods, I skipped her class because I was late starting school then they skipped me a year so that I could catch up with the students who had started the year earlier, you see.
Story_ID: 7405
Speaker 1: So you were a good student?
Speaker 2: Well, see I don't remember that part but what I remember is the junior high school at that time there was a seventh and eighth grade.  I think that's right, sixth so around that and I went to a junior high school called Booker T. Washington [Junior High School, Richmond, Virginia] after Booker T. Washington.  And I remember Mr.--it was interesting because the principal's name was Mr. Booker but he was not a relative.  And I remember Mr. Booker wanted me to play clarinet for some special occasions and it was there, it was in my junior high school so it must have been sixth or seventh grade because I was then playing the recital.  And I remember being chosen as the editor of the school newspaper and you know all of that you know for young kids to come together it was very exciting to, to be chosen like that.  And then when I went to high school I went to Armstrong High School in Richmond [Virginia] and I remembered also, I remembered being chosen as the editor there because I had been editor in junior high school.  And it was interesting because after one, after the anniversary of the recently, I didn't go back to the high school for the, I think it was 44th, 45th or something like that anniversary.  But the associate anniversary was my girlfriend.  I remember the girlfriends and recently I talked with her by phone.  Her husband had passed away and she was on the committee to invite the students back for the homecoming of the high school and so she made a contact.  It was very, very interesting you know to go back all those years to think about that.  But I don't want you to get the impression that that's all I thought about was the girls because in fact there was a hiatus in which I had no girlfriends because I was so concentrated on my music.  And my mother [Theola Freeman] said "Well can't you get out and socialize a little bit, you know?"  But I was deeply concentrating on, I was writing music, studying piano.
Story_ID: 7406
Speaker 1: And then at age fifteen came my big break, you see.  We were sitting in the class one day at the school [Armstrong High School, Richmond, Virginia] and I was by that, by that time or let's see now was it--no, I was playing clarinet.  I remember it now because the principal came into the room, Mr. Peterson, I remember that principal and he said "You know Mr. Williams has fallen ill, Maurice Williams and we need someone to conduct." I think it was the band for the students for the parents, you know, for the PTA [Parent Teacher Association].  And do we have a volunteer?  And of course I raised my hand and we played about twenty minutes of music, marches and such things that were not so difficult.  But I conducted that night for the first time in my life and a maestro was born, you see because that was the night that I decided that this was definitely what I wanted to do, fifteen years old.  And when I told Maurice Williams my teacher about this, he said, "Are you sure?"  He says "You know if you want to be a symphony orchestra conductor, first of all you must study a stringed instrument."  So right away we got into that.  I was studying a little bit of violin but mainly cello because my muscles had developed you know in the finger, for the fingerboard.  I had large fingers and so he thought it would be better to start with the cello so I did that.  And he asked me something interesting he says "Now are you willing to become involved in the intensive work which is required to become a symphony orchestra seriously?"  Now at age fifteen, how much of that do you know?  And so I said "Of course," not knowing how many years of training, years were required for that.  So he said to me "Bear in mind that the only conductor of international note that's black is Dean Dixon."  Now Dean Dixon at the time, he had had an orchestra, WPA [Works Progress Administration Federal Symphony] Orchestra in New York [New York] and I think he was born in Jamaica his folks moved to New York when he was quite young.  Now Dean Dixon then could not become, was not able to receive a permanent appointment as a chief conductor of an orchestra in America because of segregation and although he guest conducted.  He was the first black conductor to conduct the NBC [Symphony] Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], New York Philharmonic and yet he couldn't get an orchestra.  So he migrated to Europe and you know went from pillar to post and then eventually he was appointed music director of the  Göteborg [Symphony] Orchestra in Sweden which was, that was an outstanding accomplishment.  Subsequently he was appointed music director of the Frankfurt Radio [Symphony] Orchestra in Germany and then in Australia, of the Sydney [Symphony Orchestra], Australia when very few blacks were permitted to work in Australia at the time you see?  So all of this was happening but it happened later on.  But at the time he was just appointed music director in Sweden and my teacher said "You know look, he spent years traveling around trying to get work and are you prepared to do that?"  And I said "Of course."  He says "Well my advice is while you are a junior in high school [at Booker T. Washington Junior High School, Richmond, Virginia] you must seek out enrollment in the finest conservatories that you can because this would be the determining factor.  I made application to the Eastman School of Music [University of Rochester, Rochester, New York], to Curtis [Institute of Music, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], to Juilliard [School, New York, New York] and so forth but the best arrangement was at Eastman so that's why I went to the Eastman School of Music.
Story_ID: 7407
Speaker 1: The best arrangement was at Eastman [School of Music, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York].  What was that arrangement?
Speaker 2: Okay, at that time you see because there were so many of the brothers and sisters studying or working or whatever, my parents [Louis Willis Freeman and Theola Freeman] could not afford to actually pay for our education so we had to receive scholarships and supplement that.  I supplemented it the first year by working as a bus boy at the restaurant at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] in Rochester, New York.  But you know some of my older, older brothers and sisters helped. They would send me money.  But I received a scholarship from the Eastman School of Music and in addition to that, supplementary funds from the State of Virginia.  Now this is the irony.  Some of the HistoryMakers with whom you have spoken might have called to your attention that some states were paying black students to study out of state, you see.  And I was able to take advantage of that arrangement and as converse and as convoluted as that was at the time, it provided funds, major funds for my education in music at Eastman School of Music, you see.
Story_ID: 7408
Speaker 1: So you stayed at Eastman [School of Music, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York] for your masters and your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Yes, what happened was I finished the, the bachelor's degree first and just at the end of the bachelor's degree as I was going into the masters program I met my wife [Cornelia Perry Freeman] when--you know we met and we were studying both at the conservatory.  She was studying organ and as a matter of fact we married just as I was in the master's program.  So our honeymoon was an extended two year honeymoon to Berlin, Germany where we studied on a free ride grant.  So between the masters and the doctorate I studied at the Hochschule für Musik [Hanns Eisler, Berlin, Germany] orchestral and operatic conducting in Berlin and those were wonderful days, a great influence on you know trying to understand the music of German composers in particular because that's the seat of symphonic music.  And we had the pleasure at the time of going to all of the concerts and many of the rehearsals of the music director of the Berlin Philharmonic [Berliner Philharmoniker], Herbert von Karajan, who of course goes down in history as one of the great, great conductors of all times.  And we, I made a log while we were studying at the Hochschule and we had attended about during a two year period because it was so easy for us to get student tickets, we had attended about eighty some operatic performances and a hundred and sixty some orchestra performances in a two year period.  So you know we were going to concerts four or five times a week.  That was a great, great educational experience in addition to other classroom work.
Speaker 1: Who did you do your thesis on?
Speaker 2: Okay, when I returned from Berlin to Eastman to do a doctorate and I will tell you in between what happened which is very interesting from a historical perspective, I didn't get to the thesis but at the end of the first year in Berlin I applied for a Fulbright [Scholarship] renewal and I was fortunate enough to receive that.  But I wanted to try to get a third year because I was just beginning to make my way in the world professionally.  However, the Fulbright Commission really granted mainly one renewal and so I was trying to get other foundation grants.  Now in the process in my second year as a student at the Hochschule, I made my conducting debut.  I think I was twenty-four or twenty-five, something like that.  And it was very interesting because as a result of the conducting debut there were eight critics from various cities and from East and West Berlin and I thought that you know my career was made but I didn't know that I would have to go through many hoops and circles before anything substantive happened on a regular basis.  And I was then invited to conduct other orchestras in Berlin, two other orchestras in Berlin and one in another country in Denmark and I simultaneously applied for a John Hay Whitney Grant and also applied for the assistant conductorship of an orchestra in Denmark, in Aalborg.  And I also, because I was turned down on the Whitney, then I applied for a doctorate fellowship at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana], the music department.  Now when I returned, finally returned to America and talked with the executive director of the Whitney, John Hay Whitney Foundation, because they had helped me up until like July, he said "You know I was trying very hard to get you that third year extension," but he says "My committee said that there's no point in spending money to train a black conductor.  He won't get a job in America."  So he told me that when I returned from the grant.  But at the same time what happened was we had planned to return to America to go to Indiana University and we took this long trip from Berlin to Le Havre [France] where the boat, where you're docked on the, the ocean liner to come back to the [United] States.  And when I arrived there I had a letter from Indiana and I thought, "This is wonderful."  I had already received one letter telling us that I had the assistant-, assistantship so that's why we were on the way there.  The letter said they made a mistake.  That I would not be receiving that assistantship.  Subsequently of course I, I discovered that in the process of applying they did not ask for race or color but when they discovered it they withdrew the assistantship.  And I'm sure that you've heard stories on and on about that.
Story_ID: 7409
Speaker 1: How did that grab you [denied a job based on race by Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] right then if you can just tell me--?
Speaker 2: Well that was, it was devastating.  However, at that point was when I thought uh-huh, the power of positive thinking.  Now I have an unusual concept of religion.  It was more philosophical because both my mother [Theola Freeman] and father [Louis W. Freeman] were very religious.  My mother eventually became a member of the Church of God in Christ and my father was a deacon in the Baptist Church so we were surrounded with religion.  And then my brother is a minister also and we attended his church even as kids.  He was older, see so I had this religious background.  But the thing, a singular most important deterrent in the whole religious experience for me was to try to understand why churches were segregated.  I thought okay now schools are segregated, communities are segregated, which, why the church?  That's not, that's supposed to be an altruistic organization.  Religion we're supposed to be loving our brothers and sisters.  So I couldn't figure it out and my mother was upset that eventually at age maybe fifteen, sixteen I couldn't deal with going to church with all of the other brothers and sisters.  I wanted to stay home to practice.  But she said "You, you must do something."  So I thought okay, I will seek a religion which is, a church which is integrated so I went to the Unitarian Church and there they had a black organist and it was thoroughly integrated the church.  And it, it was fascinating because it was that ambiguity and the religious experience that sent me on the road of probing.  And because of that I cannot say that it was only the religious experience that came to bear, it was a confirmation of the strength of religion with the philosophical concept of the power of positive thinking.
Story_ID: 7410
Speaker 1: My father-in-law came to meet us [in New York City] and he thought we were going to Indiana [University, Bloomington, Indiana].  That was the idea with communication which was mainly by mail.  You see that time lapse, not e-mail and Internet and all of that at that time.  So he said "Well what are you going to do?"  I said "You know we'll, we'll look around."  I think it will be wise if I go to [Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester] Rochester, New York and see even as late as August 4th or 5th, I think it was even later I think it was 15th or 16th, a week before school was to open, see if I could get a doctorate assistantship there.  Well I went there and I talked with the head of the [music] theory department and so on and so on.  He said "You're just a few days too late, we've given away the assistantships."  But when I was an undergraduate you're speaking about the aggressiveness of students.  I was very fortunate because at, I went to Eastman when I was eighteen.  At age nineteen as a sophomore I was handed a community orchestra that was called Hillel Symphony Orchestra.  We rehearsed at B'nai B'rith so I had students from Eastman, from the university and from the community even at that age and I remember playing for [former First Lady] Eleanor Roosevelt.  I have a photograph of that which I'd like to, I think I can provide a copy of that.  And it was interesting because even at that age I, I lost the original train of thought--.
Speaker 2: You were telling me about the assistantship.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's right.  Because as an undergraduate student I had been with the community orchestra and head of the recording department which--today the recording facilities are much more sophisticated.  But at that time we had a couple of Ampex machines and some microphones and I did the recordings and I did the recordings and recitals and rehearsals of Howard Hanson who is one of the, the outstanding American composer who was the director of the Eastman School.  And because of that relationship with Hanson when I came back I asked to see Dr. Hanson.  Now there was one day during the summer that he was in town because he like Gustav Mahler, the great Austrian-Czech composer or Czech-Austrian composer, composed mainly in the summertime.  They both, Mahler was music director of opera companies and orchestras and worked during the season and in the summer he composed the great nine and half symphonies which he wrote.  Howard Hanson was director of the school and composed in Chautauqua [Institution, Chautauqua, New York] during the summer.  I think he wrote about six or seven symphonies and other works.  But it was the one day that he was in town before the school opening and I remember waiting four hours to see him.  But his, I said to his secretary "I would wait until the night time but I must see him."  I saw him, went into his office and he was very gracious and we had worked together because I recorded his rehearsals, you see.  And so I was able to build on that relationship and I said to him, he asked me, "Tell me about your experiences in New York." And I said "Dr. Hanson the thing that's most glorifying is the fact that I heard several of your symphonies in Europe."  Now I exaggerated a little bit when I said several.  I think I heard one but anyhow that played very well.  And he says "Great, great.  Now what are your plans?"  And I said well I was going to go as, on an assistantship to IU [Indiana University].  He stopped me.  He says IU--which was a great competitor of the Eastman School.  He says "You don't have to go there."  He said "We can give you an assistant conducting, we can give you an assistantship here to work on a doctorate."  He said "You know Frederick Fennell, who is in charge of all of all of the orchestras, three or four student orchestras and bands and all that rest, he needs an assistant.  You've just returned from studying conducting in Europe.  You would be ideal for it.  How would you like that?"  Now this was ten days before the school was to open and that was an incredible breakthrough for me.  So I said I, I mean I'm, just ecstatic.  I'll forget Indiana because I hadn't even told him that I had been turned down because he didn't ask me, you see.  So what happened after that was we moved to Rochester [New York] and my wife [Cornelia Perry Freeman] got a job teaching German and French.  French was her minor and we had lived with a German family so she had picked up German and we both studied a little German.  And by the way the German has come in very handy throughout the years and particularly now because I have my rehearsal in German, my rehearsals in German and English because in the Czech Republic the older musicians understand more German and the younger musicians more English.  So that came in handy.  I didn't know that years later that would be such an instrumental part of my working experience.  But anyhow, that's what happened at Eastman.
Story_ID: 7411
Speaker 1: Now I had another break after the first year, during the first year at Eastman [School of Music, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York], this is a confession which I make with, I'm very careful about this because I don't want it misunderstood.  But, and I wouldn't advocate this for any other musicians but during that first year I had to earn money so while I was taking my classes you know as, as a doctoral student I also was offered a job teaching instruments in a private, well it was a combination music store and studio.  So our idea was to try to sell the kids instruments and get them to, to study privately and so forth.  Well I taught clarinet and I taught saxophone and of course we studied the various instruments at the conservatory but the instrument that we didn't study because it's not orchestra was accordion.  So I had some accordion students but I was always one week ahead of them in the lesson book in instruction.  But I wouldn't advocate that (laughs) but I did do my homework one week ahead, you see and that helped the first year.  And surprisingly I was, I was then recommended as a candidate to become director of the Hochstein [School of Music and Dance, Rochester, New York] Music School which is a community music school in Rochester [New York].  And I was very fortunate in having been appointed.  My salary was thirty five hundred dollars I remember at the time and of that salary we were able with my wife's salary of teaching, which was also not much, to purchase a home.  So that was our first home in Rochester.  And then the interesting thing was when I went into the position as director of a school because we had a massive developmental program including I founded an opera company associated with the school of symphony orchestra and we changed the whole theory approach and so forth.  And the enrollment over the six year period that I was there increased from 275 to almost 700 students.  Well the school after I left continued to grow and today they have about, I think it's over 3,000 students and they've gone into other facilities.  And it's very gratifying to see that we were at the beginning of this development you see.
Speaker 2: Your wife worked with you on this?
Speaker 1: Actually she continued to teach and as an organist she had a position as an organist at First Episcopal Church you know because she was brought up in that church but then she was offered a job in one of the large Lutheran churches there.  And so between us we had quite a bit of work to do, so--
Speaker 2: Give me your wife's full name before we--.
Speaker 1: Cornelia Perry Freeman.
Speaker 2: And she's a native (inaudible)?
Speaker 1: She's a, no she's a native of Birmingham, Alabama. Yes.  But we met at Eastman School of Music.
Story_ID: 7412
Speaker 1: Talk with us how you and [your wife] Cornelia [Perry Freeman] crafted those early years--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --Laid the groundwork.
Speaker 2: It was very interesting because when we were students together in Germany we met a number of young people.  You know Fulbright Scholars are chosen naturally because of their achievement in, in the academic world and at that age they might not have done much as performers or authors or writers or whatever because they're basically students coming out of university.  But we did meet some very interesting people and one of those couples was Evelyn and Tom Stewart.  Subsequently they have become, they're even now in retirement because they were actually quite a bit older than all of the other students, but they became very important in the operatic world.  They both sang in the Metropolitan Opera [in New York] and in opera companies throughout the world.  But what fascinated us so much was the fact that even when they were Fulbright students they were so accomplished that they were both given contracts for the Berlin Opera [Deutsche Oper Berlin, Berlin, Germany].  And we were friends you know we'd would go to their homes and they had the children, all the--it was very interesting.  I mention this only to say that it gave us an opportunity to get to know at that stage in our development a couple who were both singers in the same profession and working together even though certain jealousies set in because he received a contract before she did.  And eventually she, he helped her to get the contract and so forth.  They're still today together as a couple, but so many couples especially in music but in other fields could not endure the difficulties within the household of a competition with each other even, you see.  And so you can just look at a number of couples that started out and as actors, as performers, as creative people in the same field they don't make it.  But one thing that I think helped us a great deal is the fact that not just because my wife is a wonderful person but also the fact that she as an organist did not have aspirations to be, to front the symphony orchestra.  Her aspirations were more to be you know a performer in the church and then later, later a teacher as she has taught music in the schools and languages and so forth so that there wasn't the same competitive edge.  And she was kind enough to not complain when we moved from city to city from Rochester [New York] to San Francisco [California] a couple of years.
Story_ID: 7413
Speaker 1: It was interesting because in San Francisco [California] I became music director of the Community Music School [Community Music Center, San Francisco, California] there after finishing my doctorate in Rochester [Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York] and having worked there in that situation.  And while I was in San Francisco I entered the Mitropoulos [International Conducting] Competition which is an international conductor's competition at the time held in New York [New York], and there were seventeen countries represented with forty-seven conductors.  I was fortunate in having become one of the prize winners in the competition.  And when I finished that competition eight days after that return to San Francisco, I was asked to, to step in for one of the guest conductors who fell ill with the San Francisco Symphony and I had three concerts.  And this was my beginning in North America, the professional area.  Because of the fact a former schoolmate, and this comes into play now the importance of what Maurice Williams had said years ago, little do you know with whom you will come in contact at the finest conservatories that will influence your life later.  Well Donald Johanos, an American conductor of Greek heritage was a graduate student at Eastman when I was an undergraduate student.  I didn't know him well but I recorded his rehearsals in the recording department.  And after I had won the competition in, and returned to the concerts in San Francisco, the next month he came to the San Francisco Symphony as a guest conductor.  He was music director of the Dallas Symphony [Orchestra, Dallas, Texas].  We had a little party for him and we talked and so forth.  And he says, "Listen I need an associate conductor in Dallas.  Would you be interested?  Come there and conduct a part of the program and we'll talk and see if the musicians and the board and all that you know will agree with my having chosen you."  Now if Donald and I had not been from the same school, he would not have had a feel for what one learns in that institution.  Plus the fact of being a fellow alumnus, you see.  And that was then important from the standpoint that my wife [Cornelia Perry Freeman] had a wonderful job teaching in the Marina Junior High School [San Francisco, California] which was a wonderful high, junior high school, an ethnic mix and all of that in San Francisco and she did not want to leave the position but, especially to go to quote, Dallas, where [President John F.] Kennedy had been assassinated and the difference in the political and just a general environment of the two communities.  But she thought okay it's for my career, for the overall good of the family so she gave up her job.
Story_ID: 7414
Speaker 1: We went to Dallas [Texas] and little did we know that it became a wonderful experience.  We crashed all sorts of barriers.  And I remember even when we were trying to get an apartment of course we were turned down in many of the finer apartments.  But we finally decided to purchase a home.  I think it was called Oak Brook Section.  I'm, I'm not sure now.  Anyhow it was a section that was, what you call that, turnover section going from white to black, transitional section.  It was another term that we used.  And so therefore the wonderful fine houses were very cheap.  We decided to buy one of those which we could afford.  The night that we were supposed to write the agreement on the house on that evening before we went to the realtors we were entertained at a party where we were guests at the home of the chairman of the board of the orchestra who was a CEO [Chief Executive Officer] of Texas Cement [Products, Inc.], okay?  So they were talking to us and they said "Oh, where are you going to live," blah, blah, blah?  And we said "Oak Park that's what I was thinking about, Oak Ridge or something."  And they said "Wait a minute.  That's a transitional section.  You, you don't have to live there, that's twenty five minutes from the concert hall.  You should live closer."  Well that was in--the concert hall was in North Texas, North Dallas which was absolutely not integrated.  And they said, "If anybody can crash a community, certainly the new associate conductor of the Dallas Symphony [Orchestra] could."  And so I said "Yeah, but we tried and we've been turned down.  We're sick of it."  The chairman said "I will send my executive assistant to you guys tomorrow.  You look at any home or any apartment that you want to see and I'll see that you get into it."  So we looked at some of the homes that--now at that time $55,000, that was, I mean like, like 5 million dollars, you know.  We had purchased a home for $29,000, we had moved from one in Rochester [New York], $24,000.  And you know but the whole thing, whole scheme of things different you know from a monetary system so we couldn't afford a $55,000--we didn't say anything.  So we saw an apartment in the Athena Apartments on Northwest Avenue [sic, Northwest Highway].  For those people that know Dallas you will know what I mean.  That was really something near Preston Road.  It was near the home of the Nash family which had developed North Park, which is a huge area of the shopping mall and all of that and he was an Ambassador to the United Nations and so forth.  That was the section to where the, these apartments were.  Now we had to push it but, but we thought okay we can afford to rent the apartment and not have a mortgage.  So we made application and they said well you know very politely "We'll let you know tomorrow.  It's very nice you're moving into the community.  We have to you know check your credit reference" and so forth and of course tomorrow came and they said "Well you know the apartment that you wanted is not going to, it's not quite, we don't have anymore of the one bedroom apartments, see."  And then so we told this to the chairman and he said "Wait a minute I'll phone there."  He phoned.  They called back, "Oh you know one just opened up, you see."  And, but the chairman told us afterwards he says "You know I told you that you can look at any apartments or homes that you wanted but we didn't know that you would select the most exclusive building in the community." (laughs) So that was a very interesting experience for us you see.  So we were crashing that.  This was let me think, early '70s [1970s] see, before I came to Detroit [Michigan] because that was my first professional job as conductor.  Now the interesting thing is we were playing with the Dallas Symphony in the public schools and so forth and we went to this one predominantly black school.  Well at that time they were still not so integrated.  Well many of them are not today.  But anyhow the black principal, and so I remember these words ring clear in my ear, ring clearly in my ear.  He stood up and he said at the end of the program, "Well this has been a wonderful experience.  You know Dr. Freeman has brought the orchestra here, the Dallas Symphony, first time."  And he says "And I want you to meet his beautiful wife [Cornelia Perry Freeman]," and he had my wife stand there.  She was at the concert.  And then he says, "They live in the Athena Apartments behind the pink wall."  He says "Did you hear me?"  He says "Behind the pink wall."  Now the pink wall was an actual spot where blacks were not permitted to go after dark without identification.  That's the apartheid we had in America.  The principal said "They live behind the pink wall."
Speaker 2: And this was early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 7415
Speaker 1: See along with the hope, how do you say with moving from city to city and all of these things I can remember the various experiences.  And my wife [Cornelia Perry Freeman] was kind of enough that, not complain.  She wasn't teaching in Dallas [Texas] and that's where our son [Douglas Cornell Freeman] was born because the doctor told us that we couldn't have, she couldn't have children.  And of course because she wasn't teaching and very much relaxed and all of that, our son was born in Dallas.  And so we moved from Dallas to Detroit [Michigan], she didn't mind and Detroit let's see, she doing some volunteer work maybe some teaching.  But then we had to move from Detroit finally to Victoria [British Columbia, Canada] and she was very happy about you know moving into West Coast Canada which was such, such a beautiful city and the people were wonderful and so forth and so on.  And then at the end of my tenure as music director in Victoria and I got the job with the Chicago Sinfonietta [Chicago, Illinois], then I said to her "You know now it's time for us to move to Chicago."  And she says "Well you know I've moved to all of these cities and the one city that I like so much was San Francisco [California] with my job there."  She says, "I don't know how things are going to work out in Chicago," because it was a new orchestra.  So she says "Maybe you should get an apartment there and we, you know, just commute back and forth," and her mother was living with us by this time.  And it was very interesting because at that time we didn't realize that the orchestra would grow to be as strong an artistic institution as it has and then midpoint I took the job in Prague [Czech Republic] with the two orchestras.  So that's when we decided, well why come to Chicago.  I'm moving around anyway.  Might as well stay in Victoria, you see.  So that was how all of that was crafted as you ask me about the household.
Story_ID: 7416
Speaker 1: Your son [Douglas Cornell Freeman], is he musically inclined?
Speaker 2: Interestingly enough he started playing the violin when he was four and a half years old.  Now we put our son in always private schools or the best schools we could find in each community because our theory has been, as our parents, get the best education that you can, and that was the most important thing that you could give the child is a solid education.  So we started him on the musical instruments when he was in the Montessori School before Cranbrook he was at Cranbrook Academy [of Art] in Detroit [Michigan] you know that one.  And we thought that he would become a violinist because he had a natural bow arm and all of that.  But he didn't want to practice so my wife [Cornelia Perry Freeman] browbeat him, she made him practice.  It was awful.  And he practiced but he didn't like it at all.  So it became such a conflict between the two of them that at age nine when we moved, he was nine when we moved to Victoria [British Columbia, Canada] we thought, look better for him to stop the violin.  Let him take something else.  So he started piano then when he started in private school, St. Michaels [University School, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada] there, he was studying the bassoon because they needed it in the orchestra and then saxophone, they needed it in the jazz band and so forth.  And at the end I thought that maybe at one point when he, when he made the change at age nine I thought he's not going to be a professional.  You must, you must want to practice.  You don't, you can't be forced to practice and achieve anything in the performing area like that.  You have to want to do it.  So we gave up.  But do you know he came home to me in senior year at St. Michaels and said "Dad, they've selected me as, as Judas in 'Jesus Christ Superstar' that they,"the school is doing every year, big production music at the hall downtown the main hall in the city.  And so I said "Oh I didn't know you could sing."  He said "Well I did a little singing and talking for them."  And then about three or four weeks after they were rehearsing I said "Well sing a little bit for me."  "No dad."  Then comes the production and I see this man on the stage just belting out this rock opera and acting and I'm thinking, "He's going to be an actor you know."  Interestingly enough all of this still was just a part of his growing experience and now he's a businessman.  Now he went--after he finished his training in, in Canada he went to [University of California at] Berkeley [Berkeley, California].  He did an undergraduate degree there.  Then he went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and he did a graduate degree there with a Woodrow Wilson [Public] Scholarship [Grant].  And he was in public policy.  We still didn't know where this was going to go.  Today he's a businessman in [electronic] e-commerce business you see and his, their largest account is Visa [International Service Association].  So he travels around a lot with the Visa--you know involvement with e-commerce and so forth and his wife is in public relations.  He's a vice president of an international PR [public relations] firm, advertising firm really.  So you see you never know in which direction you'll go, but he loves music, very supportive and it's, it's really--because we have only the one child of course he's the apple of our eyes you know.  You know how that is.  And now with a daughter in law so very nice.
Speaker 1: What is his full name?
Speaker 2: Douglas Cornell Freeman.  Interesting he took my, we gave him my middle name cause I didn't want him to be junior, I wanted his own identity, and Cornelia my wife's name and we made Cornell out of it you see.  And it's interesting because while they do not have children yet they often speak about how they might craft the name for their son.  But you know because we didn't know at the time if he would be boy or girl I mean because they didn't have the tests as they do today.  We had chosen the name Jacqueline after Jacqueline Kennedy [Onassis] if it were a girl and Douglas if it were a boy.  So we had decided that before he was born.
Story_ID: 7417
Speaker 1: Let us for a moment revisit your professional unfolding.  And let's look at a few of the challenges there.  Name for me what you saw as the biggest challenge in being African American how you end up in this very European-based.
Speaker 2: Yes, you use the word European-based which is interesting.  Some people call it a white man's world because in fact we have many, many African Americans in popular areas and relatively fewer by comparison even today in the classical areas in symphony orchestras throughout the country and relatively few black conductors and composers.  Now this could be a very extended discussion and I'm trying in my mind to think how far back we can go so that I can tell you two or three experiences which relate to this topic.  Going back a few years when my brother [Thomas F. Freeman] was minister at the Mt. Carmel Baptist Church in Richmond, Virginia they presented annually a celebrity either in performance or in speech or whatever.  And one year they presented Marian Anderson.  I was quite young and I remember the great thrill was not just to go to her concert but to go with her and the entourage to the train station because trains were being used in those days more and she took the train from Richmond to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And I remember talking with her and I think I was ten, eleven, something like that, maybe twelve and I said "Ms. Anderson would you be the patron, the honorary patron of my publication?"  I had wrote a publication called 'Paul's Joys'.  It was a music publication and I was trying to keep up with the world you know classical music.  And she says "Why of course young man."  It was a great thrill.  Now I mention that because in fact years later after she had retired from the concert stage I had the great, great pleasure of performing with her with the Minneapolis [Symphony] Orchestra [later the Minnesota Orchestra] at the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] National Convention.  And as we were standing backstage before we went on, she narrated the 'Lincoln Portrait' of Aaron Copland [composer] which also Mrs. [Coretta Scott] King did with me years later, but this was another story about Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  And she had on this beautiful, white, chiffon dress, you know this long dress.  And Roy Wilkins was standing there and she introduced me to Roy Wilkins and then I said, "I didn't play very much attention to Roy Wilkins as important as he was but I was fascinated by this dress."  And I said "Ms. Anderson this is such a beautiful dress and you look so lovely in it."  And she says "Young man do I detect an air of flirtation?"  You know she was so regal and elegant in her speech.  It was just marvelous.  And this was, years later she had remembered about the 'Paul's Joys' you see so that was fascinating.

Speaker 1: In segregated concert halls in the south, blacks were only permitted to sit in what we call the peanut gallery in the top seats.  And it, the Mosque [Auditorium] in Richmond, Virginia seated over four thousand people, that was high the peanut gallery.  And I went to concerts with Mr. [Maurice] Williams.  As a matter of fact I saw my first symphony orchestra.  It was a National Symphony [Orchestra, Washington, D.C.] under Hans Kindler.  Maurice Williams had taken some of the students to an evening performance and it was thrilling, my first symphony concert.  So I went to hear the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] Orchestra and other orchestras as they came into Richmond but the one that I remember the most is the experience when by the time that [Arturo] Toscanini was performing his last concert with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]--with the NBC [National Broadcasting Company Symphony] Orchestra, that the NAACP was boycotting the performance because of the segregation.  And so I had the challenge, I had to think should I break the boycott line to see Toscanini or should I respect the NAACP and what they're doing?  Well I had great respect.  But if I hadn't broken the boycott line I would have never seen the great Toscanini and that was something to remember.  Now what sticks out in my mind, last work on the program 'Pini di Roma'--'The Pines of Rome', which is a work that I'm playing now with the Czech National [Symphony] Orchestra [Prague, Czech Republic].  We're touring Great Britain in some twenty-some concerts next season with that same work and I always think Toscanini that last performance.  But the one disappointing thing was the encore that he played.  The great anti-fascist Toscanini played 'Dixie' for an encore, can you believe that?  With the boycotting and all of that, very interesting.  Now my experience--.
Speaker 2: See, but that was his way of getting back at the boycott.
Speaker 1: Their way you see.  And it's really interesting because just, just after, shortly after that I won the audition in the Richmond [Virginia] Symphony [Orchestra] and the year previous to my having been chosen I was asked out of the Jefferson Hotel where blacks were not allowed to enter and the manager said, "Well you, you're not supposed to be here."  And I said, "Well I talked with the music director this morning," and he told me, we played together, he was a pianist and I played clarinet with a [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart.  And he said, "Oh you should come to the auditions."  They're quite informal at the Jefferson Hotel so I was there.  And the manager said "Well he didn't tell me about it and blacks are not allowed in here."  I said, "Well I'll wait for the conductor."  He says, "What is your phone number?  I'm going to call him on the phone."  He says, "You better tell your son to get out of here, doesn't want trouble."  Now I had to leave of course but the next year they permitted me to come to the audition.  I was chosen to play clarinet and cello, now both instruments, either or.  Went to two rehearsals and I received a letter saying from the president of the board, "Your services are no longer necessary," no explanation, nothing.  Now it was my great fortune I've conducted the orchestra two or three times subsequent to that.  Now there are few blacks in the orchestra, maybe four or five.  But the thing is you know you speak about the impact of experiences like that on young minds and as I assess what happened, somehow something within me always said, "You've been knocked down but get up, rise higher," you see.  This is the philosophy.
Story_ID: 7419
Speaker 1: And I remember another very interesting thing about, this was a positive thing about Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  I wanted to tell that story because in fact my, my older brother Thomas [F. Freeman] taught at the Interdenominational Seminary [sic, Interdenominational Theological Center] in Atlanta [Georgia], summer courses and Dr. King was one of his students.  So when I was guest conducting the Oslo [Norway] Philharmonic [Oslo Filharmoniske Orkester] and he received the Nobel Peace Prize at that, at that year [1964], again I was fortunate enough to get an invitation to go.  And when I arrived, Reverend Walker, Wyatt T. Walker, I think you may know that name, he saw me and he says "Oh, oh Freeman yeah let me get you a seat with the VIPs."  Now he had been a boyfriend of one of my older sisters at Virginia Union [University] in Richmond [Virginia].  That's how he recognized me.  And I had been his paper boy.  I delivered the '[Richmond] Afro-American' [newspaper] to him.  Small world, see.  So then it's interesting what happened because it put me on the end with heads of state.  There were African dignitaries from many countries for this and Dr. King came in with the academy in a robe and so forth and the audience stood, then the audience sat and everything was quiet.  And suddenly the audience stood again and I couldn't imagine why, the academy was there in front of us.  I turned to my left and there was King Olav [V], the King of Norway was coming in with his entourage.  He thought I was an African head of state so when he passed me he looked me straight in the eye and bowed and I looked him straight in the eye and I bowed back, (laughs) playing the role.  Afterwards Wyatt T. Walker said "You want to meet the man?"  Said, "Yes."  He pushed the people aside, took me to Dr. King and said "This is Paul Freeman, he's guest conducting the Oslo Philharmonic here."  And he says "Freeman, Freeman, you're Tom's brother."  I said "Yeah that's right."  He says, "Oh I was in his seminar.  And he says you're a musician.  You will want to meet Coretta [Scott King].  She made it in music.  You should talk with her."  So I talked with her.  She gave me her private number.  Subsequently I had her to narrate with the, with the Detroit Symphony [Orchestra, Detroit, Michigan].  You know this was a period of time lapse, but it was interesting because first of all that evening I was driving to--I don't know if it was the same evening now.  But anyhow I was, I was driven by the head of the NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] forces some place and had dinner at their home.  But on the way he had to get some gasoline so we stopped at the station in Oslo and a gentleman came to the car that was pumping the gas and said "Oh Dr. King, would you give me your autograph."  That made me realize that we do all look alike.  So, see not being as clever as perhaps we are today, I didn't give him the autograph.  So you see, I said "Oh I'm sorry, I'm not Dr. King."  I wish I were.  But then, so that was an interesting experience.  And then years later, three weeks before he was assassinated [April 4, 1968], three weeks I was in Atlanta, Georgia to guest conduct Atlanta Symphony [Orchestra] and I arrived at the airport.  It was two o'clock in the morning and I saw Dr. King and his entourage and a little voice said, "Speak to the man, speak to the man."  And I thought, "You shouldn't bother this man.  He's much too important me to go to him and speak in the, in a airport."  But something said, "Go, go speak to the man."  I went to him and I said, "Dr. King."  "Tom's brother," he says.  "Tom's brother."  He remembered that.  And he says "What are you doing here?"  I said "I am here to guest conduct the Atlanta Symphony."  He said "The last bastion of elitism.  Glory, hallelujah," and walked away as if ascending into heaven.  And three weeks later he was assassinated.  The last bastion of elitism.  It's very interesting, eh?
Speaker 2: Very, very interesting.
Speaker 1: And to see many people ask me if being a black conductor has been a detriment--and again I use the positive, positive approach.  I say it has helped in many instances for me to get jobs and projects and so forth and sometimes it has worked against me.  But it has, maybe it depends on what is in the middle someplace.  But I said you know I was never invited the second time because I'm black, you see.  It's a very interesting point.
Story_ID: 7420
Speaker 1: I was going to ask you about Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  Since you saw him such a short time before he was assassinated, where were you when you found out about his assassination and what kind of things were you thinking and feeling?
Speaker 2: We were living in San Francisco [California] and I remember hearing the news on the radio as I was driving.  I remember, and it's kind of interesting because there are some events you remember exactly where you were like September 11th [2001 terrorist attacks], of course that's closer you know.  But I remember that I don't think an incident like that, I don't think you want to believe that it happened.  You live in a state of denial and in fact its interesting because you remember him not only as the last time you saw him but the photographs that surrounded his life at that time when he was young because today he would have been close to eighty, ninety-eight or seventy-eight or something like that.  And think of what he would have looked like today and the imagery and the image that we would have of him.  But we had the image of him as a young, narrow man and it's kind of interesting you know when you look at the, the downside and the upside you know.  But the thing that happened on that trip and it's this, when I had that concert with the Atlanta [Georgia] Symphony [Orchestra] Mrs. [Coretta Scott] King was there and so were the kids, the little kids.  Yolanda [King], subsequently Yolanda has narrated with me four or five times as an actress the same work her mother did you know in different orchestras and so did Martin Luther King, III, okay.  But what struck me, I'm thinking about Mrs. King as opposed to Dr. King was even at that time she said, she came to me at the end of the program, she said "Maestro," she said "Do you have time to talk with me?  I'd like to tell you what we're doing with the Metropolitan Opera [New York, New York] touring them here."  And I thought, "For Mrs. King, do I have time?  If I didn't I would make time."  You know she was so modest and the little kids were running around and all of that you know.  I mean I had no thoughts of anything happening to Dr. King, certainly not three weeks later you know.  So it was difficult, and it was, it's difficult to think because my relationship was very limited with him.  You know just seeing him and, and--but it stands out vividly in my mind and it impressed me that he remembered you know who, who I was in relationship to, to my brother and so forth.  But you know as he has become the, the symbol and the icon that he has become, when we have our celebrations biannually with the Chicago Sinfonietta [Chicago, Illinois], we usually do a salute every other year, different types of programs sometimes with the Apostolic Church of God [Chicago, Illinois] Gospel Chorus and so forth.  I can always remember those two experiences so it has a personal meaning.  And I think why my son [Douglas Cornell Freeman] and young people of his generation not only didn't see him in person but they were not living through the whole Civil Rights Movement.  And our next generation, there won't be many people around who did.  It's very interesting as things move along and then it all becomes very much like icons you know and like surrealistic.  Did it happen?  It's very interesting because you, I'm sure you can remember the March on Washington [D.C., 1963] and what it meant at the time and hearing, 'I Have a Dream'.  Little did we know that what, thirty five years after or thirty years, whatever the distance is, thirty some years, today I've sat that to music you know and presentations and I think those are some of the most powerful words uttered by a human being, "I Have a Dream."  And the way that he did it, never duplicated, only once in the lifetime.
Story_ID: 7421
Speaker 1: Your [the Chicago Sinfonietta's] an--annual tribute to Dr. King's become something of a tradition and a very special program--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in and of itself.  Let me ask you first, how do the kids receive it?  I know you have a lot of students that come to your concerts.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think that the kids receive it very well because, because it has become a national holiday.  But again I don't think they really understand.  I mean you know it's almost now the analogy is perhaps not warranted but it's almost as if you're talking about Jesus Christ.  I mean because don't forget many black kids don't really relate to [Mohandas] Gandhi that much and there are not many other figures if you think about this, to which we relate on this level.  I mean kids don't even relate to George Washington on this level and certainly not to you know some of the other very important historical icons, but they relate to Jesus Christ.  I mean, and I know it's not an appropriate analogy but what I'm saying is this is maybe the kind of thing in their minds that they think okay the Bible and you know going to church, what it stands for and then Martin Luther King, the Civil Rights Movement, the recognition, the holiday.  Do you see what I'm saying?  But you know speaking about young, young people in symphony orchestra concerts we have a program whereby students are invited to our concerts on a subscription basis and the subscriptions are subsidized so that it means more than just coming to one concert and these are evening, adult performances.  I had a fascinating experience with a group of students that came backstage after one of the concerts here in Chicago [Illinois] and there were about fifteen, sixteen and I just asked them questions.  And one of these five year olds, I said "Oh what was the, the work on the program that you enjoyed the most?"  And she said to me the [Dmitri] Shostakovich second piano concerto, five years old.  I said, "Oh, wow that's really impressive."  And I said to an eight year old I said, "Now have you heard the orchestra before?"  "Many times," he says.  Ooh, and then I asked another.  Now they looked a little bit tired.  I said, "Oh did you sleep during the performance."  He says "Of course not," insulted that I asked him.  This was so gratifying to see the reaction of young people who had come to symphony orchestra programs and they accept it as a matter of fact, you see and that's a wonderful thing, wonderful.  And I think one of the most moving experiences in dealing with young people here in Chicago that, that I have had but it's once removed is when we sent, we sent teachers into the public schools to teach privately to students under several different types of programs that we have.  And this one Hispanic student, age thirteen said that her mother committed suicide about a year ago and that the only thing that helped her not to do that was her music lessons, studying with the cello with one of our teachers.  She looked forward to it so much each week that experience and this is very powerful.  She didn't say that about her school work, she said studying music you see.  Very powerful.
Story_ID: 7422
Speaker 1: The reason that I was in Atlanta [Georgia] was to share with Robert Shaw who was the recently appointed music director at the time of the Atlanta Symphony [Orchestra] the podium for a symposium at Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] which lasted for a whole week and which we read the music of black, black composers from across the country but other composers from the Southeast.  That, that was the choice and the committee selected the scores and we read through them in, in public performances.  Now this was a precursor to the black composer series and the African heritage series which I want to tell you how it was started.  So we had many composers there, Ulysses [Simpson] Kay, George Walker, Olly Wilson, [Adolphus] Hailstork and several others.  It was my first real experience meeting composers of that stature from my own race and I wasn't aware that we had contributed so much to symphonic music because again the white man's world.  You see I'd been accustomed to playing the music of [Ludwig van] Beethoven, [Pyotr Ilych] Tchaikovsky, [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart, [Johann Sebastian] Bach, [Johannes] Brahms and so forth, not thinking about our own contribution in that area.  But--.
Speaker 2: What year was the symposium?
Speaker 1: Let's see, now Dr. King was assassinated in '68 [April 4, 1968] wasn't it?  See that was before I had received an appointment with an orchestra.  I was still director of Community Music School [Community Music Center, San Francisco, California].  And the interesting thing is that we chose about seven of the works to perform in the public after reading works during the whole week and five of the seven were by African American composers or black composers.  And Shaw made the statement that had these composers or some of them the experience of having their music played earlier in their lives and on a continuing basis and recognition as they should have had, that we would have, quote, "a black [Leonard] Bernstein or a black Aaron Copland," I mean on that level because he was, he was really pleased that a biracial committee had selected five of the seven works by the black composers.  Well that gave me the idea of when I was appointed to the Dallas Symphony [Orchestra, Dallas, Texas] of designing a ninety minute concert for PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] in which we played some of that music and talked to the composers and so forth and so on.  And the next day after that program was presented nationwide, Dr. Dominique-René de Lerma phoned to me and said "You know we're doing some of the same work.  Why don't we collaborate?"  He's a musicologist who specialized in the music of black composers and in particular in the symphonic music.  So when I went to his office at IU [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], he was on the faculty, I didn't know what to expect but I was taken, taken aback when in fact I walked into the room and there was a white man.  I thought that Dr. de Lerma was black.  It didn't occur to me, aha, just as we have black musicologists that are specialists of Beethoven, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, why couldn't we have white musicologists that specialize in the music of black composers?  So that was kind of neat.  And then we said what do you have to do to expose the music?  The first step was of course to make recordings.  We then met in New York [New York] and we set up a meeting with Columbia Records and we were going to other recording companies but Columbia accepted the project right away.  It was just the right place at the right time and emerged in the '70s [1970s] this huge black composer series of nine LPs [long-playing albums] tracing the music of black symphonic composers from the time of Mozart to the present you see.  And the new series, the African Heritage Symphonic Series, three volume CDs [compact discs] of the music of black composers was an outgrowth of the earlier project because we took some of the same works, performed them again, recorded them state of the art recording twenty some years later.  And also then we recorded some of the music of the younger black composers so that we brought that up to date.
Speaker 2: Who was the first composer of African descent who became--?
Speaker 1: Well one of the first important one was [Le] Chevalier de Saint-Georges.  He was born in 1750.  And we have his music in the black composer series.  We don't have it in that series.  The earliest one there is [Samuel] Coleridge-Taylor, whose photographs you'll see there.  He was born at the end of the 19th century.  And it's fascinating because in each case of course its, it was from mixed marriage because Chevalier de Saint-Georges was born in Guadeloupe.  His mother was Africa and his father was the French Cousul General and he had befriended, she had befriended him and the boy, the little baby was born and the French Consul General took him back to Paris [France] at age eight, away from the mother, trained him in the tradition of France, and he became a member of the court of Marie Antoinette.  And so we see the photographs today of this black face with the white powdered wig and so forth.  He became quite an important figure in the music world in France, fascinating.
Speaker 2: So you must have had a ball just learning all of this when you--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh yes uncovering this with musicologists in various places, you know.  And Dr. de Lerma of course had done a lot of the research.  We had a lot of the music reconstructed and so forth.  And now this black composer series of course would be in the library, most of the music schools and the public libraries throughout the country.  Now of course I--Sony Records purchased Columbia and I tried to get Sony to re-release the Black Composer Series in total but they just weren't interested somehow and so I became disenchanted with that.  And then I thought aha, why don't I get the [Chicago] Sinfonietta [Chicago, Illinois] to do a new series, some of the same works but state of the art recordings.  And we got money from the National Endowment [of the Arts], Bettiann Gardner financed, a part of it and then of course we were able to do our own new series which has gained a lot of attention.
Story_ID: 7423
Speaker 1: Tell me about when you're putting together a concert [of the Chicago Sinfionietta, Chicago, Illinois], an evening, what kind of--give me the process.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.  No, well this, this is very interesting that you mentioned that because in fact I remember at the Eastman School [of Music, Rochester, New York] years ago we had a class of music history under Dr. Charles Warren Fox who is a distinguished musicologist and he got a kick out of having us not only put together programs but finding unusual works by well known composers.  And so this has been the kind of thing of fun and somehow I get a gut feeling.  And see many of my programs when you look at the people who are into music, when you look at the printed page you see the combinations and you think, "This is not going to work."  But the gut feeling that I have about the music and putting it together then brings together an unusual combination.  Now some of the things we've played as, as you well know are quite unusual.  For an instance, we played the work for American, a Native American flute an orchestra with the Native American playing the Indian flute and that was quite unusual.  We have played also the concerto for maracas in orchestra and that's unusual, probably the only one of its kind.  And there's been one tap dance concerto written for a tap dancer and symphony orchestra.  We played that many times a year on tours and so forth as well as here and we've even now a commission from Warwick University [sic, University of Warwick, Coventry, England] for David Baker to write a new tap dance concerto.  We've also of course pop concertos.  That's not as unusual but we have had from time to time different combinations that we have commissioned.  And I was just trying to think because there have been so many, for an instance recently harmonica concerto, you see.  And what I would do is to put those on a program with a regular concerto and of course with orchestra, surrounding it with orchestral works and it makes for quite an unusual combination.  So we like to do that kind of thing.  Now for our next program that's coming out with the Sinfonietta next month we have Jonita Lattimore who is a very well known soprano here doing the [Giacomo] Puccini--four Puccini arias. The second half of the program but before that we are performing a concerto for marimba in orchestra which is preceded by an 18th century symphony written by [Jan Vaclav Hugo] Vorisek who is a Czech composer of the 18th century [sic, Vorisek was born in the 18th century, but composed in the 19th century] who in fact wrote only one symphony and died when he was like thirty-one or thirty-two years old.  But it was a very strong work and so combining that with marimba concerto on paper, and then the Puccini and then closing with [Antonin] Dvorak 'Slavonic Dances'.  So we tried to do something that's more familiar with less familiar, traditional with not so traditional.  And the programs are generally a very interesting mix.
Story_ID: 7424
Speaker 1: I believe it was one of the concerts [of the Chicago Sinfonietta, Chicago, Illinois] that was being taped and you were, the music and you had the, the images--.
Speaker 2: Visuals.
Speaker 1: --[Pablo] Picasso works--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yes, that's right.  Oh you remember that?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Gorgeous.
Speaker 2: That's interesting because that's the work of the Canadian composer Harry Somers and he wrote a work called the 'Picasso Suite'.  And each of the movements dealt with the period in the life of Picasso's paintings or in the life of Picasso during the period of the paintings.  And we, we had some of those paintings project, projected on the screen.  That, that was a very interesting collaboration.  We also did the work of Adolphus Hailstork called, 'In Memoriam to a Man Who Dreamed'.  It was just the memory of [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].  And we used on the screen projections of Dr. King's activities and that, that was also an interesting collaboration.  We had recently when we honored Dr. King in this last program in January [2003], we had the Dance Negra group [Luna Negra Dance Theater, Chicago, Illinois] which is a group of Cuban dancers choreograph music to the work of, to the music, choreograph dance to the music of [Alberto] Ginastera, the Argentine composer.  And that was interesting too because it brought dancers in front of the orchestra as a kind of thing.  We used, we broke with tradition and we did not use the orchestra for the debating team for Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas] which they did a verbal presentation about Martin Luther King.  So you see we tried to do unusual combinations.  To open next season we have Cecily Tyson narrating the poems of James Weldon Johnson set to the music of William Dawson or to his 'Negro Folk Symphony' it's called.  That will be an interesting presentation.  We're also doing the world premier of a piano concerto with Leon Bates.  It was written by the Afro-Panamanian composer Roque Cordero.  Now you know when you're speaking about these unusual combinations its interesting because in fact some of these works are also takes of the Czech National [Symphony] Orchestra [Prague, Czech Republic] and it's, it's very interesting I reversed it this time because a gentleman sent me a recording of his performance.  He's an artistic whistler and you know I played this for some of the music committee and our operations manager of the [Chicago] Sinfonietta and they said "Maestro you know that's going a little far."  So I thought I would try it in Prague first in a special program last Christmas.  So I had him to whistle an excerpt from 'Messiah' and then the 'Exultate, Jubilate' of [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart (whistling) only he did it with the melismatic presentation I think that a musician--and the audience of course was blown away but the musicians couldn't believe the accuracy.  So I'm bringing him to Chicago [Illinois] next year on the same program with Bates you see to combine that, think I mean it's interesting the combinations.
Story_ID: 7425
Speaker 1: Because of this I wanted to tell you also that we're working now on a series of programs with WFMT [Chicago, Illinois radio station] which is you know the second largest classical station, radio station in the country.  And this will be syndicated to, between seventy five and a hundred radio stations in America and then ten or eleven foreign countries.  But will be a series of thirty two-hour programs which will feature the music that I recorded or I've made now, by now a combination of over two hundred CDs [compact discs] and LPs [long-playing albums].  We'll play some of that and some of the live performances of the Chicago Sinfonietta [Chicago, Illinois] as well as the Czech National [Symphony] Orchestra [Prague, Czech Republic] and that's to start the beginning of 2004 on [W]FMT and other stations throughout the country.
Speaker 2: It will be a weekly broadcast?
Speaker 1: Weekly broadcast for thirteen weeks.
Speaker 2: It's an hour?
Speaker 1: Two hours.
Speaker 2: Two hours.
Speaker 1: Two hours. And at that time we'll have, we'll have a commentator that will interview me about the music and I will in turn phone to some of the composers and some of the soloists and talk with them about the music and, and in particular the human interest aspects of having recorded the music.  So we, we think that it's a kind of a new format and we think that should take on--well they've chosen the name 'Global Maestro' for the series so that should be very interesting.
Story_ID: 7426
Speaker 1: Who is your favorite composer of African heritage?
Speaker 2: Now I thought you were going to say favorite composer in general because, because I'll tell you when I'm asked that question what I usually say is this.  Look, we cover three centuries of music, of symphonic music and generally conductors psych themselves to believe that each work that they conduct is their favorite work.  You see, this is a part of the, not only the training process but the, the, the way that the mind functions so that you can seek to provide the maximum interpretation.  But what happens then it's left to the listener to decide if you were successful and that.  But you know, you know I've worked with now so many of the African American or black composers of different countries and in addition to that so many other composers because I'm always fascinated by you know having composed myself in earlier years.  I don't have much time to do it today but I also discovered that I didn't have--that I have more to say as an interpreter than as a writer, as a composer.  So I thought unlike many people who don't have much to say as composers I thought I would stop writing and then work with people who have something important to say.  But it's really gratifying to see how people like as an example, George Walker whose music we've performed you know George received the [1996] Pulitzer Prize for music.  He was the first African American to receive that.  And I remember the early days when you know we were performing his works and he, he was very ticklish about various things and he's also very demanding.  His works are usually quite difficult.  But I was happy to see that this had happened but we also predicted, Dr. [Dominique-René de] Lerma and I predicted this in the '70s [1970s] that if we brought this music to the public there would be a spin off and the soloists who performed in the series, many of them have gone on to you know other things and important careers.  But the composers who also receive big commissions, George has received commission from the New York Philharmonic [New York, New York], from the Boston Symphony [Orchestra, Boston, Massachusetts], from the Cleveland Orchestra [Cleveland, Ohio] and Olly Wilson from the Boston Symphony, [Adolphus] Hailstork from many orchestras and so forth.  And it's very interesting to see because I remember that three weeks before [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was assassinated when he said the last bastion of elitism, and to see how that has unfold, how it has began to unfold and how significant the contribution our writers our making today, our composers.

Speaker 1: So, so you find it more fun to get--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Interpret.
Speaker 1: --the word off paper?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right than in fact to, to write the work.  I mean I've done some writing.  I did a work for the celebration, 125th anniversary of Chicago College [of the Performing Arts, Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois].  Is that right?  Is it, is it Chicago College? Not University of Chicago?  In Chicago College, this was a few years ago and it was called 'Celebration'.  It was an interesting work because what happened was the lights go out and the players are performing backstage.  It's a small ensemble and then they come on stage one by one playing the music and then lights come on and they're, they're celebrating the occasion, see.  But it was, it was an interesting experiment but I, I haven't had the chance to write much recently.
Speaker 1: Do you ever lock horns with some of the composers about your expression since you like to interpret--you like to have a little fun with things and some of them may be--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, but--that's right.  I will have to tell you that most of the composers are very, very much delighted you know with interpretations.  And you know many of the recordings that I make with the Czech Republic of composers of different nationalities is very interesting because some of their cultures have to surface.  But most of them are quite pleased and not just with the interpretation but with the whole process, the recording team and the whole thing about bringing the music to life and putting it on CDs [compact discs].  But I have had two or three composers who have been a little bit arrogant about different things to the extent that I had one composer whose name I should not mention, he got a little bit upset.  I'm usually not combative or don't get upset easily but I said to him "You know I don't really have to record the music you know if you're going to be that difficult about it."  And then with one composer, again another composer whose name shall be unmentioned he actually wanted, he actually had his attorney threaten to sue me because he didn't like the interpretation of the music that I had recorded before, before it came to the CD with an orchestra I think it was in Mexico or something like that.  And it really had been an unprecedented case.  Of course that frightened me at the time I mean because I thought I don't want to get into a suit and all this.  But it would have been very interesting because there, I think there's never been a case like that in history in which the composer actually enters a needless suit of a conductor because of the interpretation.  And I wonder how a judge or jury would decide that the result should be?  They would probably bring in experts to listen and see.  It would have been a fascinating case but it, it, it didn't go as far as court.  We settled out of court.  I'm still recording his music by the way.

Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be?  What do you think you will be remembered for?  Both of those questions.
Speaker 2: That's a very good question.  I wanted to start by answering it maybe in a different way because somehow one of the interviewers on one program asked me when I plan to retire.  That was a question.  And so I said you know traditionally conductors are you know, have the great fortune of living a while because of their cardiovascular system and our work you see the exercising of our heart and so forth.  And two of my teachers, Dr. [F. Nathaniel] Gatlin from earlier years and Pierre Monteux with whom I studied later both died on the podium.  And ironically they were both conducting [Johannes] Brahms.  That's fascinating.  And so I've always said that given a choice of course I would prefer not to die, but given the choice since I have to die, I would like to work until the end if, if I'm so fortunate.  And I think it's a wonderful thing because I've seen so many of my colleagues who are now beginning to retire even if it's at an early age or whatever and you know it's a, it's not so pleasant.  You know it's better to keep going at what you're doing until you can't do it anymore.  That's the one part of the thing.  But in terms of legacy, I didn't think about it very much but you see because now when I was making the recordings I did not think about the fact that this is something that as long as we have you know CDs [compact discs] around or the apparatus to play CDs these will be remembered and the LPs [long-playing albums] and see that's beginning to wear out.  I didn't make any 78s [78 rpm records] so I wasn't of that age, but the LPs, you can now buy LPs today and at one point they will become almost absolutely extinct.  And then eventually something will happen to CDs because now the DVDs [digital video discs] are coming out.  We don't know how long that will last or there will be a new format you see which means that if there is a new format and works are not transferred from the CDs to those or even the LPs then those will be lost in time  But I think in the end I mean if people remember what I've done, it would probably be for the recordings and maybe in some instances the unique programs or also the diversity we've tried to bring in all of our work you see.  And I, I brought a kind of diversity to the Czech [National Symphony] Orchestra [Prague, Czech Republic] too because when I went there even in 1996, there were no women in the orchestra.  It was an all male orchestra and I asked them why and the excuses were I mean very flimsy like when we travel we don't have to use one room, we don't have to wear--and in Japan they prefer to see an all-male Aryan orchestra on the stage.  Well say well, I wonder why did you appoint me as music director?  I mean that kind of breaks that tradition a little bit doesn't it?  So, so now we have about sixteen, eighteen musicians, female musicians out of about ninety five, ninety eight musicians so that number has grown. But Czech Republic is a kind of monolithic society so there are not many people of color in the Czech Republic so I mean you can't do that like in Chicago [Sinfonietta, Chicago, Illinois] where we tried to bring in as much as possible people of color into the ranks.  And I think this is very important, diversity not just in the selection of music but also in the selection of musicians on the stage.  And maybe this will be a kind of contribution that we have made and you know the other, the other recordings.

Speaker 1: Your success with Chicago's Sinfonietta [Chicago, Illinois] as far as the excellence the music, the diversity--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that sends a message to CSO [Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Chicago, Illinois] doesn't it?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, but you know it's interesting because I've always felt that the Chicago Sinfonietta complements the Chicago Symphony and in one way what we do by sending a message helps.  Now whether that this is an indirect reflection of our work because we are the largest tenant in their hall, the Orchestra Hall [Chicago, Illinois] is owned by Chicago Symphony and we do you know we are very supportive you know of each other.  And Henry Fogel is leaving as the executive director on our board and we're honoring him next week when Diahann Carroll is with us and so forth.  So there, there is that kind of tie.  There's not an official tie.  But if there is, let's say a spin-off from what we're doing that has a very strong message is the fact that, that the successor to Henry Fogel which was just announced two weeks ago is female, you see and therefore she would be you know one of the few female general managers, executive directors of world class orchestras.  And that's kind of interesting because we consider in the symphony orchestra business females are minorities historically and we have 55 percent in our orchestra.  So you see that's a spin off in that way you see.  So--and of course Chicago Symphony you know tries to reach out into the community and so forth.  And now the, it, the Chicago Symphony has Tage Larson [trumpet player] who was the first African American to have a, a permanent status as a member of the orchestra and Tage is going to appear as soloist next season, you see.  But I will tell you that when I'm asked the question about integration and the concert halls and symphonic halls throughout America, my answer is a very simple one and that is that diversity must, or succeeds if the spin off is on all levels and by that I mean from the top for the board of directors to the musicians on the stage to the music that's played to, in the case of the Sinfonietta or some orchestras or friends groups or the women's groups and then its reflected in the audience because the orchestra is a reflection of all of its parts you see.  And this is the problem with so many orchestras including the Chicago Symphony that it is only in the year 2003 that a permanent member is black in the orchestra.  The, they had people of color and of course they've had females for a number of years and so forth but there's only one black musician in the Chicago Symphony and it was perhaps the only major orchestra in America, maybe one of two that had, never had a regular black musician in his ranks.  Now Michael Morgan was there and then the young conductor now as they're on the conducting staff but not on a permanent basis like musicians in the orchestra.  So this is--we're, we're happy to see this happening in our time and in some way we may have had an indirect influence you know by creating the kind of diversity for which the Sinfonietta has become known.

Speaker 1: Just closing out for us Dr. Freeman with a statement to the Maestro Freeman of the future.
Speaker 2: That's really a difficult one.  I can, I can only say that for years during the training process both of the conservatories where I've studied with the various teachers that it has been important to learn the skill through working with orchestras both as associate conductor, small orchestras as music director and also as guest conductor and so forth to learn the skills necessary to now work with a major orchestra in Europe [Czech National Symphony Orchestra, Prague, Czech Republic] and in many ways Chicago's Sinfonietta [Chicago, Illinois] in terms of its output is considered a major orchestral artistic organization.  So in order to have arrived at the point that I could participate on this level as music director all of these components have played a very important role and I am grateful for the opportunity of having been able to study with the people with whom I've studied and the people have helped me along the way to arrive at this point.  I think at least in these years I've always looked forward to working with orchestras at a very high artistic level and it was gratifying when I took the Czech National Orchestra to England last year when the stage manager said to me "You know we have ten, twelve orchestras from around the world to visit each year."  And he said, this was in Bristol [England] and he said "You know you are one of the finest orchestras that we have heard."  And this was so nice to hear that kind of comment from that environment.  And I think if I look toward the future and I'm asked which orchestras I enjoyed working with most I will Chicago Sinfonietta and Czech National Symphony Orchestra.  And if I'm asking which orchestra I enjoy working with the most, I'll say Chicago Sinfonietta and Czech National Orchestra.  So I feel very pleased, indeed very pleased to have this opportunity. And also I think a kind of culmination of at least the present activities will be the 'Global Maestro' [radio] series when that becomes, when that goes into effect.  That we always strive to make better music to serve the public better and to do whatever we can in those areas of diversity which need so much attention.
