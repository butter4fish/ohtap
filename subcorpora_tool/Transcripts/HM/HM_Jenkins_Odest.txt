Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Odest Chadwicke Jenkins, O-D-E-S-T, C-H-A-D-W-I-C-K-E, J-E-N-K-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: Now, sir, is there a story behind your first name?
Speaker 2: I, my dad, my dad is Odest Charles Jenkins, and, and my father, my grandfather is--on my dad's side is Oliver John Jenkins.  And I have heard, I think at least five or six different stories about how, how that name came to be.  So I'm (laughter) not sure, I'm not sure what the story is.  But there's some, there's some good ones.
Speaker 1: Is there one story that makes more sense to you?
Speaker 2: You know, I think, I think what, one thing that my, that--the story that I hear most often is that my, my father who actually goes by O.C. was just called O.C. most of the time.  And then when he got into the Army, they made him, you know, pick a, pick a first and middle name.  And he just decided Odest was something that he liked, and he put Charles in the middle.  And that was it.  And then I inherited the first name.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And, sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is January 9, 1974, and I was born in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: And what is your title and occupation?
Speaker 2: My title is associate professor of computer science.  I am a roboticist who studies, we study the computational aspects of the, of autonomy systems.  And I work at Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island].
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is November 8th, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're currently at Willow Garage in Menlo Park, California.
Story_ID: 24129
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight questions we always ask as a warm up basically--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know.  I think I--I would say I do have a favorite food.  It's probably, it's probably chow mein at this point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I like Chow Mein.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, Navy blue.
Speaker 1: Okay, favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: June.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, not actually.  I would say that Hawaii was the best place that I've ever visited, that I'd like to go back to.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter), actually, I have two things that I say to my graduate students all the time.  It's "Get her done" and "Drop it like it's hot", I, 'cause (laughter), 'cause I want them to get things done, and I want them to be good.  So that's, those are the things I say often (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 24130
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but separately so we can keep 'em, you know, straight.  So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's name is Nadine Francis Jenkins, and that's N-A-D-I-N-E, F-R-A-N-C-I-S, J-E-N-K-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: Now, what is her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Dixon.
Speaker 1: Dixon, okay.
Speaker 2: D-I-X-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is November 7th, 1945 in Port Arthur, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side and what are the stories and activities of that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Right, so, so I can, I can start maybe from the present moving backwards and that'll be, that'll show how far I can go back (laughter).  So my mom actually, right now she lives in Houston [Texas] with my, with my dad.  She, we moved all over the country, and she worked in higher education.  So she worked at a number of really great colleges and universities.  She has, she has degrees from--in education, a doctorate and a Masters from North Texas State University.  Before that she got, she got a, her undergraduate degree from Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas.  And she grew up primarily in Port Arthur.  She, she was raised by my, my maternal grandparents, Willie Mae Dixon and Lloyd Dixon in Port Arthur.  And, you know, by all accounts, she, you know, she had a pretty, pretty good, pretty good life there.  And my, and she was--and my grandparents, my grandmother was raised by my great grandmother, Elnora Haisley, also in the, in the Southeast Texas.
Speaker 1: Is that H-A--
Speaker 2: H-A-I-S-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: --I-S-L-E-Y, okay.  And what did your mother's parents do?
Speaker 2: My grandmother stayed at home, my granny stayed at home.  She's still, she's actually still, still living with my, my--she's living with my parents right now.  And, and my granddad worked at the oil refinery in Port Arthur, the Gulf Oil Refinery, worked there for decades.  As long as I knew him, he was working at the refinery.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, now we've got back to your great grandmother--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Elnora Haisley.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And can you go back any further?
Speaker 2: I don't think I can go any further back than that.
Speaker 1: Now, did she have roots in Texas too or did she come from--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To the best of my knowledge, she, she pretty much grew up in Texas, and, you know, and the Southern part of Louisiana, Southeast Texas and Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Pretty much all of my family comes from that area.
Speaker 1: Okay, so some are from Southeast Louisiana too?
Speaker 2: Right.  Southwest Louisiana.
Speaker 1: So your great grandmother takes us back to, I guess 1890s or something?
Speaker 2: Eighteen nineties [1890s], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother have any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: She had lots of stories (laughter) growing up.  Many of those I, I might not be able to remember.  I do know that, you know, that there were, you know, at the time a lot of the stories talked about, you know, where she went to school and people around, around the neighborhood.  Some of the more vivid stories though are, you know, are, relate to, excuse me, pardon me [wiping nose], some of the more vivid stories relate to, to going to integrated schools.  For example, I know that she would say that when she was at Lamar University, she would always--she would never let the instructor be able to associate her name with her face 'cause she thought it might be, you know, she might get a lower grade if, you know, given that sort of bias.  But, you know, I think, I think overall, in contrast to my environment where I moved around a lot--my parents, both of my parents stayed in the same place.  You know, they grew up in Texas.  They, you know, they know lots of people that went on to do, to do great things, and, you know, and just other people that are around the neighborhood.  And they feel very connected to the area.  And I think it was, it was a very happy life.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  She tried to make sure that the instructor didn't associate her name with her face.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So she could get, because, I guess of racism in the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --classroom.
Speaker 2: So I mean, you know, I mean the area where they grew up, where both my parents grew up, this is my, my mom grew up in Port Arthur and my dad grew up in Beaumont, Texas.  And, you know, they're separated by about seventeen miles, all part of Jefferson County.  And, you know, it's not the, it's not the most, at the time, it was definitely a segregated place.  And it's not the most forward thinking in terms of, you know, race and civil rights.  And so there is, there was a certain, you know, a certain degree of bias.  And, and so, you know, so that's something that, that, you know, I think with my parents, they, you know, it factors into how they, how they view the world and to some extent, it's a reality in that area.  You know, and not, and there are definitely places where, where in the area where you just, you know, were still not necessarily a safe place to be when the sun goes down, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, your mother and your father really pursued education.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, was your mother the first person in her family to go to college?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and she went all the way to achieve a PhD.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did she talk about who inspired her to do that?
Speaker 2: So, so she had a, she has a, she actually has an ED, an educational doctorate, (unclear) EDD, I guess.  And I think she, you know, I think a lot of it comes from her, her parents, you know, who wanted her to do well.  You know, she had lots of support with, you know, I think in the home.  You know, both of my, my maternal grandparents are really, you know, great and supportive of people that are happy and fun to be around, but also understood the value of an education.  I think everybody who, who's successful at that level has a number of professional mentors that helped them along the way in terms of their career.  So I am, you know, there're probably people that I don't know that, you know, as she was, as my mom was growing up in terms of her, her elementary and secondary education, who were able to help her.  There were, I know that there are people, you know, that along the way, in terms of her undergraduate and graduate education, that were supportive of her and gave her mentorship, and gave her, gave her direction in terms of what she, you know, what she could accomplish.  And I've been able to see some of those people in terms of her, you know, in terms of her professional life, who have given her mentorship and, and helped guide her career to, you know, to accomplish the things that she has.  Those people, at the professional level, I know a little bit more because I, because, you know, because at that time, I was able to meet those people and know a little bit more what they've done.  And some of them have helped me.  So that's, that's, I think there was mentorship at all levels, yeah.
Story_ID: 24131
Speaker 1: Well, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father's full name is ODEST Charles Jenkins, O-D-E-F-T, C-H-A-R-L-E-S, J-E-N-K-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is October 22, 1942, in Beaumont, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a reason, you know, he gave--you have Chadwicke as a middle name, and he has Charles--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but the names are similar.  Is there a reason for the different middle names?
Speaker 2: I think just to, just to have some separation, to not, for me not to just be a junior.  So I have a brother and a sister, and my brother is Oren Cedric Jenkins, and I think they wanted to keep the initials, the initials the same.  And so my sister is Nadalynn Fern Jenkins, so that is the same initial as my mom.  The story to why we're named that way (laughter), I hear mixed things.  But I don't know for sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there any particular story that (laughter) once again, that makes the most sense?
Speaker 2: No, no (laughter), just, it's just that way as far as we--I mean I've always been, and in growing up, I was just called Chad, you know.  I was never, if somebody called me ODEST, I was like, who are they talking to?  That's somebody else.  So I think my parents always--they, it was always intended that I would be, I'd be distinct from my, from my dad.
Speaker 1: Okay, but something, you know, but similar initials (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, it does sound like a plan.  So, now he was born in Beaumont, Texas.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side and how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So, so my dad, he basically was, had, you know, he has my grandmother who comes from, who is Edna Levias (ph.), and she comes from the Levias tree in--
Speaker 1: Levias?
Speaker 2: L-E-V-I-A-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandfather, Oliver John Jenkins, they basically, both of them basically got to, you know, came together in, around Newton County, Texas and moved to Beaumont relatively, you know, I think as my, as my dad was growing up.  And that's, you know, that's, the whole family tree, and there's actually a cemetery up in Newton County that has all of my, all of my relatives on that side of the family.  And so we can, we can see the family tree from there.  It's, it's really too, after that, it gets really too big for me to recall.  But, but I think, but the main point with my grandparents is that they moved from, you know, from the rural country area in Newton County into the more, in the more, at the time, urban area that's Beaumont.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, so how far back can you go to your, can you go back further than your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I probably could, but, but not off the top of my head.  I think I'll, I think I'll say a lot of things wrong.  I could, I could try to dig that up.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, a few years, about ten years ago, we interviewed Mel Farr, the football player--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who is from that region.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And he talked about all the athletes that came out of Beaumont.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: One he particularly talked about was Jerry Levias.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is he related to you?
Speaker 2: I believe so, but I'm not, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jerry Levias was a big football player--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then he ended up in the American Football League.  I think in the beginnings, you know, in the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --early '60's [1960s] before you were born.
Speaker 2: Right, so, I mean my dad tells any number of stories on this.  I, I (laughter), they usually go into my head and then leave because of some focus on something else.  But, but I heard lots of stories about Bubba Smith and Mel Farr.  Mel Farr, who I actually got a chance to meet, he--a couple of times, he's really, really a nice guy, makes very interesting commercials from what I've seen (laughter) that you may be familiar with but, yeah, I mean at that time, you know, a lot of the stories that my dad tells about, about growing up in that era is that, you know, is that sports were the way to really make a name for yourself, that, you know, you wanted to be talented academically, but, you know, but it's not clear that those paths were gonna be open to you.  And sports were the way to, athletics were the way to, you know, to ensure that you would get a, that you'd actually get a shot.  You'd get an opportunity.  And so my dad, so he played a fair amount of high school sports.  He went to Hebert High School.  I should also say my mom went to Thomas Jefferson in Port Arthur.  I forgot to mention that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, my, but, yeah, going through Herbert High School with, you know, and being able to see the people that came out of that era, you know, both Mel Farr and his brother, you know, I think that was, you know--I think a lot of people, I think my dad, you know, every time he mentions Mel, he mentions that, you know, he played in the National Football league and did all these great things.  You know, I think everybody in the area took pride in the accomplishments--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and a whole bunch of, I think Curley Culp and Bug Buchannan and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, so it was a bunch of them.
Speaker 2: Right, it's, I mean it's a big deal.  I mean when I would go back as a kid to, you know, as a kid and teenager to visit my cousins in, in Beaumont, it was a very big deal.  You know, high school football was a very big deal and where you went to was a big deal.  And I would see my cousins go through the tour days and, you know, and be in the weigh room because that's, you know, because it meant so much to the community.  And so that was, you know, I think, I think that just, that's part of a culture that my, that my dad grew up with.  But I think it, that's what enabled him, you know, the drive that it took to, you know, to excel in sports.  And my dad played some college football and, you know, but, you know, didn't play professionally.  But I think that instilled a lot of the drive to help him accomplish what he accomplished in his career.  And so, you know, I can talk a little bit about my dad's educational and career direction.  So, so my dad, my dad went to Herbert High School, then went to Prairie View A & M, played a little bit of football, but got, but got an undergraduate degree and then went to Sam Houston State [University] to get a Masters.  So both my parents have graduate educations.  And then took a job with the Bureau of Prisons in Texarkana, Texas, and from there, that basically, his trail of promotions and, and transfers basically is my existence growing up.  So whenever my dad got a promotion or a transfer, we would be moving.  And we moved all around the country.
Speaker 1: Not just Texas?
Speaker 2: I've never lived in Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've visited my, you know, when I'm off from school or we'd go for a visit, I visited Texas.  But I've never--and I've had residence in Texas, but I've never lived there.  I've never, I've never had a job in Texas or anything like that.  So--
Speaker 1: Now, what I didn't, I guess we haven't--we have to make clear.  Your dad worked for the federal prison system, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's why he traveled so much.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the federal, so he worked for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that is part of the Justice Department, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it started in Texarkana, Texas, and then he moved to Washington, D.C., where I was born and then to Lompoc, California, Lexington, Kentucky, Anniston, Alabama or actually Talladega [Alabama] is where he was.  And then, then we moved to Chicago [Illinois], then to Louisiana, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and that's where I graduated from, from high school.  And he went, then he was the warden at Leavenworth Penitentiary, and then moved to Dallas [Texas] where he retired.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, that's a lot of moving.
Speaker 2: That is a lot of moving.
Speaker 1: That's more moving than most military families we talk to do.
Speaker 2: Right, but it, all the moves were domestic moves so, you know, so if you talk to somebody who has a military background, they move all around the world.  They've maybe been to Germany or, or Asia or, you know, or some place in the Pacific whereas all of my moves, you know, there was, you know, there was a mall nearby, there was McDonald's, there were (laughter) certain things that you, you know, you could always expect.  So, you know, so it wasn't hard in terms of, you know, in terms of what you would expect of the culture.  But it was a big adjustment in terms of, you know, socially, being with connected with people around you, yeah, which may explain why I'm in computer science (laughter).
Story_ID: 24132
Speaker 1: So, now, when you think about your parents' [Nadine Francis and Odest Charles] personalities, their dispositions, their mannerisms, their interests, hobbies, how they walk, talk, look, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: It's interesting.  I think I take a little bit of, I take a little bit of mom's personality for kidding around and sort of, you know, maybe more easy-going demeanor.  And then I definitely take after my dad when it comes to, when I'm not happy about something.  You know, my dad is, is a pretty aggressive, you know, hard-charging kind of guy when it comes to, when it comes to getting things done.  And I think, you know, and that makes it such that it's, that it can be, you know, when there're things that need to get done, he can't, he's not necessarily the easiest person to be around.  But he makes sure that things, that things happen.  And he takes the responsibility, those responsibilities seriously.  And so that's, so I definitely take after my dad in that regard.  Sometimes I try to keep the, my temper in, you know, try to keep an even demeanor.  But my base state is probably more like my, well, more like my mom, where, you know, I like to have, I like to kid around, I like to have fun.  I like people to feel included and I like to, you know, I like to keep things very easy.
Story_ID: 24133
Speaker 1: All right, now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think all of my early childhood memories come from, from being in Lompoc, California.  So I was, you know--I think we lived there for, until, you know, when I was, from the time I was an infant to about three years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you don't have any memories of D.C. [Washington, D.C] then?
Speaker 2: I have no memories of D.C.  I have pictures, and I've, and my dad [Odest Charles Jenkins] would take us back to D.C. every now and then to be able to see, you know, to see places that, where we were.  I believe the hospital that I was born in doesn't even exist anymore.  So, but we do have, we have been back to D.C. occasionally and met with, you know, with people that my parents knew when we were there.
Speaker 1: Now, what's the name of the town in California again?
Speaker 2: Lompoc, California.
Speaker 1: Lompoc, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: L-O-M-P-O-C.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So everywhere there's a big federal penitentiary, there's a chance that I've lived near that area.
Speaker 1: Now, what's the name of the penitentiary in Lompoc?
Speaker 2: It's just the Lompoc Federal Correction Facility.
Speaker 1: I'd never heard of it before.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a good thing you haven't heard of it (laughter).
Story_ID: 24134
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, so, well, you've lived in so many different places, did the places that you lived in, did you live near the prison facilities normally or--
Speaker 2: Right.  Typically, no, about the time that I became school aged, we stopped living--so before I was in school, we actually lived on a reservation.  So, so the correction facility may have houses nearby that they reserved for staff members to, so they could be close to the facility and still have, you know, affordable housing.  But since I started school, you know, as a young kid, we typically lived about, you know, about thirty miles away from the facility, except for one year where, when I was in elementary school, and when my father [Odest Charles Jenkins] was the warden at Leavenworth, that's when he, when they actually had the warden's house.  And I think it was, I think it's actually, it's actually a nice place to be.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've seen movies where the warden has a house really--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on the grounds of prison which always seemed to be like a dangerous place to be.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Well, it's actually interesting because the house that we had in Leavenworth is actually up on a big hill.  So you could see the, you could see all around.  You could see the penitentiary, and you could also see Fort Leavenworth.  So it's, one thing that's helpful if you're in a penitentiary and you're worried about things, to have a big military base nearby.  So (laughter), it eases the mind for sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, that's interesting though.  You typically lived about thirty miles away from the facility which is--
Speaker 2: Right, both of my parents commuted.  So when we lived in, when we lived in Alabama, both of my parents, we lived in Anniston, which is about, I'd say about maybe thirty miles away from Talladega [Alabama], where both of my parents worked.  When we lived in Chicago [Illinois], for instance, we lived in Wheaton, but my dad worked downtown, and my mom [Nadine Francis Jenkins] worked in Aurora [Illinois].  So, you know, so commuting was a big part of their lives, and by extension, my life, and why I'm trying to avoid commuting in my own life because it does take a toll on you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24135
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Right.  I would say, well, I'd say, it's really hard to talk about, you know, specific sights and smells being that I moved around so much, you know.  I mean four years is the longest I lived anywhere during my, you know, during my childhood.  But one thing it gave me was a very good memory in terms of chronology.  So, like if, you know, whenever I wanna remember something, I can usually, it's usually associated with a place and that place is associated with a moment in time or a certain span in time so I can locate the timing very, pretty easily.  But there are certain things that were constant throughout, you know.  So playing sports was something that I did a lot of.  I played, you know, baseball and basketball, and my dad, you know, always the, was always willing to be the coach of the team, and, you know, give me instruction and, you know, and help everybody out.  And I thought that was, that was something that was great.  And so, you know, sports were always there.  We always had, you know, the football game on or the basketball game.  So that was, those, I think those are very vivid memories, and probably why I watch football with, you know, religiously.  You know, Sundays are, you know, are a lot about, you know, in the afternoons and the evenings, about, you know, just sitting down and watching TV.  I played a lot of videogames (laughter).  Videogames were a big part of my childhood, starting from my parents buying me an Atari 2600 for Christmas in 1982, which was, you know, which is, I think, you know, it changed my life.  It gave me a real sense of direction.  So we had the Atari 2600, and we had Nintendo and my parents bought me an Apple 2e growing up.  And so computing was always a big part of my, a big part of my life.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 24136
Speaker 1: Okay, now, the Atari, from what I've read, it was a pivotal device in your upbringing.  And--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --describe it.  Now, what was an Atari and what was the significance of Atari when it came out?
Speaker 2: Right, so at the time, growing up, I, you know, television was only a, it was only, it wasn't something you could interact with.  Television was something that just projected images at you, and you would watch, I'd watch, you know, TV shows, you know, so I'd be watching, you know, maybe basketball or football or "The Jefferson's" or "I Love Lucy" or something like that.  And, you know, I'd watch a lot of TV, a lot of cartoons, but the Atari, when it came in, was a videogame device, cartridge-based videogame device.  So you could plug in a cartridge, be able to play a game.  And it basically hooked up to the, the device would hook up to your television through the antenna.  So you would essentially, you'd connect these little electrical leads to the, you'd replace the antenna with these little electrical leads.  And the Atari would send a video signal to the television, and you would be able to see this game play, and what was great about it was that now I could interact with the images on the screen.  I could move my Joystick and I could see things happen.  And it was a total interactive, immersive experience.  It's something that we take for granted now.  But it was amazing for me to see as an eight-year old in the early '80's [1980s].  And it, and my path into computer science was essentially about how to do I make those games for myself?  And, and in order to, and the thing that you have to realize is in order to make those games, you have to know something about electrical engineering, computer science and you have to know something about physics, because physics is what makes those games move.  And so, so my realization over the years to come about how do I make these games was essentially, was essentially me telling myself, I need to be in, I need to be in computing.
Speaker 1: Now, I remember the first Atari I ever saw had a game called, a ping pong game.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And very a simple thing, no graphics on it, just an electronic blip--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that, and two longer blips--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --were the paddles and bounced it, you know, across the screen, and it had a realistic bounce.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I was, but then by the time you, it got to you though, it was a little bit more sophisticated, right?
Speaker 2: Right, so the game that came with the Atari was this game called Combat.  So it was essentially two tanks that you could drive around.  So you had your joystick, and if you pushed forward, it'd make the tank go forward.  And if you turned left, it'd make it turn right, left in place or turn right.  And then you had the little fire button.  So you just had to look, like a small joystick that was, you know, that came out from the paddle, and you had like a little fire button.  So you would just around, playing tanks with each other and shooting at each.  And that was just, that was amazing.  But the game that my parents bought with the system was this game called "Space Invaders".  And so, you know, it's these little, you know, the game and you see it today, and you just have these rows of, you know, of invading enemies coming and you have to go up and you have to move to position to shoot them.  And as you shoot more, they get faster and faster and faster.  And, you know, there's no, I mean to some extent there's no point to the game.  It never ends.  But it was just amazing to see.  It was like, wow, how did they do this.  It seemed like magic, but it wasn't magic.  It was, and at the core, it was, you know, science and technology and engineering.  And that's really where, you know, that gave me the spark to pursue my career.
Story_ID: 24137
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was asking you about Atari and how you got interested in programming instead of just playing it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you said that they actually offered some, a keyboard and a cartridge that would teach you basically how to do some programming, right?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, so I, you know, as I got more cartridges and played more games, I wanted to figure out how to program these games myself.  And so I begged my parents to buy this cartridge called "Basic Programming", which, you know, which essentially--which came with a little keyboard attachment and it let you, you know, it gave you a small environment to program and get the system to do what you wanted it to do.  And I played around with it for, you know, for a couple of days, and I realized that programming is really hard, and that it's, it's gonna take a lot more.  So there weren't a lot of resources at the time to figure out how to program.  But from what I could cobble together, you know, a lot of it was about, you know, I read a book, I read books about how a computer represents information and binary and memory switches, you know.  And I would, and you'd see all these, you'd have all these flow charts.  So you had a flow chart that would talk about information flow and how you would use that to program and trying to cobble all that together was really difficult.  And, and, you know, and so I just, I came to realize that I couldn't necessarily do that on the Atari system.  But fortunately, a little bit later, a few years later after that, my dad bought me an Apple 2e, and I don't know if you've seen the Apple 2e, but it was, it was a great system because all you had to do, 'cause you'd turn the computer on and it gave you a little prompt.  And you could immediately start programming in this language called "basic", same with the Atari.  But what was interesting was that you could go out and buy these magazines, and you could essentially copy the, the program code from the magazine into your computer, and you could see how it worked.  And there was just games that you could make from, you know, from copying this code, and then you could change it yourself.  You could make the, you know, like there was a little "Snake Bite" game that you could have.  You could change it so the snake was blue instead of red, you know, make little alterations, put your name in the game.  I would make, I would make programs to print out my Christmas list so my mom could see it.  I would writer counters that would go from 1 to 10,000.  I would make, it made it very easy to do graphics.  So I would make just graphical displays that would, you know, that would draw shapes and all sorts of things on the screen.  And so--
Speaker 1: Now, this is on an Apple 2e.  Now, chronologically, I guess, you got your Atari in '83' [1983]?
Speaker 2: Eighty-two [1982].
Speaker 1: Eighty-two [1982], okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, actually, I should say it's '81' [1981].  It was Christmas Day in 1981.
Speaker 1: So you were like seven or eight?
Speaker 2: I was probably seven or eight, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I think two Christmases after that I got the Apple 2e and that was--
Speaker 1: So you're about ten now?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Nine or ten, yeah, now, Apple 2e, what kind--it wasn't the, I know we've seen the little MAC, a little square box.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it like that?  (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No, the MAC, the MAC came out a little bit, a little bit after.  So the Atari--Apple 2e was, it was like a long box.  So think of it like a big rectangular box with sort of, with a keyboard at the end of it that was attached, and so it was like a long box with a sort of pointy end to it.  And it had these floppy disk drives that you could put in.  And you had to hook it up to a monitor.  I just hooked it up to my TV.  And so, and so it was really my first computer, let's say, because I would, 'cause you would start it up.  And you could start it up and put a disk in and then it would load that disk and play whatever, whatever's on there.  So first it's, one of my favorite games was "Dr. Jay versus Larry Bird, One-on-One", you know, (laughter) that was a great game.  And so I would just put the disk in and start up the computer, and I would play.  But in addition to being able--it was the first time that in addition to being able to play those games, I could start up with no, no disk necessarily, and be able to, to be able to just type code in, be able to program directly and see the result and interface with that system, using the basic programming language.  And so Apple had a number of great tutorials.  Actually, my fifth grade teacher at the time had like a set of, a set of instructional cards that you could follow and just learn the basic syntax and structure of programs.  And so I went in, and a lot of it was just copy, paste like.  You know, like I would look, I would see what they were doing, and I would type, I would take the thing that they told me to enter in the computer, and I would type it in myself.  And I would see the result, and then it would suggest, well, you could change it this way and you would, and this is what should happen.  And that gave me ideas for how I could change things myself.  And so I just started creating all sorts of programs.  The basic programming language was, is what it says, "basic".  So it's not intended for, you know, it's hard to write larger programs to do interesting things, but I was able to make, you know, basic games, you know, just question and answer sort of games, tic-tac-toe type games by myself.  And that was, that was really inspiring.
Story_ID: 24138
Speaker 1: Now, where did you--you have started school in California, right?
Speaker 2: I started school in Anniston, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Anniston, okay.  What was the name of your school there?
Speaker 2: Donoho, D-O-N-O-H-O [The Donoho School].
Speaker 1: Anniston, Alabama, okay.  Did you know anything about the history of Anniston when you were?  I know they probably talked about that--
Speaker 2: I, you know, I--there are certain things about Anniston you can't escape.  And so I knew a little bit about the history.  But I, but, you know, but I didn't know, you know, I don't think I delved into it too much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think, you know, Anniston has a number of--I mean given that's where I started school, and, you know, just sort of, you know, the makeup of the place, you know, it has definite, definite memories, both, you know, both wonderful memories and also maybe not so nice memories.  But, you know, but it's--
Speaker 1: Was this an integrated school in Anniston?
Speaker 2: This was, this was an integrated school.  Actually, it was a private school.  So the school, my class had, it was mostly, you know, white kids, and there were probably about two or three other, other black kids.  One Jewish girl which I think was weird, was I think she was, she was maybe, at that time, she was maybe more of the outlier than the black kids.  But, but, yeah, it was not, I mean I think I had friends there, and it was a nice, it was a very nice school.  The teachers were, were quite nice.  In fact, I had really good teachers, and, but, you know, there are certain, you know, racial undercurrents that you can't avoid.  I think where it, pardon me [wiping nose-face, cold].  I think some of my more vivid memories were going to Atlanta [Georgia]. So, you know, so we were, so being in Anniston, we were just a few hours from Atlanta, big Braves fan at the time.  You know, and the Braves had a great team.  In 1982, they had a fabulous team, you know.  And I can probably name them all, you know, name their starting lineup (laughter).  I don't know if I still can, but I, but I could.  There were definitely times where I could.
Speaker 1: Was that the team with Gary Matthews, Jr.?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't know if Gary Matthews, Jr.  It was, you know, they had Dale Murphy and, and Claude (ph.) Washington and Bob Horner, Chris Chamblee (ph.), Rafael, I think Rafael Ramirez was on that team at that time.  You know, there was just, those were just the few that come off the top of my head.  I mean we went to a number of Braves' games, and, you know, Warren Bob Horner hit like, you know, hit two homeruns, almost hit a third, you know.  And it was, and, you know, there was, that was just a great team to be, to follow at the time.  And, you know, baseball was probably the, you know, and growing up at that time in Anniston, it was, it was the sport to be a part of.  You know, I remember, I do have definite memories of going out and playing baseball at the complex, and, you know, that was fun.  That was tremendous fun.  I was actually, you know, a reasonable, reasonably decent player at the time.  And, you know, I turned not to be a great baseball player over, as (unclear)--
Speaker 1: What did you play growing up?
Speaker 2: What's that?  I played, I usually played first base.  You know, I'm a decent first baseman.  I don't think I have a great throwing arm so, you know, so usually, but I could hit.  You know, so first base is usually where I went.  My dad tried to get me to do, to play short stop, you know.  And when I had, when, you know, and I had, I had the ability to move and at times I had a great arm, but just not consistently, you know.  It would, the ball would get there, but not--it would get somewhere fast (laughter).  So, you know, I--
Speaker 1: You had the power, but not the control?
Speaker 2: No, no, I definitely didn't have control.  And I, you know, and I pitched a little bit, you know.  But, yeah, I mean, I mean I still have, I still have fond feelings for the Atlanta Braves, you know, just, you know, just given how much, how influential baseball was on me at that time in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were you living in Atlanta when you got your Atari?
Speaker 2: We were living in Anniston, but--
Speaker 1: I mean in Anniston, right, right.
Speaker 2: --but, yeah, that's where we were living.  Actually, we weren't that far away from Texas.  So we, so that Christmas we spent in Port Arthur [Texas] and Beaumont, Texas.  And so that's where I officially got the Atari.  I'm sure I drove my grandparents nuts because I would not take it off the TV, all right.  It was just like, you know, it was just a fixture, and we were just sitting there playing "Asteroids" and "Space Invaders" constantly.  And not only that, but like at the time Atari had a number of, had a number of materials.  So you can have the catalog, you could get this catalog that came with it.  The catalog would just give you brief summaries of all the games and little screen shot of what the game looked like.  And, you know, and so they had, so we had the, you know, a couple days later we had to go to, you know, we were going to church.  And I just was, you know, I wasn't paying attention at all (laughter).  I was totally just looking at this Atari catalog thinking about all the games that I wanna get and what could I do with this game.  And, you know, eventually, my granny had to take the catalog from me.  (Laughter) But--
Story_ID: 24139
Speaker 1: Now, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so actually, you know, on my father's [Odest Charles Jenkins] side, my grandfather was a pastor.  I have two uncles that are pastors.  They big, you know, they have pretty involved and engaged congregations.  You know, the kind, you know, church was an all-day thing for, you know, for my family.  So, you know, you get there for Sunday school.  You'd be there for, you know, you'd be there all the way through the main ceremony.  And, you know, there's lots of, you know, and there's definitely music involved.  So, you know, so my uncle, you know, my Uncle Willie could play, you know, he played the organ.  He plays the, he plays the piano, you know, really got, really knows how to get things going.  And, you know, my cousin would be on the drums.  You know, it was a lively, lively thing.  And, you know, it wouldn't be done until you, until, you know, until 2:00.  And at that point, once everything settled down, we'd make our way over to Luby's Cafeteria--I don't know if you've heard of Luby's Cafeteria, but we'd make our way over to Luby's Cafeteria, and I'd have, you know, we'd, you know, we continued to, you know, the family would be all around the table and we would, you know, and we'd talk and, you know, I'd have my fish fillet with tartar all on it.  That's a very vivid memory.
Speaker 1: There's a civil rights lawyer, I think in Nashville [Tennessee] name Luby, L-U-B-Y.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's probably related, could--
Speaker 2: Maybe.
Speaker 1: --be related with that name.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, yeah, we went, we had a, pretty much, you know, all growing up we had, you know, church was a regular part of the routine.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--well, go ahead.
Speaker 2: I just gonna go back and say, one memory of Atlanta [Georgia] that I have.  So Atlanta holds a special place in my heart as like the first big city that I really was, that I really, you know, got to know and was attracted to.  We actually got a chance to go to the Martin Luther King Memorial in Atlanta.  And, you know, we got to go to Ebenezer Church, and my dad took me around there.  And one, and there was actually, this book on Martin Luther King [Jr.], that my dad bought for me is one of the--I think it was one of the first books that I read, that talked about, you know, it was a story about Martin Luther King growing up and Jim Crowe laws and how he became the person that he is.  And that was, I think that was the first time that I really ever thought about race and how it fits into the larger picture.  And, you know, and it was educational.  It made Martin Luther King one of the, you know, somebody very, you know, somebody to look up to.  It gave me a guiding example of the type of person I wanted to be.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think it was in that, during that era that Stevie Wonder had started a campaign to make King's birthday a holiday, Dr. King's birthday a holiday.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And with the "Happy Birthday To You" on the air.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, it had been '68' [1968] and no one had made a move to do that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 24140
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, now, how long were you in Anniston [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: We were there from 1979 to 1983.
Speaker 1: Okay, so in '83' [1983], what grade were you in?
Speaker 2: I was, I'd just finished third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then the family moved again?
Speaker 2: We moved to Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay, Lewisburg.  Now, Lewisburg in terms of--
Speaker 2: Lewisburg is in central Pennsylvania, I think about an hour from Harrisburg, which is the capital of Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of your school there?
Speaker 2: Kelly Elementary.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was this a public school?
Speaker 2: Public school, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, now, how long were you in Lewisburg?
Speaker 2: One year.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have any memories of Lewisburg in school in Lewisburg?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so one thing, in Lewisburg, we actually lived on the reservation, on the federal, for employees of the penitentiary.  My mom [Nadine Francis Jenkins] worked at Bucknell University, which was, which was actually really interesting to see.  You know, just see, you know, a larger institution because when we lived in Alabama, my mom worked for Talladega College which is a historically black college, historically black college.  And that was, that was really, you know, that gave me one perspective.  And actually, that was really a pretty fun place to be.  Bucknell is a much larger school, that's more of your standard, you know, your standard university in terms of demographics and has a much larger selection, you know, of academics.  And, you know, and has a bigger, bigger football stadium, so you got to see that.  But also, you know, memories are, you know, that was the, so where we were in Alabama, we just had a--we didn't have HBO (laughter) and the hotel we were staying in, we had to stay in a hotel for about a, for several weeks.  And it had HBO.  And that was a big deal.  And it had a pool with a diving board (laughter), and diving, that was a lot of fun.  But it's a much smaller, it's a much, sort of smaller place, much more, you know, people had lived there, I think for a lot longer in terms of community and knowing who everybody else was.  It was, you know, I think people were very nice, but it was also more of a sense of being an outsider in Lewisburg.  But, then again, we were only really there for a year.
Speaker 1: So, now, when you make these moves were you, did you feel like the school was keeping pace with the former school that you attended or was it behind or--
Speaker 2: I thought it was, I thought it was a great school to be a part of, you know.  I think, I think, you know, being in a private school, you have more resources, you have more, you know, more things that you can do.  But the teachers that I had the public schools were quite good, you know, the--they actually took time to give me, you know, to give me extra tutoring in math which was something that I liked.  You know, and so I personally have a very, have very good memories of public schools.  As an aside, it just, it kind of hurts me right now to see public schools in the shape that they're in.  You know, I can say in Rhode Island we're, that we're not able to live in the places that we'd like to live because of, you know, they don't have the diversity that we'd like and be able to send our kids to public school, which is regretful.  So.
Story_ID: 24141
Speaker 1: So you were there a year, and then the family moved again?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In '84' [1984]?
Speaker 2: Eighty-four [1984].
Speaker 1: Okay, and where did you go this time?
Speaker 2: We moved to Wheaton, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Wheaton, Illinois, okay.  And so, what's the name of the prison there?
Speaker 2: Its' the Metropolitan Correctional Center.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So if you're coming in from the Western suburbs, and if you drive under the Post Office and then pretty much as soon as you drive under the Post Office, you look to the--I think it's the right, you'll see this tall building with very, very long, thin windows.  That would, and if it's still there, that would be the Metropolitan Correctional Center.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how long were you in Wheaton?
Speaker 2: We were there for four years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's like, so eighth grade, I guess?
Speaker 2: Through eighth grade, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were there any particular teachers that were like mentors to you, you know, during this period of time [at Lowell Elementary School]?
Speaker 2: I think, you know, I think I had, you know, I think part of the reason why my parents chose to live in Wheaton, of all places, is that we had, you know, we had good, good, you know, we had great teachers, our grade-school system.  My fifth grade teacher was excellent.  He had, he actually had the programming instruction sets that I could use and take home and play around with, which were, you know, very helpful for me to engage in computing.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: I was able to give a couple of presentations on, you know, on using computers to do things, to program, how to program computers, although my knowledge at the time was very limited.  But there were all sorts of great, you know, I, you know, even though it was, you know, growing up in the '80's [1980s] in a highly Republican area, there were lots of, there were, you know, I wouldn't say that I sense that, that I sensed that there were, you know, there were differences among people.  I had, I had lots of fun in Wheaton.  You know, I was part of a Boy Scout troop where we had lots of, we had lots of great leaders.  We got to go on camping retreats and summer camps that were lots of fun.  You know, I played sports and I was able to engage with, you know, I got to go computer camps and meet with people with like interests, although still very, very narrow.  You know, my mom worked at Aurora University, and I got to meet people that actually knew what they were doing in terms of computer science and actually had done things like cracked games.  So that was a big deal, like being able to crack a game.  So a game would be distributed on floppies and they'd have certain, you know--but you couldn't copy the game from, you know, I sort of pirated games.  But you couldn't copy the game from one floppy to another unless somebody cracked it.  And so when somebody cracked a game, then they would put their name, and you could--and when it proliferated all across to other people who were copying the, you know, across the community, you'd see, you know, maybe there's, you know, "Summer Games" or "Jungle Hunt" cracked by somebody's name.
Speaker 1: So they took pride in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter) yeah.  You know, it's the beginning of sort of like, you know, it's sort of like the hacker culture, you know.  Whoever, I mean I'd say whoever cracked "Kareteka", you know, that was a big deal because that game was incredible, and, you know, it was very complicated.  And--
Speaker 1: What's the name of it again?
Speaker 2: K-A-R-E-T-E-K-A, I believe, but that was like, you know, but knowing that there were people that knew how to do this, and they had the sophistication, and some of those people were people that my mom knew.  Some of those were students at Aurora University.  That was like, wow, this is really, really interesting, and I wanna know how to do that myself.
Story_ID: 24142
Speaker 1: Now, we were talking off camera about the College of DuPage [Glen Ellyn, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and their jazz station.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And Wheaton College [Illinois] where you weren't allowed to dance.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: These are both in DuPage County, right there near Wheaton.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  I had a, I remember having a teaching assistant in I think one of my classes that was from Wheaton College.  And she was very nice, and, you know, a good person, and, you know, but very reserved, you  know, like lots of fun, but, you know, but there was just, you know, but just, you know, just a little bit more conservative in terms of how she approached things.  But I do the first, one of the computer classes that I took, sort of on my own was at the College of DuPage, and they, you know, and they had, you know, you would drive by, and you'd see this big campus with glass windows all over the place.  And that was, that was fun.  That was, that's where maybe I proliferated a few cracked games and learned how to do, you know, and learned how to do certain things.  My, my biggest, the hardest problem I had was typing.  So I wasn't able to type fast enough.  I wasn't able to type as fast as some of the other people.  So that's why when I got to middle school, I took typing.  Typing's important, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so this is Wheaton--Kelly School in Wheaton and let's see, seems like I didn't.  No, Kelly was in the other town, in--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was the name of your school in Wheaton.
Speaker 2: So in Wheaton, I went to Lowell Elementary.
Speaker 1: Lowell?
Speaker 2: And then I went to Edison Middle School.
Speaker 1: Okay, Edison Middle School?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, that's appropriate.  Here we're sitting in Menlo Park [California] now.  Edison--
Speaker 2: Well, my teachers at the time may have not said that I was on Edison's level, but (laughter).
Story_ID: 24143
Speaker 1: All right, so is there any--so you were in the Boy Scouts and you're doing--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you get into computer cracking culture now.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  So I mean there were a number of things like one thing I desperately tried to ask my mom was to buy me a modem so I could connect to some of these other things.  And she flatly refused because she thought I'd get in trouble.  I, you know, I'd say that it was, that, you know, I had a lot of fun.  I think one thing that, as much as I had an interest in computing, there wasn't really a lot of outlets for that.  So there were, there weren't a lot of people that knew how to program computers, how to use computers.  You know, I think usually at the schools, there were, it was given to the librarian to manage the, you know, the computers.  And they didn't quite, I don't think they knew what to do.  They treated computers like books.  And so you had to reserve time and you gotta be quiet, and you really, you know, it wasn't about exploring so much.  And so it was somewhat a restrictive time to, you know, to try to get involved, but--
Speaker 1: Now, these are the early days of the PC, that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --now we're talking about, the 'mid-'80's [1980s]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the early days of PC, with Apple, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --SE and other--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --smaller computers, IBMs and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So they're starting to, you know, become a reality in the country.
Speaker 2: Right, so what would happen was, you know, the PC came out in the, you know, the early '80's [1980s].  The Macintosh [MAC], the FE-30, the box-looking Macintosh was '84' [1984].  I had an Apple 2e.  That's usually what you would see in a lot of, in a lot of schools, the Apple 2e because it was, you know, more affordable, a little bit more accessible.  And, you know, it usually had people that were, you know, were sort of MAC or PC, you know.  And since you did have, since people didn't have enough money to buy, to, you know, to buy a number of different computers, and they weren't very interoperable.  You would have different, you know, different sort of support sections, or, you know, different communities.  A lot of my friends had the Commodore 64, I don't know if you've--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --if you saw that.  But, you know, usually, I thought the better games came out on the Commodore 64.  But my parents wouldn't buy me one of those either (laughter).  So, you know, so usually you were stuck with those types of systems.  But I would say the game changer came around 1986 when, and this was actually a machine--this was the Nintendo NES [Nintendo Entertainment System] game systems.  I thought it was incredible.  And I actually had seen it earlier.  I'd seen it in these magazines like the "Sharper Image".  They would talk about the Famecom system from Japan and how you could play "Super Mario Brothers" and get an arcade-like quality.  And I was like, wow, when can we get that.  And before I knew it, I would see it at "Toy-R-Us".  I would just stare at "Toys-R-Us" at the Nintendo video reel.  They would just keep playing it over and over and over.  And I was just amazed, like how good the graphics were, how smooth the game play was, how, how, you know, how were they able to make this experience, and, you know, and, you know, it's clear that it's, you know, this is a 8-bit computer.  It has a lot more memory, you know, the, you just have a lot more computing power.  But I didn't, you know, most people, and I definitely didn't understand at the time, what the differences were in computing.  I just knew that this was a really cool game.  I wanted to play "Super Mario Brothers".  I wanted to play the baseball game that they had.  I wanted to play "Metroid", I wanted to play all those things.  I guess "Metroid" wasn't out at the time.  But, you know, but they had a lot of, they had, they were able to approximate the experience that I could get on these big computers in the arcade games, and that I would have to go to arcades to see and pay .25 cents per game.  And I could have that at my house.  That was amazing.  And so, my parents, my parents, my whole family didn't hear anything except for, about Nintendo, that whole, you know, the whole fall and early winter of 1986, it was just, it was all about Nintendo (laughter).  And then finally, I was visiting my, we were visiting my relatives, my uncle in Texas.  And they'd heard all about Nintendo, and so Christmas Day, I got a Nintendo.  And it was just, it was incredible.  It was, it was a game changer in my life probably at the expense of my grades.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that real game changer (laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm sure my dad looked at it and said, let, you know, this kid just spends all his time just playing videogames.  You know, what's going on?  But, you know, I, in retrospect, I like to think it's training for my career in computing.
Story_ID: 24144
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, for a lot of parents, that was the lament, you know, these kids are spending all their time playing videogames.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You can't even get 'em to have exercise.  They won't--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You can't get 'em to go out and play ball and--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --they're just watching this screen, and their thumbs are getting stronger and stronger.  But that's about it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it's--
Speaker 2: So for me, I'd definitely go outside and play 'cause, you know, I was on the basketball team.  You know, I played in, you know, I played recreation baseball and basketball.  I played on the middle school basketball team, you know.  You could get me to go out and do those things.  The thing that wasn't getting done was homework (laughter) and maybe the, that's where, that was the thing, homework and everything that had to do with academics were, you know, those were the things that I would be lacking in.  But I would also say that at the time, the educational system was more of your standard, you know, reading, writing and arithmetic, sort of, you know, structured curriculum.  And a lot of sort of academic-style, just in case learning.  So it was hard to say, well, I'm learning math, I'm learning, you know, grammar, I'm learning about history, how does this apply to things that I'm really interested in like, like computing.  Like there was no place for me to learn programming and learn how I could take the things I'm taking--that I'm getting from the math courses that I'm taking and apply those to, to making better programs or making better games.  And I think there is a better awareness of that now, and we're trying to better connect, better connect what you're learning in the classroom to the thing that you actually wanna do.  So that's something that I think is getting a lot better.
Story_ID: 24145
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in terms of, were you thinking at that stage that you would like to become a computer programmer or involved in science on some level?
Speaker 2: I didn't think I was smart enough.  It's what I enjoyed, but, you know, but with the grades that I was getting, it wasn't, you know, it wasn't--it didn't seem like I would be in a position to actually do something in that, in the sciences.
Speaker 1: What were your grade like?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) They were bad (laughter).  They were, yeah, I mean I think if, I think if I came home, and I had--I'm sure that there were no all A-semesters.  I was never a straight-A student, you know.  I think straight B's would have been a good, you know, if I had four B's and two A's, I think that would have been, that would be a really strong semester for me, a really strong report card.  You know, I mean it's a combination of maybe I wasn't, you know, the curriculum didn't engage me at the time, and so I was bored.  But also, I didn't try.  You know, my mindset was videogames and computers and playing ball.
Story_ID: 24146
Speaker 1: Now, were your parents away a lot because they both had demanding jobs--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --it seems, and long commutes.
Speaker 2: Right, so they were away in terms of commuting, but, you know, they were typically around.  You know, maybe my dad took a couple of trips here or there, but for the most part, they were around.  They, you know, I travel, as a professor, I travel a lot more than my parents ever did.  But they were definitely engaged, and they were definitely worried, and, you know, and it wasn't something that they took lightly.  You know, I dreaded every report card that came home because I knew that it was gonna be, you know, it wasn't gonna end up, it wasn't gonna be pretty for me.
Story_ID: 24147
Speaker 1: What about your brother?  Now, your brother is like, how many years younger than you?
Speaker 2: He's about three years--
Speaker 1: Three years, okay.
Speaker 2: --three or four years younger than I am.
Speaker 1: So were you and your brother close in terms of the things you did around the house?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I mean we both liked playing videogames.  He was much, both my, I think both my brother and sister were much more focused academically.  [sneeze] Pardon me.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: So, yeah, so my brother was, I think they were a lot better about getting things done, and, you know, staying in the good graces of school and making sure that they took care of what they needed to take care of.  But we, I mean I spent a lot of time with my brother, you know, watching cartoons, you know, "Transformers", "GI Joe".  You know, we played lots of games together.  You know, we were involved in similar things.
Speaker 1: So Robots were also like, I mean you just mentioned "Transformers"--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the way those little things would fold up and everything, and they actually had models of, three-dimensional models of how you could unfold one of them--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It'd be a car, and then you'd make him a robot.
Speaker 2: Right, so I wasn't into that as much, but my brother was.  My brother had Transformers all over the place.  And I thought they were really, you know, they were interesting, but not something that I was into.  And maybe I would take Lego's and try to model some of the Transformers and like, you know, make my own.  But that didn't necessarily go that far (laughter), yeah.
Story_ID: 24148
Speaker 1: So in 19--so you were there, you were in Wheaton until when?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety eight [1998].
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-eight [1988]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen, yeah, 1988, sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1988.   And where did you go in '88' [1988]?
Speaker 2: In 1988, '88' [1988], we moved to Alexandria, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where is Alexandria in relation to New Orleans [Louisiana] say or Baton Rouge [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: It is in the Central part of the state.  So we're, it's near, it's not close to Shreveport, and it's not really close to Baton Rouge.  I think maybe a two-hour or three-hour drive from Baton Rouge, maybe a two or three hour drive from Shreveport [near Monroe, LA].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it is probably, you know, maybe the most recognizable city in Central Louisiana, but nationally, it's, you know, it's not nearly as well known as Shreveport or Baton Rouge and New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now, what school did you attend Alexandria.
Speaker 2: I attended Alexandria Senior High School.
Speaker 1: Is this a pretty good school?
Speaker 2: I thought it was pretty good academically.  You know, I would say that in comparison to the school that I ended up graduating from high school in New Jersey, it wasn't nearly as high-powered, you know, academically.  But, you know, I'd say that, you know, you could get, we had the basics of, you know, for your reading, writing and arithmetic.  You know, I played one year of football.  Football is a big deal there.  Part of me wishes that I would have, you know, played a few more years of football.  So growing up in the '80's [1980s] basketball was, I think was really starting to gain, you know, gain mindshare in, amongst the kids, the kids that were growing up at the time 'cause you had Michael Jordan and, you know, Dominique Wilkins doing, you know, having the dunk contests, and your basketball was just a much bigger deal.  I mean that was, you know, Magic [Johnson] and Byrd [Larry Byrd] had been doing great for a while and Michael Jordan was just getting big.  And so that was like, that was a big deal at the time.  But I realize now that my body was probably better suited for football (laughter) and maybe that was a--
Speaker 1: So did you--
Speaker 2: --somewhat a better choice.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you go out for basketball?
Speaker 2: I did.  I would say that I would consider myself to be a JV All star, which means I warmed the bench on the varsity (laughter).  I didn't, you know, I didn't get a lot of playing time.
Speaker 1: Well, you did play, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, now did you play guard?
Speaker 2: I was actually, so I grew up, I grew pretty fast so I've been about the same height since, you know, since fourteen, fifteen.  So I started as like a forward when I played, you know, freshman year and slowly became more of a guard.  I was, I think I was maybe a forward at the time, but, you know, but like a smaller forward, but, you know, but by the time, by the time I finished high school, you know, I, you know, if I wasn't playing guard, then I just wasn't playing at all.
Story_ID: 24149
Speaker 1: Now, this has got to be tough, like moving so much.  Now, here you're starting high school, and, well in some ways it's, I guess it's good to be able to start high school if you're new, than come in the middle of it.  So.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would say, I mean I would say one thing that, I'd say that moving was really hard growing up because I was always the outsider, you know, like people had been there, you know, had typically, you know, gone to school together for, you know, since they, as long as they could remember.  The social, you know, the social arrangement had already been set up.  And so I was always, I was definitely more on the outside.  I would say going to, you know, going to Alexandria Senior High [Louisiana], you know, the, walking into the cafeteria was, you know, you know, I gravitated towards more of the people on the outside, the people that didn't quite fit in more so than, you know, than the popular kids or the other kids.  You know, you walk into the cafeteria , and it's clear that there's somewhat of a racial divide, you know, like most of the black kids sit over here.  Most of the white kids over here, and then all the people that don't fit into maybe, you know, popular, into the arrangement, like more of your skater types or, you know, people that are into computers or something like that, that would be where I would end up.  And, you know, I didn't mind that.  I guess I, to some extent I felt comfortable.  I think you could describe me as a geek with jock tendencies, you know, with jock interests.  So I liked playing basketball.  I liked going out and doing things that are athletic, but, you know, but it's clear, like, you know, the thing that gets me really motivated is, are things like computers and building Lego sets and, you know, tinkering with Erector's.  That's, you know-- what I like.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: But I would say that moving around actually gave me a different perspective than a lot of people.  You know, I considered it and sort of expected that I'm gonna have to go where the opportunities are, where opportunities are.  So I'm going to, you know, moving is just a part of life.  And it made me look outside of my current situation.  So, and so, you know, when I went to college, I expected that that might be, that's gonna be move, and I'm not expecting that it's gonna be right in the location where I'm at.  You know, when I went to graduate school, I went to Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology] for graduate school.  And that's a move and I'm gonna go, and I expected, I'm expecting that I'm not, that I may have to move to go to do my PhD, where I moved to USC [University of Southern California] to do my PhD.  And it's clear that in most cases, for a faculty position, that you're not gonna be hired at the same institution where you did your degree.  And so that was a move for me.  Fortunately, I got a position at Brown [University].  And so, and I don't think it's restricted to just faculty life or just academia.  You have to be prepared to go where the opportunities are.  And that's, I think that's what I got out of moving around so much.
Story_ID: 24150
Speaker 1: So, now, in high school, now you were there only--were in Alexandria [Louisiana] for a couple of years before you moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: I moved to, I moved there--we were there for three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we moved to South Jersey, where my parents, both my parents worked in Philadelphia.  And that's where I graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were any, now, were you majoring in--well, you don't major in high school, but were you taking heavy science curriculum in high school?
Speaker 2: No, not necessarily.
Speaker 1: In terms of math, how far did you go in math?  Did they offer calculus or did you take anything like that?
Speaker 2: I would say that if you looked at the first part of my high school career, it was mixed.  You know, it was, it definitely, I think I was very, my performance was very much dependent upon the teacher that I had and my engagement in the subject.  For instance, I, I'm pretty sure I got a "D" in Algebra I.  I didn't do very well in Algebra I.  I just wasn't, it just, you know, I think I pulled out all the concepts, but I just never really applied them.  I never really did the homework.  I didn't do that well on the tests.  But I got an "A" in biology pretty easily.  I don't think I had to work that hard to get it, to get an "A" in biology.  I just, for some reason, it just sank in, and I just seemed to be engaged with the material.  I don't know.  And so, you know, so it was a mix, it was mixed success.  I did, you know, I had, I'm pretty I had an "F" in typing (laughter).  I don't know how you get an "F" in typing.  But I did (laughter).  You know, and, you know, I had "A" in literature.  I, you know, it was just mixed.  And so, so I wouldn't look at the quality of the education based on my performance.  I would just say that at the time I didn't know what I wanted.  I didn't, I wasn't, I was immature.  I definitely hit my low point academically during that period.
Speaker 1: Which, what year would it be?
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: What year would be your lowest--
Speaker 2: Eleventh grade--
Speaker 1: Eleventh grade.  That's your third year--
Speaker 2: That was my third year, yeah.  I mean, well, I mean eleventh grade was, you know, was the time when I went from being maybe one of the taller kids in class to, you know, to just average, where I'm not getting a lot of playing time on, you know, athletically, you know, like, you know, it's clear at that point that I'm not going to, you know, I'm not going to get where--I'm not gonna play professional basketball or any sort of dream that, dream that I may have of professional baseball or something like that.  And, you know, and I'm not doing well academically, you know.  And so, you know, so it was just a sort of a low point where I have to figure out, well, what am I doing here?  You know, what are the things that really interests me, and maybe I--it was a maturing point in terms of I need to actually, you know, if I wanna do something, I'm gonna have to apply myself and, you know, I can't just play videogames all the time.  And it helped that, you know, that, I mean maybe part of the thing that helped was that, you know, Nintendo, I'd already had a Nintendo for a while.  And so maybe the games got a little bit more boring.  So it gave me time to, it gave me a little bit more time to think about other things.
Story_ID: 24151
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, were there any special teachers or people that were in your life in Alexandria that--
Speaker 2: I think, you know, there were lots of people that were around.  You know, I think at different times there were different people that I tended to hang around a little bit more, teachers that had more of an influence that helped me out.  And I think it was, that was--I think that was just a rough time where, you know, I think some people look back at high school, and they say high school was great, the best time of their lives, and they got to do so much.  And I, and there's another group of people that says high school was miserable because I'm trying to figure out what's going on, and I don't know where I fit, and I definitely fit with the people that didn't (laughter), that didn't like high school very much.  It got a lot better when I got to college.  I think high school also, it's so regimented in terms of, you do classes and you have, you know, you have classes and you're there.  You have to wake up early.  You're there till 3:00 o'clock, and if you have to play a sport after that, you're there till 5:00 o'clock.  And then you were just too tired to do homework, and, you know, and it's just, it's just a big grind whereas college, you had a lot more flexibility in terms of your coursework and, you know, you're not in class all the time.  You're, you have more control over your schedule.  And I think I, I personally flourished more in the college model than the high school model.
Story_ID: 24152
Speaker 1: Okay, what about your senior year?  Now, you're in--are you going to school in New Jersey?
Speaker 2: In New Jersey, so--
Speaker 1: Near Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], but--
Speaker 2: Near Philadelphia.  So we lived in a city called Voorhees [New Jersey].  And, and so that was, so that was, that's, you know, that's right on the New Jersey-Philadelphia border, close to the, so many people will commute into Philadelphia.  My mom worked at Temple [University], and my dad was working at a regional office for the federal corrections system.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they both commuted into Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: All right, so did you, now, what--did you take higher math than Algebra?  Did you take Geometry in--
Speaker 2: So, my progression mathematically through high school was Algebra I, Geometry, Geometry and Trigonometry.  Then Algebra II, and I took pre-calc, as a senior.  But one thing that the school in New Jersey could offer that the, that I couldn't get in Louisiana was I was able to take my first real programming course, you know, as part of my curriculum.  And that was a course in the FE programming language, and that was just, that was a great class.  It was my, it was the first time I actually had the, had what we called a, worked with a compiled language.  So usually, so when you're making an application for a computer, you can--there's one of two ways you can do it.  You could write your code or you can execute the code.  One is through interpretation.  So every command that you give to the computer, it takes it, interprets it and then acts on it.  So it, when it, when I say "act" on it, it takes that code that you've written as a programming language and converts that into the machine code that actually runs on the, onto the computer, whereas a compiled system takes all the code that you've written and compiles it into machine code at once.  And so it, hopefully, it will run faster and you can optimize it for performance.  And so, in the past, as a kid I'd been using interpretative languages that weren't very performant, whereas the FE programming, when it was my first time with a compiled language that performed, that, you know, that was more suited towards developing serious applications, especially at that time.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your high school here in New Jersey?
Speaker 2: That was Eastern Regional High School.
Story_ID: 24153
Speaker 1: When you graduated from high school, well, what were your prospects?  What were you thinking about going to--were you thinking about going to college?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Both my parents basically, you know, said that, you know, for all of our kids, we're going to college.  They, and as far as they were concerned, your only real career prospects, you know, require a college degree.  So that was ingrained into me and my brother and sister very early on.  And my dad actually, I mean and my mom being, working in higher education, I got to experience it.  I think the fact that both my parents have graduate educations, you know, was, you know, served as a model for me to say, you know, as sort of in the back of my head, you know, a graduate education is something that I should strive for, just by their example.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, yeah, so I was thinking about colleges, and even as, even in, you know, all throughout middle school and high school, whenever we would drive through an area, you know, my dad and my mom point out the schools that were there.  And maybe we would drive through and take a look, you know, very cursory.  I actually got to go to basketball camp at LSU [Louisiana State University] which was, I think going to camp at, on college campuses, even, and this was basketball camp, it was just a great experience to feel what the vibe is like on campus.  And so that was, that was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: LSU, now was Shack [Shaquille O'Neal] around in those days?
Speaker 2: That was just before, so when I went, it was just before his--no, actually, he came the year, two years after I went, I did basketball camp there.  They had a guy named Jose Vargas, who was a pretty good player.  And the coach there, Dale Brown, was, you know, I actually got to shake his hand and talk with him very briefly, but he was a really nice guy and during the time, and I, I was very impressed.  It was great to, it was a great time, yeah.
Story_ID: 24154
Speaker 1: Is there anything special about Eastern Region before we have you leave and go to college (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd never been to, you know, to such a high-powered high school in terms of academics.  You know, they had, they offered satellite courses, you know.  All the students were heavily involved in the college process, you know, college admissions.  You know, everybody had, everybody had--I got the sense that everybody there was college bound, and had prospects, whereas in Louisiana, it was much different because I think you had a certain set of people that were more of the elites, more of the people that were college bound, but most people didn't necessarily know if they were going to college.  It was, you know, there were people that were from a background that wasn't necessarily, you know, college educated, and you know, much more blue collar, working class.  Some people, you know, there were, you know, I could see the, you could see the effects of social tracking.  You could see the effects of people that were being promoted that maybe weren't trained, just to get them out of the system or more people in remedial classes.  You know, I took away from that experience that, you know, more so than the education that I got, more so, the people that are involved, how the educational system works with, you know, with people that aren't necessarily being prepared for the world.
Story_ID: 24155
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how did you choose Alma College in Michigan?
Speaker 2: Right, so when we lived in Chicago [Illinois], my mom worked at Aurora University, and she worked with two people, Allen Stone and John Feveland (ph.) who became, Allen Stone who became the president of Alma College, and John Feveland who became a vice president.  And so, when I was looking for colleges, they highly recommended I think about Alma.  And I got into a number of schools that I was really interested in.  You know, given my interest in engineering and computer science, I was really, really looking at Case Washington Reserve [University] as a place where I wanted to go.  But there was something about going to a small teaching college that was interesting, and, you know, and I think that's what I needed at that time in my life.  I needed something that was more instruction heavy, that was focused on undergraduate education.  I was, there were a number of large schools, large state schools that I got into that have great programs in things that I was interested in, in terms of computing.  And at the time, I was really thinking about accounting, and, but Alma as a place to, you know, maybe help me grow up a little bit, I think was a good nurturing environment.
Speaker 1: Okay, were you still kind of, didn't think you were smart enough to do the stuff you really wanted to do?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.  I thought, I had taken accounting in high school, my last year of high school.  And I liked it, and it's something that I was considering, you know, it's something that seemed within my skill set, you know, nothing too ambitious.  And so I did, so I went to college thinking I was gonna do accounting.  And I took computer science and calculus just sort of like as a, you know, hey, let's just try it and see.  And it was actually a good thing because the major in business, you couldn't actually enter it into, as a first-year student.  You had to wait till your second year to start taking the, enter business classes.  They made you take economics first.  So I started, so my first year of college was Calc I, Computer Science I and Macro Economics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it turns out, I--computer science was the thing that I liked.  And I was actually pretty good at it.  I was better at it than I thought I was gonna be.
Story_ID: 24156
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it's, Alma College [Michigan] is about 93, 95 percent in state.  And it was, and, you know, it's mostly, you know, mostly white, but there were a fair number of students of color around.  And one thing that they did that was excellent, so the, at the provost office at the time, they had this program called the Four-F program, where they brought essentially minority students together, six weeks before the semester started to take, essentially take English, to take English 101.  And we had Carol Bender as an instructor.  And that was a great experience, to actually get used to the campus and make friendships with lots of students of color before everything had already started.  And that was, you know, that, those were great friendships that I was able to have throughout college.  And also it just gave me a sense of, it gave me a little bit of a sense of confidence that I could perform at the collegiate level.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you still had doubts that you could perform at the collegiate level after--
Speaker 2: Definitely.  Yeah, yeah, I mean I think part of the thing is that I am (excuse me), I never really performed well in the elementary and secondary system as it was during the '80's [1980s] and '90s [1990s] when I was there.  It was, it's just a much more structured, regimented system that didn't necessarily align with my interests.  And it made me think that, you know, that maybe I just wasn't smart, you know, like it kind of--it beats you down because you think, because you get your report card every six weeks or so.  And it basically says, you're really that smart.  But, you know, but I think--and so being able to come into a situation and, you know, and focus on one class, and you only have to be at that class for, you know, for maybe three hours of the day.  And then you can spend the rest of the day exploring other interests and, you know, working on the extracurricular assignments or the, you know, extra--outside the course room assignment, the homework.  That was, I think a lot better, that's just a lot better model for me.  And it, you know, and sometimes I think this is the case not just with me but, you know, but with students in general, they just become frustrated because they're doing well in high school.  And they think, well, then I just might not be smart.  This just isn't the path for me, but maybe it's just finding a better match between their interests and the training that they need.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that way, you're lucky.  I suppose a lot of students really don't--they fail to meet that challenge at a certain point.  I mean they, or they can't, they don't have an opportunity to really crash through that barrier.
Speaker 2: Right, I mean I think, I mean, so I grew up as pretty much middle class or, you know, maybe you might even say upper-middle class, you know, environment.  And so I think I was given the opportunities to, you know, to explore and to get to a position where I could actually be successful, whereas a lot of kids, you know who socio-economically don't necessarily have those same opportunities.  They're just told they're not smart, and, you know, and you have to go do something else.  And I think that's a waste of our talent.  I think that's, I think we need, you know, we need to find an educational model that works for, that can adapt to the individual student.  You know, some students aren't gonna, aren't gonna necessarily wanna be in computing.  They're gonna wanna do something else or maybe they just want a job. Maybe they, at the core, they don't necessarily have a passion in life that they, that they need to follow.  They just want a career that's gonna be able to provide for their family.  And so that's viable too, but it's all about finding, you know, where your, you know, what's gonna work for a particular student.  And I think the model at the time was, that I grew up with, was not let's find what's best for you.  It was more like, this is what you have to do in order to, you have to run through these hoops in order for--and that's how we're gonna value your level of intellect.
Story_ID: 24157
Speaker 1: Okay, so these classes you took, computer science and calculus, you actually excelled in those?
Speaker 2: I would say I did really well in the computer science class.  And I think I did, I did reasonably well in economics.  Math (laughter), math is always a challenge, you know.  I think I was a, you know, an above-average maybe student in calculus.  But I was really interested in it.  I was told very early on, I got great advice from my computer science advisor, from my advisor in computer science, who basically said, if you're even thinking about doing graduate school in computer science, you need to get at least a math minor.  And that turns out to be right.  I think math is one of those things that, lots of students shy away from math or they think it's difficult.  It's really just about, you know following, instructions and then being able to understand the rules that, you know, and that you can extend those rules to new domains if you basically have the mathematical foundation in place.  And also computer science is, really what we're doing in computer science, is we're taking math and we're expressing it in terms of programming.  And so math is just fundamental to that process.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's what a lot of people have said, that there's certain principles that if you know in math, and they build, you know, through--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --all the different levels of math.  But if you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --don't learn one, you can't start at the other one and expect to understand it.
Speaker 2: Right.  I mean math is a, you know, with other areas of the academy, you could potentially jump in and, you know, gain an understanding of this particular area of history, you know, or understand this philosopher or, you know, or jump into a certain process, you know, understanding maybe the chemistry of a certain process.  In math, you know, you really have to build on, you know, it starts from the beginnings of addition and subtraction, multiplication, going all the way through, you know, Algebra and Geometry up through calculus, linear Algebra, statistics.  You know, all these things build on each other, but it's the fundamental way that we communicate, you know, logical operations.  It's the way we, it's really the way that we express computation, whether it's done by a computer or done manually by hand or maybe a mechanical device.  So that's, you know, you can't BS math for sure.
Story_ID: 24158
Speaker 1: Now it says here that you were the resident assistant in your sophomore year--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the dorm.
Speaker 2: So I was a resident assistant for three years--
Speaker 1: Now, wait a minute.  Here's somebody that didn't think you were mature--you needed to mature, and now by the time you're a sophomore, you're resident assistant (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, well, I had a really good first year, you know.  I made the Dean's List.  I was, you know, I was getting good grades.  I was getting adjusted, you know, and I thought, you know, maybe I could do that job.  Lots of people applied to be RA's, and fortunately, I was selected.  You know, I think I was selected more to, you know, to be RA of the maybe more nerdier or geekier or dorkier, yeah, sections.  I was definitely not, you know, I was definitely not the RA for the more fraternity types or, you know, or things like that 'cause that would have just been a bad match.  But, yeah, I was resident assistant for three years.  And that was a fun job, you know.  It gave me a way to try to provide a fun, but, you know, but not out of control environment for people in my quad--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to just be around and make it, you know, make it a fun environment to be a part of.
Story_ID: 24159
Speaker 1: Now it says here also that you worked as an undergraduate research intern in the prism lab at the University of Texas at Arlington during the summer.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, so when I was, after my sophomore, my mom--at that point, my parents were living in Dallas [Texas].  My dad was working at a regional office in downtown Dallas.  Actually, we were living in Arlington, Arlington, Texas, and my mom was working at U-T Arlington [University of Texas, Arlington].  And she was able to, you know, and I didn't necessarily have a plan for the summer.  I didn't have a plan for an internship that I would wanna do.  In retrospect, I would, you know, knowing now what, if I knew then what I know now, I would have like a really nice internship lined up.  But, you know, back in the '90's [1990s], that was less, you know, those opportunities were less prevalent.  But my mom was able to connect me with a researcher on artificial intelligence at U-T Arlington, and they had, and they basically had a project that they were working, they had a couple of projects that I sort of worked on while I was there.  I learned, for one of the projects was knowledge representation projects for, to help people that are, you know, to triage, medical triage.  And so I learned a programming language called LIFT in order to do that.  But probably the more fun thing that I did was, excuse me, the more fun thing was actually using web technologies.  So the World Wide Web had just started at that point, you know.  Before that I had, and probably the reason why I think they were interested in having me work on this was I knew some of the early Internet technology such as Telnet and FTP and Gofer, as a way for you to exchange files or log into remote systems.  And around the early '90's [1990s], around 1993 is when they released the first web browser which was called Mosaic. I don't know if you ever saw Mosaic, but--
Speaker 1: I didn't, but, yeah, but keep on, that's Mosaic.
Speaker 2: So there was, so the NCSA [National Center for Supercomputing Applications] released this thing called Mosaic.  It was the first web browser, and I set up one of those.  And so me and actually a friend set up the web server for Alma College.  It wasn't very much.  It just said Alma College and "under construction".  But we were able to get that server up.  But a lot of that came from my friend, named Jim Blum at Alma College who exposed me to these web technologies.  And I took some of that to, some of that knowledge to this internship where I got to learn about how, you know, basically how HTML works, you know, how the browser works, a little bit of the server side, you know, the basic protocol for HTP.  And we would go out and give talks to show people how they could make these web interfaces by themselves, how to create their own web pages, how to imbed content, not imbed, but maybe link to concepts such as movies or audio, you know.  And we just had fun with the scanner, being able to scan the various images and have them show up.  And so, you know, that was a fun time to learn about the web.  And if was smarter, I would have probably gotten in on web technologies earlier and maybe been a part of the big web boom that happened in the '90's [1990s].  But, yeah, that's what I did for that internship.
Story_ID: 24160
Speaker 1: Okay, this is, yeah, in the early days of the web, yeah.  And so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they had, they didn't have like the fast network that we have now.  It was, a lot of it was over dial-up, you know, from in the, at U-T [University of Texas] Arlington, they had, you know, we had actual Ethernet.  We actually connected, so that you, it made things a little bit faster.  But, you know, but it was nothing compared to the speeds that we have now.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you have a personal computer in those days?
Speaker 2: I did.  So I had, so I had, at that point I had a 486, an Intel 486 PC computer that I originally bought.  The reason why I bought it was to play "Doom".  I don't know if you've ever seen "Doom".  It was really the first 3-D, mostly 3-D, first person shooter type game.
Speaker 1: Now, it's called what now?
Speaker 2: Doom.
Speaker 1: Doom, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter), and so that, I mean that was, I mean by the time I got to college, you know, computing technology had gotten so much better.  We had, instead of just having the old Nintendo, we had the Saga Genesis which had just a remarkable capability to, you know, to render images and, you know, and create immersive experiences.  We had, you know, when I first got to Alma, we had a big mainframe computer that we all logged into, that, you know, that was like--that was, you know, somewhat clunky to use.  But by the end of it, we were all running, we all had, you know, IBM P--we all had PC's, Intel-based PC's, and we were running Linux on those systems.  So it's a (unclear) of UNIX that we could use instead of Windows.  And so that allowed us, you know, to experiment with more of the core, the core systems, the core software and operating systems that you would use for being a real software developer.
Speaker 1: And I guess it would also, I've heard it also protects you from a lot of computer viruses and stuff like that too, Linux instead of the regular--
Speaker 2: You know, you got, I think, you know, if you're running a machine with OS-10, you know, with MAC OS-10 or Windows, you know, you're a bigger target because, you know, 'cause more people run those systems, and they're less secure.  And if you're administering a machine with UNIX or with Linux, then it's more like working without a net.  You could configure things such that it's less secure or you could configure it so that it's much more secure.  But it depends mostly on your skills as an administrator, as a technician to make sure that your machine is safe, whereas OS-10 and Windows, you know, it hides a lot of things from you.
Story_ID: 24161
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now some of the things that you would work on later, I mean were you paying attention to CGI [computer generated imagery] in movies and that sort of thing in those days?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So I came into college, once I realized I think I could do something in computer science, my interests at the time, instead of being more interested in web technologies, which maybe was the safe bet at the, you know, which turned out to be a huge area, I was much more interested in 3-D computer graphics.  And so I took a course, you know, I lobbied, I actually lobbied to have a 3-D computer graphics course taught at Alma [College], and that was incredible.  That was great to experience, to see how you can actually make the 3-D images that you could, that would be produced and then people, then you started seeing videogames in movies.  And that interests is what led me to do a Masters degree at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology].  At the time, you know, given that graphics and AI [artificial intelligence] was like the thing that I was really interested in, Georgia Tech, you know, started this Graphics Visualization and Usability Center.  And it was something that I was really interested in and motivated by.  And so when I got to Georgia Tech, then I took my first, you know, sort of graduate-level course in computer graphics, and that was amazing.
Story_ID: 24162
Speaker 1: You had an internship at Ford System Integration Center in Allen Park [Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: On, I guess the summer between your junior and senior year?  And can you talk about that one for a minute?
Speaker 2: Right, so I worked at Ford Motor Company for, you know, in the summer 1995, and I actually lived--and they put us up at the University Tower in Ann Arbor [Michigan].  So I would commute from Ann Arbor to essentially, Allen Park is Dearborn [Michigan], essentially.  And I got to see what life was like doing more of the IT side of the Information Technology side.  You know, that was where I got my first taste of Windows 95, and we got to see all the bills and I got to see, you know, the people that were, you know, apparently, there were rumors that some of the people that--because Microsoft was helping us transition, helping Ford transition to Windows 95.  I got to see some people that, you know, that just looked like anybody else, but apparently were millionaires because they, you know, because they got into Microsoft, you know, pretty early.  But, you know, it's just great to see what the professionals are, you know, what professional IT people look like.  And, you know, and I think what I realized from that is that I'm just not that.  I'm, you know, these people do a great job to make sure the systems are up and running, and they're extremely knowledgeable, but my interests was more towards the innovation, you know, how could we do something new, make something that wasn't possible before.  And so that's what I--I left that experience thinking that graduate school was the right thing for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, because there was a path that you could have worked for Ford or something or could have-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I could have, I could have gone more down that route of, you know, whether it was for Ford or for another company, to do Information Technology and to be more of a professional IT person or to be a professional software developer.  And I realized that I'm just more interested, I was just more interested in knowledge, innovation than--I was more interested in the question than the answer.  I wanted to say how could we do this thing as opposed to how can we do things that we can't do before rather than somebody coming to me with a question and saying how do we answer that question.  How do we do this technical thing that we know is possible, but we just need to work out the details.  That wasn't (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That doesn't excite you.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Not at the time (laughter).
Story_ID: 24163
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in terms of your mentors in school, I have here that John Gibson was your physics instructor.  He was really important.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, there were a number of great people at Alma College [Michigan] that were a huge presence or, you know, so I took my electrical engineering classes.  They didn't offer many, but they offered some, and John Gibson was there.  You know, and he was, and I also took physics from him.  You know, he was a very demanding instructor, very competent, knew what he was doing.  We actually made a crystal radio system, you know, in one of his courses, and I still have that radio today.  I think it still works, you  know.  And that was great.  I don't think I always lived up to his expectations because it was, you know, 'cause sometimes I'd get a--I wasn't the best physics student.  But, you know, but I tried.  I, you know, my story is not a story of like I walk in and I understand because I'm just that smart.  My story is repeated failures until I actually get it, and, you know, and getting back up on the horse and, you know, and keeping, trying until I actually get it.  And physics and electrical engineering came a little bit easier to me because that fit with the computational models I had in my head.  But physics that I took with John Gibson, took a long time for me to get my head around.  And, you know, and, but I got a lot from his lectures.  He was a great teacher.  All of the people in math, the mathematics and computer science department were great.  I've, my advisor, Miles McNally, I took, you know, I took my course--when I realized I had a future in computer science is when I took data structures, a data structures course from him.  And data structures is sort of like the core course where you learn how to, where you learn how to program, you know, beyond the introductory level, where you're actually really making, making software that does some purpose.  And we would have code reviews.  So we'd have these code reviews that basically would, then we would write a program to solve, to solve the problem.  And then we'd have like a thirty-minute session where we had to answer questions.  The professor had gone through and gone through all of our code and was ready to grill us on certain parts of that.  And, you know, and I was being grilled in that session, and, you know, there was a design choice I made on one of the projects to essentially use a double-buffer ray.  And they were, he was asking me, why did you do this and why did you do that?  And I answered it, and he says, you know what?  That's a really nice idea.  That was a good idea to do that.  And I thought, wow, that was cool.  And so Miles McNally, you know, gave me a lot of mentorship.  We, he was the coach of the ACM programming team.  So they had these big competitions that started regional programming competitions and end up being worldwide.  You know, have, end up sort of crowing a world champion every year in programming.  And he was the captain of that, he was the coach of that team, and we'd have to, you have to go to a number of places and compete.  That was a lot of fun.  But it was just a fun department to be a part of.  My mathematics instructors, Professor Sitco (ph.) was, you know, I took calculus courses from him.  He actually was the one that taught the computer, my first collegiate computer graphics course.  That was, that was an amazing course.  Your, everybody in the department, you know, they were willing to put up with an average (laughter), an average math student and answer all my questions and help me understand.  And that was the benefit of going to a small, teaching-oriented college.
Speaker 1: Okay, the time that they could spend.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean math, getting a math major is not easy.  And so instruction is really key, and they were very good about instruction and helping me understand 'cause it took a lot of time, you know.  I wouldn't say that my grade in math were that good.  I think there's, there's maybe a point difference, a GPA point difference between my grades in computer science and my grades in math.  And so, you know, computer science, programming came, I would say not naturally, but it fit with the, with how I think about the world.  Math took a lot more effort.
Story_ID: 24164
Speaker 1: All right, so Atlanta [Georgia], Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Living in an area that's, you just described as kind of a dump when you were there (laughter).
Speaker 2: I wouldn't say, I mean Georgia Tech was, has always been a nice place.  But when you, but when you go, when you cross 75, 85, Interstate 75, 85, you know, they had, you know, there were areas of that, at that time that were not so nice.  And so with, you know, so it was kind of, being on campus on nice but other nearby areas weren't so good.
Speaker 1: You were saying, it's kind of been upgraded since you were there?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So the area near, if you're familiar with the area, the area near Fifth and Spring and where the, where currently the, where the TSRB Building, the Jordan Tech Hotel and the bookstore--the bookstore wasn't there when I was a student.  Now, it's all, you know, really nice.  And it's a place I like to go.  I like to go visit.  And, you know, in addition to all the great researchers that they have, especially, the significant effort they have in robotics at Georgia Tech is considerable.  The, but when I was, but the thing is that, the number of people that overlapped, that are there now versus the people that I was, that were there when I was a student, it's a slightly different set of people.  So every place changes and adapts.  I can say that the reason why I went to Georgia Tech as a, for a Masters student was to really dig down into 3-D computer graphics.  And they had a big, they have a--they still have a great set of, group of people in graphics.  At the time, it was just really emerging.  We, a lot of the graphics that you see are generated by this, by a library called the Open GL.  And that had, that was just emerging at the time that I was, that I was going to Georgia Tech.  And, but I learned, essentially, I had, I took a great class from an instructor named Greg Turk, who's a fabulous graphics researcher and also a great teacher.  And he, you know, we took a course in three-dimensional rendering that I still have a video from to this day.  But I got to learn the basics of, you know, how do we take three-dimensional polygons, project them into the screen, do transformations, all the things that I [learned in] linear Algebra, applying it to computer graphics to make images that looked like the, you know, sort of, on the level of what I could, what you see on, in production animation and--
Story_ID: 24165
Speaker 1: So, there's a question I was thinking about.  So when you're talking about 3-D graphics, you're talking about--all right, you're not talking about like 3-D with the glasses and that sort of thing, but--
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry, yeah.  So--
Speaker 1: More about the shading and the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --modeling of--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --a figure that looks like it's in (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Exactly, three-dimensional rendering is what we're talking about.
Speaker 1: Yeah, rendering, yeah.
Speaker 2: So I'm not talking about, like a stereoscopic display where essentially, you know, where it looks like it's a blurred image, but really what they're doing is they're trying to show one image to your left eye and another image to your right eye.  And the disparity between those two images give you the effect of three dimensions.  What we're talking, what I'm talking about is, how do you model a virtual three-dimensional world and then render that into a two-dimensional image so it looks as realistic or as expressive as you would like.  So, for instance, but just before I got to Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology], they released the first "Toy Story" movie, which was a big accomplishment for computer graphics because now you could procedurally, through 3-D computer animation, be able to make movies, a feature-length movie.  And that was very, that was a great accomplishment, but it also inspired people like me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seemed to me, in watching that movie the textures, you know, like are especially firm, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, I mean I just--it just boggled my mind.  How do they--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: How did they render that, you know, but it's as hard when you're using computer technology, right, to do it?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean there's two parts of it.  There's, you know, there's an artistic--there's the mathematical and computational of how do you, you know, how do you express that, how do you express the world in a way that you can actually render it out of that form.  But then even though you have that medium for expression, you still need the artist and the people that have that talent to visualize thing and express that visualization to use those tools.  And so I, as somebody who can't really draw or have limited artistic expression, computer graphics is a way for me to be expressive artistically without, but more from the mathematical, analytical side.  And that's something that I value.  And so, but once you understand how the process works, you know, that we, that essentially it's about taking triangles in an image and being able to fill them in with the right colors and then expressing that same triangle in three-dimensional space and projecting it into an image, and then finding out the right models for lighting that, that triangle, based on the property, on some basic properties of physics.  And then the texturing, texturing is actually a really big issue because what you're essentially doing is taking a piece from an image, and you're essentially papering it onto a triangle.  And you're finding a way to paper, to have, to build up that correspondence.  And, you know, once you have that basic mechanism in place, you can make all sorts of compelling 3-D imagery.
Speaker 1: So, now, I don't know anything--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I'm really not, I am (unclear) an appreciator--
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: --an appreciator of this--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but correct me if I'm wrong, but I think what I understand you to say is that you actually sample a texture into the computer and then you're able to build with it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the, so, for instance, if I was gonna say, "Shrek" for instance, wear your suit,--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --we would sample the fabric of your suit into an artist's rendering of the suit on Shrek.
Speaker 2: Right, we use, you have to figure out--
Speaker 1: And the texture would be--
Speaker 2: --right, and you'd have to be able to take the, create an image of all the different areas of my suit.  So like, so, for instance, if you're going to texture a head, you may have a geometric model of somebody's head, and you wanna texture it with their face, the image, so you actually may have a camera that goes around the head, that collect images.  But the resulting texture image looks like you're, looks sort of like you're taking my, the skin of my head and warping it into a rectangular image.  That's what the texture looks like, and then you're just associating small patches of that image texture with small patches of the 3-D geometry so that they match up, so everything looks right, everything's aligned.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hopefully, that makes sense, but (laughter), if--
Speaker 1: So, the small--okay, so the question, the smallest component of this graphic is a triangle.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's a triangle that--
Speaker 2: A triangle, the triangle is an easy simplex.  It's an easy piece of geometry that we can use to model a wide variety of different shapes, different polygonal structures, geometric structures.  But if you, if everything uses triangles, then you can streamline the process and make, and essentially build a pipeline for rendering triangles.  And that's what a lot of modern rendering systems do.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So if you have like a complex shape like, let's say an octagon, you would break it into triangles and then render out each of the individual triangles.
Speaker 1: Now, we interviewed, I think two years ago, we interviewed Mark Hannah, who was involved in, who's from out here in Silicon Valley, and he was one of the innovators with the CGI [computer generated imagery].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, but what, what Pixar did in "Toy Story" I think and then what happened "Shrek" and these other movies is a little bit different, right, it's a step up from the old CGI technology, I guess.  Was it?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean I'm not a production person--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --so I wouldn't know for sure, but it's, but I think these are all related technologies.  So, you know, making a three-dimensional movie is really about being able to construct a virtual world and then realize that in terms of, construct a 3-D virtual world and render that out into 2-D animations.  The computer graphics and special effects is a little bit different because what you're trying to do is take something from the world and then add virtual pieces to that.  And you start to get into areas that relate to computer vision which is, computer vision is essentially about understanding images, being able to take video of imagery and then be, computer imagery or like camera images, and then be able to understand which parts of those belong to, you know, be able to segment different pieces out.  You know, what you see these days is being able to, you see text that moves along with the background.  That's essentially being able to estimate the motion of the camera such that the text will move properly with the background.  Like if you watch football, you know, sometimes you'll see them put up this big graphic on top of a city or something like that.  Well, that's essentially looking at the camera motion with respect to the, to like the buildings and being able to move the graphics along with that building.  So that's sort of, sort of more--or like even just the first down line that they put in.
Speaker 1: Right, and that's always, when I first saw that, I said, what in the world, how'd they do that, you know?
Speaker 2: (Coughing) Yeah.
Speaker 1: They had a yellow line across there, but the guys are not, it's not like blocking the guy's feet out or anything.  It's like, it's looks like he's standing on this yellow line.
Speaker 2: Right, so in order to do that you have to have, you have to have the graphics to be able to take what you're under--you have to have the computer vision to understand what's happening in the world and construct a representation that you can then use to then build this, to then take things that you can add to this world and then render out into the image.  So that's sort of how computer vision relates to computer graphics.
Speaker 1: Now, I think one of the first times I saw something done in a movie in a realist movie, I mean an actual movie with live actors--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --was like "Forest Gump" when Gary Sineis' leg--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was, they didn't have to pretend he didn't have--they didn't have to tie his leg and pretend he didn't have a leg.  They actually graphically--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --got rid of it.  And--
Speaker 2: I mean that's, I don't know exactly how they did that.  But one of the things that makes it easy is to, you know, is to maybe like put, to green screen or put like an element that you know that you can then, you know, take those pixels away and then use a background to fill it in.  And so, that's like a computer vision technique.  Well, I wouldn't call it computer vision technique, but it's a way of modifying, it's a way of understanding, you know, what parts of the image belong, you know, should be in the image or should be in the final result and which parts should not be.  So you can composite those things together properly.
Story_ID: 24166
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Georgia Tech, well, just kind of guide us through what you did at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology]?
Speaker 2: A lot of what I did at Georgia Tech was, I took a lot of classes in computer graphics.  So I took courses in virtual reality, three-dimensional rendering, computer rendering.  I took courses in animation and videogames.  But in my final, in my second year, I started working with a professor named Jessica Hodgins who was just starting to explore the topics of physics-based animation.  So how could you, instead of having an animator necessarily come in and make the complete animation, you would actually use the laws of physics to animate your movie.  And Jessica had come from a robotics background so she worked with Mark Rayburn at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] to make robots that can hop like quadruped robots and bioped robots that could hop and do flips and go down stairs.  And so she took that knowledge and turned it into making all sorts of interesting biopeds and quadrupeds for, that you could animate in physics, so using physics in a virtual reality, essentially, taking a robotic approach to animation.  And so, and she did this, and she applied this to all sorts of--just as I was getting there, she applied it to--'cause the Olympics were happening in Atlanta [Georgia].  She applied it to all, to physics-based humanoids that were doing gymnastic moves and diving and all sorts of things like that.  And it got me really interested.
Speaker 1: So these are virtual figures, right, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: These are virtual figures, yeah.
Speaker 1: Not actually on--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so these are, these were, there are simulated humans, physically simulated humans in a virtual world that were doing things like running and biking and diving off of a high dive and with the idea that this would be a new way of performing animation.  But also, like if you had to do something like, so instead of necessarily bringing, getting, if you're making a movie, you're not necessarily getting a crowd of people together, you know, to shoot background.  You actually could use virtual actors to, as background or you could have a virtual stuntman or something like that.  So that's sort of, that was sort of the idea.  But I started working with her, and that was really my first path into robotics, sort of taking, you know, taking, you know, what had been done, what she was doing in computer graphics, and taking what I've learned in computer graphics, and then applying it to essentially physics-based animation.  And so I got to learn about how, you know, they used this package called S.D. Fast in order to do, in order to build structures that they would simulate and actually do the physical integration.  They actually had an animation pipeline that was for taking the things that they simulated and doing nice rendering.  I got to be a part of making a movie, a little animation, short animation that they did.  And I got to learn about how to model things in animation packages.  But the core, I started really learning about how to control physical things.  Or I got to learn how--that was my start of learning how to control characters that undergo, that are subject to the laws of physics and learn how to start building robot controllers.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Okay--
Speaker 2: And it was Jessica who suggested I consider, I mean she was very helpful in helping me decide to look at graduate schools to pursue in graphics and robotics, and she suggested USC [University of California].  She suggested, she was the person that suggested my eventual doctorate advisor, Maja Mataric.
Story_ID: 24167
Speaker 1: I failed to mention that, now, you met your wife at Alma College [Michigan].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (laughter), right, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so when you, by the time you got to Atlanta [Georgia], you were married, right?
Speaker 2: Actually not.  So, I met my wife at Alma College.  We met during my sophomore year.  And we dated pretty much the whole time that we were at Alma College.  But then I really wanted to go to Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology].  So I went to Atlanta, and she went back to Los Angeles where her family lives.  And she got a job there and we were pretty much long-distance relationship for those two years.  But I did, but in that summer, the summer of 1997, I did an internship at Intel Corporation in Folsom [California].  And that put us, you know, at least on the same coast for a few months.
Speaker 1: Okay, and now you're going back to USC [University of Southern California] for graduate school, right?
Speaker 2: Right, so that, so, you know, so I think by the time that we were, that I finished at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology], I really wanted to, you know, I wanted to no longer have a long-distance relationship.  So, fortunately, I got in at USC, and that was close to where, she was still known as my girlfriend, so we were together.  And about two years after I started at USC, we got married.
Story_ID: 24168
Speaker 1: So it seemed like everything in the world is happening in order (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you're at USC [University of Southern California], and this is 1998?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1998, so what did you learn at USC and who were the mentors there?
Speaker 2: So, I learned a lot from the various faculty at USC.  So my advisor, Maja Mataric and, you know, I mean she, along with the other faculty in robotics at the time, so this is Stephen Shaw, Cora Sacotney (ph.) (unclear) and George Becky, provided a very interesting collection of people that were doing robotics.
Speaker 1: Now, we have it here, but can you give her name again, your advisor?
Speaker 2: Maja Mataric.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: M-A-J-A, M-A-T-A-R-I-C.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, just for somebody can--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So, yeah, so Maja is Yugoslavian.  So, you know, whenever you see "J", you should think "Y".
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there's a little apostrophe, a little accent on the "C".  So it's Mataric.  But she doesn't get upset if I say Mataric (laughter).  She gets a lot more upset when you say Maja as her name (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I've seen many times over the years.  But at that time it was a special time to be at USC because, at least in robotics, because there were a lot of people that were coming together, you know, who I've got to have, you know, good, you know, close collaborations with and good and get to see develop.  We sort of developed together, coming out of USC.  And so there were people that, you know, a number of people that I was there, that I was, that I worked with as students at USC, who I now work with at Willow Garage or, you know, who I see at robotics meetings and various other places.  So it's just a, it was just a fun time to, you know, to sort of develop and in this very new area.  I mean robotics is still a really new area.
Story_ID: 24169
Speaker 1: And I, even Ayanna, so you mentioned Ayanna Howard.  So Ayanna's last year was my first year at USC [University of Southern California].  And I was actually, I was recruited to be the, a flag bearer at the graduation ceremony.  So I was, so that's a, so I got the, I got to walk in front of Ayanna and carry that, and the carry flag for the graduation ceremony.  But, yeah, it was, you know, I wish we had overlapped a little bit more 'cause, because, you know, she's a great researcher, good person to work with.  But she was at JP--I mean by the time I was there, she was a JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --doing all sorts of other great things.
Speaker 2: Now, she's a Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology] where you--(laughter)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know (laughter), and so, yeah, but Ayanna and I, you know, I'm going off on a tangent here, but Ayanna, you know, she's one of the people that I see frequently and we're all, and we're at all sorts of meetings.  I mean one thing about being part of a research community, being part of, you know, a set of people that they're aligned by a common interest, is that you see each other all the time and you're gonna be involved in a number of common things.  And so Ayanna, I'll see her at, you know, we have a conference, various conferences for robotics like the International Conference of Robotics and Animation or the Human Robot Interaction Conference, I'll see her at those and we'll meet up.  Last year, Ayanna and I were recruited as part of a study group to go tour Asian countries, Japan, China, Korea and do an assessment for the National Science Foundation of robotics and human robotic interaction technologies.  And so, you know, so, you know, and so that, those are just fun times to, you know, to be with your colleagues like Ayanna.  In fact, we were in Beijing, and I was like, you know, we were just finishing this nine-day tour.  And I was like, I've bad about checking email.  I need to get back online.  There's all sorts of things I need to check up on.  And Ayanna was like, don't do that.  Come with us, you know, come with us to Tiedemann's Square, the forbidden city, and let's go, you know, let's go make a day out of it.  And that was fun.  So it was me and--me, her and Bill Gaye Mootler (ph.) from Wisconsin, and we actually had a, you know, those were the fun times that, you know, beyond just the research that you get to experience with your colleagues.  But I'm glad Ayanna is one of my colleagues.
Story_ID: 24170
Speaker 1: Now, was Willow Garage in existence when you came?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't even in existence when I started at Brown [University].  The robotics, robotics at that time was not nearly as mature as, an industry, as it is now.  You know, there were some companies that were out there, but most of the software tools that we use, most of the hardware that we use now was in existence back then.  Some of it was.  You know, some of the knowledge in terms of how do you, you know, how do you simulate and build mechanical systems and do control over those systems.  You know, that was there and basic notions of path planning, but it's changed dramatically in the years since I started graduate school.  And, you know, and some of, and a number of people that I was fortunate enough to be in contact with, then I got to work with at USC [University of Southern California], you know, they've been leaders in making that happen.  So, you know, in addition, I got to work with people like Brian Gerkley and Nick Canning, who, you know, who are now leaders of Open Source Robotics movement to make it very easy for people to develop robot controllers.  You know, Andrew Howard, who worked, you know, who was at JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory] himself and now in Space Ex and Richard Vaughn who developed stage and the stage robot, robot simulator.  You know, I got to have, you know, these are just a few of the people that I had the fortune of collaborating with and working with.  But it was a great time.
Story_ID: 24171
Speaker 1: Now, you worked in, well, it says, the Interaction Lab--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that focuses on human robot interaction--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for socially assisted robots.
Speaker 2: Well, so that was, that's the focus now.  So my, so, you know, it's interesting.  In addition to having a biological heritage, I also have an academic heritage.  So I talked a little bit about Jessica [Hodgins], you know, coming out of Mark Graybar's lab in MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology].  Maja came out of Rodney Brooks' lab at MIT, and Rodney Brooks, who--he cofounded "I-Robot Corporation" that makes the "Roomba" and all of those things.  And he developed some of the core ideas into helping robots better react to their environment.  And so, so at the time when I started, Maja was a pioneer in thinking about multi-robot systems, so how do you have multiple robots coordinate.  And she was also big into this new control paradigm called "Behavior-based control".  And so at the time that meant that her lab was sort of split amongst people that thought about multi-robot systems and people that were starting to think about humanoid robotics.  So how can you apply this behavior-based control paradigm to humanoid robotics.  And so what we, we explored a lot of imitation learning.  So how can we have humanoid robots learn from demonstration?  And that's sort of is, by the time, and so that was the theme until about the time that I graduated.  Since then she's started to think more about socially assisted robots, so how could you have robots that help rehabilitate, that help a stroke rehabilitation, to help with treating autism.  So robots provide a good focal point for kids with autism.  So you can use them, to help with better outcomes for autistic kids, autistic children who want to engage.  But at the time, what we were really focused on, at least on my side of Maja's group, was how do we have robots, how do we take ideas from neuroscience, some inspiration for ideas like mirror neurons for imitation and use those to have robots that can learn from demonstration, from human demonstration.
Speaker 1: Okay, so robots, so you could actually show something to them, and they can do it?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And so lot of our early work with using--it's funny because we were using the same simulations that I had used at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology]--which is why I believe Maja was interested in me 'cause I had experience with those systems, using those systems in order to control, on a simulation of a human, and using visual input from humans.  So essentially, we were developing this sort of low-cost, motion capture technology where you could stand in front of a camera and perform some action.  And this simulated robot would be able to do the same action as you had been, as you had done, with some robustness to dynamics.  So you could move the arm a little bit, it would still perform the way it's supposed to.  So we wanna robust in those physical disturbances.  And so you could stand in front a camera, perform some movement, motions and have a physically simulated robot do the same thing that you were doing.  And this eventually started, Maja developed a collaboration with Johnson Space Center, with the team that was developing the Robonaut system.  And we started to develop, take our work in terms of imitation learning and learning from demonstration and apply it to the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] robonaut.  And that's, and so, what I particularly did in that, those collaborations with taking large streams of motion captured data that were unsegmented, that were raw and turning those into a form that the robot could then actually execute.
Story_ID: 24172
Speaker 1: Okay, so you earned your PhD in 2003, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was your dissertation to--
Speaker 2: My dissertation was, it was about data-driven learning of motion permanence from robots.  So, so the basic idea is that you would take human demonstration, you would take motion capture, and you would break that up into smaller sets of skills that the robot could then perform in a more general context.  So you could then take those skills and say, so I might have a motion where I'm doing all sorts of reaching behaviors and then I'm doing, I'm waving my arm or I'm doing some sort of, let's say Karate kicks or a bunch of, or boxing moves.  And I wanna be able to break those, I don't wanna just play that long stream of data onto my robot.  I wanna break those up into their component skills so that I can tell each of those skills when they should execute.  But it also gave me a basis for doing further imitations so I could--so when you demonstrate something to the robot, they can encoded in terms of these skills and then adjust to, you know, for slight variations.  So instead of reaching to one specific, having the robot reach to one specific point that it was originally trained to do, it could reach to any number of positions, based on the (unclear) [hema?] demonstration.  So it's just making, giving the robot a rich repertoire of skills if you wanna think of it that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did a fair amount with machine learning at the time, so, you know, so--because we take a data-driven approach, I started to get a little bit more into the, into the way the, with the data mining or (unclear) machine learning in order to extract this knowledge from the data that we have, the motion data.  And so that was somewhat of a, so I sort of was at the intersection of robotics and data analysis.
Story_ID: 24173
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I mentioned about my watching an old, I think TV commercial with a basketball player hooked to different electrodes--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and they go through the motion of shooting a basketball--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or dunking or something like that.  Did you use that kind of--
Speaker 2: We develop technology to do that.  So one major challenge, so that's motion capture technology, and the type of system that you're referring to in particular is an optical motion capture system.  So what you have are these little balls that, that reflect infrared light.  And then you have cameras that are around the performance area, that emit infrared light so that we can see these balls in the camera image, these little markers.  And from that, from collecting the motion of these markers from different, from multiple different camera angles, you're able to reconstruct the kinematic motion of the person, their sort of, you could call it their skeletal model, a representation of a skeletal model and how it moves over time.  And one challenge that we've been, that's been out there is the problem of markerless motion capture.  So how can we have somebody who's not instrumented with all of these markers be able to, how can we capture their motion.  And so we did a number of work in terms of markerless motion capture, pulling that from multiple cameras, from multi-camera systems.  And so--
Speaker 1: So, one person, for instance, then you'd have like multi-cameras around to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --model them?
Speaker 2: Right, so it says, so what we would do is, actually, the approach that we took at the time, 'cause this was 2002, 2003, was that we would have multiple cameras around.  And each camera what we do is we try to segment, we try to find the pixels that belong to the person and separate those from the pixels that belong to the background.  So if we had--essentially, we're generating a silhouette for a person.  If we can generate a silhouette from a person for multiple different cameras and all those cameras know where they are with respect to each other, then what we can is, and what you can do is project that silhouette out from each camera and then take the intersection of these projected silhouettes, and that gives you essentially, a rough approximation of the volume of the person.  And from that volume of the person, you're able to then, we can then have, we have separate methods to extract the skeleton from that volume.  So as you're moving around, your volume changes.  We're able to extract your skeleton and that's how we perform motion, markerless motion capture.  I know that's a lot to say, so it--
Speaker 1: No, yeah, I can of understand that, which--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is good.  If I can understand it--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I've got images.  Like I'll have, maybe I'll have to pull those images out so you, so it makes more sense, but, yeah, it's--
Speaker 1: So you all are past the marker motion capture now. I mean nobody puts that in--
Speaker 2: Right, so I think it was at the research stage when I (unclear), there was lots of ideas.  And now, with the advent of the Microsoft connect, which essentially provides depth, so the game changer that the connect provides is that it's able to estimate depth from these images, using a technique called structure lighting which is not that different from the infrared marker piece.  But based on that you're able to not only extract the, you easily extract the silhouette of the person from the background, but you also have a pretty good model of their geometry, and so, you know, it's been revolutionary in terms of providing markerless motion capture capabilities.  So now, those ideas for markerless motion capture that were more or less research ideas in 2002, 2003, are now, it's now a commercial product, yeah, with some, with several limitations.  But it's something that's out there.
Speaker 1: It's now commercially viable now, and so that's the standard now for--
Speaker 2: I would say, yeah, but there's many things that you don't get from one of those systems that my work has been trying to address since then which is physical plausibility.  So when you're tracking somebody through markerless motion capture, they're, you know, they would, you see sort of weird effects, like their feet might be floating above the ground or they might be penetrating into the ground or if they're touching something, they're, you know, their hands might be, the connection between their hand and object or a wall that they're touching is not gonna look right or if they're walking, you might see their foot skating something that doesn't look really tractable, so some work that we've done.  Since I've been at Brown [University], it's been more on the lines of using physical simulation to make those tracking results physically plausible so they make sense--
Speaker 1: Simulate weight and things like that.
Speaker 2: Right, right, and mostly contacts so, like, so you don't wanna have the, you know, if somebody's floating above the ground, that's not really possible, at least the way that, at least it's not possible without some technology that we don't know about.  And so, this would be a way of correcting that such that a person would actually be in contact with the ground at the right place.
Story_ID: 24174
Speaker 1: So, you did post-doctoral studies at USC [University of Southern California] as well--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and which is unusual to stay at the, to do a post-doc at the same place where you got your PhD, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I actually graduated, I didn't in May, 2003.  I graduated in November, I think it's November of 2003.  So I graduated off the academic cycle.  So I wasn't in a position to go out on the academic market that year.  And so my advisor kept me on as a post-doc in title until I was able to apply the, for the, for that coming year's academic job market.  And at that point, I got the, I was fortunate to get a position at Brown University.
Speaker 1: Now, before you went to Brown [University], or maybe around the same time, your work results were published in the "International Journal of Humanoid Robotics", right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, was this your first major publication?
Speaker 2: So, actually, the way that computer science tends to work is that conferences tend to be more, tend to be the venue that we use to disseminate our work more so than journals.  So we had a number of good papers during that run that made its way to the International Conference on Humanoid Robotics.  We had papers at the Intelligent Robots and Systems conference.  We had one at the International Conference Robotics in Automation.  In addition, from this other work in markerless motion capture, was able to go to the, was able to go to conferences in machine learning and computer vision, which was good to see.  But, yeah, if you look at it, I look at my resume more from the conference publications than the journal publications.
Speaker 1: Okay, but the article that you wrote was entitled, "Performance Derived Behavior Vocabularies Data-Drive Acquisition of Skills for Motion"?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was probably the, that was the--I would consider that to be the journal version of my dissertation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 24175
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island].  Now, so did you have a lot of offers or, now, Brown's a pretty good place to go.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm just saying, but did you have other choices?
Speaker 2: I had other choices, from very good schools that made me really good offers, but Brown had--Brown at the time reminded me of the old Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology] of, you know, of the sense of community, a sense of student engagement, balance of teaching and research that I really liked, the balance of theory and practice.  And, you know, just a larger engagement.  You know, I didn't wanna feel isolated at the place where I was going to be.  I wanted to feel part of a community and Brown had that, had that feeling to it.
Speaker 1: Now, I've heard other scientists say that once you get deep into the science, a lot of the things that separate people really don't seem to matter anymore--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know.  The scientists seem to bond with each other around certain things, and they do what they do.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is this basically true with you?
Speaker 2: I think it varies with the person.  You know, I think we live in a, I think when it comes to academic research, when it comes to research in general, it's always going to be a people business.  You're always in the business of engaging with people.  You can develop the best ideas ever, but if nobody uses those ideas or buys into those ideas, then they're not, then it's hard for them, you know, then you really won't have an impact.  And part of that is going out and convincing people, part of it is having a good idea in the first place.  And then going out and saying, well, getting people to engage with the idea and getting them to use that idea.  And also because we're in a community where, you know, because you're in these research communities, both--in your department at your university, but also across the world, you know, you wanna be with people that you, you know, you wanna interact with people that you have good relationships with or offer something to you that you wouldn't have had otherwise.  So, so it is, you know, there is a fundamental scientific core, engineering core to the work that we do, that has to be there, that there has to be value in the ideas.  But there also has to be a, a certain level of engagement.  So it's not the case that we, you know, I would say I spend most of my time talking to people and not as much of my time, maybe not as much as I would like, sitting in front of a computer, coding or on a blackboard thinking about mathematics, yeah.  Does that answer your question?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, right.  Now, you were, at Brown you were a part of the robotics learning and autonomy laboratory.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, yeah--
Speaker 2: I founded that laboratory when I got there, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's more than being a part of it--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you're a founder of it (laughter).  So you really are founding this branch of robotics at Brown because--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, so in my department we're a small department.  So as a small department, we, you know, we have, you know, we have world-class people in various areas, but--in specific areas, but we don't have maybe the critical mass that, you know, certain places like a Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology] or a University of Michigan or Carnegie Mellon would have or an MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], I would say.  [Cough] Pardon me, so in my department, I'm the roboticist.  I was fortunate to have a great mentor in Michael Black who studies computer vision.  We have a great natural language person in Eugene Charniack, a fabulous machine learning person and Eric Sutter, and Amy Greenwald does great work in software agents and reinforcement learning.  And so that was what the department looked like for most of the time that I was there.  We have experts in each area, world-class people in each area, but we don't necessarily have, you know, we don't necessarily have ten people or thirty people that do work in robotics or machine learning or computer vision.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, your first year you were an advisor for one PhD candidate, right?
Speaker 2: So I started working with my first student, Dan Goldman, during his first year at Brown.  Oh, it was his second year at Brown.  It was my first year at Brown, and Dan was able to, he did some really good work, and graduated in 2009.  He's my first student to graduate.
Speaker 1: It says here by 2009, you had five students?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So this is becoming a, it has some popularity, I mean in terms of the students.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's attracting people, so.  And you were a Masters advisor for seventeen students.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And Bachelor research advisor for eleven.
Story_ID: 24176
Speaker 1: And the first course that you taught was called "Building Intelligent Robots"?
Speaker 2: Right, so that was a, intelligent, "Building Intelligent Robots" was a course I inherited from Tom Dean and Leslie Cabbling (ph.) that was, they were one of the first people to use Lego robotics.  I don't know if you've ever seen the Lego robot systems.  So there's this little programmable brick, and you can build Lego's on top of it and put motors on it to make little Lego robots.  And so I took that class over and we did Lego robotics for a while.  But as time went on, I was able to see like, you know, students in middle schools and fifth grade classes be able to do the same types of things that we were doing with those Lego robotic systems because they're a very limited platform.  So, instead we started using the, we started using robot vacuum cleaners.  So this was at the time when the Roomba was coming out (cough), excuse me.  And if you look on the side of any Roomba system, there's a little, there's a little port and you could, a little piece of plastic you can take off and there's a port that you can tap into.  And so we essentially taped into that port and put a laptop computer on, and put a camera on top of that computer.  And we started doing things like, doing, having, doing robot soccer in my courses and doing, and playing, you'd be able to do like, to do real versions of Pac Man in our building.  And so that was, that was, you know, that's sort of where we got.  And we got a chance to work with iRobot in terms of, you know, in terms of using their educational version of the robot vacuum cleaner, the Roomba.  It's called the iRobot Create.  And we started developing Open Source modules, are modules, software modules that are open source that people could use to do similar things at other schools.
Speaker 1: Now, IRobot, that was founded by a fellow we mentioned a little while back--
Speaker 2: Right, Rodney Brooks.
Speaker 1: Rodney Brooks, okay.  Right.  And was it named after the movie "iRobot" came out or--
Speaker 2: Well, no, so actually, I believe that they were--I don't know how long they've been iRobot, but they've been, they were founded in 1990.  And they were, no, and I know that they were definitely, I think they released the Roomba before the "iRobot" movie came out, so--
Speaker 1: But I think the movie is based on a--
Speaker 2: Right, it's based on a--
Speaker 1: --story by--
Speaker 2: Carl Tropick (ph.).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, the term "robot" comes from Carl Tropick's story about Ross's universal robots, I believe so.  And, no, I think, no, it comes from the Carl Tropick story.  I don't know about the universal robot part.  But I know that he termed, he coined the term "robot" from the term robota which means forced work in Czech.  Yeah.  The funny thing is I haven't read that story yet (laughter).  I should read, you know, I should really, given I'm a roboticist, I should really read that story.  But there's just not enough time in the day.
Speaker 1: I understand, I understand.  So, well, at any rate, so you got like--it seems like you're having a good time here.  So you got like--it seems like you're having a good time here.  You've got like Roomba's playing soccer and Pac Man, and I mean, Super Mario Brothers, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, so, but you're getting paid for this--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and it also has applications in the, you know--
Speaker 2: Right, you know, life as an assistant professor is, it's fun 'cause you get to do all sorts of stuff, but you're on, but it's also really stressful because you're on the tenure clock.  So I started at Brown [University] in 2004, which meant that in 2010, they were gonna make a decision on whether to tenure me or not.  And so a lot of my efforts went into, you know, training students and getting them up to speed and getting them to the point that they would be productive researchers in the world, raising funding for my, to help support my efforts.  So that's, you know, that's a big part of the tenure process, as opposed to, you know, to building relationships with people in my community through service and also teaching students.  I have to teach students.  That's a lot of activity to be a part of.  And so it can be stressful, but, you know, you also have, you know, take time away from all of the stresses and appreciate the fun things that you get to do.  One of the things that I spend a lot of my time doing is raising funds, raising funding.  So I've been extremely grateful to federal agencies such as the Office of Naval Research and the National Science Foundation who have been, who've been major contributors to some of my funded efforts, to a number of funded projects.  So is the Defense Research Project Agency, DARPA, and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, who've all funded efforts that I've had.  So in that regard, I've been able to get a number of young investigator awards which have supported my research.  So "young", in terms of faculty usually means pre-tenure.  So even at the age of, you know, at the age of thirty-five, I'm considered young, young career or early career.
Story_ID: 24177
Speaker 1: And I was able to, fortunately, for my award from the Office of Naval Research, I was nominated for the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers out of PK (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So I got to go to the White House in 2007 and meet the president and lots of great people in the administration who are concerned about science and the progression of scientists, engineers.
Speaker 2: The president himself gives this award, right?  So this is--
Speaker 1: So this is given by, so the president did not give me the award directly, but there's a picture of me with the president and several other and many other of the select group of scientists, engineers selected for this award every year.  It's only a small number of people that get this award, so it's just a really big deal.
Speaker 2: So this was in 2007?
Speaker 1: This was 2007.
Speaker 2: This was when George W. Bush was, this was his last year.
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually, I got to shake George Bush's hand and I got to, and we got the chance, we, as all the scientists and all the PK case awardees were able to talk with him for about, you know, he's very busy, busy man at the time.  So we got about five, about ten, fifteen minutes to chat with him.  He's actually really, really funny, really engaging.  I enjoyed, I really enjoyed meeting him.
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: In addition to that I also got, I, you know, those type of awards give you a higher profile, and help you get--and prepare you for applying for other awards.  So I was fortunate to get a research fellowship from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, which was a great recognition to get.
Speaker 2: This is 2009, right?
Speaker 1: That's 2009.  I got to be one of "Popular Science's" "Brilliant 10", last year in 2011.  No money with that one, but just good recognition, good vibe, you know, lots of people, I get lots of people to, you know, get lots of interesting emails from people that are really interested in robotics, you know, from that type of recognition.
Speaker 2: You were one of "Popular Science's", what is called, Brilliant--
Speaker 1: "Brilliant 10".
Speaker 2: Brilliant 10, okay.
Speaker 1: As I said, you know, teachers I had in middle school might not agree with that, but (laughter), but it's there.
Speaker 2: What a different--it's funny when you watch, I always tell my son, when you watch sports, you know, one athlete will perform one way under one coach and another coach, he may be greater or lesser, depending--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --on how they use him and what they--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and what people see in you.  So,--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 24178
Speaker 1: So your life story for a lot of young people could be to be patient and to take, you know, make sure you take, I guess--what would you say?  I mean I'm (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I would say that I've been lucky and some, lucky and prepared.  So, you know, so we watched lots of the Pixar movies at our house.  And so from the "Incredible's" we always say "Luck favors the prepared".
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That's (laughter) something, we quote these movies all the time, but it's true, you know, I think nobody in this world is completely self made.  They've always had mentors or support and something that has helped them along the way.  And you have to be lucky to meet the right people at the right time and have the right opportunities pop up.  But you have to be prepared in order to take advantage of those, to be prepared to take advantage of those opportunities and to put yourself in a position where those opportunities will come to you or you go to those opportunities.  And so, so it's some preparation, a large degree of preparation and a certain degree of luck.
Speaker 1: Okay, it doesn't hurt to really be, from what I hear you saying, it doesn't hurt to really be excited about something and to pursue it, I mean even though you can't see the end of it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at the time that you're doing it.
Speaker 2: I think, you know, you have to be, you have to find your passion.  If you don't know, if you don't walk in every day and say, wow, I really wanna do this or you have a sense of what you really wanna be doing, then you maybe need to do something else.  I think I've been fortunate that I've been in a situation where I can actually explore and figure out what are the things I really like to do.  For me it's about computing and robotics and making interactive systems that people can use.  For my wife, it's more about our kids, you know.  And she doesn't have the same passion for, you know, academic subject or a piece of technology or some area of technology.  You know, she's really about family, and she's really about making those things happen.  And there's other people that wanna do a career.  They wanna, you know, they wanna support their family, you know, and they don't necessarily have an academic passion.  There are some people that will be enthusiastic about, you know, the humanities or law or, you know athletics or, you know, or chemistry, and you know, and you have to find what that is.  That's the, that's the first thing that has to happen.  And everything will go from there.
Story_ID: 24179
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, there's something, I had a question about something.  I asked it on the phone, and we were discussing your outline.  And it's something called the "Oz of Wizard".
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: What in the world is that?
Speaker 2: All right, so, this'll take some explaining, but typically in research into human computer interaction, they wanna be able to study what is the human effect, what's the effect on humans for certain technology?  So I might study, you know, like (cough) pardon me, I might study the effect of, you know, how big should a third button be, you know, if I make it, in a graphical user interface.  So I may make it really big, but then I can't put more stuff around.  I might make it really small, and it's hard to click, and I might wanna find the right size.  Or maybe I want to engage in some functionality that doesn't already exist.  So I wanna create an interface that performs a certain way, but I haven't implemented it yet.  And so what you can do is use a technique called "The Wizard of Oz".  The Wizard of Oz would, you would have somebody sit down in front of like a computer screen, and they would be interacting with this, but it wouldn't be a computer program necessarily driving what's going on in the background.  It would be somebody, you know, somebody actually moving things around behind you on a computer screen and sort of faking the effects of this.  And so in robotics, it's particularly difficult to implement autonomous systems that perform certain behaviors.  So what we can do is instead of (coughing) pardon me, so what you can do is instead of implementing all the code and all the programming that needs to make a certain feature, a certain capability for a robot happen, what you do instead is you have somebody in a back room in a close who's joy sticking the robot around.  He's totally operating the robot to perform some functionalities.  So if somebody giving verbal commands to the robot, those are just being piped to, you know, saying, "Robot go here and get me a glass of water".  Well, the robot doesn't understand it.  It's just being piped to a micro--to a speaker and a microphone to somebody in the closet who's taking that command, joy sticking the robot to do the, to do the right thing and as far as you as a user could see, it's just the same.  It's, the robot's doing everything, and it's a magical capability.  And so--
Speaker 1: I mean so, would the robot remember to do that?
Speaker 2: The robot doesn't do anything.  The robot's just a remote controlled box.
Speaker 1: It's just a remote control, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, and so that's the reason--
Speaker 1: That's what "Wizard of Oz", you've got the man behind the curtain.  Don't pay attention to (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly (laughter), exactly.  And so, what we were advocating for in, for research in human robot interaction, was that, well, you can study a lot of, we're saying you can study a lot of things in terms of the Wizard of Oz fashion, but if you don't actually turn those into real systems that the, where the robot can do it itself, without the guy in the closet or without the person in the closet, then it really doesn't mean anything.  And so we sort of flipped it around and said, well, what would it take for you to, what's the kind of evaluation that you'd like to do for autonomous systems that are used in this context, you know, how can you actually take those--how can you actually take those things that we're testing, the Wizard of Oz and make those into real systems that will actually be useful for people and finding the right balance between these purely empirical studies and technological research.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so the "Oz of Wizard" (laughter).
Speaker 2: The "Oz of Wizard" (laughter).
Story_ID: 24180
Speaker 1: Yes, now, you're still a young man here, really a young man by the standards that we have--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now, if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean it's hard to know like, you know, what, how everything would shake out if I did things differently.  But one thing is I'm really happy to spend this year at Willow Garage in Silicon Valley [California].  It really is the, you know, the hub of activity for computing and technology and especially in the robotics area, there's a lot of stuff going on here.
Story_ID: 24181
Speaker 1: Well, tell us something about Willow Garage [Menlo Park, California] before we--I should have asked you that question, but--
Speaker 2: Sure.  So Willow Garage has been, was started in 2008.  And it was started, meant as an incubator for the robotics market.  So the idea is that they would help the robotics market journey into technologies, to mature the technology such that they it becomes commercially viable and start the--and Willow Garage doesn't necessarily have to make money itself.  It should spin out companies that make money.  And so it has a fair amount of funding behind it so that the people here can focus on research and focus on technology and not necessarily about making a product.  Willow Garage has, in its very short history, has produced the PR-2 Robot, one of which we have at Brown [University], that's capable of moving around in human spaces and working with human tools and with an idea that this would be a--you know, this is really a research platform.  But it's to explore the ideas of how robots can use space, can use human spaces, active human spaces at the level that we would expect.  This robot has been used to help the disabled, to do lots of demos such as playing pool and fetching a beer out of a refrigerator.  At the core of this though, the core software, one of the major accomplishments of Willow Garage has been the robotic operating system.  And the robot operating system has made it such that we can take certain capabilities, software capabilities for robots to be able to plan certain navigation routes or give it robot navigation capabilities, grasping behaviors for picking up objects and perceiving various objects from its sensors and be able to integrate--it's been able to take those capabilities and import it to many different robots so that you don't have to write, you don't have to write a lot of specialized code or specialized systems for each, for every robot that you wanna deal with.  And so it's sort of taken robotics from thinking about at the low-level, hardware level and expressing it more as a software problem, which is great for computer scientists like me.  And we've been involved with the robot operating system, you know, very early on, since 2009.  We've made a lot of contributions.  One of the contributions, one of the reasons why I'm here this year is to work on putting robots on the worldwide web.  So a lot of people don't understand what robots are capable of, and that's because they don't get a lot of exposure to robots.  Robots are hidden away in our labs, and nobody can actually use those systems, similar to the way that computing mainframes were, you know.  People had lots of speculations about what computers could do when we were in the mainframe era.  And, you know, and they were, and computing was locked away in back rooms.  But so now what we're gonna try and do is take the robot technology that we have, expose it through the worldwide web such that people can be, can program robots and be, and use robots in a very fluid and natural way, yeah.
Story_ID: 24182
Speaker 1: What advice would you give to young scientists today who--or aspiring scientists in the black community, especially?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  I would say, well, I don't know about--I can't speak to scientists in general.  Well, I can say this for any, for anything that you wanna do, science or beyond, you have to go out and think beyond your current situation.  You have to be willing to go where the action is.  You have to have, you have to find out what are the things that you're really interested in.  The worst thing you could do is force yourself into working on something that, you know, that you're not really passionate about.  But that also means that you have to go and explore beyond yourself to go and find what that, what that passion is.  If it's, you know, if you wanna, you know, the same energy that you would have to spend to be a professional football player or a successful entertainer, successful musician, you know, you can, you know, that level of effort would be required to be, you know, to be a professor of robotics.  The only difference is, is that, while only a small number of people can be really successful in entertainment or play professional sports, lots of people can be involved in the technical domain.  Lots, you know, we have a labor deficit when it comes to people with skills in terms of the high-tech areas, not just computing, but biology, chemistry, physics, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering--I think I already said biology.  But all of those areas, we need people.  And you're probably gonna, you probably can be good at some of those areas or other areas across the discipline whether it be the social sciences or the humanities or the life sciences.  So you have to go out and experience that.  I didn't know that there was a path available for me in computing until I went out and tried it.  And I just knew I liked videogames.  That was it.  And so in terms of computer science in particular, the training that you need to get, that you need to do, I would say people, you should learn how to program on the web.  You should learn how to use Unix, to use Linux.  It's free and it's available.  And really, it's the mathematical background.  Linear Algebra and probability and statistics is really, is what's driving things right now.  And those are the, that mathematical background, especially in those two areas, are crucial.
Story_ID: 24183
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I am hopeful because I think what you're are the--you're seeing African Americans at all levels of the socio-economic and political spectrum.  You know, you have people that are part of the, you know, who are part of the one percent or the, you know, the point one percent.  You have people that are, you know, that are Ivy League professors like myself, people that are captains of industry, people that are doing, that make an honest living doing things, doing, you know, professional and vocational work.  And so that's, you know, I think that makes me feel good about, you know, that everybody's got a chance to do what they want to and be what they wanna be.  What's making me less hopeful is that I don't think enough people are taking advantage of those opportunities, partially because of their situation, and, you know, and their local circumstances or maybe their mindset locally, but also that they just don't know it's out there, and I think we have to do--those of us that have the power to, we have to do a better job of engaging those students, engaging the youth to let them know that there are paths available out there for them to pursue.  I think that in a globalized world, the competition's gonna become much more intense.  You know, it's not the case that, you know, that companies and business and industry and innovation is just restricted to certain geographical areas just because of location.  With the Internet and everything, you know, I'm interacting with people across the globe.  Willow Garage has people in Argentina, Romania, England, France, that all work here, you know, even when they're remote and very, you know, productive.  That's gonna enable people from all over the world to be a part of technical innovation.  I worry about African Americans falling behind by not taking advantage of those opportunities.  So, yeah.
Story_ID: 24184
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell us something about your family.  You have, I know you're married now, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --do you have children?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have three kids.  I have, so my wife, Sarah.  We've been married for twelve years.  And we have Morgan, who's nine.  She's my oldest daughter, Wesley, who's five, and my youngest is Violet, who's two.  And they're very great, they're great about going places with me, so I spent part of my sabbatical in Munich, Germany in Bavaria several years ago, and Morgan and Wesley came with me, and they were willing to come out here for a year.  And, you know, we--and it's, and part of my struggle is finding the right work-life balance, so I can be both the good roboticist and faculty member, but more importantly, a good father and husband.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And your parents, are they with us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so both my parents are still here.
Speaker 1: Were they surprised with your career trajectory or did they--
Speaker 2: I don't know (laughter).  They seem to be pretty proud of me, so that's good.  I think my dad very early on, you know, said I should be, you know, he said I should be a mathematician, you know.  I think, he was like, maybe math is in your future.  Well, he's kind of right maybe.  Computer science is very close to math.  But so I don't think, maybe they're not too surprised, but, yeah, most of my family lives in the greater Houston [Texas] area.  And that's where my parents live right now.  And they're still with us along with my maternal grandmother.
Story_ID: 24185
Speaker 1: When you look at the things that you've been able to accomplish so far, you know, you're still really young, what today would you consider your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think my legacy are people.  Mostly, your legacy is in terms of the people that you interact with.  So most importantly, you know, my kids, students that I've had the opportunity to work with, both at Brown [University] and USC [University of Southern California] [sneeze] pardon me.  You know, I think more so than the idea that get generated, it's the spirit of collaboration and a spirit of innovation that comes through, working with those students and also, the ability to get those students to a position where they could actually succeed.  So that's the biggest legacy right now.  I think in terms of ideas, I think we have, you know, I'm at the beginning, I think we're at the beginning of a really interesting area in robotics where things are starting to move out of the research phase and really start having an impact on society.  And so in that regard I feel like my impact there is still too, yet to be determined.  I think we have a lot of work to, work ahead of us.  But I think in the coming years, you know, over the next decade or two, we're gonna start to have robotic systems that work with humans in a variety of different areas and really help human quality, improve human quality of life and improve human productivity.
Story_ID: 24186
Speaker 1: How do you think the future of robotics is gonna effect human labor, you know, especially people in our own community?
Speaker 2: Right, so I think human, I think, you know, there is a danger that robots could be used to take over jobs to replace humans, but I think the reality with the technology is that you will always need a human in the loop for these systems.  The idea of a purely autonomous robot is possible under certain constraints, but generally, not necessarily possible.  So I think what you're gonna see are robots that multiply the productivity of an individual that will be able to--you know, one person will be able to do a lot more through commands, through supervising a collection of robots.  That makes it, it leaves the danger of, you know, hiring one person at a really high level and leaving lots of other people out.  And so I think the way to deal with that is through education, is through being able to, you know, to update and improve the skills of people so that they will be on the next level of innovation.  We are, I think we have an innovation-based economy, and that's fueled by knowledge workers as opposed to physical labor and robotics is going to, if you can't, if you're purely relying on physical labor as your way of support, of employment, of being productive, I think slowly that's gonna be less important.  It's more about what, about the knowledge that you bring and the technical and analytical skills.  And so education is where a lot of people, where we really need to do better.
Story_ID: 24187
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a good husband, a good father, an insightful researcher, that brought, that shed light on new problems and helped move the community towards, move research in the direction that will be, that will open up new areas, and I wanna be known as a good advisor and a good teacher for the students that work with me and my collaborators.
