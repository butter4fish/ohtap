Speaker 1: We're gonna start the interview by talking about your ancestors, and do you know your, let's start with your father's [James Singletary] side of the family.  Do you know your grandparents or great-grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  My father's parents, they died when he was a little baby.  In fact, his mother died right after having him from childbirth, so I don't know anything about my grandparents, but I do know that they're from South Carolina, and they also migrated to Mississippi, is where my father grew up.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about your mother's [Mattie Hicks Singletary] side of the family?
Speaker 2: My mother and father grew up in the same small town in Clarksdale, Mississippi.  My [maternal] grandparents, Oliver Hicks and my grandmother Dereanzy Hicks [Dereanzy Barry Hicks].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know when they were born?
Speaker 2: It's on the obituary, my grandfather (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your grandparents?
Speaker 2: --and yeah, my grandparents, yeah.
Speaker 1: So they lived in Mississippi.  Did you visit them as a child?
Speaker 2: Oh, God yeah.  They were very close, very close.  Our family is very close.  My mother's siblings and my father's siblings were basically from that same area, Clarksdale, Mississippi, so pretty much get together when I was growing up, every summer, and, in fact, there was one point in our lives that we actually left Detroit [Michigan] and moved to Clarksdale.  My father worked for Uniroyal [United States Rubber Company] and there was a layoff and my uncle, my father's brother, has a garage there in Clarksdale, Mississippi, called Little Willie's garage, and my father went there and worked there and we were there for about, I think about a year.  I think I started, I don't think it was kindergarten.  I think I started pre-school there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My sister [Sheila Singletary] actually went to school there.
Story_ID: 371252
Speaker 1: Now can you share some stories about your [maternal] grandmother [Dereanzy Barry Hicks]?
Speaker 2: Oh, God, yeah.  I remember when I was living there that period of time when my father [James Singletary] was laid off, we were living in Clarksdale [Mississippi] and my mother [Mattie Hicks Singletary] and father were invited to a party and I remember my mother was dressed, it was a costume party.  My mother was dressed up like an Indian [Native American], and I was left there, we were left there with my grandmother, my sisters and I, and I remember her telling me about somebody who died, and I said, "Well, what's that?"  I think I was four years old.  She described to me what death was and that was the first time anybody had ever told me what death was, first time I was ever aware that there was death, and she took me in her arms and I was sitting in her lap, and she was telling me it was a deep sleep, but it's comforting, it's like a blanket.  I remember that very specifically.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what type of person was your grandmother?  How would you describe here?
Speaker 2: Grandmother was, she was a character; she liked to, to go.  When people said they're getting ready to go somewhere, she'll ride, take the ride in the car.  She liked to go.  She didn't do much shopping.  I think granddaddy [Oliver Hicks] did most of the shopping, like grocery shopping, and even clothes shopping.  She just worked really hard all her life.  I know that when she was younger, raising my mother and her siblings, you know, she used to take in wash, she used to work in the fields, along with my mother and her siblings when they were younger.  But my grandfather, he was a minister, and he went around to all these little towns preaching.  He was a C.M.E. [Colored Methodist Episcopal; Christian Methodist Episcopal] minister and he also sold insurance and he also was a porter on a train.  That's how my folks got a chance to go to places like Chicago [Illinois] and to visit other relatives and go to Memphis [Tennessee].  And a lot of our family actually migrated to Chicago.  So they were very hard-working people living in a southern town.  There was just a certain way of life that they became accustomed to, and it was more routine than anything else, but they lived on this wonderful street called Bolivar [Avenue] and it seems though that particular street had all the professionals, like the school teachers and my mother always said she wondered how they got there.  But, they always made the most of what they had.  Grandmother would work hard and my mother was one of the older daughters.  She was the oldest girl, so she did a lot of the raising, helping raising of children and keeping the house and cooking and all that.  My grandmother did what she needed to do to keep the family together as well as granddaddy.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did they own the land that they lived on?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, they did.
Story_ID: 371253
Speaker 1: Did they talk about anyone in your family coming from slavery?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, my great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Did they tell you any stories about that?
Speaker 2: Well, she told me.
Speaker 1: What did she tell you?
Speaker 2: Well, my great-grandmother was old, my great-grandmother lived--
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Lillie Barry was her name and she lived 'til she was a hundred and--well, they say a hundred and fifteen.  I believe maybe it was a hundred and thirteen.  And she, she died in Chicago [Illinois], but she was raised in, I think, places around Clarksdale, Mississippi, like Alligator [Mississippi].  But she finally moved to Clarksdale, Mississippi.  She married and then I think her husband died and then I think she married again, and I think this husband also died.  I remember him climbing up a ladder and falling, but before he died, she had several children and, she had children late, sort of late in life, and so did my [maternal] grandmother [Dereanzy Barry Hicks] had children late in life.  But my grandmother was, great-grandmother was a very spry woman.  She lived by herself for a long time, until she was in her hundreds, and she liked to travel and she liked to dress, and she was very animated until she got to the point that she couldn't.  But when she got to the point where I was really interested in her, that's when she got to the point she where she could barely talk and tell me stories.  But she was a children of, she was a child of parents who were in slavery.  So she couldn't tell me very much, but it was, she was part of the Tooles [ph.] family and they did own a lot of land.
Speaker 1: The what family?
Speaker 2: The Tooles family.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  T-O-O, I think, Too, T-E-S, Tooles family.  And they did own land because she would talk about this land and my great, my great-grandmother talked about this land, and my grandmother was constantly talking about this land.  So, yeah, the Tooles family.
Story_ID: 371254
Speaker 1: You started talking about your mother [Mattie Hicks Singletary], so tell me about her growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, growing in Clarksdale, Mississippi, it was a town that everybody sort of knew their place.  There was a certain part of town, there was a bridge that you go across this part of town, it was the white folks, and then the black folks lived on the other side.  But they sort of understood this dance that they had.  It wasn't a lot of violence, but you knew your place and everybody seemed to be okay with it.  Not okay with it, but you know what I'm saying?  They lived with it, understanding that there were things that they knew that they could not do.  There was an understatement, you know, but, my uncle, my father's [James Singletary] brother, ran this garage and my mother remembers this garage, as long as she can remember this garage being in operation, the town was just about tradition and she grew up very much a part of that.  There was no high school, I believe, at the time, so I think when she finished elementary school, they had to go away to school.  I think it was called Aggie [Coahoma County Agricultural High School; Coahoma Agricultural High School, Clarksdale, Mississippi].  I think this was the school that she would talk about.  A lot of her friends went there and they had to get on a bus and get there, or a lot of the kids would board there.  But she had to work hard because she was the oldest girl, so she had a lot of responsibilities.  Of course, the cooking, and they had to work the fields, you know, in order to keep everybody together, keep it all together.
Speaker 1: How many siblings did she have?
Speaker 2: Oh, God, you had to ask me that.  There were, I think there were thirteen children altogether.  I think ten survived, if I'm, if I'm correct.
Story_ID: 371255
Speaker 1: And your father [James Singletary], did he share any stories about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he was pretty much the baby and sort of a loner in terms of, he didn't have the siblings right there with him because he was so young, but he was very close to his brother and he had two sisters, so he was the baby and he was bossed around a lot.  I remember that.  But he was very well taken care of and mentored by his older brother who had the garage that I was telling you about there in the town [Clarksdale, Mississippi].  So, he learned about working on cars.  That was what daddy did, he worked on cars.  And then he joined the [U.S. military] service and then after he came back from the service, which he really, when he went to the service he has this picture of when he was there in his uniform in Paris [France] and that first really sparked my interest in Paris.  Daddy was there, I gotta go check it out.  He would always say how wonderful it was.  He always said he wanted his whole family to go there, it was so wonderful.  But when he returned back from the service, he began working in the garage again, and then, I think he decided then he wanted to go to Detroit [Michigan] where the car industry was.  So that's what he did.  So eventually, he did go, but before he left, he made arrangements with my mother [Mattie Hicks Singletary] to marry her and so they married, and then they went to Detroit.
Story_ID: 371256
Speaker 1: So you were born in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your siblings.  How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: I have four siblings.  I have three sisters and one brother.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me their names?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how you fall in the order?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My oldest sister Sheila [Sheila Singletary] just by eleven months, then there's me and then my sister Wanda [Wanda Singletary] who's a year younger.  And then my sister Rose [Rose Singletary].  She is five years younger than me.  And then my youngest brother, he, we so glad he made it, a boy, James [James Singletary], he is fourteen years younger than me.
Story_ID: 371257
Speaker 1: Let's think about your childhood.  What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, kindergarten I guess.  I remembered my kindergarten teacher, I didn't like her very much.  And there was a divider right between the classes.  There was a group of kids on one class and the other group on the other side.  The teacher that I didn't like very much, I can't remember her name, but there was another teacher on the other side.  She was so nice. She never yelled at the kids or she was so nice, and I remember, I wanted to be in that class, so one time they opened up the divider and I snuck in over at the other side, and they discovered me and took me back and I cried.  My mother [Mattie Hicks Singletary] had to come get me (laughter).
Story_ID: 371258
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, we were talking about your mother and father, I don't think we got their names and their dates of birth and--
Speaker 2: Mattie Lee Singletary [Mattie Hicks Singletary] and James Singletary.
Speaker 1: Okay. What else do you remember about your childhood?
Speaker 2: I remember being happy.  I had a happy childhood. I had great parents, you know, I had those warm, cozy Christmases.  We didn't have a lot, but we didn't know it.  You know, we were very, you know, we were very happy, we had everything we needed. We were very fortunate.  None of us were really sick.  Daddy kept a job and then he worked on cars in the garage. We had a nice car garage.  That's one of the reasons he bought that house 'cause it had a really nice garage.  We, we just, it was happy.  I can't really tell you how much I appreciate that until I went away to school and talked to other kids who didn't have happy childhoods.  But our childhood was just very warm, loving, supportive parents who were supportive of all our efforts in school and whatever we did.  We had a lot of fun because we were very active in school.  There were a lot of concerts.  I played the violin.  My sisters played.  My sister, older sister [Sheila Singletary], she played the violin.  My sister Wanda [Wanda Singletary] was a cheerleader.  So they had to go to a lot of school events, and when daddy could, he did.  But he worked two jobs, one at Uniroyal [United States Rubber Company] and, of course, the one I was telling you, his own business, working in the garage, working on cars.  But I remember, my mother helped me to remember this, she was pregnant.  She was pregnant with my brother [James Singletary] and I was still in high school [Charles F. Kettering Senior High School, Detroit, Michigan], and I belonged in the orchestra, not the orchestra, a quartet, one of these things where I had to be at school early in the morning, and it was a little ways and it was really early that she didn't feel comfortable about me walking by myself, and this was in the wintertime.  We'd actually walk to school together.  She would walk me to school to make sure I got there okay, and I do remember it.  It's funny the things that you forget, you know, sort of take for granted, but yeah, I remember those kinds of things.  That's the kind of family I'm from.
Speaker 1: Your mother, did she work outside the home?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  We were really selfish.  Whenever she'd take a little part-time job, and she would occasionally, like Christmastime, we would be really annoyed.  She wasn't there for lunch, you know, we'd have to get a key and open the door and have a little put lunch together ourselves.  We didn't like that very much.  And I think she really felt a duty and responsibility to be there for us.
Speaker 1: How much education did your mother have?
Speaker 2: High school, high school.
Speaker 1: And your dad?
Speaker 2: Daddy, I think, eighth grade.
Story_ID: 371259
Speaker 1: What were holidays like at your home?
Speaker 2: Oh, they were great, you know, they were great, you know.  We had the Christmas tree, we'd go and get the real live Christmas trees.  We didn't have artificial trees, not until we were grown.  We'd have the tree, we'd go to the market, get the tree, come back, decorate it.  When we were kids, of course, Christmas Eve was a big event.  You know, Mom [Mattie Hicks Singletary] would bake for days and, you know, Christmas Eve as kids, we'd go to bed at six o'clock and, you know, we had this show on TV called 'Poopdeck Paul' and he would take care of the weather, but also the Christmas Santa Claus journey, so he would tell us where Santa Claus was and what kind of whether he was having, and all that.  We'd go to bed at six o'clock.  Of course, we couldn't go to sleep and, you know, we'd chat until we eventually fall asleep and the next day would be Christmas.  We'd get up at five.  Sometimes the toys would be there, sometimes they wouldn't.  We had really good times at that house in Detroit [Michigan].  My parents are still there.
Speaker 1: What was the address?  Do you remember? What was the address?
Speaker 2: Yes, 5315 Seminole [Street] is our address.
Story_ID: 371260
Speaker 1: What kind of community was it when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, every--we had kids to play with.  My best friend lived a house down.  My sister's best friend lived next door, you know.  It was a wonderful community.  Everybody went to the same school.  All the schools were walking distance.  Nobody had to bus, or, everything was, it was a great area, and school was just really good.  We lived in the east side of Detroit [Michigan], and I'm not talking about the suburbs.  It was just a great place to live.  The programs in school were wonderful. We had a lot of music.  We had a lot of art in our programs, unlike the schools have now.  We had music classes where we'd actually sing.  We had instrumental music where you actually learned an instrument if you wanted to.  We just, we just really had a wonderful school sister that introduced us to all kinds of cultures, you know, and programs that could eventually become interested in and pursue.
Speaker 1: What was the makeup of the students at your school and the teachers?
Speaker 2: Predominately African American but we did have maybe about 20 percent that were white at that time.  But we were going through what they considered the white flight.  People were leaving.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And what about the teachers?
Speaker 2: Most of our teachers were white.  We had a few black teachers, but as we got into junior high school [Barbour Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan], we had more and more black teachers.  And then when I got to high school [Charles F. Kettering Senior High School, Detroit, Michigan], there were, most of my teachers, well, about 50 percent of my teachers, were African American.
Speaker 1: In elementary school [Hillger Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], was there a teacher that might have encouraged you or somebody that you looked up to, or--?
Speaker 2: In elementary school?
Speaker 1: In elementary school.  Or someone that you remember (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember, yeah, I remember my first grade teacher, Miss Joyner [ph.].  She was just very patient, very kind and I remembered not wanting to leave my grade and go to another one 'cause I didn't know what I'd get.  I remember Miss Marsgood [ph.]. She was a wonderful teacher.  Oh, I'm trying to remember my music teacher.  I can't remember her name, but I just can't remember her name.
Speaker 1: That's fine, that's fine.
Story_ID: 371261
Speaker 1: What other curricular, extracurricular activities did you participate in in your elementary school [Hillger Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] years?
Speaker 2: Well, elementary school was just recess.  We didn't really have too much, other than me starting my violin lessons.  I started violin lessons, I believe I was in the third grade.  And that was the wonderful thing about education in Michigan, specifically Michigan.  They truly believed in the arts and they believed in students being exposed to it as early as possible.  I remember discovering that I could draw in elementary school.  We had an art teacher and I cannot remember the art teacher's name, and I was actually put in a special program.  This is all coming back to me now.  I was actually put into a special program.  My art teacher realized that I had talent and there was a citywide art program that wasn't far from where I lived, and once a week I would go there, but I didn't enjoy it very much.  I remember not enjoying it very much, not--
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: Well, the kids were so talented, and they were doing things that I thought was just beyond what I could do.  I didn't think that I could do that.  And I remember feeling inferior.  And I remember feeling the best in my classroom.  So I liked that feeling better.  I didn't understand growing.  I didn't understand challenge.  I understood that, what they were doing was, was I liked to see them work and I would sit and watch them work, but I didn't do well in that environment.  I liked being the best (laughter).
Speaker 1: So did you take, well, talking about the violin lessons, did you take lessons outside of school? No, just in school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, because the lessons, we had private lessons two times a week.  They would take us out of home room and we, we'd be gone for half an hour, and then we have lessons, and we were, you know, expected to know those lessons when we came back, and it was just exciting to see how much I learned, and the violin became so easy, I became a notice and very talented in that aspect, in music.  So, I really enjoyed it, so it wasn't like, you know, and then the students were given an opportunity, so if you wanted to play an instrument, you could.  If you didn't want to, you didn't have to.  But they wanted all students to know how to read music, so we had, that's when we had vocal classes, chorus classes, to learn how to read music.  But I just enjoyed it.  I couldn't wait. I felt special being pulled out of homeroom and I'd get a chance to play and we had a wonderful music teacher, so I really enjoyed it and really blossomed and looked forward to playing in junior high school [Barbour Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan] when I went.
Speaker 1: At home did you and your sibling, you said your sister [Sheila Singletary] played the violin also?  Did y'all, did y'all play music at home?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What other types of music did you and your sister play at home?
Speaker 2: Well, when we were young, my mother [Mattie Hicks Singletary] felt that we should all play the piano, so we took piano lessons.  I hated piano lessons.  And we'd all have to take the, there were three of us, and we'd all have to take it on Saturday, so we'd get to the music teacher's house like at nine o'clock.  It was a hour each and by the time we got through it was like half the day was over and we'd have to wait for somebody to pick us up and we hated it.  I hated it.  But, you know, we attended church [Saunders Memorial A.M.E. Church, Detroit, Michigan] and Ma felt that it would be nice if one of us could play the piano or the organ for church.  And it didn't work out too well.  But it did give me a good solid background in music, to say something nice about it (laughter).
Story_ID: 371262
Speaker 1: What church did you attend?
Speaker 2: We attended Saunders Memorial A.M.E. Church [Detroit, Michigan].  We grew up in that church, African American Episcopal [African Methodist Episcopal].
Speaker 1: And what was church like for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was just part of our, our family life.  Every Sunday, we'd get up getting ready to go to Sunday school and my father [James Singletary] sang in the choir.  He had a, has a wonderful voice, still does.  And my mother [Mattie Hicks Singletary], before all the kids became too much, she used to sing in in the choir.  And, it was just part of what we did.  Our parents were very active in church and Ma even taught Sunday school at one time.  And dad even became a steward in the church and, you know, trustee, and still very active in the same church.
Story_ID: 371263
Speaker 1: What was the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Hillger Elementary School [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) H-I-L-L-G-E-R.  You really bringing the memories.  (Unclear) Hillger, long time.
Speaker 1: And that was in Detroit [Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so now you moved to, you graduate and go to junior high school or middle school.
Speaker 2: Middle school, junior high school is what we called it.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was the name of that school?
Speaker 2: Barbour Junior High [Barbour Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Barbour?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  That's B-A-R-B-O-U-R.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your junior high school experience.  Well, actually, before you get to junior high school, is this when you start, enter into the art contest, or is that in junior high school?
Speaker 2: Oh that was in high school [Charles F. Kettering Senior High School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: That was in high school? Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm that art contest, yeah.
Story_ID: 371264
Speaker 1: We were at junior high school [Barbour Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan] and you're just entering junior high school so tell me about your junior high school experience.
Speaker 2: It was terrible (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh no. Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I never felt like a fish out of water more so than I did in junior high school, you know, that's when, you know, you begin to know the social cliques and people who are popular, and I was not, you know, the smart one, I was not the pretty one, I was not the intelligent one.  I was just very average.  I was the kid that would sit in the back of the classroom and I would grab the back pew, you know, that very back seat, and hope that the teacher doesn't notice me.  I just wanted to observe things.  I didn't want attention and that began with me in junior high school, you know.  If I knew the answer to a question that the teacher was, was putting out to the class, I would not raise my hand.  I was one of those students, very shy, very withdrawn.
Speaker 1: Well, did your artwork help you express yourself at this time?
Speaker 2: No.  I retreated into the art because it was very solitude.  As an artist you work alone, you known, you create alone, so I enjoyed my art classes, but the art classes were not a vehicle to give you attention ever in school, you know, it's sort of like a silent talent, you know.  But that's what I loved about it, you know.  It gave me solace in a world that I chose to be silent in.  So it gave me something to hold on to until better years I thought were coming, which would be high school [Charles F. Kettering Senior High School, Detroit, Michigan] (laughter).
Speaker 1: So did you continue with your music lessons as well?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, music and art were very important to me.  We had an orchestra in high school and I participated in the orchestra.  Mr. Hickland [ph.] was my teacher, and he was very, very encouraging, very encouraging.  My sister and I played in the orchestra.
Speaker 1: This was in junior high school?
Speaker 2: In junior high school.  My sister Sheila [Sheila Singletary].
Story_ID: 371265
Speaker 1: What type of music did you listen to at home?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh.  Oh, soul music.  We listed to, you know, we were from Detroit [Michigan], Motown, you know.  Hey, what else was there?  But we also listened to a lot of classical music because of my exposure to music in junior high school [Barbour Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan] and in elementary school [Hillger Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan].  We would play classical pieces.  We would play popular musical pieces like 'The Sound of Music,' those kinds of things.  And then my folks [Mattie Hicks Singletary and James Singletary] were a big fan of 'The Lawrence Welk Show,' so they had this one violinist there.  That's how I knew that's what I wanted to play.  And we would watch that and popular music is what we would play, and so that's what we listened to, but number one, of course, was Motown.  Number two, a lot of church music because my father sang [at Saunders Memorial A.M.E. Church, Detroit, Michigan].  And number three, a lot of classical music 'cause we would buy albums for, for the pieces that we were learning so we'd have an idea of what they, we would sort of cheat, play by ear, rather than to struggle with the music so if you know what it sounds like, you can play it easier, so we did that.
Story_ID: 371266
Speaker 1: So what else do you remember about junior high school [Barbour Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: I was glad to get out.  I had, I had a wonderful teacher, Mr. Hall.  His name was Prentiss Hall [ph.].  He was very stern with me.  I was supposed to learn the Gettysburg Address.  I was so nervous that I stumbled and I blanked out and I do that when I get nervous, I just forget my name.  And I was halfway through it and I actually forgot what I was doing up there and, you had to learn this.  I mean you absolutely had to learn this because if you didn't, you would get the paddle.  That's when the paddled you in school.  Well, I didn't and I did.  And it was the first time that I was ever paddled in school, in front of everybody.  You have to turn around and it's a big wooden paddle and you'd get paddled.  But I remember learning a lot from him.  I mean I didn't like that part about him, but I remember him expressing to us the importance of excellence, and that he would not accept anything but excellence.  He expected it from us, and we gave it to him, most of the time.  If it weren't for the blackout, I would have given it to him.  But he expected that, and I grew from that.  I, I begin to think outside of what was around me because of him.  I began to think of other possibilities, and he would expose us to people in history, you know, who did some incredible things, some black people in history to show us that we could do it too.  And that was really the beginning of possibilities for me.
Speaker 1: What subject did he teach?
Speaker 2: He was my homeroom teacher.
Speaker 1: Oh he was--
Speaker 2: But he also taught me, I guess that was, would that be political science?  I think it was political science or social science because it was the Gettysburg Address.  It was history.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: That's what it was, history.
Speaker 1: At this point you saying that the school is more integrated or is it still predominately black?
Speaker 2: It's more predominately black now.
Speaker 1: And you still had white teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes we did, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So this teacher was a white teacher?
Speaker 2: No, this was a black teacher (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Teacher, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 371267
Speaker 1: Did you belong to any outside organizations, like maybe the Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] or join the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was a Bluebird--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for a minute.  That was in elementary school [Hillger Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan].  And that didn't last too long.  I wasn't interested in it.  The arts and crafts projects just didn't do it for me.  And I think I left, maybe about, maybe two or three months because I don't remember.  I just remember getting a uniform and after that I wasn't anymore.  And, no, other than musical concerts that we do through the music department with the orchestra, no.
Story_ID: 371268
Speaker 1: You go to high school and tell me the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Kettering Senior High [Charles F. Kettering Senior High School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for me?
Speaker 2: Ah, yes, K-E-T-T-E-R-I-N-G.  And--
Speaker 1: Let me see, what year is this now we're in?
Speaker 2: And this is a brand new high school.  And this was in, I was, that was in ninety, no 1970, no, was it 1970? Nineteen sixty-nine [1969], I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's--
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little bit (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we are going back (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, I wanna go back a little further before we enter into high school.  Tell me were your parents [Mattie Hicks Singletary and James Singletary] political at all?  Because you see we're talking about the Civil Rights Movement, was, did that--?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, yeah.  Yesterday was Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] birthday.  I remember as a child, I guess I must have been about nine, ten, my father would go to choir rehearsal [at Saunders Memorial A.M.E. Church, Detroit, Michigan] and he would come back with the men, the men's group, the men's choir, and the men would come back over to our house at night.  Daddy had a, very few families had a record player.  Daddy had a record player, and they would bring these Martin Luther King records and they would all sit around and they would listen to them.  That's how I learned about Martin Luther King.  It really is how I learned about him, you know.  A lot of things were going on in Detroit [Michigan] at the time, you know.  We had the riots and things like that, so it was just a very heated kind of environment, Detroit was.  And I remember the men sitting around listening to his speeches and saying, "Yeah, that's right, yeah, yeah, that's right, that's what we need to do, yeah," recognizing him as our leader.  Recognizing him as someone to change the way we live in America, recognizing this the whole time.  And that was an important moment for my father 'cause I think at the time, he was thinking about running for City Council [Detroit City Council], and for some reason, he didn't.  I know why.  It was so many of us and he had the job.  I think someone had approached him to run for City Council, but daddy had two full-time jobs and I just don't think he could have handled it.
Speaker 1: So do you remember when, when King was killed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember.  I remember when my aunts were on that bus to Washington [D.C.].  I remember my Aunt Cora [Cora Hicks] and my Aunt Euzilla [Euzilla Hicks Vaughn] telling me about that experience.
Speaker 1: What did they tell you?
Speaker 2: Oh, my God.  You know, about how wonderful it was.  Everybody coming together, that ride.
Speaker 1: You talking about the March in Washington?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So we're in '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And they were just telling me about the experience and I really didn't come to appreciate it until I was a little older and then they would retell it.  In fact, my aunt just this Christmas came to visit my, my parents in Detroit and we were talking about it when we were in the car, that it was a very powerful moment.  It changed everything.  It changed everything for everybody in America.  She was in high school still in Mississippi, in Clarksdale, Mississippi then, and it made her, made her come to the conclusion that she had to go to college, she had to go, which she did.  It changed a lot of people's lives.  The awakenness, the awakening of, of all the things that were happening in America and the things that we could do to change it, had to begin with us.  And everybody sort of recognized it at that time.  It was like this awakening, you know, and I remember my father experiencing that awakening and our community, our city, experiencing that 'cause I remember the riots.  I remember shoes in the streets, clothes everywhere.  I remember people running. I remember people looting.  I remember all of that.   I remember when, you know, Martin Luther King would make speeches about peace, and I knew it wasn't right, and that it wasn't nonviolent.  We were supposed to do this in a nonviolent way.  But I knew how angry everybody was.  It was just like this, this thing that was swelling and it just came to a head, you know.  We could feel it in Detroit.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what you were doing when King was assassinated?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was in junior high school [Barbour Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan].  I was in junior high school when he was assassinated, you know, and I just, you know, you just know where you were, you know.  I just remember being in school and talking about it and everybody crying and, you know, it's, sure, I was in high--I was in junior high school (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 371269
Speaker 1: So now you are going to high school, to Kettering High School [Charles F. Kettering Senior High School, Detroit, Michigan] hoping that it will be better than junior high school [Barbour Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan] for you.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell me about high school.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I fell in love with this guy named Vincent Bryson [ph.], and he played the flute, and he belonged to the city orchestra, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.  And I wasn't very good at violin, but I wanted to get, I got inspiration, so I began to practice, really practice, and I got good enough to get in and Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] also had a youth orchestra.  You would go there on Saturdays.  I had to really practice so I could get in there.  So I became very good with the violin.  It's strange what your motivation is.  And I began to play in orchestras and I loved it.  I really loved it.  We would compete in school.  We would have these music festivals, the Detroit Youth Symphony would have different events, like, I'd go to those and it was just a really a great time.  I really thought my career was gonna be in music.  I put all my energies into music and the art work was still there.  I was still, you know, in art class, and, but everything was music.  I was in the orchestra.  I played in the school quartet.  I wasn't in the band because, I would have been in the band but they didn't allow string instruments in the band, but because I wasn't in the band, I became Kettering's first majorette, me and my sister.  We were majorettes.  There were four of us.  And we were the string quartet.  The string quartet became violin, no violin players turned into majorettes.  And we didn't have a school banner.  My mother [Mattie Hicks Singletary] made our first school banner, and we were in the Hudson's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and all that stuff.  So we had to have uniforms.  Our mother made our little uniforms, you know, the twirling.  We learned the twirl ourselves.  We didn't know anything about twirling, and everything was music.  Everything I did was music.  Everything in high school was centered around music.  So that doesn't make you very popular because music is kind of square.  So I was, I would get attention occasionally because I was the concert mistress in our orchestra, so I would play violin solos and play with the quartet and things like that.  But I pretty much stayed under the, you know, the wire.  I didn't really get a lot of attention.  My sister, Sheila [Sheila Singletary], was very popular. She ran for homecoming queen.  And my sister Wanda [Wanda Singletary] came in her first year and became a cheerleader.  She was very popular, but I was still kind of under the wire, you know, still a very average student and loved music and enjoyed, you know, drawing, and I did a lot of that.  I'd do that at home and my mother was kind of concerned about me.  All my siblings in school, they were very outgoing and when I came home from school, I'd practice my violin and I'd watch television.  That's all I did.
Story_ID: 371270
Speaker 1: I would study occasionally, but I really wasn't motivated. I did know I wanted to go to college 'cause that's what I was supposed to do, but I really wanted to go to college.  I really was looking forward to going, but I didn't think that my grades were really that great, and I was only motivated with art and music, especially music.  So my curriculum was an art and music curriculum, and I really didn't understand how you could make a living doing art.  So I wasn't really moving in that direction.  I just knew that when I did go to college, I did want to continue to study art.  And I didn't really want to be a teacher.  My mother's [Mattie Hicks Singletary] people were teachers.  They were, the families, like my aunt who rode in the March to Washington, she's a teacher.  My other aunt was a teacher.  All my mother's sisters were teachers or in the education field.  My Uncle Jeff [ph.], who was the oldest of my mother's brothers and sisters, he's a teacher, so everybody were teachers, and they expected me to go to college and become a teacher.  Now there's nothing wrong with being a teacher, you know, I just didn't think I could be a teacher because I wasn't very good at school, I wasn't, you know, I was just average.  So, but I did know that I wanted to go to college, I just didn't know what I was gonna do there.
Speaker 2: So who helped you make a decision about your future after high school [Charles F. Kettering Senior High School, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 1: Well, everybody nicely insisted that I become a teacher.  I remember my Uncle Jeff calling.  He wanted me to, "Brenda [HistoryMaker Brenda Singletary], it's good that you can go into school and learn that art, but what if the art thing doesn't work?  You know, you need a safety net."  And you know, my mother said, "Well, Brenda it's good to be in art, just become an art teacher."  But if I were gonna art, I'd want to be an artist and I didn't know of any other arts that were making a living at it.  We didn't get that in school.  We didn't know any African Americans who made a living at art.  There were no examples.  We weren't taught that then.  So I was lost.  I had no direction.  Mr. Yost [ph.] who was my art teacher, didn't really give me much direction.  No that he couldn't, it's just that I never really asked him.  I didn't know the questions to ask.
Story_ID: 371271
Speaker 1: Well, did he [Singletary's high school art teacher, Mr. Yost (ph.)] see your talent?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.  He was the one that got me into that art competition.  There was this art competition every year in Detroit [Michigan].  It's featured by one of our major department stores, called Hudson's [J.L. Hudson Company, Detroit, Michigan] and the New York, no New York, the Detroit Free Press, and I entered a fashion illustration and it won one the prizes, one of many.  It wasn't the first prize, but it was one of the prizes that was given out.  And I remembered my picture later being in the paper with my parents [Mattie Hicks Singletary and James Singletary] and everybody at school was excited about it.  I said hey, I like this, publicity too, and I win a prize, and, you know, I said I like this art thing, you know, I really like this.  And I didn't have to get up in front of people and say anything or didn't have to raise my hand, they just took my picture and they did everything for me, so I liked that, I liked that a lot.  So when I, I did think about a future in college, I was thinking more along the lines of an artist, but I was still struggling trying to find some kind of mentor, someone who was doing this, that I could say, okay, I can do this.  Or tell my parents, see, he's an artist or she's an artist, you know.  But I just didn't know where to look.
Speaker 1: So, by the teacher helping you to get into this competition, what happened?  Did you being to do more artwork to get into other competitions?  What happened after that initial contest (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was truly inspired, I was truly inspired that other people thought it was important enough to put in the paper.  So I say, it's got to be important, what I do has got to be important to somebody, you know.  I just hadn't found the audience yet.  But, he wasn't really in a position, you know.  He was an art teacher, he didn't know anything other than art education.  So, he did as much as he could for me.  He just encouraged me to go on and study art in college, but he didn't say you could become a professional artist if you study hard or, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there anyone like that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: No one.  Like you said, you just could not really find a mentor or anybody that could lead you in the right direction.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Story_ID: 371272
Speaker 1: So what happened after high school [Charles F. Kettering Senior High School, Detroit, Michigan]?  You graduate in 19--
Speaker 2: Well, I do have to say something, one more thing about high school.  I had the most incredible music teacher.  His name was Harry G. Shuman.  I don't know if he is still with us or not.  He was incredible.  Because of my interest in music and the quartet, he would expose us to all kinds of things that we never would have had an opportunity.  The Detroit Youth Symphony, we'd have never been involved in that.  The American Youth Performs, this was a televised program.  We never would have gotten involved, the national televised program.  We would have never been involved in these, these events.  He made sure that we had opportunities to play places that black kids wouldn't get a chance to play.  He was the most incredible man.  This was not an African American man.  And he would take us to his church, he would take us to different churches around the city to play.  He would take us to wonderful place, a park we have in Detroit [Michigan] called Belle Isle [Belle Isle Park], play.  He would make sure we were in professional groups.  The Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] youth orchestra, we were involved in that.  He was just incredible.  There were times when we had to rehearse for various events.  He would come to our house.  We would rehearse at my house in the basement.  He would come, he said, "Hello Miss Singletary [Mattie Hicks Singletary], I'm coming to rehearse with your girls."  And we'd be in the basement on a Saturday and he'd come there, drive from wherever he lived to our side of town and rehearse with us.  Not many teachers would do that.  He did that, you know.  He was a really wonderful teacher and truly was the definition of a teacher who cares.  I have to say that about him.
Story_ID: 371273
Speaker 1: And did your social life pick up?  (Laughter) You talked how in junior high school [Barbour Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan] you just stayed to yourself.  Did you begin to, you know, to reach out and be a part of any other organizations?
Speaker 2: Other than music, no.
Speaker 1: No, just music?
Speaker 2: If it were not, if it was not associated with music or a music programs or music organizations or programs for the summer, no.  I was a, like I said, I (laughter)--nah.
Speaker 1: So you graduated in what year?
Speaker 2: I graduated in '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had just turned seventeen when I graduated.  And, when I was in high school [Charles F. Kettering Senior High School, Detroit, Michigan], my mother [Mattie Hicks Singletary] has a really good friend.  Her name is Miss Matthews [ph.], and her son was in the same class as I was, and they were talking.  She said, "You need to check out Oakland University [Rochester, Michigan], they're recruiting African American students, you know, and they're giving money to students."  It was a fairly new university.  It wasn't that old.  And so I remember my mother, my father [James Singletary], myself and my sister, Sheila [Sheila Singletary], we drove to Oakland University.  It's about thirty-five minutes outside of Detroit [Michigan] in Rochester, Michigan to get an application.  I was still in high school.  So we went up there and there was a gentleman sitting there.  His name was George Jackson, who is now, I think he's the dean of graduate students at the, at Iowa State University [Ames, Iowa].  And he was part of this program called special projects.  And they would recruit students from inner city schools and, you know, I helped them and mentor them into, into college, and he said, "You need to meet Dean Pearson [ph.]." So he sent me to their office, Dean Pearson's office. I met Dr. Pearson and he was very stern.  He said, "Do you want to go to school this summer?"  And I said, "No."  He say, "Why?"  I said, "I've got to work this summer to get money to go to school in September."  And he looked at me and my sister was with me, he looked at me.  He said, "Don't--" and I kind of laughed.  He said, "Don't laugh."  He said, "I'm serious.  Do you want to go to school?"  And I said yes.  So I graduated that June, two weeks later I was in college.
Story_ID: 371274
Speaker 1: And in this program [special projects], it was wonderful.  Like I said, I had just turned seventeen, and my world had just opened up for me.  And I was able to study art and it was different than what I thought it would be.  It was a new college so they really didn't have a really great art program.
Speaker 2: And it was called Oakland College?
Speaker 1: Oakland University [Rochester, Michigan].  And I was a little disenchanted with the program.  It was a little bit more than I really was ready for.  They were doing a lot of experimental kinds of work that I didn't quite understand yet.  I hadn't gotten to that point yet, but I observed a lot, I learned a lot, and then I felt that I was, I stayed there about a year and a half and I wanted to go have an experience, an African American school experience.  So I transferred [to Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: So this school was--how man--well--
Speaker 1: The school was wonderful.  The campus was beautiful.  The summer was from a dream world.  It really wasn't summer school, it was like a summer camp.  We had, had a little lake there.  We'd, they'd serve free watermelon and have lunch and they served ice cream.  Just as a whim they would do these things.  We only had two classes that summer.  So we had a chance to really experience campus life, you know.  And we met students from all over and it was wonderful.  When the fall semester started, it was wonderful too.  I had a little bit too much fun but I passed all my classes.  That second semester I was having a little bit too much fun.  I didn't do as well in my classes, but I didn't really, I felt a little disenchanted and I felt that I lost my direction because my art classes just weren't what I had wanted them to be.  And then I said I want to do some figurative things and the classes were doing nothing but abstract and experimental three dimensional kinds of work and I really wasn't ready for that yet.
Story_ID: 371275
Speaker 1: We were talking about your time at Oakland University [Rochester, Michigan], and you're disenchanted with the art classes because you wanted to do something different.  What type of work were you doing up until that point since abstract really wasn't something that you understood?  What was your artwork like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it's, it's not that I didn't understand it, it's not what I really wanted to do at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay. I got you.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I really wanted to explore more, see this was the seventies, the early seventies, and everybody was very political, and I wanted to do some things that reflected my feelings politically, and they weren't necessarily abstract, but that's all that we were really exploring were three dimensional designs and, you know, things that were very abstract.  We'd get a model to work from, but it, the outcome wasn't what, the whole thing, it just wasn't me, and I wanted to do some things that reflected my feelings at the time.  And a lot of that was figurative, a lot of it wasn't, but I wanted to be able to express myself politically as well.  And that just didn't give me the engine to do it.  That program just wasn't right.  So I dropped out of school at the end of that spring semester, not planning to return.  And my mother [Mattie Hicks Singletary] was taking my sister. She was starting, my sister younger than me, Wanda [Wanda Singletary], up to Western Michigan University [Kalamazoo, Michigan] to school on campus, and after we got her settled in, on the drive back, my mother was so disenchanted that I wasn't starting school that semester.  And she says, in a desperation, she said, "Brenda [HistoryMaker Brenda Singletary] have you considered any of the African American colleges [HBCUs]?"  And then a light bulb just went off.  And I had been wanting to have that experience.  And as soon as I got home, I got the set of encyclopedias out and they listed all the schools, Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], you know, Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia], and I sent information out to all of them.  And even Georgia State [Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia], and Morris Brown won, because first of all my parents, my mother mentioned it but she didn't really want me to do it, but Morris Brown is an A.M.E. school, we are A.M.E., so I could talk them into letting me do that because that's who we were.  We were A.M.E., African Methodist Episcopal, and somehow I just wasn't going to school unless I was going to Morris Brown, so I start applying.
Story_ID: 371276
Speaker 1: Now this was in the fall.  I wanted to get into that January semester.  Well I started filling out the forms, I believe, in October, and financial aid papers and everything, and I hadn't heard from Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia], and I was getting really nervous.  It was the Christmas holiday and I didn't know whether I was going to school in January or not.  The semester starts like January 4th or something like that.  Didn't hear anything.  Now then I really begin to go up the wall.  I was working at a little part-time job at Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.].  We had a Sears store right behind our house.  And every day I'd come in wanting to know did I get any mail.  Hadn't gotten any mail.  Christmas holiday, we're right in it, you know.  Campus was closed so I couldn't find out anything.  So I waited until campus closed, no opened up.  So I called and called and called, no one answered the phones.  No one answered the phones.  I didn't understand what was happening.  Finally, I called and let the phone just ring like a hundred times.  The janitor picked up the phone.  He said, "The campus is closed.  We've got an ice storm here.  The campus has been closed down for days."  And I said, "Well I'm supposed to find out whether I'm going, gonna be there for that semester or not.  No one has contacted me.  I haven't gotten any papers, I don't know what I'm supposed to do."  He says, "If I were you, I'd just come.  They won't send you back if you get here."  So I hung up the phone and my mother [Mattie Hicks Singletary] says, "Brenda [HistoryMaker Brenda Singletary], did you talk to the school?"  I said, "Yeah."  She said, "What did they say?"  I said, "They said to come on."  So my mother put me on a plane and they were not ready, they were not expecting me, and my sister had a girlfriend, her and her husband were attending ITC [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia], a seminary school.  They picked me up at the airport and they dropped me off at the dorm.  Now, I was not officially a student at Morris Brown College and it was in the middle of the snow storm.  I mean we were one of the first planes that came in after they opened up the airport.  So the campus was still closed down.  And I was standing there, you know, and I said well, Brenda, no guts no glory.  So I walked in, the dorm mother, Miss Jefferson [ph.], looked on her list and said, "I'm sorry I don't see a Brenda Singletary here."  Well she wasn't supposed to see one 'cause I wasn't on the list.  And I said, "I came all the way from Detroit [Michigan]," and she says, "There is only one room here, and the window's broken."  It was like zero temperature.  It was a ice storm, snow storm, ice storm, and so they put me in that room and I slept with my coat on for about two days before the campus opened, but that third night, God it was so cold in there, there were two girls who let me sleep on their floor with my mattress, two girls I know now, some of my closest friends even to this day.
Speaker 2: Who were they?
Speaker 1: Pat Mollett [ph.] and Valisa Moore [ph.].  Our rooms are like the two beds that come out the side of the wall and then you have the window as you go all the way in, and in between you just have this little space, enough for a mattress to, that's what we had.  And then there was the door, so there was no room, so they were being very charitable to me.  So I slept on the floor until the campus opened up. And then I knew I had no choice, I had to go to the president's office, which I did, President Threatt [Robert Threatt] office, and confess what I had done, because they had no records. I was--don't have financial aid, I don't have anything.  So I went this office and I said, you know, I'm Brenda Singletary and I told him my story, what I did and I said, "If I can't go to school here, I won't go to school anywhere else."  And I thought that was very noble of me to say this.  Well he looked at me very sternly.  He says, "Don't give me that, don't you know I get all kinds of stuff from students, don't pull this stuff on me.  I'm gonna send you right back home," and I started to cry, and you know.  And then he says, "Well, I tell you what, I'll let you go to school for at least, let you sign up for classes for at least a couple of weeks to see if your financial aid kicks in.  Your financial aid kicks in then you can stay, if it doesn't, I'm sending you home."  So he did, he let me sign up for some classes, and so two weeks went by, my financial aid hadn't kicked in, so I went by his office, he gave me one more week.  By that time my financial aid kicked in and I was officially a student at Morris Brown College.  My mother didn't know that story until I was an adult.  I mean like really old.  I think I was in my like early forties, when I finally told her that story, but that's how got there.  I just really wanted to be here, and here in Atlanta [Georgia], and I wanted that experience at the AU Center [Atlanta University Center; Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] and I'm so glad that I did come.
Story_ID: 371277
Speaker 1: Well tell me about your classes at Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Was your art classes what you expected?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, they were more of what I expected because Morris Brown had more art education courses, but you had the facilities of the entire AU Center [Atlanta University Center; Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia].  I told a lot of my art, you know, actually art classes were painting and drawing.  They were on other campuses, like at Spelman's [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] campus, or at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] campus, is where I took my print making.  Had some wonderful professors, [HistoryMaker] Lee Ransaw, he got there the same time I got there in '73, so we got there together and he is very much a wonderful artist and we've done projects and Lev Mills was in printmaking over at Clark.  He's a wonderful printmaker and he's over at Spelman now.  So these teachers are still very active and still teaching.  So, yeah, it's just been a wonderful experience, exactly what I wanted.
Speaker 1: So at this point, the artwork that you are doing, is it more political as you, as you wanted it to be (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean were you able to express yourself politically, I guess is what my question should be.
Speaker 2: Yes. I was able to express myself how I wanted, how I felt, because we had freedom.  We just had complete freedom.  Of course, some classes are structured, but when it came to printmaking, we could do our own designs.  When it came to sculpture, you know, we were given like a piece of wood and do what we can from it.  We had that complete freedom, whatever we could conceive it, you know.  We talked to our professor of course.  We could do it.

Speaker 1: Well what were some of your early pieces about?
Speaker 2: Ceramic courses.  I really got into ceramics so I did a lot of ceramic work.  I did a lot of textiles.  I really got into that because I've never been exposed to those before.  I did a lot of working with rugs.  I actually would hand make rugs and look for the rights kinds of materials to make them interesting, and--the ceramics classes, I was making these wonderful hand, hand-made creations, not all what your obvious ceramic pieces look like, but some sculpture and some really wonderful three dimensional pieces that I just wasn't able to do before, you know.  I never had that opportunity before.  The sculpture classes were all new to me.  I'd never done any sculpture before so that was really incredible for me.  But what I was really at home with just the plain painting and drawing is really what I sort of went into and really enjoyed the most.
Speaker 1: And, okay.  In your paintings, what materials did you use for your paint?
Speaker 2: Well, I used acrylic, I used oils and I sort of gravitated to a material that a lot of people were using it, around me at the time, were pastels, and I love pastels.  They're so immediate.  Pastels are sort of a dried pigment, sort of chalk like, and once you do your design on paper, you spray it with a fixative and it seals it.  They're really called pastel paintings and they are ready to go immediately.  You frame them immediately and I really loved it because when I was at home or traveling, I could just take out my pastels and I could use them and spray them, put 'em in my case and I didn't have to worry about paints and water and oils and messy and can't paint in the hotel room 'cause it's too much of a mess, or, 'cause I like to paint pretty large, and I'm not the neatest worker, so I like to feel that freedom when I'm working.  I don't like to feel like I'm messing up someone's room or, so it was wonderful to travel with.  So I became very committed to that medium, pastels.
Speaker 1: So when did you have your first, not, well we know about your first art exhibit at sixteen, but when did you first present a piece that actually was presented to the public?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  That was--oh, well, well when I was in college at Oakland University [Rochester, Michigan], the black students' association, we had visitors to come to our school like [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni and just a number of different people would come and I remember painting this huge banner with all the African American leaders, including Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], there was a lot of civil rights leaders and it was just a collage of different faces.  And, it was really good.  It was so good it was stolen, it was stolen, and so, that was probably one of the first pieces, yeah.
Speaker 1: So now at Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia], you're working in pastels, tell me about, can you remember your first piece that you did in pastels?
Speaker 2: Oh, God.  Well we worked in pastels in high school [Charles F. Kettering Senior High School, Detroit, Michigan], but I wasn't really keen on it.  I really didn't know how to manipulate the medium very well, didn't know techniques or anything.  That was my first experience so it wasn't really good.  Not until I got to Morris Brown College did I feel, you know, felt a connection with it.  I learned how to use them properly.  That way I could make it do what I needed it to do, manipulate it in the way that I was trying to express myself.  I knew how to do it.  Before I didn't know what I was doing, didn't know how to express myself with it.  So the more I worked with it, the better I got at it, and I just, again, the immediacy of it.  I fell in love with that.  It was instant gratification.
Story_ID: 371279
Speaker 1: Well, tell me when you first started and you had your artwork, you were your best advocate and started going to different art galleries to show your work.  Is that, am I right about that?
Speaker 2: When I was in college [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't show my work at all in college.  In college it was just going to classes and doing the work that was required, and no, in fact, when I was in college I really wasn't working for any particular ends to a means.  I still was not clear on what I was gonna do.  In fact, my curriculum was art education, the very thing I was fighting against was truly my curriculum.  But I felt by being in Atlanta [Georgia] away from, you know, that, "Brenda [HistoryMaker Brenda Singletary] you should do this" environment, which I love them, I love them, but, I felt that I could choose my curriculum, change it at any time if I needed to or wanted to, that I could still become a professional artist if I wanted to because there was no one telling me I couldn't, you know.  And I really needed to be in that environment, encouraging environment, and the AU Center [Atlanta University Center; Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] gave me that because a lot of these professors were encouraging us to do more and do this and, where I had not had that before.  But at the time I was there I was still not very confident about my work.  I was never to that point.  Still, like I said, very unclear what direction I was gonna take with my art.  There were a lot of people who were so much more talented than I was, so I'm not really sure I could be a professional artist.
Story_ID: 371280
Speaker 1: My third year, I did the unspeakable, I left, I left Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia] and I talked about that in one of my classes a few months ago that there's no reason for leaving there was just some reason, I couldn't go back to class and I can't even explain it now.  But for some reason I just couldn't walk on campus for some reason, and my boyfriend at the time, he was trying to, "Brenda [HistoryMaker Brenda Singletary], go back, we got to get back to school, you--."  I just, once I got off campus, I just couldn't.  The sound, I one, I remember one time being in class and just the chalk on the board, just the sound of it, not squeaky, just of the sound of the professor writing on it, I just couldn't take it and I just knew, I just couldn't come back.  I don't know what it was.  So I remember going to the campus clergy.  I can't remember who it was at the time and I explained to her what my situation was, I wanna be here and it broke my heart to not be able to go to class, but I just mentally, physically, could not be in class.  I don't know what happened.  I really don't.  I wasn't having a nervous breakdown I don't think, I just couldn't go to class, I just couldn't go to class, and I knew that if I didn't go to class I couldn't graduate, but I couldn't go to class.  So talking it over with the clergy, I was explaining how I felt.  She put me in my very first transcendental meditation thing, but it worked.  I mean it was really good.  I remember leaving feeling as though weight had been lifted off me and she said, "I don't think you should go back to class," and she said, "I'm gonna contact all your professors," and, obviously, I hope she did because I never stepped foot on Morris Brown's campus for at least another thirty years.  Different projects would bring me back there but not in the classroom, not as a student, so that was really strange.
Story_ID: 371281
Speaker 1: So when I left Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia] I really didn't know what to do other than look for a job, start looking for work and I took odd jobs here and there, didn't want to go back to Detroit [Michigan] because, you know, during that time, it was a recession going on.  In Detroit, the car industry was doing terrible so I didn't want to go back there.  So I just, hey, I hung out with my boyfriend.  I moved in with him.  It was the '70s [1970s] thing to do, and I just worked on my art and stuff, and I got this, I got the urge to actually get out and work.  I don't know where it came from, but I did.  And whenever I'm looking for a job I go to the yellow pages, and I got to the Ts, to television, and I called WSB [WSB-TV, Atlanta, Georgia], Channel 2, they had a television and radio station, and I had gone on so many interviews at that time because I had gotten up to the Ts.  You know, you get an invitation to be interviewed and, I guess I'd gone to so many job interviews, I didn't really care what I wore.  I wore a white blouse and a cotton skirt.  And Phil Roebuck [ph.] was the personnel director at the time, and he interviewed me, and I said, "I don't know anything about television, but I'm smart."  I said, "I can learn."  I said, "I can answer the phones."  I said, "I can get people coffee, I can do whatever you need me to do."  And he seemed impressed and he hired me on the spot.  And I began working in radio news and the title was radio news, general and all, and I gave sports scores out when people called.  I screened calls for the reporters.  I pulled news off the wire that I thought was important, that the reporter should see and, you know, monitor the teletype machine, and I did that kind of thing.  And I got a chance to work around a lot of reporters and I saw what they did and it was very interesting and I found out what everybody else did and that was very interesting, and I enjoyed what everybody did and I enjoyed the environment, you know, especially on the weekends.  It was very, you know, nice skeleton crew, everybody was laid back, no stress, you know, it was really nice.  I kind of liked it.  So I worked there at Channel 2 doing various things.  I worked the front desk.  I worked the switchboard.  I gave tours.  There were people that would come through Channel 2 for to, a lot of social groups and organizations.  Channel 2 is one of the oldest television stations in the southeast so it has a lot of history.  So I enjoyed that.
Story_ID: 371282
Speaker 1: And then a girlfriend [Cheryl Baldwin (ph.)] of mine was the secretary of, of, for Dr. Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy] and one day I was hanging out with her at the church [West Hunter Street Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] and she was telling me about this CETA [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act] program, and I said, "Oh, you got a CETA program?"  She said, "Yeah, it's at, it's at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]," and so, she said, "They'll pay you to go to school."  I said, "Hey, well that's my thing."  It was a business program, so there were three classes.  It was in the evening.  So I was doing that and I was working at Channel 2 [WSB-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] on the weekends.  This is a part-time job, Channel 2.  So the internship was part of the program and on the board was community affairs director, Ben Perry [Benjamin Perry], for Channel 11, WXIA [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia], so he pulled me as his intern because I had experience working in broadcasting.  I was working at Channel 2.  Well Channel 2 and Channel 11 are right next door to each other, so it was really great.  I was there during the weekdays and I was at Channel 2 on the weekends.  Well see I didn't know that you weren't supposed to be working at different stations, you know, that you, you weren't supposed to do that.  You're not supposed to work at a rival station at the same time.  I didn't know that, you know, ignorance can be bliss I guess, because I learned so much.  So I was doing my internship over there at Channel 11 and they put me in news and I was going around with the reporters and was learning how the cameramen operated and how a crew works together and how to shoot film.  At that time we were using film and video was also being used by news, but they were still using film, believe it or not, while I was there.  And it was just really exhilarating and I was put with a reporter, Maynard Eaton and he was a great reporter and he was best at the standups.  He could do a standup in a dime, just get in front of the camera and talk about the story, just like that.  I've never seen anyone since like him.
Speaker 2: And he's Maynard Easton.  Could you spell his last name?
Speaker 1: E-A-S-T-O-N [sic.], Eaton, Eaton, Eaton, yeah that's his name I think, yeah.
Story_ID: 371283
Speaker 1: Did you know Monica Kaufman [HistoryMaker Monica Pearson]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew Monica.  Monica lived across the street from me when I was working Channel 2 [WSB-TV, Atlanta, Georgia], yeah, so yeah, I know Monica.
Speaker 1: Any stories to share?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).  Not that she would like.  No, really, great stories.  I remember we had a party, you know, Christmastime they'd have these parties in the studio and, you know, it was exciting for me because I'd never met everybody before and it was this really great Christmas party and I got a chance to meet Monica.  Little did I know that later on I would be living across the street from her, and she had gotten married and bought a house that she had renovated and I was living in one of the houses in her neighborhood, not one of the big houses, but it was a guest house that I was renting out, that I was living in, and it was right across the street from me on Boulevard, (unclear), and so yeah, she drove the sporty, I mean we weren't like bosom buddy friends, but I just admired her from afar, you know.  She was just so accomplished the time that she came to Channel 2, it's just really big news because I think she came from Kentucky and I think this is most as an anchor that anyone had ever been paid in Atlanta [Georgia] that was African American.  So it was really a big deal just, you know, being at the station that had Monica Kaufman at the time.  So that excitement was going on and just me working in a newsroom was exciting because that was, I never imagined myself even doing this kind of work but I really loved it.  And working with the internship at Channel 11 [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia], learning the news business was exciting, but I didn't really care for the on-camera work, and all the work at that time when I was younger was camera work and that's what they were looking for at the time, after the Civil Rights Movement, after the '70s [1970s] in the, in the late '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s], you know, all that work began to pay off.  People wanted to see us on camera, so they were looking for African Americans to put on camera, you know, at the time.  There were some people who were on camera, let me see, [HistoryMaker] Billye Aaron, [HistoryMaker] Hank Aaron's wife, she had a talk show ['Today in Georgia'] at the time.  I'm trying to think of some of the people who were on camera who were African American that I can remember.  Ken Cook was there at the time, and I think, [HistoryMaker] Xernona Clayton, I think was still, was doing stuff then.  Of course she was, but I remember her doing specific--I think she was still at TBS [Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia] then, I remember, but she was doing some things, special things then.
Story_ID: 371284
Speaker 1: I didn't envision myself in that profession, but I was intrigued by it.  I wanted to learn as much as I possibly could, so I did.  I was the first one there and the last one to leave on my shift, you know, and anything they wanted me to do, I'd do.  I messed up a lot, made a lot of mistakes, but they seemed to be forgiving because I went and got coffee and ran errands (laughter).  So I did that for about, the intern program lasted for three months and then I became a paid intern, and then that's when I was invited to work in community affairs, and that's what I loved, working in community affairs.  And at the time Deidre McDonald was at Channel 11 [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] then, and a lot of people had just come on board, [HistoryMaker] Roz Abrams, who's now in New York [New York], was there then.  Joe Washington, who's now at CNN, just came, he was a baby then.  He was like twenty-one or twenty-two when he got there and he was promised to, to do many things there.  And just a lot of people came through there.  And Ben Perry [Benjamin Perry] was responsible for getting a lot of African Americans into television in this city.  So it was exciting time just to be in that, in that arena, you know.  And I was still doing grunt work and enjoying every minute of it, learning as much as I could.  But I enjoyed community affairs.  I worked with a lot of nonprofit organizations.  Part of the job of community affairs is the liaison between the community and the station, and I really loved doing that, learning to produce public service announcements.  Learning to produce public service programming.  It was exciting to me and I realize the power that community affairs had, that they could, they called the shots.  They could put on TV anyone they felt impacted the community in any way.  And that lead to just about anybody, from music to art, to news to politics, and I just loved the format of the public programs, the public service programs were moving.  They went out of the studio.  They shot interesting stories, and I really enjoyed that.
Story_ID: 371285
Speaker 1: Not in the '70s [1970s], it was different.  People didn't major in communications and broadcast journalism.  People didn't, you know, not us, because we weren't on, they weren't letting us on.  But now everybody's majoring in broadcast journalism and communications.
Speaker 2: Okay, so community affairs was what you really liked when you, tell me how did you break the connection or find out that you shouldn't be working for two stations at the same time?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Funny story.  Pruitt [John Pruitt] had just left Channel 2 [WSB-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] and came over to 11 [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Who was that?
Speaker 1: Pruitt, oh gosh.
Speaker 2: That's okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Pruitt, what's his first name, he's on Channel 2 now.  Is it Channel 2 or Chanel 11, Channel 2 now?  He was with Monica [HistoryMaker Monica Pearson] for years.
Speaker 2: You can't think of his name?
Speaker 1: Pruitt, Tim Pruitt [sic.], oh God, I'm gonna kill myself.  But anyway, one of the reporters, one of the anchors from Channel 2 was over at Channel, had just come over to Channel 11, and we were in the snack room, break room and everybody was pumping him for information because Channel 2 had just built this brand new news set and they were promoting it, you know, they were doing all of the promos for it and everybody wanted to know what they look like over there.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Hold on Denise [Denise Gines]. I'm sorry.  We started that whole thing over.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's good.  Tim, what's the guy's name?  What's Pruitt's, what's Pruitt's name?
Speaker 2: Wait a minute, is it Jim Pruitt?
Speaker 1: I think its Jim Pruitt but I don't even wanna use his name.  I'll just say an anchor.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Jesus Christ--
Story_ID: 371286
Speaker 1: Okay, so you are really enjoying working in community affairs, but tell me how did you find out that you should not be working at Channel 2 [WSB-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] and Channel 11 [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] at the same time?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was in the break room and a new anchor [John Pruitt] had just arrived at Channel 11 from Channel 2, and everybody was pumping him for information.  Well if you're leaving one station going to another, you're off the station for so many months before you go to a new station, so he didn't know what it looked like over there.  And so I was just thinking, well, I know what it looks like over there, but I was wondering should I say anything, you know, he's an anchor and I'm just a lowly intern, and so I just listened to the conversation, and then I said, well, it got more intense, so I said, "Well I know what it looks like over there."  They said, "Well how do you know?"  And I said "'Cause I work over there."  They said, "What, you what, you work over there?"  I said, "Yeah."  "And you work over here?"  I said, "Yeah, but I'm an intern over here."  And then, of course, news traveled upstairs to our station manager, and before Ben Perry [Benjamin Perry] could even intercede for me, station manager heard about it and called Ben Perry into his office.  "I hear you got an intern that's working over at Channel 2."  And so then Ben Perry called me to his office, said, "Look you gotta go to the general manager's office," which I did.  Went to the general manager's office, Jeff Daverson, Davidson [Jeffrey B. Davidson] was his name, I believe, and he said, "You're gonna have to make up your mind what station you wanna work at.  Do you wanna work here or do you wanna there?"  I said, "I wanna work here," 'cause they were training me.  So I wrote a letter of resignation and that was my last time working at Channel 2, and I started working at Channel 11.
Story_ID: 371287
Speaker 1: One thing lead to another and before my internship was over [at WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] there was word through Deidre McDonald, who was in community affairs, she had gotten a call from a station [WTVC-TV] in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  They were looking for a community affairs director.  I mean everything just happened so fast.  So she asked me, would I would be interested in the job.  And I said, "I don't know if I can do it, I've only been in broadcasting for like a year and half, maybe two years," and she said, "I think you can do it."  I was very nervous about it.  Before I knew it, I was in Chattanooga.  So I was working there as news, no public affairs director, was my title.  And I enjoyed it.  My job was to create and produce six public affairs programs and to host one of them, and I didn't like the on-camera stuff, but I loved producing.  I realized I really loved putting the pieces together.  I loved working in community affairs.  I loved the relationships that we're responsible for building with the community in terms of supporting their good efforts in helping people receive medicine or health issues or education or--all their issues are, are issues that everyone should know about and that's what the television station does.  That's what community affairs does: let people know services that are available to them, a friend to the community by supporting the things that these nonprofit organizations do, so I loved the contact with the nonprofits.  I loved events that we did.  We did telethons for Easterseals.  We did all kinds of events and I loved producing those things and a lot of times they were a little over my head, but somehow we got through it.  I had a lot to learn and because I didn't have any formal training in communications, everything I learned was on the job, so I was very intimidated at first, but I got a lot of help and support, had a lot of mentors that really helped me, so that just seemed to work without effort.  It seems as though one job would lead to another and one opportunity would lead to another opportunity.  And when I was in Chattanooga, I was meeting a lot of people from Atlanta [Georgia] doing various interviews and things and there were telling me about the things that were happening here, about Ted Turner getting ready to start a new news operation, and everybody was laughing.  Everybody, I remember everybody at our station laughed about it.  Who's gonna watch news 24/7?  I remember that, but I liked knowing that I was at the very beginning at the--even the concept of that.  People were talking and doubting.
Story_ID: 371288
Speaker 1: But at the station [WTVC-TV, Chattanooga, Tennessee] I did some really interesting things.  The Reverend Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] came to town.  He was involved in the PUSH Excel program and came to talk to some high school students there.  And I covered it.  It wasn't a great interview but I covered it.  He actually walked out on my interview, but I covered it.
Speaker 2: He walked out?  Why (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  He was talking about the PUSH Excel program and I was, you know, he has a wonderful way of wording things.  He had just, he can word things without really answering the question and he was being a little evasive and I was asking him a question and my question was when students are exposed to this program, they're involved with this program, they go off to college, is there any follow-up on these students?  Are there any tutor programs or mentor programs to get into a college setting?  What will you do to ensure that they'll be able to continue their pace of education will be able to survive the college experience?  And he wouldn't really answer my question.  He danced around it, and then finally I said, "Well Reverend Jackson, if you're not going to answer my question, let me know and I'll go on to the next."  And then he got up, and then he left.  You can't do, you can't run this.  But it was, I said now I'm really, this is real, I'm really a serious interviewer, but when they, when they refused to answer questions, I politely pushed it and I didn't do it in a way that was insulting, but at the same time, I really need to get an answer and he was just a little evasive and I just said well, you know, I'll move on if you want me to, but you got to let me know if you're not going to answer my question, yeah, I'll move on, but, you know, he didn't like that very much.
Story_ID: 371289
Speaker 1: So, and then, we had Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] activity in Chattanooga [Tennessee].  There were only two people in the city of color who could cover it.  There was another gentleman from another station, and then I was there, you know, to cover it.  It was just an interesting time to be in broadcasting at the beginning where a lot of African Americans were just being able, you know, just being able to be a part of it, or able to participate and be a part of it.  It was just--
Speaker 2: What was this Klan rally like?  I mean you covered it. What, what kind (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They were marching downtown Chattanooga, and I remember the other reporter getting his car scratched.  And my station was right downtown so I didn't have that problem, but, you know, everybody knew you because you were the only two people on camera that were African American, so wherever I went Chattanooga people knew who I was even though I didn't stay there very long.  Just the time that I was there, I was doing public service announcements and, you know, I'd do a program, and it just became news because there weren't any black people on television at the time.
Speaker 2: What year did you go to Chattanooga?
Speaker 1: I think that was in '80 [1980], I think that was in '80 [1980].
Speaker 2: And you stayed there [WTVC-TV, Chattanooga, Tennessee] for two years?
Speaker 1: No, no, I think I stayed there a year.
Speaker 2: Oh, just one year?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  Yeah, it, Chattanooga was a great place to learn, but I missed Atlanta [Georgia].  Every weekend I was going to Atlanta, you know, so.
Speaker 2: So what years did you work at WSB [WSB-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] and WXIA [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978], and I stayed there, I stayed there a year and a half.  Then I went to Channel 11 [WXIA-TV].  I stayed there like a year and a half, counting the internship.
Story_ID: 371290
Speaker 1: And then I did a lot of jobs in between broadcasting.  I worked as a private investigator once.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: How did that come about?
Speaker 1: I was in between broadcasting jobs.  That's when I came back to Atlanta [Georgia] and I really missed the city and I really wanted to be back in the city, and I really felt I had a good chance working in a smaller market, I might be able to get a job, you know, back in Atlanta as a community affairs director, but there aren't very many positions as community affairs director, so I had to wait for it to come up.  So I would do other jobs in between, and so there was an ad in the paper for a security operative.  I didn't know what that meant, so I went for the interview and they told me what it was, asked me had I ever been bonded before.  I didn't know what that entailed and what that was about.  So they bonded me and I started working.  They trained me, a little training and I started working and one of the first places, I can't name the name of the bank, but one of them was a very major bank here in the city, and I worked there and my job was just to ascertain who was stealing, who would use profanity, just all kinds of nothingness.  In the news, I mean in the mail room, if any stamps, if anyone were taking stamps, or if you had lunch, was there anybody getting high on the job, or lunchtime were people getting high in their cars?  Was there anybody there selling reefer?  And I think they had suspected there was someone there selling drugs, selling reefer and other things.  Productivity, what affects it?  If a supervisor has a favorite.  All these kinds of things that are not supposed to happen.  If they do, you're supposed to report it because it will determine whether someone gets a raise or not, will determine, you know, whether you get fired or not, if you're doing things, and people should know that they have security people in every corporate situation doing what I was doing.  So be careful what you do at work.  And my job was to write reports of my daily activities, what people said to me and what I, what was going on around me, and I did that for a while until a really bad situation came up.  It was pretty dangerous and my cover was blown and I was there in the bank and people knew who I was, and I remember going into the elevator.  The job was downtown and was on the elevator and I was going up and a lot of people were there, you know, we're talking about the traffic coming into the city and they talk about it every morning, you know, same group of people are usually going up that elevator at the same time.  And they were silent that morning.  They were just silent that morning.  Nobody was talking much, like somebody come in talking and then they'd shut up, you know, and then I, it was strange and then when I got up on my floor and went to my desk, I got a phone call, it was from my company telling me to get out of there.  My cover was blown.  Leave my purse, it could be a dangerous situation, and as I was getting on the elevator, they were carrying someone out in handcuffs.  It wasn't anything from what I was doing.  It was another operative working and they had busted one of the supervisors there for stealing funds, and as he was going off the elevator, because he was a supervisor, he knew who I was, so he was going off screaming, "You don't know who's working with you, that [HistoryMaker] Brenda Singletary, you don't know her."  So my cover was blown, so that was (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How did they find out who you were (laughter)?  Did you ever find out why?
Speaker 1: The supervisor, he was the only person there who knew who I was.  No one else knew.  And because he was busted he thought I had done it, but I hadn't.  Someone else was working on his case.  He was embezzling funds from the company, and he was under investigation for a long time.  Just so happens that he had got a link that they were going to come and arrest him, so he start putting out the word like a day before, so when I got on the elevator, people kind of knew and I didn't know.  They were kind of talking about it, and they kind of knew and I didn't know.  And when I got off the elevator he was coming out in handcuffs.  I said ooh, and then when he said that, then I knew my cover was blown.  I didn't need the phone call, I knew my cover was blown.  So I said let me get out of there, but I went back and got my purse and then I (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Why did they tell you to leave your purse?
Speaker 1: Because it's a, could be a dangerous situation if someone knows that you snitched, and your job that's basically what it was.  I wrote on everyone that I was important, you know, and if people find out about it, you could be in danger, you know, because there were a few operatives that did get hurt.
Speaker 2: Did you go, did you get another assignment?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) No, I said enough of the spy business.  I think I want to do something else.
Story_ID: 371291
Speaker 1: Were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So--
Speaker 1: --doing your art work during this time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was doing my art work during that time, but I was not selling art work or anything like that.  My professional career had not started yet.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So I got another job.  I was hanging out again with my, the church is a good place, Dr. Abernathy's church [West Hunter Street Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia], at the West End [Atlanta, Georgia].  My girlfriend was his [Ralph Abernathy] secretary, and I was just hanging out with her that day.
Speaker 1: What is her name?
Speaker 2: Cheryl Baldwin [ph.].  Cheryl Baldwin is her name.  She's still here in Atlanta [Georgia].  And there was an organ tuner that came in and he tuned the pipe organ that belonged in the church and he asked if anyone knew the piano, the keyboard.  Well see those music lessons came in handy.  Thank you mom [Mattie Hicks Singletary].  And so he asked if I could go hold keys while he goes up and adjust the pipes to tune the organ.  So I told him I knew the keyboard, so I assisted him while he was adjusting the pipes and tuning the organ.  I would hit keys he would tell me to and afterwards he says, "Do you have a job?"  And I said, "No, I'm in between jobs right now."  And so he hired me and we, we tuned pipe organs all over, you know, Georgia.  It was the most interesting job I ever had.  We, we went to all kinds, we went to Savannah [Georgia], those historical churches with the pipe organs and we just went all over and he was sort of in demand because there was not a lot of people in Georgia that did that kind of work.  He repaired organs and parts that need to be repaired.  He taught me how to do them and I would re-leather organ parts.  You know a lot of the organ parts are leather inside, has to be replaced because it'll rot out.  I learned how to do that and just all kinds of things, and I worked with him for, you know, for a long time.
Story_ID: 371292
Speaker 1: Until I got a call from Channel 11 [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] saying that they got a call from Channel 46 [WGCL-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] and they were looking for a news and public affairs director, and I said, "News, no, public affairs, yes."  And they said, "Well go to the interview and, you know, please go because we recommended you," and Deidre McDonald had called me and told me about the job and I felt, you know, a responsibility to go, but I knew I didn't want the job.  I really didn't want to get back into television at that time.  I had sort of given up on that and wanted to do other things, and so I went to the interview, very nonchalant.  In fact, I started interviewing the general manager, "What did you do before you became general manager, were you in sales?"  "Yes, I was in--" that kind of thing.  I really didn't think I wanted it because it was news.  If it was public affairs, yes, but it was a combined job.  So he told me my duties would be doing the news every morning and producing usually at the average of six public affairs programs, and I loved that idea, but I didn't want to do news every morning.  I hadn't had any anchoring experience.  They were just gonna throw me out there, and I said, "Well could you send me--" you know, they had like an anchor camp in those days where they would send people who were transcending from the, you know, the bowels of radio and coming up into television, they'd send you to some type of camp where they would sort of train you.  They wouldn't even do that with me.  I said, "I don't think I really want this job."  So they introduced me to the person that I was replacing.  She was getting married to one of the engineers at the station, and she was telling me how the job was.  She had no experience when she had the job and she did news every day and I said, "That's nice, I don't think I really want to do it, so."  She said, "You can do this, you know, think about," and she gave me the heave-ho talk about you can do it, you know.  Fear is growth, you know, anything you're afraid of, you know, blah.  She was right but I hated she was right, but it was an opportunity she said and you'd be crazy not to take it.  And I reluctantly took the job, but on the condition that they be looking for someone else to replace me because I really didn't want to do news.  So my job at Channel 46 was news and public affairs director and that was a, just a whole 'nother, it was a whole 'nother meaningful situation for me.  I, I learned so much.  It changed my life.  Working in that capacity, it made me know exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, and that was public service.  I wanted to work in the nonprofit sector.  I knew that, and whatever I did would be a part of that, would include that, but in the meantime, I had news every morning, and, at the time, Channel 46 was owned by Tribune Broadcasting [Tribune Broadcasting Company, LLC].  It was not a large company, broadcasting company as it is now.  The news person did everything.  I'd run it in the morning.  I'd pull the story.  I'd write the story.  I put it on the tele- right, print it up for the teleprompter, put it on the teleprompter, find my slides, you know, for my supers, you know, I did all of that.  It just, it was learning a lot, a lot fast.  And I was at the station early and I was, I don't why I didn't just pack my clothes and just move in.  Seriously, I was there all the time and when I wasn't there on the week days, I was catching up on paperwork on the weekends.  It was a very demanding job.  But I loved it, and like I said, I learned a lot.
Story_ID: 371293
Speaker 1: But I really would still be a bundle of nerves every morning for news.  We would have these department head meetings.  I believe they were on Tuesdays or Thursdays, I can't remember, but it would be right during the news, and we'd be at, it would be this large conference table and the general manager is at the head and all the department heads are sitting around.  And I'm always the last one running in because I do news and then I'd join them. (Cough) Excuse me.  And I would look at everybody as he goes around the room.  Everybody is giving the report on their department.  Everybody is just like, their lives depending on this.  Some were nervous, some were, you know, and I was looking at the fear in people's faces.  I said I don't belong here, you know, I really don't belong here.  This does not, is not that important to me to be, I don't feel like they do.  I don't, I don't have that much vested into this, and I almost felt it was unfair, and I would get so much mail in my office.  People who had their master's degree in communications and here I am doing this job and I had, I hadn't graduated from college [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I'm a college dropout, and I wasn't taking it as seriously as I felt I should, or, I didn't feel like they did.  Their lives depended on it.  I mean really, I saw people just shaking and, you know, I, when our station [WGCL-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] was bought by Tribune [Tribune Broadcasting Company, LLC].  We immediately got a vacation package and it was six months in, and it said six months, you can take a two-week vacation.  Well I left that meeting, I got into my car and I drove to the nearest travel agency, and I booked a cruise, and I said to myself, I really know now that I really don't belong here.  I thought that I could make something out of this where, create a niche where I could really stay, but I knew that I wasn't.  And I kept telling my supervisor, the programming director, that I'm leaving, I'm leaving, find someone to replace me.
Speaker 2: What year was this?  Was this '82 [1982] now?
Speaker 1: No, this was '84 [1984].
Speaker 2: Eighty-four [1984]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, this was '84 [1984].
Speaker 2: So you leave there, what do you do?
Speaker 1: Yeah, a year to the day, 'cause I was a corporate girl, I didn't want just, you know in those days when you start a job you don't want to leave, just leave, so I waited a year to the day I began.  A year to the day I brought my letter of resignation in.  And, I was out--
Story_ID: 371294
Speaker 1: And I had no idea what I was gonna do.  I didn't really care.  You know when you're young, you just don't think anything bad is gonna happen to you, and I just knew something else would turn up and I was just very confident that that's not what I wanna do, so when I left Channel 46 [WGCL-TV, Atlanta, Georgia], I just had a little nest egg and just enough to maybe get studio space.  I was looking for a studio space.  I really wanted to get back into art and then I started creating a line of women handbags.  I did a project with Stone Mountain bags, and that went really well, but you know, it wasn't quite what I wanted to do.  And then I started designing a line of jewelry, and I even got a spot at the Merchandise Mart [Atlanta, Georgia] and that went well for a while, but that still wasn't what I wanted to do.  I was still thinking commercial.  I was still thinking in the back of my head, art is not going to sell, I am not going to be able to make a living at this, so why not incorporate art in a project that is retail so you will.  That's truly what was in the back of my mind.  So out of sheer desperation, when the jewelry thing folded, because I needed to hire a lot of people just to get that going.  I was holding on to my little nest egg, and still looking around for a studio, but studio space was like 850, 900 [square feet].  I said well I could get a house.  So with my little nest egg, that's what I did, I bought a house with a two and a half car garage that had like a, a shop in the back of it, you know, like shop area, and that was my studio.  And I began to seriously work, and I remember going around to different galleries.  Everybody told me no.  I create this body of work and I'd call these galleries up and tell them what I have and I go back into the galleries and they said no, that's not what we were looking for, that's not what we want, and after months and months of rejection, I went to this one gallery, it was called Tritt Gallery [Decatur, Georgia].  Bill Tritt owned this gallery.  It was in Decatur [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Bill Tritt?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Tritt?
Speaker 1: T-R-I-T-T.
Story_ID: 371295
Speaker 1: So we were talking about, now it's about 1985, and you begin to do your artwork where you want to sell it and you haven't been successful selling your artwork and you go to the Bill Tritt Gallery [Tritt Gallery, Decatur, Georgia]
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bill was different.  He told me why he didn't like it.  He said he didn't like it, but he told me why he didn't like.  He told me that a lot of people come in now are looking for specific colors.  Interior designers come in, they look for specific colors.  He gave me a little color swatch.  He said if you can come back with some landscapes and floral designs with these colors, you know, then we can talk.  That was all I needed.  Oh, Lord.  I couldn't wait to get home, 'cause see I'm a very prolific artist.  I work very fast, so all he told me he needed landscapes with these colors in it in a floral design, oh, it's over, it's over for him 'cause he gonna write me a check.  So I went home and I started working and I did about twenty-five pieces and I went back in two weeks and he bought everything I did.  So then I understood, I was learning, I was understanding that if you're selling artwork you have to know that particular gallery to find out what trade that gallery sells to.  Now he was an interior design trade, or he worked with people who buy artwork for their homes.  There's different galleries that provide people with artwork for various reasons for various tastes and for various projects, and I was learning, I was learning.  I also learned that in Atlanta [Georgia], it was a very traditional market that they didn't have African American galleries, maybe one or two.  In fact, there was only one that I knew of, and other than galleries were buying very traditional kinds of art.  One was called Frames and Fine Art [Frames 'N Fine Art; Frames 'n Things].  Marian Langley ran that galleries for years.  She passed away a couple of years ago, but she was one of the first persons I went to, one of the first supporters of my work.  Another gallery was in the Highland [Virginia-Highland, Atlanta, Georgia] area.  I don't remember the name of that gallery, but I remember going there just seeing the artwork that was in that area.  God, I should know the name of that gallery, but it escapes me at the moment.  But I went there and I saw some fabulous work.  I saw a new artist at the time, William Tolliver for the first time in that gallery, and I remember being so impressed by his work, a number of artists that I had never seen before, new ones, but artists that I was familiar with.  And they were making a living with their art.  I'd never known that before, you know, so that was exciting for me, and it gave me a lot of encouragement, so once that gallery bought my work, I had a clue, these are the popular colors.  So I went to other galleries using the same color schemes.  My work started to sell.
Story_ID: 371296
Speaker 1: I started selling my work to galleries.  I didn't leave work on consignment.  I don't believe in leaving work on consignment, not to retail galleries, because retail galleries have to buy inventory, and a lot of artists would go in, you know, and take their work to the gallery owner, the gallery owner would look at the work and say, "Ah, that's interesting, let me see what I can do."  And they'll take it and put it in a bin or if it's framed, they'll put it behind something, because it's free inventory and there doesn't seem to be much respect for anything that's free.  But when I go into a gallery and I might sell a piece when I was first starting out, wholesale for fifty dollars apiece, they would frame it and they'd put it in the front window 'cause they invested fifty dollars in it.  So I said, okay, this is working for me, where other artists were participating in galleries that left work on consignment, I was only looking for galleries who would buy work and owned their collections.  That was the only way I could make a living at it.  I think that's where the term starving artist came from, where artists would take their work into an art gallery and wait until the gallery owner sells it for them.  You're waiting month after month, calling, did it sell yet?  Did it sell yet?  And in the meantime, you got to pay the rent.  You got to eat, you got to pay the electric bill, the gas bill, so I think that's one of the reasons that I couldn't find very many artists who were doing it.
Story_ID: 371297
Speaker 1: But it was just a period of time, I think in the '80s [1980s], it was so new and fresh.  There were a lot of us, we're getting these jobs now.  We were getting jobs in broadcasting, we were getting jobs in corporations.  We were actually making really good salaries.  We were middle class, so now for the first time we're able to, to afford to buy artwork, where when we were kids, we used to get that traditional trip to the museum where we'd look at art from afar on this pedestal, that it was something for other people to appreciate and have, and not us.  See now we can.  Now we actually can afford to buy it, support our own artists.  We can actually do that.  And I think that time was sort of like this period that everybody realized that and art became really hot, and I don't think I could do enough art.  Everything I did, I could sell it.  I had to hold back some things.  I would literally get in my car and drive from one gallery to the other in this city.  At one time I was in at least fifty-two galleries in the city alone.  Atlanta [Georgia] at that time had a lot of art galleries.  Then when I had covered the Atlanta market, I'd get in my car and I'd drive to Memphis [Tennessee], then to Nashville [Tennessee], I'd just make a circuit, and then I would just sell on the road and I did that for years.  I would just sell my artwork directly from my car sometimes, so that's how I sold my work.  And I had a whole territory of various galleries throughout the country.  One part of the year I'd go up north, another part of the year, I'd go down south.  I'd go to Florida.  I'd do that in the winter.  You know, I just had a little turf.  And one year for the National Black Arts Festival, I got an opportunity to show at the Woodruff Arts Center at the High Museum [High Museum of Art, Atlanta, Georgia] which was incredible for me because I really had not had my work out there, not to the important galleries, not to the fine arts galleries, just to retail galleries, and there's a difference.  Retail galleries are galleries that sell artwork that are really nice and pretty that go on your wall, or for your office.  It doesn't necessarily have to be investment art.  Fine arts galleries are museum art, art that is destined to be headed towards museums, maybe not now, but they're more academic kind of art, trained artists work for years to get the skills in order to create the kind of artwork that will grow and be part of history.  Well, that's where I wanted to be, but look I had an opportunity to show at the Woodruff Arts Center.  That was in that league, and for the first time, my art was getting recognition.  I got Remy Martin as my sponsor, and then Attorney General Thurbert Baker [HistoryMaker Thurbert Baker], he was a state representative at that time.
Speaker 2: What year was this?
Speaker 1: This was in '92 [1992], I believe, or '90 [1990], '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 371298
Speaker 1: And I realized then when I left Channel 46 [WGCL-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] that anything that I do with exhibiting artwork, an art show, a nonprofit organization has to be involved because I learned by being in television that if you're nonprofit, you get television coverage.  If you're nonprofit, then that organization supports you in what you do.  They will bring their people out to support you.  You have an automatic audience and all I have to do is donate part of the proceeds to that nonprofit organization which is a win, win, win situation for everybody.  Number one, I really feel so important that the work that I do gives back to the community.  That's really important to me.  I learned that by working in television.  I learned that primarily in public affairs because that's what public affairs did.  It worked with nonprofit organizations.  And I love that.  Then the nonprofit organization had that built-in audience, all those people there supporting that organization.  So they would come there with a mission, to buy my work to support the organization, so that's a win for me.  So, it just really worked well, and for coverage I could get newspaper coverage, I could get television coverage, just because I'm helping this nonprofit organization, just because I'm helping them.  I said, that is so wonderful.  And so I changed my title.  Instead of just being an artist, I'm a community service artist.  So I really liked that so every exhibit that I do, it is to benefit some nonprofit.  Now, I don't bring the newspapers or try to get coverage for everything that I do, because a lot of the fundraisers are in people's homes, because nonprofits, their whole goal is to raise money (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Money.
Speaker 1: --without spending a lot of money.  So because I was so prolific, I put together this huge show at the Woodruff Arts Center [Atlanta, Georgia], large paintings, and the community affairs director at the Woodruff Arts Center, David Manuel, he helped me get that show.  He was the, he worked in the facilities department at that time.  They had nothing to do with art, but they let me do the show.  So I brought in Remy Martin, they sponsored it and all these other sponsors came in and it was a huge show.  It was fabulous.  It was one of the largest events for the National Black Arts Festival that year.  Martin Luther King III was there.  I had never met him before, just a number of people came.  It was just very exciting for me.  This was my first really big art show, huge art show, so I really enjoyed that very much.  And then I had a direction with my art.
Story_ID: 371299
Speaker 1: So at this point, when you're doing this big show, because you're kind of known as an abstract artist, even though you do some other things.  Did you, when did you make that transition from doing landscapes, you know, where you said that the Bill Tritt Gallery [Tritt Gallery, Decatur, Georgia] and other galleries wanted you to do floral designs and landscapes, when did you make that transition to do some other things?
Speaker 2: Well I always did, you know, figurative things since I was a kid.  I remember drawing figurative things like my sister watching TV.  I'd get a sketch pad, draw her on the floor watching TV or my mom [Mattie Hicks Singletary] washing dishes.  I always did that but I realized that if I wanted to sell my artwork I had to diversify.  I can't just do what I like to do, but I like to do everything, but I can't just do figurative things, or I can't just do landscapes, or I can't just do floral designs in order to make a living.  And it was important that I make a living as an artist.  So I did something that a lot of artists find out that they have to do.  They have to learn to do different kinds of things, so I always did the figurative things, but my first professional things were landscapes and floral designs, not abstracts, because Atlanta [Georgia] at that time, all they were looking for were landscapes and magnolia trees and azaleas.  They were not into abstracts.  It was a very traditional market.
Speaker 1: What kind of artwork was in the big show at the Woodruff Arts Center [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was abstracts.  It was all abstracts (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I guess that's what I was trying to, it was all abstracts?
Speaker 2: It was mostly abstracts, but I had some figurative, I had some landscapes, but it was mostly an abstract show.  I really wanted to show my true love and my true direction, but before then, in order to have gotten to that point, the landscapes and floral designs was what I did.  In order to sell my abstracts, I had to get on a plane and go to New York City [New York, New York].  I'd set up my appointments and I'd fly in like at six o'clock in the morning, spend the whole date in New York, and then fly back at night because I couldn't afford a hotel.  That's what I'd do.  So I, I still did the abstracts, but they weren't really selling in Atlanta.  I'd have to go to California or, again, New York City, Chicago [Illinois], to sell abstracts because they just weren't into that at that point here.  So after that show at the Woodruff Arts Center, I started doing more and more nonprofit work because at that show at the Woodruff Arts Center I had newspaper coverage, Channel 5 [WAGA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] came out and covered me.  That's how I met Amanda Davis and all these other people who really supported me and my work.  And that was important because at that time there was no support for us. It was all so new to us, and it was like they didn't know we were there and then they discovered we were there.  And since they didn't know and they discovered us, they really gave us a lot of air time.  They really helped us and gave us a lot of attention.
Story_ID: 371300
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other artists that was in the area, in the Atlanta [Georgia] area during the time that you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was--at that time, Zachariah Anderson was an artist, doing really well in this area.  Oh gosh, there's so many.  You really catch me off guard now.  [HistoryMaker] Lee Ransaw, my professor, he was doing a lot, and still doing a lot of work in this area.  There was William Tolliver who had just come to this area at the time I did that art show.  There were a number of women artists who came.
Speaker 1: Do you know Margaret Warfield?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Margaret Warfield.
Speaker 1: What about Zelda Grant?
Speaker 2: You're taking the words right out of my mouth.  Zelda Grant, Selma Glass.  When they first started out, I had like little seminars at my house because they were new to the art business.  I think I was the only African American woman who was making at living at art at that time.  And I, I charged them a hundred dollars because I would sit and talk with them on the phone and, hours and hours on the phone, and the conversations would kind of go out the window.  They would make the mistakes.  I said, don't do that and they'd go ahead and do it, so I said I'm a charge these ladies a hundred dollars, and they were all women, a hundred dollars to come sit in my living room and I'd tell them everything I know about the art business, the galleries that buy work outright so you won't have to starve trying to hone in on your talents, and you know, all of this, so I charged them a hundred dollars apiece.  But they listened, they listened this time and they're all professional artists.  Not because I told them how to become professional artists, because they took it seriously and that was the first sign.  They were coming in paying a hundred dollars, and at that time that was a lot of money.  They were serious, but I had gallery owners to come in and talk to 'em.  I had people who made prints to come in and talk to them about how to get their prints made.  I had all kinds of artists' representatives to come in and in my house that day, and we, I told them they could come in in the morning and we'll stay until they felt like leaving.  So we were there until late and we provided lunches and people talked and we brainstormed and we came up with projects.  It was just great.  We only did it that one time and I always felt that we should do that again.  But out of that came some wonderful professional local artists.
Speaker 1: Do you remember Victoria's Fox [Decatur, Georgia], the art store (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Victoria Fox was one of the galleries that carried my work.  She was one of the first to really support me, her and, let me see, then it was Lucy [ph.] was in there and Lucy stayed there a long time.  I think that gallery closed, that gallery closed.
Speaker 1: Well, actually Lucy--
Speaker 2: Is still working out of her home?
Speaker 1: Yeah, she bought the gallery.
Speaker 2: I remember that, yeah.
Speaker 1: But it's closed now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of our African American galleries are closing, and why is that?  Why do people think they're closing, you know.
Speaker 1: What about other artists like [HistoryMaker] Howardena Pindell?  What do you--do you know their work?
Speaker 2: Pindell?  No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were a lot of artists.   That's the thing about an artist, unless you're in art shows with other artists, again, its very solitude.  You're focused on your career and sometimes I do shows to bring other artists in, like the show that I did.  At the same time that I did the show at the Woodruff Arts Center [Atlanta, Georgia], I had also had a show going on simultaneously at the state capitol [Georgia State Capitol, Atlanta, Georgia].  And I also had a show in midtown.  No it was in Buckhead [Atlanta, Georgia] at the TULA [TULA Art Center and Galleries, Atlanta, Georgia] area, we did one and I brought in other artists.  It was a show for Georgia artists.  But unless you do that, your whole world is consumed with how you gone do this, how you gone put together another show 'cause another show is how you're gonna eat, you know, so it's like all tunnel vision.  And it's very unfortunate, unless there's some kind of conference or there's some of program that brings us all together, or United Negro College Fund [UNCF] invites a group of artists whose work is exhibiting, or something like that, or they done one of their wonderful award programs, just for the arts, which they do. I wish more would do that, we don't get a chance to see each other, and every now and then we'll hear that somebody is doing something.  We'll give them a call, like Charlotte (unclear) Riley [ph.] got, got a fabulous (background noise)--
Story_ID: 371301
Speaker 1: So we were talking about the work that you don't get an opportunity to work with other artists, but you know [HistoryMaker] Kevin Cole?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah, we--'cause we, the way I met him is an art show.  I think it was for the DeKalb County's [DeKalb County, Georgia] art council [DeKalb Area Arts Council] and he had some work exhibited at that show and that's how I met him, but it left there something to bring and I had work in the show and there.  I very seldom get a chance to meet other artists and I'm trying to do more of that doing different projects, like right now I'm working on a show.  I want to put together a show, because we don't do very many visual art shows here in Atlanta [Georgia] anymore.  We've gotten away from it, but then a lot of our galleries have closed down so they don't get a chance to really sponsor us.
Story_ID: 371302
Speaker 1: As a black female artist, did you experience a lot of prejudice?
Speaker 2: That's why I sign my work B. Singletary. Have you noticed on any of my work, it's not signed [HistoryMaker] Brenda Singletary.  It's signed B. Singletary and the reason being is that a lot of gallery owners when I was going around selling my artwork, they didn't think a woman artist was serious, that she'd end up you know, having babies, getting married, this is a little hobby you know.  So I would sign my name B. Singletary so no one would know who I was.  A lot of times I'd go in as my rep and not be my artist, you know, just be a rep for this artist, you know, and her name is, is, I wouldn't even say who it was, it's B. Singletary.  I don't have, I don't know whether it's a man or a woman.  A lot of times people wouldn't buy your work if you were a woman, so yeah, we were treated differently.  That's one of the reasons I had seminars just for women because men would fight over things like billing, how their name is listed on a group show.  Women just want to show their work.  We don't care about that.  I mean we care, but we don't.  We want an opportunity to show our work.  Men would care about and argue over different kinds of things.  The ego we try to take out, and it was more important that our work be seen.  That was the most important thing.
Speaker 1: How different was displaying art for women?  Did you do a lot in New York [New York], I mean it's a different type of market.
Speaker 2: Oh, the market's different in New York.  In New York, you know, everyone is more accepting, you know.  If you're different that's better.  If you're a black woman, you know, from the South doing abstracts, that was cool, you know.  Atlanta [Georgia], it was just different.  So you have to just sort of create artwork for the areas that you market to.  So, if I'm going to California, I know exactly what to take there.  If I'm going to New York, yeah, abstract city.  You know, I even know what to take depending on where I'm going.  Not all work fit in the same place.  It's just like when an artist walks into a gallery, you can't take it personally when the gallery owner says, I'm sorry, that work is not right for our gallery.  Doesn't mean you're not talented, but it's not right for us, and not take the rejection personally because that gallery focuses on a particular group.  Every gallery does, has a target group.  So you have to understand what kind of work that gallery is carrying before you even approach the gallery, you know, so you can go in there, you know, ahead of the game.
Story_ID: 371303
Speaker 1: Is it important to you to know who is buying your work?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's very important to know who's buying my work.  My work goes to different entities.  There's corporate collectors, companies buy the work for their company collection.  Then you have people who collect on a personal basis.  Then you have interior designers who buy for the trade is work specifically for being placed in a corporate setting.  So it's good to know where your work is going.  It's good to know who's purchasing it, you know.  It helps you as an artist.  Anyone helps you to create but the best way to create is to be inspired and not to have restrictions or not to have to, I call it paint by numbers when someone gives you a commission, which is good sometimes, but I'm not really crazy about commission work.  Now when an interior designer, you know, approaches me about a project she's working on, she might give me the swatches, color swatches or the carpet or the marble or whatever, and she'll tell me, "I want an abstract using these colors.  I want it soft," or tell me the emotion she wants the piece to have.  That's cool.  I can do that, but I don't do portraits, you know.  It's just too much of a study, and then there's so much of an opinion, "It doesn't look like me, or "It doesn't look like my mother, it doesn't look," you know, that's not really where I am.  There are artists who vie for all kinds of jobs.  There are artists that are perfect for portrait work and there are artists that are good for corporate work.  Artists do different things and specialize in different things.  I just try to touch on a little bit of everything.  It keeps it interesting, you know.  If I do a portrait it's for my mother [Mattie Hicks Singletary], you know, she ain't gone criticize.  If it is, its kind, you know, I might paint my girlfriend or my sister, you know, because I want to, only because I want to.  Commission work is a little bit different.  You got to get into the feeling because they offer you money to do it, so that's good too, but there are a lot, a lot of work, commission pieces I turned down because I knew it wasn't right for me and I knew somebody else would do a better job, and I might refer that person to another artist or I just don't want to deal with it because I know it will be working outside of myself.
Story_ID: 371304
Speaker 1: Okay, so 1992, so what happens after the show at the Woodruff Arts Center [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Oh, everything started to fly.  This art agent from California was there.  He saw my work, in a month or two I was off to California. I had never been to California before.  Oh, I met a whole new audience there from, I went to Oakland [California], San Francisco [California] area, did a show there.  William Tolliver had a cousin there.  Did a show at his house.  And just, I met all of these wonderful gallery owners and so, I just had another part of the country that I had established a business connection with.  And then from there I went to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], stayed there for a few days.  A friend of mine who at the time, Vincent Bryson, he was, I think he was the president of the Magic Johnson Foundation.  We went to high school together and that was my first time in L.A.  I was there visiting, oh, artist there, on gosh, Wilson.
Speaker 1: Kathleen.
Speaker 2: Kathleen Wilson [Kathleen A. Wilson].  I was there visiting her and her studio.  Her studio showed me what a studio should look like.  She has a wonderful studio, and I had a cousin.  I went to visit my cousin.  One of the cousins is in the movie industry, television industry, and I was introduced to all these wonderful people, and so I had a reason now to go back home, create a portfolio and then fly back and sell it.  And I did that for five years.  Virtually just selling to the California market.  I'd come back to Atlanta [Georgia], create a portfolio, then I'd go out there and do these fabulous art shows.  People were just really into the arts.
Story_ID: 371305
Speaker 1: But then I got away from my direction.  I wanted to do things in nonprofit, so when I went back to Atlanta [Georgia], I was a member of a organization called 100 Black Women [National Coalition of 100 Black Women], and my group from Stone Mountain [Georgia], they would complain about my work was too expensive in the galleries, so I was getting ready to throw some work out.  Now a lot of artists destroy work.  We all destroy work, and I happened to have more work than most artists because I'm very prolific.  When I work I create on an average of ten pieces a day.  So I'm constantly eliminating pieces that aren't right for my galleries.  So I have what I call a B pile.  Most artists have it.  They call it different things, but I call it a B pile, where I'll store pieces that aren't right for my galleries or pieces that might have been slightly damaged because when I get on a plane, things get banged up a little bit.  So at the end of collecting pieces that are, you know, it's too much for me to contain, like under my beds and in closets and things like that, I would take these pieces, roll 'em up and put them in my garbage out front.  Well, you know the garbage pick-up is right out front, so my neighbors see the rolled up pieces in the garbage.  Well they know I'm an artist so they start going through my garbage.  I had groups of people going through my garbage, and I'm looking out the window and I'm looking at the people going through my garbage and I said well next year, I'll just burn them.
Story_ID: 371306
Speaker 1: I just have so much work that's stored up everywhere so I'd roll the work up and I'd put it in the garbage.  Well my neighbors they know I'm an artist, so they start gathering around the garbage can thinking that it's, of course, artwork.  And one neighbor would beckon another neighbor and I had a group of people, about four or five people around my garbage can pulling out artwork.  And I said, "Oh, gosh, next year I'll just burn those pieces."  So the following year I attended the Mayor's Masked Ball, and we came back and, to my house, it was about one or two o'clock in the morning.  We were sitting around in our ball gowns and like I said, it was about five of us, one was a gallery owner, one worked at a gallery and then there were just some, just smart people, and I said well this is really great.  I have my fireplace going, I'll just go get some of this work while we're sitting here sipping wine and I'll just throw it in the fireplace.  Well I started tearing up the pieces and throwing it in the fireplace and my guests were saying, "What are you doing?  What are you doing?"  I said well, and explained to 'em what I was doing.  And she said, "Don't burn that piece.  I want that piece."  And I said, "Well, I'm sorry but these are just pieces I want to--." "I'll give you seventy-five dollars not to burn it."  And I said, "Okay."  So she went got her wallet and wrote out a check and then as I continued to burn, somebody else said, "I'll give you a hundred dollars Brenda [HistoryMaker Brenda Singletary].  That's so big, I really want to, I can frame that one, that would look good over my, and I said well wow, maybe I got something going here."  So I was a member of 100 Black Women [National Coalition of 100 Black Women], and they were always complaining about, "Brenda your work's too expensive at the galleries, you know, we need to do something else, let's do something." So I remember calling the chapter president and I said, "Listen I'm getting ready to burn some artwork." I said, "I'm going to do it this Saturday, if any of your members wanna come over and catch some of the work before it hits the fire by bidding on it, you're welcome to do it."  And that was the only phone call that I made.  And there were over forty people that showed up.  And among the group was Amanda Davis was at my very first burning.  One of our local television personalities, an anchor.  And our attorney general, [HistoryMaker] Thurbert Baker, was there.  We had, [HistoryMaker] George Wallace was on his way to the airport.  He's a comedian and a friend of mine was driving him there.  They made a U-turn, he was the very first one there.  And it was just really a interesting evening.  I wanted to burn everything.  I think I end up burning maybe seven pieces out of eighty pieces and we raised over ten thousand dollars there in my living room.  I said wow, that's really great.  So I said okay, well I'll donate 25 percent to 100 Black Women.  Everybody was happy.  I said I'll do this again next year.  The following year, I didn't think much of it.  The following year Atlanta Magazine called me, said we heard about your burnings, that you're gonna do another burning, and they covered it.  They wrote an article about it.  So then, you know, everybody started calling me wanting to know about the burnings, and I did, the next one I did was for Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia].  They had a new art gallery and I told [HistoryMaker] Lee Ransaw, who was a wonderful artist and was the head of the art department there, he didn't even need to show up, just, you know, just gonna raise the money and we're just gonna shoot it to you.  And so we did.  And that went so well.  I said I got something going here.  I need to work on this a little bit more, fine tune it.  And so when that article came out, the senior vice president of CNN called me, Gail Evans, and she said, "I think this is just remarkable what you're doing.  Can, can my husband and I come?  Can we come to the next one?"  And I said sure.  They came, they bought and we raised another around ten thousand dollars, and then the word just got out, and, you know, AJC [Atlanta Journal-Constitution] wrote an article and nonprofits began to get in touch with me to do the art burnings, and I've been doing them now for about, about twelve years.  And I only do them for nonprofit organizations but it fits so well in what I wanted to do, work with nonprofit organizations.  So many nonprofit organizations have a hard time raising funds and finding unique ways to do it.  This way it doesn't cost them a lot of money.  We just have little hors d'oeuvres and finger food and invitations are done by the nonprofits, so all I do is come, bring the artwork and we just go, and the burning usually lasts about three hours.  People can get up, look at the pile of artwork, see artwork that they're interested in bidding on, put it in a pile next to the fireplace and we just keep rolling.  We just keep rolling until all the work is gone, or 'til the audience gets tired from bidding and then we just stop.
Story_ID: 371307
Speaker 1: I'm sure there are some people who think that burning art is a no-no.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Have you heard any negativity about that (Simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well first of all I don't care, it's my work.  I can do whatever I wanna do with it.  It's mine.  I created it, you know.  But, you know, in all defense, these are pieces that have been earmarked for destruction.  These are pieces that when I travel might get a little bent or smudged because when I travel with my artwork, it's paper and it's unframed, so it is for collectors.  You know when you go into an art gallery and you're buying serious art, it's better to buy your artwork unframed and then you decide on how much money you want to put in the framing.  But, in this case, it doesn't get to the galleries.  In this case, the audience becomes collectors.  They become the collectors and they can make the decision on what they want to purchase, but they only buy the paper pieces.
Speaker 1: But isn't this also an excellent way for people who are just starting to collect and maybe don't have a big budget to buy art, you know, from a gallery?
Speaker 2: Well yeah.  Because the pieces are what I call my B pile pieces, the pieces they start off as low as thirty-five dollars.  I do these little tiny originals and then they go for as much as fifteen hundred [dollars], but the pieces are, are mainly under thirty-five, under a hundred, under five hundred dollars.  I try to keep it that way so that everybody who comes who is supporting their nonprofit organization can afford to participate.  So if you come with fifty dollars, you can walk away with an original.
Speaker 1: That's great.  Okay.  So now, let me see, what year, you said you've been doing this for twelve years.  Do you remember the year of the first one?
Speaker 2: No, I sure don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Twelve years from today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 371308
Speaker 1: Now in--not sure what year it is, tell me about your participation with the White House Fellow panel [President's Commission on White House Fellows].
Speaker 2: Through Gail Evans, senior vice president, CNN, who responded to the Atlanta Magazine article when was the regional director for the judging panel and what that means is that she's responsible for gathering up community leaders to judge in this area from Chicago [Illinois] all the way down to the southern states.  And I think something like thirteen states, I'm not absolutely sure, but she's responsible for also making sure that people who are applying for the fellows have interviewing appointments here and it's a very rigorous interviewing process, and you're selecting the finalists who will go to Washington [D.C.] and out of all the finalists across the country, only, is it between eighteen to twenty-one fellows are selected each year.  And this is a program that is for young professionals who are outstanding, really outstanding at what they do, early in their careers.  They get an opportunity to go to Washington and work in the White House [Washington, D.C.] for a year is not for students.  The premise is to go to Washington, get this experience, come back home and share it with you community, so all kinds of people get involved in it.  We have teachers, we have lawyers, we have doctors, we have nurses.  We even had a farmer to apply.  All kinds of people from all walks of life.  You're very good at what you do.  Educational background is really important.  Community service is very important, but it's a combination of things and qualities that we look for in a fellow, and I served for two years.  And during that process I got an opportunity to create a piece or artwork for the fellows at one of their ceremonies to present to the president [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], and at this ceremony it is when all the fellows receive their official appointments, so they either work for the [U.S.] Department of Labor, the [U.S.] Department of Defense, and they work directly under the secretary of these departments, so it's just a wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: So tell me about the piece that you created for, for that time.
Speaker 2: Well, the director sort of gave me free reign and I wanted to illustrate the class that was being inducted that particular year so the class members were my models.  In fact, Sanjay Gupta, who is the senior medical correspondent for CNN, he's in that post.  He was a White House Fellow.  And I just had fun with it.  But it is the group of fellows and they are extended in the air and the American flag has flown them up to the heavens and there's stars and they're reaching for them.  So it's a wonderful piece.  I really enjoyed doing it.  And later on Georgia-Pacific volunteered to have the piece reproduced and the White House seal is on the piece, so that really did give it a wonderful selling point for the fellows because they use it to raise funds for the program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And it's hanging in the White House?
Speaker 2: The original is hanging in the White House, yes.
Story_ID: 371309
Speaker 1: So what happens after, or during the White House [Washington, D.C.], you know during that time.  What happens after that in life?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, the reception is really amazing.  In fact, you know, I had never been in the White House before.  I remember I was in Washington [D.C.] one time and we were right at the corner where everybody was getting ready to go in for tours and I was with a friend of mine and he said, "You wanna take a White House tour?"  And I said, "No.  I wanna wait until I'm a guest at the White House."  I was just kidding because we really didn't have time to go or I would have said yes.  But it really turned out that way.  It was a wonderful experience.  The program was wonderful.  All kinds of people were there.  All the secretaries of different departments were there to receive each fellow, [U.S.] Department of Labor, [U.S.] Department of Defense.  It was really wonderful, and they presented the artwork there.  After the ceremony, the fellows [White House Fellows] get right to work, and it's an amazing process.  They actually do the work, you know, of the country and they've been put in a very unique position to be able to do that.  And it lasts for one year but the, you know, the whole experience is just surreal.  They get to do so many interesting incredible things.  And the year after that, that was when the Bush [President George Walker Bush] administration came in because I got involved during the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] administration.  But the wonderful part about the fellows program, it doesn't matter who's in the White House.  It doesn't matter what party you belong to.  That program is consistent.  It is always there.
Story_ID: 371310
Speaker 1: And during the very beginning of the Bush [President George Walker Bush] administration, I was called to come back and I was invited to speak to the new class [of White House Fellows] about my experience in America as an African American artist.  Well I can tell you I was scared to death.  I had never, you know, first of all, I'm not really, I really don't like to be in the spotlight.  I don't like talking in front of groups and it was very terrifying.  In fact, a month before actually presenting myself there at that particular luncheon, you know, I couldn't rest, I couldn't sleep.  It was like a monkey on my back.  I couldn't do anything until this event was over.  And I didn't know what to expect, but it was very comforting.  When I got off the plane, you know you can't drive right up in front of the White House [Washington, D.C.], so one of the fellows was meeting me there.  He told me he was going to be wearing a bow-tie, so they told me what corner to be dropped off at, and so I was and there was a guy there standing at the corner with a bow-tie and he took me on in to the office and, and it was really a nervous and a really high pressure situation for me because I really didn't know what to expect.  I didn't know what they expected of me.  I'm an artist and I wasn't politically, you know, charged to, to really banter on about how my life is living in America, but they put me in a situation that was very comfortable.  First of all, there wasn't anything like what I expected.  We all got together.  There were about eighteen fellows.  We greeted each other, then we all walked out the door.  We walked down the street around the corner to this delicatessen where you buy food by the pound, and we chose what we wanted.  I picked an oriental salad.  It wasn't at all what I expected, but it relaxed me.  It wasn't, you know, this corporate, gritty, political--and we walked down the street, you know, two by two, and then we walked back into the White House building and then we sat there and then the meeting started.  Then it got very formal.  But how formal can you be when you got plastic container with food in it and you got a Coca-Cola bottle sitting here, and I'm saying this is so surreal.  I've got my painting that had never seen this behind me in their conference room, and, you know, I'm in the White House and I'm saying, this is just so surreal.  But the meeting was wonderful.  They would ask me questions and I would answer it.  It was more like conversation so it wasn't like I had to speak for two and half hours, but it was really wonderful and I had a great time.  Afterwards they just took me on a tour of the White House.  It was really wonderful.  And at the end I walked through the front door to the front, you know, where all the, the, you know, the gate is and people were standing out, you know, the tourists, and it was kind of neat when I walked out the door, you know they give you this little A thing when you walk out the door.  I thought maybe I could keep it as a souvenir, but you have to take it off and put it in a little box when you walk out and everybody was standing around me.  They said, "Who are you, who are you?  Did you meet with the president?"  And I said not today.  And they said, "Well what are you doing?"  'Cause one of the fellows handed me my portfolio.  And I said, "I'm an artist."  And they said, "Can we have your autograph?"  And I said, "Certainly."  (Laughter) So that was a thrill for me and then after that I just went right back to the airport and flew back to Atlanta [Georgia].
Story_ID: 371311
Speaker 1: So how was life after that [guest lecturer, President's Commission on White House Fellows] (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was, you know reality in my world is, it does not, it does not blow your head up, you know.  It really keeps you grounded because I had to get back and get ready for another burning, and that's kind of grueling because sometimes I actually now create pieces to destroy because sometimes I'm a little short, so, you know, and then I get back involved in the projects, many projects that I work on.
Speaker 1: Who are some of the other organizations that you have done burnings for?
Speaker 2: Oh, God, I can't think of any organizations, the organizations here in the city [Atlanta, Georgia] I think I've done one for just about everybody, United Negro College Fund [UNCF], NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], 100 Black Women [National Coalition of 100 Black Women], 100 Black Men [100 Black Men of America, Inc.], you just name the organization, the March of Dimes.  I did something for United Way [United Way Worldwide], you name the organization.  I've been pretty busy here in the city, and not just here in the city, I've done a lot of burnings for organizations in California and Chicago [Illinois].  I've done a couple in New York, a couple in Florida, oh, just all over.
Story_ID: 371312
Speaker 1: The year of the White House Fellow [President's Commission on White House Fellows] was what year?
Speaker 2: That was in '97 [1997] and '98 [1998] and then they invited me to come and visit them in, I think that was 2001.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what has happened for you since that time?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Or what have you worked on?
Speaker 2: The White House Fellows when they receive their appointments, they get an office space and sometimes the office space doesn't have artwork on it.  Sometimes the space isn't what you think the West Wing looks like, you know.  They have some really strange and interested spaces within the White House [Washington, D.C.], and sometimes the fellows are assigned to, and because they are away from home, they don't bring a lot of things with them, like artwork.  So, I thought it'd be a good idea to put together a White House art library so that when fellows receive their appointments, if needed, that they could pull from original work from artists all over the country, and will have sort of like a slide library and they select the work that they're interested in.  We contact the artist, the artist will send the piece.
Speaker 1: Wow.  That's good.  Okay.  Anything else?
Speaker 2: I'm getting ready to prepare for going to school again, and that's continuous, and I'm working on a degree, and, but that's about all.
Story_ID: 371313
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, what is the thing that stands out the most in your mind?
Speaker 2: What stands out the most is finding my true direction 'cause I really didn't have one.  I think sometimes you have to go around the block in order to come back to where you need to be.  And even though I started out in broadcasting and I did a lot of other interesting jobs, it brought me right back to where I needed to be, and all that information that I learned coming around that block brought me back to the place where I need to be.  It gave me direction and focus.  And that is working with nonprofit organizations.  You know if it had not been for the broadcasting experience, even being an artist, I would not have been able to come to that conclusion that that's the best place for me, so that was the best time for me, realizing my true direction and what I felt I'd be good at and what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
Speaker 1: Would you have changed anything?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would have stayed in school and continuously went to school.  That's about the only thing.  It would have been great to have had a family because I don't have any children.  I think that when women, we get involved in our careers, we become tunnel vision at what we do, which is really important, but sometimes we forget what the true important things are, and when it all boils down to it, when you're on your death bed, you're not going to be thinking about oh, did I finish that paper, or did I finish that art piece that I--? It's not going to be about that.  So that's probably one of the things that I, those two things, school and family, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 371314
Speaker 1: If you had to give advice to up and coming artists, what would you say?
Speaker 2: Find out what kind of artist you wanna be first.  It will cut down on all the road work.  Decide what kind of work that you do and decide where it's best for it to be.  A lot of artists do retail work and they're forcing it into fine arts.  A lot of artwork is fine arts and they're selling it retail.  Know your work, know the galleries that are out there where your work fits.  Understand what it is that you wanna do, not what everybody else is telling you to do, or what's in the market now, or what's selling now.  You have to sort of go for your true self, but at the same time, be flexible if that makes sense, but you have to be.  To work hard.  You're not an artist unless you produce.  You can't lay on a title and that's about all I got to say.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.

Speaker 1: Tell me, who are the artists that you respect the most?
Speaker 2: Oh, Jesus, that's a easy question.  I guess Thornton Dial, hearing his story.  His work is so incredible.  His work is folk, folk art, categorizes folk art, it's a primitive look to it.  But his work is some of the most dramatic, inspirational attempts at expressing yourself artistically I've ever seen.  I really love his work and I truly have gravitated toward it.  And it's very much unlike what I do (laughter).
Speaker 1: Anybody else?
Speaker 2: Yes, [HistoryMaker] Sam Gilliam.  I love Sam Gilliam's work.  His work is truly incredible.  I love his abstracts.  I certainly hope you all do interview him.  He is truly an incredible artist.
Story_ID: 371316
Speaker 1: Tell me, what are your concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, gosh, I have so many social concerns.  I have all kinds of political concerns and you know, I, because those things really affect what I do.  I paint what's around me.  I paint what I see and feel and experience.  And women's issues are really important to me.  Of course, I'm a woman so, of course, that's important to me.  I take it personally and it reflects in my work.  But I enjoy abstracts and sometimes when I'm doing the abstracts, even if, you know, the topic that I'm painting about is something social, is greatly influenced, the feelings are greatly influenced by what I hear on the news or what I read in the paper, who's running for what office and all that's really important.  But I draw inspiration from all of that, all of that really helps what I do.  It injects into everything that I do and I'd like to see our community take a more serious view about the arts.  They're taking 'em out of our schools.  It is truly the sign of a well-rounded education.  Everybody gets it and we're standing silently when music, art, you know, things are--dance is taken out of our school.  We don't say anything.  We don't get mad.  We don't picket.  We don't, we just silently let it happen, and when they graduate and go to college and they don't take those courses because why should, they're not in it, they don't understand it.  They don't know what it's about.  Why should it be important to me?  It's not important to my parents because they didn't say anything when it was taken out the schools, you know.  The school system doesn't think it's important.  It's not there, you know, but when you're competing for the fellowships program and one of the judges ask you about what was the last concert you went to?  You know, and, you know, and it's hip hop.  Nothing against hip hop.  I love hip hop, I really do, but you have to broaden your horizons.  That's what school is supposed to do for you.  It's supposed to give you a view of the world.  If you know nothing about symphony music, if you know nothing about the artist who paints pictures in the Louvre [Musee du Louvre, Paris, France], you know, at the city museum or in your community arts center, you know.  You don't know what's going on culturally within your area, then you're not completely knowledgeable about what's around you.  And it's a true sign of being knowledgeable, a true sign of caring about humanity, the humanities.  It's a true sign of that by just understanding what the arts are and what it, how it can improve your life, and our kids just don't get it.  We're not asking kids to become Picassos [Pablo Picasso], but learning the arts in the schools helps you to be creative, creative thinkers.  It helps you to think creatively.  Entrepreneurial spirit is enhanced by creative thinking.  That's all I'm a say about that.
Story_ID: 371317
Speaker 1: Is there anything else or anyone else you'd like to talk about, or anything else you'd like to say?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's another artist that I, I really--work I really enjoy.  That's Jean-Michel Basquiat.  I really loved his work and unfortunately he passed away and his work was very powerful. Everyone thought his work was powerful.  I think if he had lived a full life that he would be someone that you would be interviewing now.  There are a number of artists that I think were really important and I didn't mention.  I think that when people begin to collect artwork, they look to find out who's the most popular and whose work is selling for what so that's who I should buy because, but you need to start in your own local area when you're collecting artwork because every nationally known artist is a local artist from somewhere, and when you're buying artwork you need to start thinking about the galleries right there in your neighborhood, and I came up with a little formula.  If you don't know whose work to buy, go around to several galleries.  If you hear that name more than three or four times, then find out about that artist. See if the work is something that you enjoy, and then that might be something that you investigate.  I think it's one of the best ways to begin to collect artwork.  It's important to know what you like, but then you need to understand what it is that you like.  A lot of people say buy what you like, but you don't do that, you know put down five hundred dollars or five thousand dollars just because you like it.  You wanna make sure that it has value, that it'll appreciate.  Now sometimes you can buy just for aesthetic reasons, just because you like the piece and it looks good over your sofa.  Then you've made a decision.  I'll spend five hundred dollars just because I like the way it looks, understanding it does not have any appreciative value.  But, if you're putting down five hundred dollars, to most people that's a lot.  You could be buying a piece of a gallery and the framing is only worth five hundred dollars and the piece inside it only worth twenty-five.  So you need to understand what it is that you're purchasing.  And by doing that, start going around to your local galleries and investigating your local artists and then hoping that their careers, you know, grow and that's how your work appreciates.  But it's sort of like buying IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] stock.  You don't buy it now, you should have bought it years ago.  And it's the same thing with artists.  You invest in the artist early in their careers.  Find artists that are truly dedicated, artists who exhibit, you know, artists that truly show a dedication to their work and most likely, these are artists that are gonna grow in their career and their work will grow with them, and the value will follow.

Speaker 1: You talked about retail art and fine art versus original, can you speak to that?  I mean some people when they first start collecting art, they're taught, well buy a limited edition print versus then something that is not a limited edition, can--or an original versus a limited edition print piece.  What, can you talk about that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well you know, th- well, there are values in everything.  You can buy a valuable print, but there's different kinds of prints.  You can buy a print that's, you know, just a, like a photograph, reproduced.  It's called offset, you know, a reproduction, and you can do an offset reproduction and they can reproduce that piece as many times as they want.  It's the number of pieces and the quality of print.  Now the best print you can get, of course, is something that is etched, you know, the plate and it runs through, different, you know, done by an artist's hand and be done on stone, you know, different etchings and they're run by a printing press and the artist actually does the etching by hand.  That's probably one of the best ways, best qualities of print that you can buy.  And to go to the very low end is the offset lithograph.  But there are, there are others in between.  And it also depends on how many pieces are in that edition, so it's a question of getting some books and reading and understand, but it is not rocket science.  Anyone can do this.  I think people when it comes to the arts and limited editions, originals and remarks, all the different terms that are used, it's just a little bit of research and then getting people around who understand it too, not just gallery owners too, but you can read up on some books and some gallery owners can share some books that you can do a lot of this yourself, just like anything else.  But the numbers of the edition really does have a lot to do with the value of the print, and the lower the number traditionally, the more value the print has.  But that is not always true.  It depends on how it's printed.  It's just so many variables in there.  Originals will hold their value, you know, for the most part.  Now if your auntie does a original piece and you say, "I'm gonna hold on to it for thirty years," that may not be the way.  It may not appreciate like that.  You can call them nice little Sunday painting, or you have an artist who was really hot at one time and exhibited some work and then they kind of stopped working, well, the, you know, the probabilities are not all that great unless that person becomes famous someday.  Maybe even in some other field, but if you find an artist who starts a career, work very hard at it, their work grows.  They do one-woman, one-man shows.  They start exhibiting outside of their state.  They start bringing work into the various museums, then that's the one you want to go for, you want to start investing in.  That's the one that has longevity.  Once your work gets into a museum, that's like forever, depending on the museum too, but that's, that's really the way it goes.  It's not as complicated as I'm making it sound.  Anyone can do it.  You just have to find work that you're really interested in and learn about it.  It's really basically it.
Speaker 1: All right, well, if there's nothing else, we want to thank you so much for taking the time to do your interview.  Your story is so important for history, and we know that you're busy so we really do appreciate you taking the time to do this.
Speaker 2: And thank you for thinking of me.

Speaker 1: This piece is called 'Unity.'  It was the piece that was commissioned for the White House Fellows, and it really depicts the fellows that were in that particular class in '97 [1997].  And I wanted to do an inspirational kind of piece.  These people went through a very competitive situation in order to be appointed these positions at the White House [Washington, D.C.], so I wanted to depict them really reaching for the stars, which is what they're doing.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next.  This is how we go, just cycle them through one after the other.  And you'll see us orient them in odd ways because we're fitting them on the frame.  Later on they'll be cropped in.
Speaker 1: I should have said Georgia-Pacific produced that piece.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Actually, you're still on camera.
Speaker 1: Oh, well, Georgia-Pacific, they, Jim Bostic [James E. Bostic, Jr.] who's the senior vice president, of Georgia-Pacific was a White House Fellow and I asked him if he would lend his company's facilities to have this piece printed and they did that in-house, and I thought that was really wonderful.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Now let's talk about this one.  We're just focusing on the photograph at the bottom.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This was at the show at the state capitol [Georgia State Capitol, Atlanta, Georgia].  You can see some of the historical figures in the background of my picture that I'm exhibiting.  This was a show called 'The Ties that Bind' [Walter Bennett].  This is an exhibit of Georgia artists during the National Black Arts Festival, and the gentleman who is receiving a piece that I'm presenting, he's receiving it on behalf of Zell Miller, the governor of Georgia at the time.  This was in 1994.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Denise [Denise Gines], you know what you're doing?
Speaker 1: Shadows, shadows.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Oh, those of just photographs of me working.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: I'm in my studio, and I'm working on my pastels, and a lot of times I use a brush with my pastels.  I'll put the chalk down, the pastel material, down and then I'll take a brush, and it gives it a wonderful water color effect.  But the brush is dry but it just helps me to move the pastel around.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Oh, these were shot maybe about, that's when I was a lot younger.  I think I was about fifteen, about fifteen years ago when that was shot and I can't tell you what year.  It just looks, fifteen--maybe like--
Speaker 2: Ninety-one [1991]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '90 [1990], '91 [1991], something like that.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Oh, that was, oh, I see what's coming up.  That's deep.  So you can flip it?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah.  What's going on here?  Okay, go ahead and give me a description. (Unclear) upside down (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, that's, this is 1984, and it's in the morning and I'm doing the news.  It was a job that I truly did not like.  It was one of the worst parts of my job.  I really hate being on camera, and I was news and public affairs director.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  At what station?
Speaker 1: WXIA [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] at the time.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.  Turn it over.  All right, and your description of the bottom photo?
Speaker 1: Ah, that was WGNX [WGNX-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] and I'm doing my talk show called 'Atlanta Forum' and actually that's my director.  We're kind of fooling around on the set after a shoot and we had a studio audience when we did this show.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  About what time period?
Speaker 1: That was 1984.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next? Okay, and the bottom--
Speaker 1: Oh, that was my gallery.  It's the Brenda Singletary Art Gallery [Singletary Art Gallery, Stone Mountain, Georgia].  Are you shooting the top one?  Well I'm sitting in my art gallery and it was especially for the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia].  I opened it up in Stone Mountain [Georgia].  I got corporate support to open it up.  It was to exhibit my work and other artists so that when the work sold, that an artist who did exhibit would receive 100 percent of the proceeds.
Speaker 2: Do you want to talk about the gallery?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the gallery was just up for, just for the Olympics.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Horizontally then, please.
Speaker 1: And that's me standing out front of the gallery and you can't see it because I'm standing in front of it, but there's a sign with all the names of the corporations that made that gallery possible.  But it was open for about, I was personally in the gallery for about three to four months, and then a friend of mine who owned another gallery, came in and ran it for another year.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next. Want to do the lower one or the top one?
Speaker 1: Do the top one because I got to remember her name.  Marjorie, Marjorie Benton.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead and give me description for the top one with the blue banner in the background.
Speaker 1: Okay, that is me at the White House Fellows' reception, the reception where they receive their appointments and they just asked me to talk about the piece that I presented and the bottom picture.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Denise could you rotate one eighty so that (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm standing with Marjorie Benton and she is the chairperson for the President's Commission on White House Fellows in 1997.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next. Put it on the bottom.
Speaker 1: I don't know what year that was, 2000, that's right, 2000.
Speaker 2: And that was at the Mayor's Masked Ball in 2000 and I created a piece called 'Masked' [MASKED Award] and it was their feature piece that they'd be using for five years.  They use it to present to recipients of appreciation during the awards program, and they also used it to sell for benefit, to benefit UNCF [United Negro College Fund].

Speaker 1: That's an invitation to one of my burnings.  I usually use that that image of myself in a fireman's outfit, actually burning a piece of my work, and you see listed some of the sponsors that helped me throughout the year.  And this is my annual Christmas burning that I do at my house.  And we have very special guests.  I believe Amanda Davis from Channel 5 [WAGA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] who's our anchor, is our special guest that particular show.  And I think attorney general, [HistoryMaker] Thurbert Baker.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right. Next photo.
Speaker 1: Oh, God, y'all gonna do all of these?  That was, I think that was around time that the other picture was taken.  This was taken by a camera man and photographer, Al Ash [ph.], at Channel 11 [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] came by and he just wanted to take some photographs of me and my work. Give him a credit.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's a piece called 'Three Sisters' is one of the very few pieces that I published commercially.  There were 250 in the edition and recently we just did a second edition.  My gallery that carries my work, Regency Fine Arts in Norcross, Georgia.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): All right. Next, please.
Speaker 1: Oh God, do you have to? Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ, that's one, I'm trying to think is it high school [Charles F. Kettering Senior High School, Detroit, Michigan] or junior high school [Barbour Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan]?  It's just too young to be pretty.  I don't know what to say about it.  It's just one of my school pictures.  I believe I was in junior high school when this picture was taken.
Speaker 2: And that's Dereanzy Barry Hicks and that was my grandmother, and she passed away in 2003.  She was ninety-four years old when she passed away.  We miss her so much.
Speaker 1: And that's my mother and father on their fiftieth anniversary.  Can you believe it?  I only hope I look so good when I'm that age, but that's Mattie Singletary [Mattie Hicks Singletary] and James Singletary.  Hi mom, dad.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  What year was that? You think--
Speaker 1: That was 2001 I believe.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This was at the state capitol [Georgia State Capitol, Atlanta, Georgia] during the show that was there and Louis Delsarte who was a very prominent well-known international artist, was kind enough to exhibit in that show.  He also at the time taught at Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: This is an older picture.  At the time, that's Attorney General Thurbert Baker [HistoryMaker Thurbert Baker] to my left and Wyche Fowler to my right, and I don't know the gentleman next to him.  But Fowler was a senator and we were there having an event that Thurbert Baker had invited me and I had some of my work on exhibit there.
Speaker 1: Oh you don't have to show all those pictures.  You don't, really don't.
Speaker 2: You don't want this?
Speaker 1: Unh-uh.  I just put some things that you could pick through.  You could pick through them.  I didn't mean for you to 'em all.  You can just pick what you--okay, this was an art show cause we don't have any of my really art shows that I really--. This is an art show that I did in Houston, Texas, and at an art gallery where I really can't remember the name at the time.  But it was a wonderful show, but it just so happens one of the wives of the Houston Oilers [Tennessee Titans] was there, and she was having a party at her house the following night.  It was some kind of fight that was going on where all the football players were going to be there and she invited me to come exhibit my work and I met Warren Moon and he bought some artwork and a lot of the other players bought some artwork.  It was a fun night.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA WORK)
Speaker 1: Oh, that was just at the gallery, you just doing the same thing.  Remember that art gallery that I had?
