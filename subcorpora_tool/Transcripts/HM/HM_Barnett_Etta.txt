Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And if I need--do I need to talk a little louder so you can hear me?
Speaker 2: Yes, you do.
Speaker 1: Okay, good.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And [Susan] Sue [Ish] needs to be somewhere near so you can refer to her.
Speaker 1: Okay, she's right here. She's right here.
Speaker 2: What is the matter--I don't see why she can't--that's my oldest daughter, first child I ever had.

Speaker 1: Okay, I want--I'm gonna to ask a series of questions.  If you don't want to answer the question, that's fine.  Okay, but what I wanted you to describe was how it was growing up.
Speaker 2: Do what?
Speaker 1: How was it with you growing up?  How was growing up, you know?  You know, you were--how--well, let me ask you this.  How would you describe your mother [Ida Mae Norman Moten]?
Speaker 2: As a very lovely preacher's wife and a lovely mother who took very, very great interest in seeing that I was never alone.  So therefore, when she went to choir practice, I went along with her.  Once when she went, I was standing on the box that she had covered with cretonne [fabric] so that I could sit on it and enjoy and not be sorry that I had come there--had come to church.  One time, they heard me singing alto and they--my momma had me stand up on the box so that I could be the size of the grown people.  And I was a member of the choir all after.  As a matter of truth, growing up was very interesting for me because I liked people, I liked being made over as a little girl.  I think I must still have that feeling now because that's the reason life was very good for me as a--so I was not a spoiled preacher's kid.  I was a happy preacher's daughter, and the only child they had.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about your father [Rev. Freeman Franklin Moten].
Speaker 2: My father was the head of the household in a way.  In every way, really, because Papa decided the menus, because everybody cooked what Papa liked.  And he was also very, very friendly with the community people.  He was an evangelist type of preacher, and very well-trained as a theologian because he went to--and graduated with a sheepskin, literal sheepskin, which I could show you now because I have a--I have it, that very sheepskin that he graduated.  When they gave him--when he--they gave it to him when he received his college--what shall we call it?  Degree.  But they--I don't know that they called it degree then.  I guess they did--certificate--it was a college certificate of graduation.  So he was very popular among his--among the people of Texas, and that's where we were all--I was born, and Papa and his other kinfolks came up from Virginia, I understand, and settled in Texas.  But--and everybody there was assigned farms and a certain number of acres.  That was his situation.  And he traveled all over the United States with the head of the whole--head of the--with the bishop, the head of the national church. And Franklin was an international church because very early, the African Methodist Episcopal denomination had a diocese in Africa.  And the first one, I think, was in Liberia.  Yes, it was Liberia because Liberia was its own boss always.  What I mean is it wasn't under England.  It wasn't--,
Speaker 1: It was an independent country.
Speaker 2: --it was an independent country.  That's go- well said, Sue.
Story_ID: 2988
Speaker 1: I knew more about--yes, yes, we learned plenty about my grandfather.  And my background--my background comes through him and through his influence wherever he was.  And he was influential in Winchester [Texas], and they tell me he could not read or write himself.  But it was he through whom the teacher of the community--the schoolteacher of the community, was chosen.  And he married one of them after his own children were born.  They were--they were--she was--'Grandma Dilly,' we called her, was his second wife.  And she's the one that I was sitting on the porch listening to them as a little girl, listen to Grandma Moten--Grandma Dilly, read to him like my [daughter] Sue [Ish] reads to me now because of my eyesight.  She was reading to him, and I heard her say--heard Grandpa say, "Those rascals are going to get us into that war yet. They're going to get us into that war yet."  And I--I think it was the Spanish-American War [sic].  I don't know which one it was.  But which one would that have been with me nine years old?
Speaker 2: I think about--.
Speaker 1: 1910.
Speaker 2: Right. I think it was (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: Was what?
Speaker 2: 1910, it may have been the Spanish-American.
Speaker 1: Nineteen what?
Speaker 2: Ten.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Ten.
Speaker 2: You were--yeah, it might have been the Spanish-American War.
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: All of us are behind in that--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I would think before that if the grandfa-.  Okay, (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: No, remember I'm the--,
Speaker 2: Granddaughter.
Speaker 1: --granddaughter.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Listening to him talk about the--read about a war in which the United States is not in yet, see.  They're fighting someplace else.
Story_ID: 2989
Speaker 1: Was he born into slavery himself?
Speaker 2: What is it?
Speaker 1: Was he--was your grandfather born into slavery?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: As a boy?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He was a boy who came over with his white mother and half-brother (inaudible).
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right. Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause Mother remembers her grandfather, too.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Their Irish mother came with him and her Irish son, Grandpa, and her Irish son to Texas, they say, and stopped and--I don't remember the story.  [Daughter] Sue [Ish] knows it better than I do now.  But anyway, yes.  I remember him very pleasantly, too, and--.
Speaker 1: He had to have known how to read and write to carry on a 300-acre farm.  Our Grandpa Moten had to know how to read and write and there were--it wasn't uncommon for slaves back then to be taught to read and write.
Speaker 2: Did you understand her?
Speaker 1: Yes, I understood her.
Speaker 2: To carry on that farm like that, 300-acre farm--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So he had 300 acres.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  300 acres.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Moten then.
Speaker 1: Was he a wealthy man by standards?
Speaker 2: Was he what?
Speaker 1: Wealthy.  Was your--.
Speaker 2: Wealthy?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They were 'well-to-do,' quote, well-to-do.
Speaker 1: They sent all of the children to college.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What did he have, thirteen children or twelve?  Was two sets, one by first wife, one by second wife.  But he--and he--and he also decided what each son was going to do, one in ministry, one a lawyer, one a doctor.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: He can't--he had to have known how to read and write.
Speaker 2: Well, that's pretty (unclear).  You know, I may get you on Sue.  I think your mother's right.
Speaker 1: That's right.  She's the one who knows it.  She remembers--remembers everything now.  I--someone was here yesterday--.
Speaker 2: The grandmother earned the money from all of the geese and turkeys and chickens she raised--,
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --to send the kids to school, to college.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's right.  And she sent--helped the children go to college that way.
Speaker 2: Now, was that unusual in that time?  That--,
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --that people would--black people go on to college?
Speaker 1: Go on to college?
Speaker 2: Wasn't that unusual?
Speaker 1: No, not actually.  In certain groups, in that particular group of people, kind of.
Speaker 2: Education was very important.
Speaker 1: No.  That wasn't out of the way because if you didn't, you would come near to not--everybody would know you hadn't been to college or wasn't going to college, and you just 'didn't belong,' quote.
Story_ID: 2990
Speaker 1: Now, Mrs. Barnett, do you have a favorite childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Childhood memory?
Speaker 1: Yeah, a favorite one.
Speaker 2: Which one was it, [daughter] Sue [Ish], more or less?
Speaker 1: You always talk most about going back to your grandfather's farm [in Winchester, Texas].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When all the children would come home.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, I'll tell you, when we were looking at this house [in Chicago, Illinois]--which was a great, big, awful-looking, unkempt house with a little old lady who sat in the window in there and smoked a cigar and watched the people pass, and she would--I says, "[husband] Claude [Barnett], we ought to--I'd love to own that house.  We ought to buy that."  He said, "No, it's too big."  I said, "Well, some of the greatest times I ever had in my childhood were in my Grandma's house, and I want that for our grandchildren, that house."  And that's what this house is for.  And I have the life papers to show that this is--that's what this is going--this is.  This is for my grandchildren.  So one of those times in Grandpa's house, everybody who had graduated from college and so forth went to--you know, they went to different places.  Somebody went to Birmingham [Alabama] to practice medicine, and somebody came to Kansas City [Kansas] to get married and go to school--and that was one of the two girls. There's two girls and five--four boys.  Was it four boys, Sue?  Well, anyway, all--everybody came home from wherever they were at Christmas time.  And at New Year's time--when New Year's came, you began to get ready to--after New Year's Day--after you had your celebration in the way that you had it with food and a good time together--we hadn't seen each other in a whole year--Grandpa, after the dinner, when the--he said, "Now, I tell you, I've seen everybody now.  I'm glad you came, and I'll see you at another time.  But now, you can--since I've seen you, you can take your children and go on home."  That was one of the interesting things.  So I had some friends here the other day with some--with just two people, and we had talked over some things seriously, and we had talked over some things just reminiscing like we're doing now.  And then I mentioned this fact that this grandfather said, "Now that I've seen you, you can take your children and go on home," and they did. (laughs)
Speaker 1: So do you say that to your children now?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I said it the other day.
Speaker 2: It's time to go.
Speaker 1: It's time to go home.
Story_ID: 2991
Speaker 1: Now, Mrs. Barnett, when did you--when did you know that you had a talent for singing?
Speaker 2: When my grandma--when my mother [Ida Mae Norman Moten] put me up on top of the stool to sing alto, and from then on, I was a member of the choir. Then is when I knew. And then, I went shortly after that to Papa's [Freeman Franklin Moten] school, to Paul Quinn College [formerly in Waco, Texas], where they had what we would call "practice teaching" now, but they had grades.  I went there to school, went to Paul Quinn.  And then, when I got there, I was naturally in the choir.  Every place I--every place, every job, every--I was just known because people--.
Speaker 1: Did they teach you how to read music?
Speaker 2: Who--what's that?
Speaker 1: You said they taught you how to read music when you were in the choir.
Speaker 2: I can't understand.
Speaker 1: They taught you how to read music when you were in the choir.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: That's when you said you first learned to read music.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: It's where you first learned to read music.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) You need be near to me.
Speaker 1: Well, you don't--I didn't--I don't remember when I first learned to read music, except when I took music.  I began to take music, quote, study music.  I studied music then.  But singing--I sang 'Inflammatus' in Latin before I knew what I was saying, you now.  But that's the way a lot of people do--did, in those days.  As a matter of truth, a lot of people were in the 'Porgy and Bess' [opera] you probably saw could not read music.  But Eva Jessye, who as a great friend of mine and a great musical conductor, taught them by rote the [George] Gershwin music.  So that is not unusual for a person--a person who can sing if somebody knows how to train them by rote.
Story_ID: 2992
Speaker 1: So how was it being the only child?
Speaker 2: I loved it.  My Etta Sue [Ish], my granddaughter, said she was a little lonely as an only child, but I wasn't.  I enjoyed it.  I didn't need any sister to share my joy.
Speaker 1: Now, you were married very young, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you talk about that marriage?
Speaker 2: I'd rather not, except that it made--no, I'd rather not because there are things existing now that it might--,
Speaker 1: Affect?
Speaker 2: --it might affect.
Speaker 1: Okay, I understand.  Okay.  Now--.
Speaker 2: In fact, you don't need to say that you asked the question.
Speaker 1: Okay, don't worry.  Now, you sang with the [Robert] Jackson Jubilee Singers?
Speaker 2: Yes, and that was a fashion then.  They had group singers, the--and large groups, like you have had periodically in later years--in recent years.
Speaker 1: So what kinds of songs would the Jackson Jubilee Singers sing?
Speaker 2: They sang Classical.  They sang 'Blue Skies' was popular then.  What kind of song do you call that? (sings) "Blue skies smiling at me," that's the popular song of the day--songs of the day.  They sang--and they ended with, as I said--oh, there was a lecturer with us who taught us--who had come from Africa, and he taught us an African song, even.  And we sang all kinds of music of class, but it was categorized.
Story_ID: 2993
Speaker 1: Did you perform [with the Jackson Jubilee Singers] all around--around the South, or was it Texas?  Where did you--.
Speaker 2: No, all around the South, all--and mainly all of the black Negro colleges--all of the Negro colleges that were throughout the South because you had separate colleges in those days.  And so all of those colleges--all would have the [Robert] Jackson Jubilee Singers come, and whites' colleges would have the Jackson Jubilee Singers come.  And with the Jackson Jubilee Singers was this lecturer who was white, and from Africa.  And they learned something from both sides, the white colleges did. So it was one of those educational things.  In fact, you--and you knew what you were doing, and you were always taught what you were doing, but you weren't taught to dislike them for it.  You taught them because nobody had been able to--nobody had taught them before.  And they didn't know any better then.
Speaker 1: Now, after that--so you were performing--do you remember any of the songs at that time?  Do you remember the African song?
Speaker 2: Did I ever tell you about an African song, [daughter] Sue [Ish]?
Speaker 1: During the Jackson Jubilee Singers?  No.
Speaker 2: Well, now--
Speaker 1: (Sings) "Porque bebe tanto es sirapage shay gaja e dimaj."  Now, I don't know what that was, nor when that was.  "Porque bebe tanto es sirapage."  That's why--why--.
Speaker 2: That was from your radio program on (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: Well then, I had learned it from--I brought it from something out of my own repertoire. (Sings) "Porque bebe tanto es sirapage--."  Yes, I remember some of that African song, some of the African things in it.
Story_ID: 2994
Speaker 1: What was the view of Africa back then?  I mean--.
Speaker 2: What is that?
Speaker 1: What was the view?  You later went to Africa a lot.  But what was the view when you were growing up of Africa?
Speaker 2: The view that I was growing up in of Africa was more religious, towards religious on the one hand, and techni- not technically, but if you went to a movie, you always saw the African in, you know, with rings in his nose and you see that now, of course, but they did it themselves. Then, you would see in a position that you wouldn't enjoy, and you were sorry they saw it that way.  And when they finally went to Africa and were able to go to Liberia, able to go to that whole West Coast of Africa, where they came in from, they--the train that they'd come in from there.  Then, they found on that same coast lovely buildings and lovely people who had sent their children, not to United States especially, to college, but to Paris, to London, to other parts of Europe, you know.  So American-trained people--except those trained by the churches of America, had--had neglected bothering to tell the truth about Africa or to give a good impression of Africa.  They might have been true, but it was the wrong--only impression to leave of Africa.  Can you understand what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I think, because you said that it was just the wrong impression, a bad impression all--just bad.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, when there were positive things about it.
Story_ID: 2995
Speaker 1: Now, Mrs. Barnett, I want to talk about the University of Kansas?  You know, because you went there and stud--you majored in speech, in voice and speech.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right. So what was that experience like for you, going to school?
Speaker 2: It was a thing that you did avidly because you had married out of school.  You had married before you finished.  You married a teacher--a person who was a teacher, a member of the faculty [at Western University, Quindaro, Kansas], and who had left to go and receive riches in the state of Oklahoma, where they were giving out riches to his family--members of his family.  And they needed him [Barnett's first husband,  Curtis Brooks] because of his business ability.  He also was a graduate of Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and an African Methodist Episcopal college.  And so that was one of the things that happened, and that's the reason when we didn't make it, he couldn't stand the pressure of--the popularity that--all of that attention gave him with the wealth and so forth and so on.  Well, I took my babies and went back home to my mother [Ida Mae Norman Moten] and father [Rev. Freeman Franklin Moten].  And then I had a very good friend there, Mr. [Robert] Jackson Jubilee Singer's daughter--I mean his wife--was very much younger than he, she was nearer my age.  So she said, "Girl, since your mother and father are going to keep the children, come on and go up to K.U. [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas] where I'm going," because I got bored down here at Lawrence, I mean at Kansas City [Kansas], and at Western.  "So come on and go with me."  I said, "Oh, girl, I've been washing diapers for seven years now.  I can't--I wouldn't be able to make it in school."  She said, "Well, come on and don't register it, just observe, but register to observe."  And I did just that.  And before--or on the second semester, I--I let it be counted and joined the Alpha--was taken into AKA, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, and you have to make certain grades to be in there.  And that's how I got into the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas].  And I enjoyed it very, very much because they, too, were cognizant of my ability.
Story_ID: 2996
Speaker 1: Whenever you're ready.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She's directing the interview.
Speaker 2: Right, she's directing me.  You just right that down.  Okay.  So just talk about your--just a little bit and we'll move on.  But what--what was--at the University of Kansas, what were--you were in plays, you had your radio show.  Just talk about it a little bit.
Speaker 1: Well, there's not a lot to do--not a lot to talk about except I went home to Kansas City [Kansas] every weekend because my children were there, and because I was conducting a choir at a church there.  And that took me back home--well, the children really took me back home.  But the univ--so sometime when I would--I stayed at the home of--see, we didn't have dormitories at K.U. [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas].  We stayed at homes of people who kept students.  You pay rent to--room rent to ladies who kept students.  And so Miss Starks always knew that I would come back, and kept mine.  I had a room--there.  But sometime when I'd come back home to Chicago, I mean to Kansas City, and came so often, one of my kids would say, "Well, mother, you better quit coming here so often.  You will flunk all the way down that hill."  The school we called "Up on the hill," you see, because we did walk up a hill, or the streetcar would go up a hill.  It was a hilly--little hilly spot in Lawrence [Kansas].  And so everybody said, "She's up on the hill today," or "I walked up on the hill."  So the kids knew about the hill.  So she said, "Well, mother you better quit coming down here--home so much because you'll be flunking all the way down that hill."  So that's one of the things I remember about the cooperation that I got from everybody (with emphasis), you know.  Everybody was interested in my success at whatever it was--when I was--during my career, or during my lifetime--has been up as--to this morning, when my granddaughter came over here and read a passage to me that was--did me a lot of good when I came downstairs to see you, you know?  This is my life.  This is my--the way I'm cut out for living.  It's the way I'm cut out for living, to be helped and to be--because I'm--I don't know why.  I do know that I'm grateful for the assistance of everybody.  [Daughter] Sue [Ish] I could not do without.  I don't need to tell you that.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.
Story_ID: 2997
Speaker 1: Now, Mrs. Barnett, when you--so after Kansas City [Kansas], you got a teaching contract, right, at Lincoln University [Jefferson City, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: So talk about that, because that--okay--what was--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Lincoln University was a--was a school that had not--now, you talk about a school that wouldn't recognize you because--and there was no reason or rhyme except that they could give it--except that they just do not take in Negro people in that school.  It was a marvelous school for journalism.  We had a girl editor of the newspaper there, Lucille Bluford--and I don't mean there but in Kansas City, I mean--yes, in Kansas City.  It was the editor of that newspaper who wanted to go to Jefferson City [Missouri]--Lincoln University to get a degree.  Is it--that's not true?
Speaker 1: No, it's the University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri].  University of Missouri.  Lincoln University is a black college.
Speaker 2: Right, I thought so.  Lincoln--.
Speaker 1: The University of Missouri (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Your contract--what she's asking you about is the contract (inaudible).
Speaker 2: You had a teaching contract at Lincoln University.  I thought it was a black college.
Speaker 1: Lucille Bluford didn't have anything to do with that.
Speaker 2: Wait a minute now, you're right.  You're right, because I--I got it [the teaching contract].  Oh, yeah.  That's--that's the difference.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) in New York, right?  What happened?  You had a teaching contract, and then you--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's right.  And I had sent it back and told my father to resign for me because I was going to stay in New York.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  It was a black college.
Story_ID: 2998
Speaker 1: But--Let's talk about--let's talk about New York, then.  What was New York like back--I mean, what--when your--you've spent all your time in Texas and Kansas, and you go to New York.  What was New York like the first time you were there?
Speaker 2: You see, I can't--I can't tell you that changes excited me.
Speaker 1: You're going to have to ask her something specific.
Speaker 2: What's she saying?
Speaker 1: Okay.  She said--she said maybe I should ask specific questions.  But--did you--okay.  Does--let me ask you--you were in 'Fast and Furious,' [theatrical revue by Zora Neale Hurston] right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was--what was that experience?  That was your first play, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In New York.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was that whole experience like, the being in that play?
Speaker 2: Well, being in that play was the result of not having Actors' Equity [Association, a labor union for actors].  And that is, if we had had Actors' Equity, I would not have had to wait as long as I did--rehearsing, practicing, and waiting for the producer to find enough money to put the play on.  And that was--so finally, we got it on, and it stayed on one week (with emphasis) because it went on fast and came off furiously.  That's what we generally said about it.  So that was that.  But there was still a lesson to be learned there, and when I talk to students about my--when they ask me the question you asked me there about New York and how I did that, and so on, so on, so, I was able to tell them and make them laugh about going on furiously.  But I--when you come out to take your final bows, there was a man in the back of the theater--I understand that's where he was--who wanted to know who was that, "And I want to see her tomorrow."  And the next day, he (with emphasis) hired me.  This man hired me to go in a play where I needed to--I auditioned for him to get into the play by reading French, real French.  When I got the job, it was some of the broadest (with emphasis) French patois that you've ever heard of, and I hadn't heard of that kind of French patois.  But anyway, I did--got the job, and was with a cast of about five people.  One was a Mexican and the other was Pauline something or other, who was trying to make a comeback on the stage herself, actually.  And she was in a play that was taking her across the country to Hollywood.  And we played this--whatever play this was.  I forgot what the play was.  It's a French play.
Speaker 1: 'Zombie.'
Speaker 2: 'Zombie,' ah, yes.  Yes.  We played 'Zombie' all the way across the country, including here.  And I played a downtown theater that doesn't exist now.
Story_ID: 2999
Speaker 1: But Claude Barnett was--had been receiving my letters, and I'd been receiving his, and I went, as I told you, to New York with my handful of letters of introduction to people who did--were kind to me and--because of him.  And so we--when I got back here to be with him [in Chicago, Illinois], we--he was a 'Stage-Door Johnny' because he came to the theater to bring me home every--'cause I lived with a friend on Michigan Avenue at that particular time, the girl that [Edward] Ed knew so well, Sue [Ish].  And so then, well, we finally got to New York, I mean to Hollywood [California].  And there we--all because when we came back out on the--when we went on the stage, we did the best we could--had done the best we could, but we--and because we had done the best we could, this man in the back of the house was interested in hiring me because of the fact that I had done the best I could, and he liked it.
Speaker 2: Now, Mrs. Barnett, tell me what--what year are we talking about that, you know, you were in these plays?
Speaker 1: 1933 and '4 [1934].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And from then on.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I thought it was before then.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Wasn't it in the '20s [1920s]?
Speaker 1: 'Gold Diggers [of 1933]' was 1933--'Gold Diggers' was 1933.  That was before then.
Speaker 2: No, you were--it was probably in the '20s [1920s], right?  Mid-'20s [1920s]?
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.  You're right.  '33 [1933], '34 [1934].
Speaker 2: You graduated [from University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas] in '31 [1931], so it had to be '32 [1932], and you were in "Gold Diggers" in '33 [1933].
Speaker 1: I thought in 1931.  I have that they closed in 1931.  That's right.

Speaker 1: Now, did you know Zora Neale Hurston?  She was one of the writers [of the theatrical revue 'Fast and Furious'].  Can you--do you remember what it was like?  What was she like?  Do you remember her?
Speaker 2: Just exactly like she wrote--exactly (with emphasis)like she wrote.  She wrote while we were--that waiting period I was telling you about?  Because we didn't have [Actors'] Equity [Association], we were waiting people to get--I was sitting next to Zora in the empty theater at the--on that very occasion, and Zora had been secretary to some famous writer woman [Fannie Hurst].  And I forgot who--who was the woman's name, Sue [Ish], that very famous writer woman?  But anyway, Zora finally came to--oh, and when we went on to the--to the stage, you know, when we finally got to rehearsing--and waiting, but rehearsing--well, they would write--say, "We need to fill in a space here."  Zora would write that--write it in.  She would write--she was a writer that wrote spontaneously.  She was a spontaneous writer.  She was on that first group there next to the table--is her--is something that--they're keeping her memory going, although she died, and they lost her grave for a while.
Speaker 1: Now what about--did you ever meet Langston Hughes?
Speaker 2: Yes, I should say.
Speaker 1: What did--what was your impression?  How would you describe him?
Speaker 2: Langston Hughes was the best--Langston Hughes remind me--[William] Bill Warfield reminds me slightly of Langston Hughes because he's such a good pal.  He's a good friend.  He's--and knows more news and gossip, and he's just marvelous to have as a friend.  Langston Hughes was--I have this man, Price, what's his name?
Speaker 1: You know, Mrs. Barnett, I also wanted--who were some of the other people? There was Langston Hughes--.
Speaker 2: The Harlem Renaissance.  You know, the Harlem Renaissance.
Speaker 1: You know, there was--.
Speaker 2: Harry Belafonte?
Speaker 1: Not Harry Belafonte, but the other people in the Harlem Renaissance.  Who were some of the other people that you came in contact, I mean--.
Speaker 2: The Harlem Renaissance?  Let me see, that was some people in or out--in and out of the Harlem Renaissance.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was started by the professor from--Alain Locke from Washington [D.C.], Howard [University].  Well, I knew all of those--because I was getting to New York just about the time that they were at their height and almost ready to go off to different schools themselves and teach.  But this is--that was the beginning of that--of the Harlem Renaissance, was really--I knew those folks that you read about as that for the Harlem Renaissance.
Story_ID: 3001
Speaker 1: Now, what about did you ever come in contact with Marcus Garvey?
Speaker 2: Marcus Garvey?  Only to stand on the streets of Seventh Avenue in New York and watch him go by in an open automobile and when he was getting ready to fly back to Africa, and flew over the bridge and had to turn around and come back or whatever.  Yes.  That's how I saw him.  I never met him.  I didn't meet Marcus Garvey, but I met--.
Speaker 1: W.E.B [William Edward Burghardt] DuBois?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I knew him.  He was a friend.  'Cause he was a friend of Claude's [Barnett], too.  But the--the man who--after Marcus Garvey--a little after Marcus Garvey was another famous person who was a leader of people.  Sue [Ish].  See, guess Sue got tired.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you--did you, with--let's go back--let's go to--.
Speaker 2: Go quickly.  I'm getting tired.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're getting tired.  Okay, okay.  Let's talk about 'Porgy and Bess.'  I don't like talking about 'Porgy and Bess.'
Speaker 2: You don't like talking about 'Porgy and Bess?'
Speaker 1: I don't.
Speaker 2: Why?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  It's not a whole lot--.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well let's talk--okay, why don't you like talk--okay, okay.  Because you didn't like being in the show, or you didn't--?
Speaker 1: No, it's just I got--I think I got tired of being--.
Speaker 2: You got tired of talking about 'Porgy and Bess.'
Speaker 1: You think I want to talk about--.
Speaker 2: Well, you were in it three years, Mother (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well, that's too long to be in it.  I got tired of it.
Speaker 2: Well, just talk about your experiences, about while you were there.  You enjoyed part of the time when you were in there.
Speaker 1: Oh. well I--some of these experiences that I'm trying to think of--who was that--who was the man that--no, I just--I didn't enjoy 'Porgy and Bess.'
Speaker 2: She didn't like the audition.
Speaker 1: It cut up into too many different parts.  He--it was ruined with movies, different movies and too many people.  I just--I drew the curtain on 'Porgy and Bess.'
Speaker 2: Let me ask--I understand, but what about [George] Gershwin?  What were your views about Gershwin?
Speaker 1: Gershwin was--was a very fine young man.  And when he--when someone told him--oh, he was finding singers.  He was looking for sopranos that could look like the 'Bess' he wanted, and he thought I was that girl.  And so--I mean my agent thought he would think that.  So he got an appointment for me to audition for him.  So he's moved over of the piano bench and had me to sit, and he read the--it to me.  And we sang it.  And I said, "Oh, no.  This goes too high above the--above the line.  That's much too high for me.  I don't sing above A or A-flat.  And that's too many times."  And, well, it happened that he--I did not do that.  I went on to South America, didn't I, Sue, or what'd I do?
Story_ID: 3002
Speaker 1: You went--I don't know about South America, but let me ask you this.  You were originally going to have a Town Hall [New York] debut.  Do you ever regret not doing--,
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --a concert at Town Hall?
Speaker 2: I don't have many regrets because even before I met my granddaughter who teaches me that everything happens for a reason--even before that--I didn't have many regrets of anything, because whenever I didn't do one thing, I did another.  And I was going to do my own--I was going to do my own presentation because I didn't have any criticism from New York critics.  And I wanted them--I wanted to see if they thought I could sing, but I didn't do that.  Something else happened.  I don't know what happened, but I didn't.
Speaker 1: Right.  It was 'Porgy and Bess' that came along.
Speaker 2: Is that so?
Speaker 1: That's what happened.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, well.
Speaker 1: Mrs. Barnett, can I--I know you're--can you--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, well, that seems like something that could--it was a matter of money with me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was a matter of money that--with me.  From almost--from the time I brought my children home [to be raised by her parents in Kansas City, Kansas], it was a matter of money.  It was almost sad.  And that was a matter of importance to me, and a home--paid-out home for my parents, and all that kind of stuff.  I had a place for dollars to go.  And that's--that was my life.
Story_ID: 3003
Speaker 1: Mrs. Barnett, what about your life with Claude--Claude Barnett?  What--what was that whole experience like?  What was (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That was like a--let me see--'34 [1934] 'til--when did he die--'67 [1967].  How many years is that?  That's 34--33 years.  It was like a thirty-three year love affair with Claude Barnett.  A love affair--a legal (with emphasis) love affair.  It was--we had a wonderful (with emphasis) marriage, wonderful marriage, and so much so that it's (pause) indescribable.  Because you see, he was too busy to bore me, and I was too busy to bore him.  And each of our--and he--and I was a part of his business in a way because he could go from the Associated Negro Press--ANP--to the guy that was Marion Anderson's agent--manager, 'cause he would book me whenever I wanted--and wanted him to.
Speaker 1: That's what I read, that he was your--he actually took over being your agent.
Speaker 2: Well, he--,
Speaker 1: A little bit.
Speaker 2: --he did.  He did.  He did.
Speaker 1: But let me--why would--what impact do you think that he and Associated Negro Press had on the black community?
Speaker 2: On the black what?
Speaker 1: On the black community.  Why was it so important what Claude Barnett did with the Associated Negro Press?
Speaker 2: Because he had that type of reputation with people.  He was a--was honest.  He was influential with Republican and Democrat [political parties].  He was non-political, actually, so that people knew it, but he was a very marvelous person to see what's was what, and what was coming up.  And so therefore he--he was well thought of.  I think very much what this Bladley--Bradley is going to be, that we have now.  He reminds me sort of--of--.
Speaker 1: Of--of Claude Barnett.  Okay.
Story_ID: 3004
Speaker 1: ...Together with John [H.] Johnson and his wife [Eunice W. Johnson] and [President Richard Milhous] Nixon.  We went on a tour some place.  I'm trying to say when we enjoyed each oth- enjoyed ourselves as a married couple.
Speaker 2: I was saying, some of your memories of Claude Barnett and the traveling, like to Africa.  You know, could she share one of her favorite memories.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  They--you were going long before that (unclear).
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: (Unclear) independence of the countries.
Speaker 2: Right.  [Kwame] Nkrumah.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Ghana.
Speaker 2: Right.  Ghana and Nkrumah, wasn't that--.
Speaker 1: What were you saying?
Speaker 2: When you went to each country's independence celebration.  Dad was invited to each independence celebration.
Speaker 1: Yes, but I was thinking of that first one when we went--were getting ready to go to--,
Speaker 2: To Africa?
Speaker 1: --to Africa, and--,
Speaker 2: President Nixon.  President Nixon (unclear)--,
Speaker 1: --and with Nixon, yeah.
Speaker 2: --Black Press [Associated Negro Press], and (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: John Johnson.
Speaker 2: And (unclear) called the Black Press to accompany him on these trips to the African countries.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: To accompany him on the plane to the African countries.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's what you (unclear).
Speaker 1: Just, that's the two couples.  Himself--,
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  It was a whole bunch of you.
Speaker 1: --I mean--,
Speaker 2: Oh, you mean--.
Speaker 1: We two couples were together.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: With other--with the whole press from the--almost from the world.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) --plane.  But I'm thinking of Claude and me, Eunice and John Johnson.
Speaker 1: So talk about that trip that you made.
Speaker 2: Well, it was--we--.
Speaker 1: Mrs. Barnett--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: --sit back up (unclear).
Speaker 2: Got too familiar.  Got too comfortable--too comfortable. (laughs)
Speaker 1: Hanging out.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: We--that I remember--that I remember--that I remember.  It was interesting in that we--I think we--I get those two kind of things mixed up.  I don't know what--'cause I remember going down through the desert to one of the cities and then meeting them again.  But I don't quite remember that.
Story_ID: 3005
Speaker 1: Okay, well, Mrs. Barnett, let me--I'm going to ask a few more questions.
Speaker 2: How many more?
Speaker 1: Just about five.
Speaker 2: Ooh.
Speaker 1: Okay, but they're not long.  They're just thoughts.  They're not--.
Speaker 2: But you've got answer to them, haven't you?
Speaker 1: No, you have the answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I was wondering--
Speaker 1: It's all on TV.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: No good to have her answer.
Speaker 2: I was wondering where you got the questions--where you got the questions.
Speaker 1: Reading your bios [biographies].
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Reading your bios.
Speaker 2: Well, the bio [biography] means it's written down someplace.
Speaker 1: I know, but this is philosophical question.  I had answers before, but I don't have answers for this.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I would like to ask you, what--in your life, you have seen and experienced a lot of things, and a lot of your life has been involved in the arts.
Speaker 2: In what?
Speaker 1: In the arts.
Speaker 2: In the arts, yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And I want you to talk about what you feel, why arts--why the arts are so important.
Speaker 2: To whom?
Speaker 1: To people, I mean to society.  Just society.  Why is music or the arts--why are they so important to society?
Speaker 2: Because (pause).  The arts are important to society--because the arts includes the spiritual.  It includes the spiritual side, and that is the inner person, as far as I'm concerned.  And I think that--that, going way back to the Garden of Eden, almost, was the beginning of--of--the beginning of man kind--mankind.  And the arts shapes that spiritualness, which is found inside.
Story_ID: 3006
Speaker 1: Now, I have another question for you, okay, my second one.  What are your views about the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: It's interesting to sit back and watch them (with emphasis).  There are so many movements.  There are so many versions of movement and--how Civil Rights--what is Civil Rights.  And it's so changeable.  It's so--my version--my--what it means to me, it gives me something to look at now and compare with then, then (with emphasis).  Then and now.  Now, then is when man was humanized, and I don't think--we're getting unhuman now.  And I'm getting to--not fear, but be concerned about that.
Speaker 1: Well then let me ask this question.  What do you feel you have--you've had the vantage point--,
Speaker 2: Yeah
Speaker 1: --of seeing--for living a long time--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and seeing our race over a long period of time.
Speaker 2: Seen what?
Speaker 1: Our race, the black race.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, Negro.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The black race over a long period of time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What are your views?  Do you think that we--what do you see as our future, or what are your hopes for the future of the black race?
Speaker 2: My hope is ever there for the best for the black race, as you know.  But my--my--the way I see the race now, I wish all of the young people coming on were taught how it is now, were taught about it--taught about the individuals who are making it and who have made it in spite of what they think it is, and in spite of what somebody tells them that it is.  I hope--I wish they could tell--could know the reality of the advancement--the great advancement of this--the people.  I really wish they could.  I wish all of them could see it and feel it like we in this room do.  All of us in this room do, or we wouldn't be there.
Speaker 1: What--what we have talked about and she's not mentioning is--.
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: What we have talked about and you're not mentioning is the wonderful opportunities that you've seen take place for minorities that came out of the Civil Rights Movement.  Now, that's a more positive (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  That's good.
Speaker 1: You have a right to be concerned, but you're not mentioning the great progress that has been made--,
Speaker 2: That is true.
Speaker 1: --the opportunities that are here now that were not there years earlier.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Now, true enough, there is a concern about the dichotomy between the haves and have-nots.  That's your concern.  But there's also a positive side--great opportunities that minorities have now that they never had before.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They've made great strides.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, then, somebody should tell them about those opportunities.
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)  They are.  They know it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, let me ask you this.
Speaker 1: There are plenty of people who do not know about those opportunities, sure enough.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but first give the positive side.
Speaker 1: Okay, but that's--.
Speaker 2: That's what [granddaughter] Etta Sue [Ish] is always talking to you about--(unclear).
Story_ID: 3007
Speaker 1: Why do you think--knowledge of black history--,
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Why do you think--why do you think it's very important that black people have knowledge of their own history?
Speaker 2: Well, because it gives them more confidence in meeting challenges, I think.  It might give them more confidence, and it ought to--give them more confidence in meeting challenges.
Speaker 1: I have two more questions, and the one question is going back--it's not a philosophical question, but Chicago [Illinois] has been your home for, you know, many years now.  Why had--why have you liked this city, and--,
Speaker 2: Why have I what?
Speaker 1: Why have you liked living here in Chicago, and what do you think--,
Speaker 2: 'Cause Claude [Barnett] was here, Baby.
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: Damn.  You didn't have to ask me that. (laughs)
Speaker 1: So a woman following her man.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Lord, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Then I'm going to ask you this question again.  What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, since--what I hope your--well, the whole legacy would be that you did the best you could with what you had left.  That's what I say.  That's what I say all the time.  Do the best I can with what I got left.  That's after she got--she was 97, 98 [years old].
Story_ID: 3008

Speaker 2: No 'Porgy.'
Speaker 1: No 'Porgy and Bess.'  No nursery rhyme?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't know any--I don't remember nursery rhymes.
Speaker 1: No Eva Jessye song--one of the songs that came out of there?  Nothing from 'Zombie?'  Nothing from--what about--.
Speaker 2: No song.  No, no, no.  No song.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If we want to find something and play it, there's a lot of good voice stuff--you know, when I'm in good voice.
Speaker 1: Right, when your voice was (unclear).
Speaker 2: You can do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You have my permission to do that, and find the--find the best voice you can find that I got, 'cause there's a number of them that aren't so hardly--even then.

Speaker 1: What I want you to do is start out by just saying your name and spelling it for us.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Sue Ish.  S-U-E I-S-H.
Speaker 1: Now, I want you to talk--just tell us--I want you to talk about your mother and your--and your memory of her growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, I remember particularly, and in later years was very much impressed with how mother [Etta Moten Barnett] managed to stay close to us despite having a career.  And from the time that I can remember when she was in school--in college [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas]--in 1931 when she finished--'29 [1929] when she went, I was about eight or nine years-old--she wrote letters every week or every other day.  And I had a great collection of her letters where she was offering advice or telling us about her experiences, or answering some of our concerns or experiences that we had had and wanted to share with her.  It--you just never felt that your mother was away from you because she stayed in such close contact.
Story_ID: 3029
Speaker 1: Now, were you raised by your grandparents?  Was that--.
Speaker 2: We stayed with my grandparents [Ida Mae Norman Moten and Rev. Freeman Franklin Moten] until 1935.  And when she [Etta Moten Barnett] married Claude Barnett--Dad, we came to Chicago [Illinois].  Then, we were all together.  My youngest sister, Etta Vee [Brooks-Traylor], finished high school here at Hyde Park High School [Chicago, Illinois].  I was first year of college in 1936.  She just always made us feel like we were first in her life, and so you never felt abandoned at all despite her career.
Speaker 1: Now, when did you realize that your mother had a talent that was special?  A lot of times, you know, kids don't--
Speaker 2: I think the first time that it became an impact was when she was in that first movie, 'Gold Diggers of 1933,' and there were photographers who came to the house in Kansas City [Kansas] and sent a car for us to go to the movie, even though it was in the balcony, where you had to sit in those days.  And it was written up prominently in the newspaper.  That was when we realized that she must be famous.  And we were very proud, of course.
Speaker 1: What about her parents, you know, your grandparents.  How did they view her, this, their only daughter?
Speaker 2: Oh, they were extremely proud of her.  When Grandfather was interviewed, he hadn't--he didn't go to movies, of course.  And someone mentioned that fact that he was going to a movie, and he said, "Well, that's my daughter, and that's a nice movie she's in.  I'm very proud of her."
Story_ID: 3030
Speaker 1: Are you--do you know any stories around 'Porgy and Bess?'
Speaker 2: Do I do what?
Speaker 1: Any stories that she [Etta Moten Barnett] shared with you around 'Porgy and Bess' and that whole production, or how hard it was or easy, you know, on the road, or--.
Speaker 2: Well, there was a time--well I remember coming to see her in 'Porgy and Bess' with my husband [Stanley Ish] right after we had married.  He was in medical school when we married.  And we went to see her in Washington [D.C.], and we saw her here [Chicago, Illinois] after we were married, in 'Porgy and Bess.'  I can recall her being--telling us how upset she was when it played in--I think it was Salt Lake City [Utah] because it involved the Mormon area.  And they were not--she was not--as the star, she was not able to stay.  She had to stay in--in a home--they told her that she had to go to a home, she couldn't stay in the hotel.  And there her maid, who was white, stayed in the--it just seemed so unjus-, you know, it was just really a demonstration of how unjust it was.  And she couldn't appear--and she said she--that that upset her so much that she--her stand-in had--and that was I think the only time her stand-in had to go in for her.  That I remembered, you know, because it was such an upsetting thing for her.
Story_ID: 3031
Speaker 1: I want to go back to her grandfather [Rev. Freeman Franklin Moten] and grandmother [Ida Mae Norman Moten] and just for some of the family history--you know, the things that you have learned about.  What was--you know, who was her grandfather?  Who was her grandmother?  And, you know, how did people end up coming to live in Texas?  And that would have been your great-grandfather.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.  I just regret that I didn't talk more with Grandfather about his boyhood.  I guess until the 'Roots' came out, you just weren't too interested in going far back to--and some of the things I just happened to hear him mention.  And Mother [Etta Moten Barnett]--I got most of it from her--the fact that my great-grandfather moved from Virginia to Texas with his white mother and his half-white brother--she came with him.  Mother can remember seeing her when she would go to visit my great-grandfather.  And she always sat very primly in a--she said in a black silk dress, it seemed like to her--she was a little girl--and was sort of quiet and withdrawn.  She must have been pretty old then, 'cause that was Mother's great-grandmother--she was a child at that time.  I never heard Grandfather say much about his father or his mother, but I can remember when he died myself.  He--I think it was he had--there was something concerning his prostate, I remember that.  I'm assuming it may have been cancer.  I don't know, but he died on the operating table, which is unusual now but not then.  And my grandfather and grandmother went to the funeral.  And I don't remember--I also remember the good times that Mother had as a child visiting them on the farm, when she and Grandmother and Grandfather went back to Texas every year when she was small.  But I never knew them, personally.
Story_ID: 3032
Speaker 1: Now, what was--what was her mother [Ida Mae Norman Moten] and father [Rev. Freeman Franklin Moten] (unclear)--what were they like?  How would you describe them?
Speaker 2: Oh just--we were very close to them.  We naturally went to Sunday school--church every Sunday.  Grandmother was much younger than Grandfather.  As a matter of fact, he sent her to college after they got married.  And during that period, mother stayed with her--Grandmother's mother.  And then--she was the younger sister--she had one sister.  There were two sis-, two Norman sisters, and each sister had one daughter.  And Grandmother always seemed more like Grandfather's daughter than his wife.  In fact, she called him 'Papa,' but that was supposed to have been when Mother [Etta Moten Barnett] was born--you know, and she said, "Papa."  Well, she just continued to call him 'Papa.'  And Grandfather was very protective of her.  She had lived a very sheltered life.  And when we got older, we thought of her as a Victorian lady (laughs), 'cause she was always very, very prim and proper and never said a bad word.  Or if she did, she would say, "Well, as Papa says--as Papa says, I don't give a damn."  And she would put in on--she would quote someone before she--before she would say a bad word.  And we enjoyed her little funny jokes.  We had had--it felt--all of us--it was a very closely-knit family--very closely-knit family.  But we--I remember also, that we spent so much time in church that after I finished college and got married, I didn't go to church for a long time (laughs), and that bothered my grandfather.  And I remember that I wanted to switch to the Presbyterian church because I liked their government.  Instead of a hierarchal-type government, as in the Methodist and Catholic churches, it was Democratic and that appealed to me.  And I talked it over with my mother--well, the way I changed was mother wrote--she wrote many, many letters.  She was a prolific writer--letter-writer.  And she said at one point, "Well, if you won't join--," no, she said, "You should join church if for no other reason than not to bring my grandchild up as a heathen." And that really got me because prior to that time, wherever my husband and I went for his internship--for his residency, Grandfather--in that city--would contact the minister to call me and invite me to come to church.  So--but Mother's letter really affected me, and I did join.  When I wanted to join the Presbyterian church, she--I said, "I wonder if Grandfather would--what would Grandfather say?"  And she said, "I don't think he would mind, but why don't you tell him?"  So I called him, and told--he was so happy.  He said, "There's more than one path to heaven.  Go right ahead.  I'm very happy about it."  And the interesting thing is that I not only became very interested again in the church, but I later became an elder--well, a deacon first, and then an elder, and a clerk of the session.  And--oh, at Second Presbyterian Church here, I--for twelve years was editor of the newsletter.  I enjoyed it very much.

Speaker 1: Now, your--your mother [Etta Moten Barnett].  What role do you think--I mean, if I asked you to describe her voice or how hearing it, you know, makes you feel, would you have any thoughts about that, or could you describe it or her--could I ask you to describe her talent and, you know (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Mother had--it was a contralto voice.  And I think for that reason--having heard her sing so much--that was the voice that always appealed to me, the contralto--the lower voice.  It sounded rich to me.  I later began to appreciate sopranos as I got older.  But mother had--now she says--I thought she had a great voice, but Mother always insisted that she did not have a great voice, but she knew how to handle her voice.  I never completely understood what she meant by that because I--and she and Marion Anderson were very good friends, and she said, "Marion Anderson has a great voice.  I have a good voice, and I know how to handle it."  She--in her career has always had things drop in her lap.  She never had to--luckily, she never had to go without some sort of work or challenge to keep her occupied.  Just one thing would seem to lead to another as she--as one example that she gave a little earlier.  So she was very fortunate in that respect.  I--as I said--I just always thought she--I thought my mother was a great singer.  But that was the way she--,
Speaker 1: Do you think--you've had--well, what--talk a little bit about her life with Claude Barnett, your--you know, your father.  Can you talk about (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Oh that, yes.  And 'Dad,' as we called him, was really the only father we really knew.  We would see my father [Curtis Brooks] every now and then.  It was like Santa Claus with him.  At various holidays, he'd send you a big--he had beautiful taste in clothes--in fact, he taught Mother how to dress.  He sent clothes and would breeze in--and he was handsome, and we just treated him as a visiting celebrity--and then he'd breeze out.  And he married about four or five times--we met some of the wives, and some we didn't.  But Dad was a real father, and having been a bachelor for so long--because he was about eight years older than Mother and hadn't married before--was always the eligible bachelor around town--but the country, really--but had never married.  And he was just--just seemed so thrilled to have children.  And he was just like our father.  He--when I--we were away in school, he wrote with advice, kept up with us all the time, and if we had a need for anything, he was right there to take care of it.  He sent, you know, our allowances--took care of things like that for Mother.  And I remember when my husband [Stanley Ish] was in the Korean War, and he had told me that he would be arriving in San Francisco [California].  And they switched--and the boat was coming to Seattle [Washington].  And he said, "Well, I won't worry about it because I know Dad will figure that out."  And sure enough, Dad found out that the boat was switching--well, he used to be on the Red Cross board, too.  And I think it was through Red Cross that he found out that the boat was going to Seattle, or I would have missed him.  And I went out there to meet him.  But he has just--has just done so many wonderful things for us.  We all loved him very much.  And their marriage was wonderful.  Mother always said that it was just almost a perfect marriage because they never became bored with each other.  With his career as a Director of Associated Negro Press, he traveled quite a bit--so did Mother and they would just meet.  And when they met, she said it was just like a honeymoon all over again.  So there was that constant kind of--and you felt it, that they were very much in love with each other up until the time he became disabled and passed.
Story_ID: 3034
Speaker 1: What role do you see your mother [Etta Moten Barnett] having played, like in that--you know, in the arts world or, you know, the entertainment world, or--what role?
Speaker 2: I think Moth- the thing that made Mother unique in her career was she had such a diverse talent.  She could not only act, sing--but she was a lecturer and well read--and charisma on the stage speaking, even extemporaneously--I think she was even better extemporaneously.  And so with her, she has affected a lot of people--young people throughout the country with her lectures and singing.  But the--I have run into friends, my acquaintances--my age and younger, who have told me how they have been influenced by something my mother said.  And she gets that, too--that kind of feedback.  It's the same sort of feeling I imagine that teachers get when they have--even to a greater extent on the part of teachers, of course, because they have greater contact with the people.  And you go through our doctors who deliver babies, you know.  That I think, makes her unique among artists who sing, act, lecture.  And then, the various careers that she's enjoyed--radio, concerts, film, stage.  And then the boards that she affiliated with here in Chicago [Illinois] after she retired--charter member of National Conference of Negroes and Jews [sic, National Conference of Christians and Jews]; WTTW [public television station, Chicago, Illinois] Board; Michael Reese Hospital Board [Chicago, Illinois]--that one was rather amusing; at the Field Museum [of Natural History, Chicago, Illinois], founding member of the Women's Board of Field Museum; Lyric Opera [of Chicago]; it's--[Jane Addams] Hull House; [Chicago] Urban League; United Negro College Fund.  And it--she has made an impression, you know, there--not just your name there on the board, she actually contributed.  But I was amused with--when I mentioned Michael Reese Hospital Board because when she was invited to become a member--oh, I've forgotten his name.  You would know it if I called--he was a member of the board and a very good friend of Mother's.  And three years later, when they learned her age, she had to get off the board.  They were stunned.  They had no idea she was as old as she was.  I think it was sixty-five you're supposed to get off.  We got a good chuckle out of that.  She enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 3035
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of--you know, what performance or, you know, experience does she [Etta Moten Barnett] talk about that really meant a lot to her?  I mean first, I want to talk about it in terms of her performance, and then I want to talk about maybe her trips to Africa.
Speaker 2: What about her performance?
Speaker 1: Was there any one that was more memorable to her than, you know, others?  Was it the 'Gold Dig- [Diggers of 1933]?'  You know, was it--anything that she talked about very fondly.  Like, you know--'Porgy and Bess,' she's like, tired of.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) No, I don't--I don't.
Speaker 1: Any place in the world that she liked better than, you know, any other place, or--?
Speaker 2: Well, so far as that is concerned, she--she enjoyed each experience because it was different.  But I never heard--I never got the impression that she enjoyed one more than the other.  It was just enthusiasm for each one.
Speaker 1: Do you remember her talking about her trips to Africa or [Kwame] Nkrumah?  You know, do you remember (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  They--Mother and Dad [Claude Barnett] became very friendly with Nkrumah, and of course, he had had part of his education here in the United States.  They were godparents to one of his children.  And he--he had this dream of sort of Pan-Africa, you know--all of the countries getting together as they got their independence.  And of course, that didn't pan out.  But as the first country--Ghana--to receive its independence, there was this great, great hope for its future, and especially with such an able person head of the country.  But they've had some problems, of course, since then.
Story_ID: 3036
Speaker 1: I just have a question about the Associated Negro Press.  What has been it's--was there success with Claude [Barnett]--or did, when your father died, did it just--?
Speaker 2: Well you know the thing that--I feel what happened then--it started in 1919--he started it in 1919, when he got this idea that all of the Negro newspapers all over the country--each had its own news, mainly local.  And he felt that there should be a distribution agency like the Associated Press--and have it the Associated Negro Press--to bring national news.  And you share the news--the same principle as the Associated Press, and he did that with Associated Negro Press with great success.  At one time, I think at its peak, there were over 100 black newspapers that belonged to the Associated Negro Press.  I think when he passed--now this is in retrospect--I regretted it first that there wasn't someone just to take his place, you know, an assistant to take his place, because it was mainly a one-man operation.  He had staff, but it was based on his contacts and prestige.  But I really feel that that would not have made a difference as I think about it later, because at that time that Dad died, black newspapers were becoming irrelevant.  And I could see it clearly in the years after he died, because they are just about--there's no need for them.  Everything is in the daily papers, the white press.  And the staff--they have the best reporters.  They can pay them, and why not?  I mean, this is what--you do this hoping that you will not be needed, and that's what's happened.  And I think it's wonderful because there--when you look at the gifted black reporters with 'Time' magazine, 'Life' magazine when they had it.  There's Gordon Parks.  There's that wonderful photographer Jack White with 'Time' magazine, and many, many others--'Fortune,' [magazine] all of them.  They have--they have syndicated columnists--the 'Washington Post,' [newspaper] and there's just really no need for black press now.  Now, Johnny--Johnson's--Johnson Publications [sic, Publishing Company] fills another niche that is still relevant.  But newspapers I--I really don't think are needed.
Story_ID: 3037
Speaker 1: Oh, I think--I think you're looking at it while she's [Etta Moten Barnett] living, really.  The lives that she has touched amaze me.  She--she just has so much charisma and has affected so many people, more than she realizes.  They just--everybody just loves Etta Moten, and I think that that will--and fortunately, she can see a lot of it now.  My daughter [Etta Sue Ish] was just talking about yesterday when she took her down to the Mayor's [Richard M. Daley] office, where they recognized and wanted to thank the members of the what they call the 'Bronzeville Blue Ribbon Committee.'  She ran into someone there and--who was--she was telling him about the--oh, he mentioned that he had last seen her at her ninety--ninety-fifth birthday celebration that The Links [African American women's organization] had in her honor.  And she said, "We're thinking about hav-...
